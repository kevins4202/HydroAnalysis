18365,the use of irrigation water sourced from reclamation facilities and untreated surface water bodies may be a practical solution to attenuate the burden on diminishing groundwater aquifers however comprehensive microbial characterizations of these water sources are generally lacking especially with regard to variations through time and across multiple water types to address this knowledge gap we used a shotgun metagenomic approach to characterize the taxonomic and functional variations of microbial communities within two agricultural ponds two freshwater creeks two brackish rivers and three water reclamation facilities located in the mid atlantic united states water samples n 24 were collected from all sites between october and november 2016 and filtered onto 0 2 μm membrane filters filters were then subjected to total dna extraction and shotgun sequencing on the illumina hiseq platform from these data we found that betaproteobacteria dominated the majority of freshwater sites while alphaproteobacteria were abundant at times in the brackish waters one of these brackish sites was also host to a greater abundance of the bacterial genera gimesia and microcystis furthermore predicted microbial features e g antibiotic resistance genes args and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr arrays varied based on specific site and sampling date args were found across samples with the diversity and abundance highest in those from a reclamation facility and a wastewater impacted freshwater creek additionally we identified over 600 crispr arrays containing 2600 unique spacers suggestive of a diverse and often site specific phage community overall these results provide a better understanding of the complex microbial community in untreated surface and reclaimed waters while highlighting possible environmental and human health impacts associated with their use in agriculture graphical abstract image 1 keywords metagenome

comprehensive antibiotic resistance database go gene ontology arg antibiotic resistance gene orf open reading frame 1 introduction steady declines in groundwater supplies coupled with the estimation that by 2050 water withdrawals for irrigation will increase by 10 has strengthened the demand for alternative sources of water for agricultural applications bruinsma 2009 the use of reclaimed advanced treated municipal wastewater and untreated surface waters e g brackish rivers freshwater creeks and ponds may provide effective solutions to reduce pressures on groundwater sources however to date there are very few studies that have comprehensively evaluated the taxonomy and functional potential of microbial communities in alternative water sources moreover there has been limited research that has compared these microbial features across different sources filling these knowledge gaps would identify the alternative water sources with the highest and lowest degrees of putative risk with regard to both produce safety and public health this information is critical for informing the development of water reuse regulations currently reclaimed water is used as an alternative source of non potable water especially in arid and semi arid regions around the world sato et al 2013 dieter et al 2018 however because it is the end result of wastewater treatment concerns remain about the levels of harmful microbiological constituents that may persist in the water previous studies have identified that while wastewater treatment does reduce bacterial diversity potential human pathogens legionella spp mycobacterium spp and streptococcus spp may still be present and in some cases selectively enriched by the disinfection process lin et al 2016 kulkarni et al 2018 additionally antibiotics introduced through municipal influent and agricultural runoff can persist throughout the treatment process resulting in high selection pressure for antibiotic resistant bacteria szczepanowski et al 2009 zhang and li 2011 luczkiewicz et al 2015 however reclaimed water characteristics are likely dependent on the quality of the influent and the treatment practices employed by the wastewater treatment facility munir et al 2011 shanks et al 2013 while reclaimed water is commonly considered the standard for water reuse untreated surface water sources may also represent practical alternatives for water management for instance ponds are common features across the united states with an estimated abundance between 2 6 and 9 million renwick et al 2006 they can occur naturally e g floodplains isolated depressions but are often human constructed for a variety of utilitarian and aesthetic purposes renwick et al 2006 in agricultural settings ponds may be constructed as a means of capture and storage of freshwater for localized irrigation while ponds are not as widely studied as large lakes and marine systems their unique topography may influence their microbial community composition for instance ponds and other surface water sites are subjected to environmental and anthropogenic factors that can largely be avoided when using groundwater e g animal fecal contamination and agricultural urban runoff suslow et al 2003 ponds also tend to have a higher terrestrial aquatic interchange compared to larger bodies of water e g lakes that may drive the abundance of terrestrial microorganisms chopyk et al 2018 in contrast lotic ecosystems e g rivers creeks are marked by a natural flow usually toward another body of water such as an ocean or lake therefore in addition to traditional environmental factors lotic systems may be impacted by connected waterways and upstream discharge facilities for instance discharge of wastewater effluent into urban and suburban rivers was reported to increase downstream organic and inorganic nutrient content and decrease overall bacterial diversity in the sediment drury et al 2013 alterations in bacterial community structure have also been associated with catchment area e g agricultural forested urban likely due to variations in nutrient concentration stemming from runoff miller et al 2011 staley et al 2014 despite the potential importance of these water sources to regional biodiversity and water management previous studies on alternative water sources have relied on the amplification and analysis of specific marker genes e g 16s rrna gene while useful for broad community analyses these studies cannot explore functionality nor capture larger complex genomic features many of which are capable of providing a more holistic picture of the microbial community such as the crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system because the crispr cas system functions by integrating pieces of foreign dna i e plasmid phage into recognizable arrays predicting crispr can provide valuable information on phage infection history as well as provide a potential means to subtype pathogens shariat and dudley 2014 previous studies exploring crispr cas from human body sites rho et al 2012 dairy operations horvath et al 2008 and extreme environments e g microbial mats such as microbial mats heidelberg et al 2009 hot springs snyder et al 2010 and antarctic snow lopatina et al 2016 have given us profound insights into the infection history and defense strategies of their microbial communities this is of particular importance when assessing the quality of irrigation waters because while they are not direct human pathogens phages are responsible for shaping the diversity and genetic composition of their host s frost et al 2005 therefore the overall aim of this study was to provide comprehensive foundational knowledge on the microbial communities in multiple alternative irrigation water sources highlighting putative risks to produce safety and public health to address this aim we used high throughput shotgun metagenomic sequencing which enabled us to evaluate the full genomic spectrum present in the samples with these data our specific objectives were to 1 characterize and compare bacterial community composition 2 predict and compare functional pathogenic and antibiotic resistance genes and 3 improve our understanding of phage host relationships across multiple untreated surface and reclaimed water sites sampled over the course of five weeks from october to november 2016 in the mid atlantic united states 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites water samples n 24 were collected from nine sites of four different water body types in maryland united

processing to remove the cellular fraction each water sample was vacuum filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter pall corporation mi usa microbial dna was then extracted from the filters using an enzymatic and mechanical lysis procedure currently used in our lab to extract dna from various environmental biomes chopyk et al 2017 2018 briefly the filters were added to lysing matrix tubes along with a cocktail of pbs buffer lysozyme lysostaphin and mutanolysin after incubating samples were subjected to a second lysing cocktail proteinase k and sds followed by another incubation and mechanical lysis via bead beating the resulting dna was purified with the qiamp dna mini kit qiagen ca usa and assessed with the nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer 2 4 shotgun sequencing for each sample

kasa gyra gyrb mura ndh thya rpsl rpsj a post processing step mafft alignment with reference sequences available at card was taken to confirm the presence of resistance conferring mutations katoh et

availability metagenomic reads were submitted to ncbi s sequence read archive under the bioproject accession number prjna473136 samn10386131 samn10386154 the assembled contigs were also submitted to ncbi under the same bioproject accession number and biosample ids 3 results 3 1 sequencing effort assembly and taxonomy all processed samples n 24 were sequenced on the illumina hiseq for a total of 803 403 499 read pairs table s2 with an average of 33 475 146 per metagenome sd 9 122 444 after metagenomic assembly an average of 50 of reads within a library recruited to contigs from its assembly 11 383 477 contigs total average contigs library 474 310 150 989 sd with 48 of reads within a library able to recruit to assembled contigs 500 bp using homology searching with blast we were able to identify the putative bacterial genera and phyla that dominated each site at each time point on average 65 of contigs could be confidently assigned a taxonomic representative table s3 of these between 78 and 98 mean 91 were assigned as bacteria followed by eukaryota min 0 6 max 17 mean 4 and viruses min 0 6 max 10 mean 3 for the contigs that could be identified a normalized abundance was calculated to account for sequencing effort and assembly recruitment proficiency for those assigned as eukaryota the majority of the abundance was classified as streptophyta min 6 max 51 mean 21 arthropoda min 6 max 43 mean 15 and chordata min 8 max 30 mean 15 fig s1 for those assigned as bacteria the most frequently observed bacterial phyla relative to each sample was proteobacteria min 35 max 83 mean 55 fig 1 a this was followed by actinobacteria min 2 max 25 mean 13 bacteroidetes min 6 max 21 mean 13 or firmicutes min 4 max 12 mean 7 within the proteobacteria phylum the class betaproteobacteria was the most abundant at each of the sites with the exception of sampling dates 10 24 16 and 11 14 16 within the tidal brackish river ma04 and 11 14 16 within ma08 in which bacteria from the alphaproteobacteria class were the most abundant within the proteobacteria phylum fig 1b to further classify the taxonomic composition we considered the bacterial assignments at the genus level and compared them within and among sites fig 2 between 74 and 90 of contigs could be assigned to a bacterial genus in total there were 2207 different genera with 789 identified at some abundance in all of the samples of these 44 occurred at a relative abundance 1 in at least one sample interestingly the majority of sites were dominated by the same bacterial genera however there were some trends that demarcated specific sites for instance variovorax was the most abundant genus in 17 of the 24 samples min 2 max 32 mean 11 however in all the samples collected from the freshwater pond ma10 and the sample collected on 10 24 16 from the reclamation facility ma01 streptomyces was the most abundant similarly pusillimonas was the most abundant in ma03 a freshwater creek 11 14 16 and ma04 a brackish river 10 10 16 while nostoc was the most abundant in ma04 10 24 16 furthermore when we compared the normalized abundance of the dominant genera among the different sites and tested their significance via an anova with post hoc tukey hsd we found significant differences for the genera mesorhizobium cystobacter microvirga microcystis gimesia and prochlorococcus table s4 notably we found that ma04 a brackish river had a significantly p 0 05 higher abundance of gimesia and microcystis than all of the other sites except ma01 a reclamation facility alternatively ma01 had a significantly p 0 05 higher abundance of prochlorococcus than all of the other sites except ma04 3 2 functional analysis of bacterial assigned translated peptide orfs in addition to the taxonomic analysis the metagenomic data generated in this study allowed us to look at the putative function assigned to each of the translated peptide orfs on average 56 min 31 max 75 of translated orfs were assigned at least one go term with the majority min 81 max 98 mean 93 coming from contigs assigned as bacteria overall the dominant putative molecular functions and biological processes that could be assigned were similar among the various water sources the go terms assigned at the greatest frequency to all of the water sources were transferase activity go 0016740 min 25 max 29 mean 27 hydrolase activity go 0016787 min 25 max 27 mean 26 atp binding go 0005524 min 18 max 25 mean 20 oxidation reduction process go 0055114 min 17 max 20 mean 18 and catalytic activity go 0003824 min 15 max 18 mean 17 fig 3 a additionally we explored the presence of the go term for pathogenesis go 0009405 as well as its child term toxin activity go 0090729 and terms associated with antibiotic go 0046677 and drug resistance go 0042493 korves and colosimo 2009 again the normalized abundance was calculated and totaled for bacterial contigs containing translated orfs assigned to one or more of these go terms fig 3b the go term for pathogenesis was assigned to the greatest portion between 0 7 and 4 mean 2 with the majority of these contigs taxonomically assigned as pseudomonas min 6 max 14 mean 9 and pusillimonas min 1 max 12 mean 5 fig s3 while the greatest percentage of pathogenesis containing contigs was identified at ma03 on 11 14 16 there was no statistically significant differences among the sites 3 3 translated peptide orf clustering in addition to functional analysis the complete translated peptide orfs were clustered at 60 to assess the shared and unique functional profiles among the different sampling sites fig s2 table s5 li and godzik 2006 despite the majority of orfs assigned to the same go term most of the translated orfs clustered within site highlighting the unique peptide sequence composition at each water source the two tidal brackish rivers ma04 and ma08 had the greatest fraction of unique translated orfs 63 and 51 respectively followed by ma07 48 ma11 41 ma03 36 ma02 36 ma01 34 ma10 33 and ma06 31 the remaining fraction of translated orfs from each site clustered with one or more different sites and in some cases revealed a putative connection between reclaimed water sites and ponds in total 51 41 and 38 of the translated orfs from the reclaimed water sites ma02 ma06 and ma01 clustered with translated orfs from the ponds ma11 ma10 and ma10 respectively in addition to ma10 a large percentage of translated orfs 47 from ma06 also clustered with those from the non tidal freshwater creek ma03 additionally between 4 and 9 of the translated orfs clustered with at least one member from all the other sites representing a functional core among all the sampled water sources within this core 92 of the translated orfs were assigned a go term similar to the functional analysis the majority of these go terms were for transferase activity go 0016740 23 oxidation reduction process go 0055114 20 and hydrolase activity go 0016787 19 as well as translation go 0006412 18 and metal ion binding go 0046872 18 suggesting that the most abundant functions are those shared among the different sites not surprisingly in addition to these molecular functions and biological processes we also saw an abundance of cellular components assigned to the core such as membrane go 0016020 24 integral component of membrane go 0016021 22 and cytoplasm go 0005737 21 3 4 antibiotic resistance to further assess antibiotic resistance we conducted a blast analysis of the translated peptide orfs against card across all samples 114 translated orfs were identified as 32 unique args conferring resistance to over ten drug classes including resistance mechanisms associated with target mutations and those associated with dedicated antibiotic resistance gene products mcarthur et al 2013 for the former proteins were confirmed to carry the following mutations kasa r121k lee et al 1999 gyra s95t sulochana et al 2007 mura c117d de smet et al 1999 rpsl k88r k43r brzostek et al 2004 ballif et al 2012 rpsj v57m kubanov et al 2016 and ef tu q124k zuurmond et al 1999 overall the reclamation water sampled on 11 14 16 from ma06 contained the greatest diversity of args with 23 unique args identified from 25 arg like orfs fig 4 this was followed by the non tidal freshwater creek ma03 sampled on 10 24 16 which had 13 unique args identified from 14 arg like orfs the other non tidal freshwater creek ma07 contained the lowest diversity of args with just one unique arg identified throughout the entire sampling period we also identified the source genera and phyla of each arg like orf by parsing the contig taxa identified previously fig 5 all the arg like orfs originated from contigs assigned as bacteria with the majority coming from actinobacteria 59 of 114 52 while the majority of these were rpsl genes actinobacteria genera were also associated with 12 other unique args furthermore 32 arg like orfs were classified as proteobacteria 11 alpha 6 beta 14 gamma 1 delta and encompassed the majority of arg diversity with 20 2 unique args 3 5 crispr array abundance and taxonomy in addition to identifying traditional genes of concern we also sought to determine the phage host relationships within and among sites using crispr arrays crispr arrays were predicted in every library for a total of 612 arrays on 604 contigs for the contigs that had a predicted crispr array we calculated their normalized abundance fig 6 a overall crispr containing contigs only accounted for between 0 003 and 0 04 of the total contig abundance among all samples however on average the tidal brackish water site ma04 had both the greatest number of detected crispr arrays 238 across 234 contigs and the highest normalized abundance of the crispr containing contigs to identify the taxonomy of the contigs containing putative crispr arrays we parsed the blastp assigned taxa however similar to previous studies gogleva et al 2014 making taxonomic predictions for crispr containing contigs was difficult only 22 130 604 of crispr containing contigs could be assigned a taxa fig s4 the majority of which were of the phyla proteobacteria 45 made up of 34 gammaproteobacteria 29 alphaproteobacteria and 17 for both betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria this was followed by firmicutes 21 and cyanobacteria 11 3 6 crispr spacers within and among sites to determine the number of unique spacers we clustered all the sampling dates within each site at 97 nucleotide similarity not surprisingly considering it had the greatest number of crispr arrays ma04 a brackish river site also had the greatest number of unique spacers 1173 spacers followed by ma10 398 spacers ma11 321 spacers ma01 293 spacers ma06 269 spacers ma03 124 spacers ma08 161 spacers ma07 25 spacers and ma02 21 spacers fig 6b these unique spacers were then clustered together to produce the number of shared spacers among the different sites we observed similar trends to what was found with the peptide clustering where ponds and reclamation sites had the greatest similarity here the reclaimed sites shared the highest degree of spacers with pond sites with ma01 and ma10 sharing the most 69 spacers 4 discussion water reuse is an important practice to mitigate our dependence on dwindling groundwater supplies however across the farm to fork continuum irrigation water is a known source of microbial contamination of fresh produce and therefore must be subjected to scrutiny in the present study we utilized metagenomics to characterize multiple facets of the microbial communities from a variety of irrigation water sites including the bacterial community and functional composition phage infection history and the presence of pathogenic genes and args together these data provide a more complete picture of the microbial community consortium within alternative water sources and showcase those sources with the greatest putative risk to public health and food safety when comparing the bacterial communities amongst the different water sources the greatest differences were between the fresh and brackish waters figs 1 2 s2 this is likely due to the mixing of fresh and saline water in the brackish sites enabling the co occurrence of bacteria typically associated with both freshwater and marine systems e g alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria piwosz et al 2013 gołębiewski et al 2017 additionally the influx of saline water likely selected for microorganisms tolerant of high salinity such as some species of microcystis tonk et al 2007 ferreira et al 2016 this may be of concern considering that species of microcystis are capable of producing hepatotoxins that have demonstrated some ability to bioaccumulate in produce crush et al 2008 a potential source of toxin exposure not often considered when assessing irrigation water quality in addition to microcystis found in brackish water genera commonly associated with human disease e g streptococcus enterococcus were identified in all samples however typical environmental genera such as variovorax were the most abundant fig 2 variovorax falls within the family comamonadaceae and is phylogenetically closely related to acidovorax another widespread environmental genera anzai et al 2000 lee et al 2010 variovorax has been found throughout a variety of environments such as drinking water lee et al 2010 delafont et al 2013 freshwater riverine water nakayama et al 2017 groundwater humphries et al 2005 posman et al 2017 and soil lipson et al 2009 as a result it has been suggested that variovorax can adapt to different environmental constraints likely due to its ability to degrade a variety of organic compounds including pollutants bers et al 2011 this heterogeneity in metabolic potential may be an effective means for out competing foreign invaders such as human associated bacteria and likely the explanation for its dominance among the different water sources to further investigate the potential public health impacts of these water sources we also investigated the presence of args previous studies have identified a diverse range of args in reclaimed waters fahrenfeld et al 2013 natural surface water sites vaz moreira et al 2014 and even pristine environments e g ancient permafrost d costa et al 2011 van goethem et al 2018 these studies reflect both the natural production of antibiotics by bacteria and those introduced to the environment by way of human pollution in this study we identified args in metagenomes from the majority of sites however comparing the sites revealed the highest arg diversity in samples from the reclamation facility ma06 and the non tidal freshwater creek ma03 fig 4 in ma06 most of the args confer resistance to antibiotics commonly used in clinical and agricultural applications including aminoglycosides sulfonamides rifamycins macrolides cephalosporins fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines that function through a suite of resistance mechanisms including antibiotic inactivation and efflux as well as antibiotic target alteration protection and replacement mcarthur et al 2013 control and prevention 2014 jia et al 2016 this broad range of resistance is not surprising as wastewater treatment plants are considered hotspots of antimicrobial resistance due to traces of antibiotics in the wastewater driving selection pressure guo et al 2017 karkman et al 2017 one of the most abundant args detected in the reclaimed water was ermf which confers resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls antibiotics these antibiotics are used frequently to treat gram positive infections and have been found to withstand wastewater treatment persisting at high levels in the effluent mcardell et al 2003 szekeres et al 2017 for the freshwater creek ma03 we also observed a high arg diversity this is likely due to discharge from a wastewater treatment facility located upstream of the sampling location table 1 previous studies have identified that wastewater effluent discharge into natural lotic systems may increase the presence of antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria and args downstream iwane et al 2001 sabri et al 2018 a study of the grote beerze river in the netherlands found increased amounts of antibiotics and args up to 20 km downstream of an effluent discharge point compared to upstream samples sabri et al 2018 however it is important to note in our study that arg diversity was not consistently high throughout the entire sampling period due to the limited number of time points it is difficult to determine whether this was the result of changing abiotic and biotic factors throughout time or variability in sampling nevertheless the presence of these args in irrigation water sources raises potential concerns for the use of these waters in agricultural applications and should be investigated further for instance the arg at the highest abundance in the majority of the other water sources besides ma03 was the mutant of rpsl fig 4 mutants of rpsl are resistant to aminoglycosides including streptomycin an antibiotic produced by the soil actinobacteria streptomyces griseus and used widely in clinical and agricultural applications brzostek et al 2004 ballif et al 2012 mutations in rpsl confer resistance by disrupting interactions between the ribosomal protein and the antibiotic these types of target mutations are frequently found in environmental bacteria and are thought to be the result of spontaneous pleotropic mutations paulander et al 2009 allen et al 2010 this is consistent with the potential taxonomic origin of the majority of rpsl mutants ferrimicrobium an iron oxidizing actinobacteria found in mine waters johnson and hallberg 2003 geothermal soils stott et al 2008 and a waterlogged bog sanyika et al 2012 in fact while pathogen associated bacterial genera e g listeria vibrio escherichia were identified to be potential hosts of some args most of the putative arg hosts were traditional environmental genera fig 5 the presence of args even in environmental genera may still be a concern as previous research suggests that args may pass through horizontal gene transfer from indigenous environmental bacteria to pathogens guo et al 2017 finally to extend our study to phages a traditionally understudied component of microbial ecosystems we leveraged the crispr cas system overall we identified crispr arrays at all time points and sampling locations suggesting that this defense system is present in bacteria from surface and reclaimed waters interestingly the tidal brackish river site ma04 had the greatest abundance of crispr arrays fig 6 as described earlier the influx of saline water at this site may have selected for a unique bacterial composition including an increased abundance of microcystis figs 2 and s2 previously crispr arrays have been identified in strains of the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa isolated from a shallow eutrophic reservoir kuno et al 2012 in addition the authors found that the microcystis spacers were rarely shared among the strains which is similar to the results observed in this study within the crispr arrays the majority of spacers were unique to each site suggesting specific interactions between phages and hosts this is likely due to the native bacteria having adapted to the local phage populations at each site kunin et al 2008 as a result it has been hypothesized that spacers can be used as a molecular fingerprint to subtype bacteria and potentially track pathogen outbreaks shariat and dudley 2014 however there were samples across sites that demonstrated shared spacers with the most apparent between the reclaimed water site ma01 and the freshwater pond site ma10 this suggests a similarity in community composition that may be indicative of similar bacterial lineages and or environmental exposures for instance the reclaimed water sites were stored at least temporarily in irrigation ponds lagoons which have similar topographical features to ponds this may also explain the high percentage of shared translated peptide orfs observed between the two sites fig s2 however this connection needs to be explored in greater detail essential for the use of untreated surface and reclaimed water sources is knowledge of their risks to environmental health and food safety although this study provides valuable foundational data there are some limitations in particular our study utilizes shotgun sequencing a method that surveys all dna in a sample regardless of its host viability and activity accurately assigning taxonomy and function to unknown dna fragments with this methodology is a challenge sczyrba et al 2017 not only does the approach used for taxonomic assignment e g k mer based vs alignment based influence the accuracy of the assignments mcintyre et al 2017 but the database used in this process also plays a role nasko et al 2018 here we sought to circumvent these challenges by utilizing a widely benchmarked similarity searching tool i e blast and one of the most comprehensive non redundant reference databases i e uniref using this approach we are confident that our assignments accurately reflect microorganisms in the database with the highest degree of taxonomic and functional homology additionally due to financial constraints we were only able to shotgun sequence samples from a limited number of sampling time points that took place during a larger 2 year longitudinal study therefore we are limited in our power to detect changes through time within this subsample this is particularly evident for the reclamation facilities in which we were only able to shotgun sequence samples from two dates further limiting the assessment of these sites nevertheless the foundational knowledge gained through this study can be used to inform future studies and support the implementation of adaptive on farm technologies e g water treatment approaches and drip irrigation that can reduce the spread of pathogenic microbial constituents 5 conclusions the overall aim of our study was to provide comprehensive foundational knowledge on the microbial communities in multiple alternative water sources through the use of shotgun metagenomic sequencing with the ultimate goal of highlighting putative risks to produce safety and public health the main conclusions drawn from these data are features of the bacterial community in untreated surface and reclaimed water sources vary depending on the date sampled and the specific site in particular sites impacted by saline water had the greatest divergence with regard to putative bacterial taxonomy and functionality potential public health threats such as args were at the greatest abundance and diversity in samples from a reclamation facility and a creek impacted by run off from a nearby wastewater facility the high degree of crispr spacers shared between certain sites e g pond reclamation facility suggests similar environmental constraints and phage host relationships declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18365,the use of irrigation water sourced from reclamation facilities and untreated surface water bodies may be a practical solution to attenuate the burden on diminishing groundwater aquifers however comprehensive microbial characterizations of these water sources are generally lacking especially with regard to variations through time and across multiple water types to address this knowledge gap we used a shotgun metagenomic approach to characterize the taxonomic and functional variations of microbial communities within two agricultural ponds two freshwater creeks two brackish rivers and three water reclamation facilities located in the mid atlantic united states water samples n 24 were collected from all sites between october and november 2016 and filtered onto 0 2 μm membrane filters filters were then subjected to total dna extraction and shotgun sequencing on the illumina hiseq platform from these data we found that betaproteobacteria dominated the majority of freshwater sites while alphaproteobacteria were abundant at times in the brackish waters one of these brackish sites was also host to a greater abundance of the bacterial genera gimesia and microcystis furthermore predicted microbial features e g antibiotic resistance genes args and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr arrays varied based on specific site and sampling date args were found across samples with the diversity and abundance highest in those from a reclamation facility and a wastewater impacted freshwater creek additionally we identified over 600 crispr arrays containing 2600 unique spacers suggestive of a diverse and often site specific phage community overall these results provide a better understanding of the complex microbial community in untreated surface and reclaimed waters while highlighting possible environmental and human health impacts associated with their use in agriculture graphical abstract image 1 keywords metagenome

comprehensive antibiotic resistance database go gene ontology arg antibiotic resistance gene orf open reading frame 1 introduction steady declines in groundwater supplies coupled with the estimation that by 2050 water withdrawals for irrigation will increase by 10 has strengthened the demand for alternative sources of water for agricultural applications bruinsma 2009 the use of reclaimed advanced treated municipal wastewater and untreated surface waters e g brackish rivers freshwater creeks and ponds may provide effective solutions to reduce pressures on groundwater sources however to date there are very few studies that have comprehensively evaluated the taxonomy and functional potential of microbial communities in alternative water sources moreover there has been limited research that has compared these microbial features across different sources filling these knowledge gaps would identify the alternative water sources with the highest and lowest degrees of putative risk with regard to both produce safety and public health this information is critical for informing the development of water reuse regulations currently reclaimed water is used as an alternative source of non potable water especially in arid and semi arid regions around the world sato et al 2013 dieter et al 2018 however because it is the end result of wastewater treatment concerns remain about the levels of harmful microbiological constituents that may persist in the water previous studies have identified that while wastewater treatment does reduce bacterial diversity potential human pathogens legionella spp mycobacterium spp and streptococcus spp may still be present and in some cases selectively enriched by the disinfection process lin et al 2016 kulkarni et al 2018 additionally antibiotics introduced through municipal influent and agricultural runoff can persist throughout the treatment process resulting in high selection pressure for antibiotic resistant bacteria szczepanowski et al 2009 zhang and li 2011 luczkiewicz et al 2015 however reclaimed water characteristics are likely dependent on the quality of the influent and the treatment practices employed by the wastewater treatment facility munir et al 2011 shanks et al 2013 while reclaimed water is commonly considered the standard for water reuse untreated surface water sources may also represent practical alternatives for water management for instance ponds are common features across the united states with an estimated abundance between 2 6 and 9 million renwick et al 2006 they can occur naturally e g floodplains isolated depressions but are often human constructed for a variety of utilitarian and aesthetic purposes renwick et al 2006 in agricultural settings ponds may be constructed as a means of capture and storage of freshwater for localized irrigation while ponds are not as widely studied as large lakes and marine systems their unique topography may influence their microbial community composition for instance ponds and other surface water sites are subjected to environmental and anthropogenic factors that can largely be avoided when using groundwater e g animal fecal contamination and agricultural urban runoff suslow et al 2003 ponds also tend to have a higher terrestrial aquatic interchange compared to larger bodies of water e g lakes that may drive the abundance of terrestrial microorganisms chopyk et al 2018 in contrast lotic ecosystems e g rivers creeks are marked by a natural flow usually toward another body of water such as an ocean or lake therefore in addition to traditional environmental factors lotic systems may be impacted by connected waterways and upstream discharge facilities for instance discharge of wastewater effluent into urban and suburban rivers was reported to increase downstream organic and inorganic nutrient content and decrease overall bacterial diversity in the sediment drury et al 2013 alterations in bacterial community structure have also been associated with catchment area e g agricultural forested urban likely due to variations in nutrient concentration stemming from runoff miller et al 2011 staley et al 2014 despite the potential importance of these water sources to regional biodiversity and water management previous studies on alternative water sources have relied on the amplification and analysis of specific marker genes e g 16s rrna gene while useful for broad community analyses these studies cannot explore functionality nor capture larger complex genomic features many of which are capable of providing a more holistic picture of the microbial community such as the crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system because the crispr cas system functions by integrating pieces of foreign dna i e plasmid phage into recognizable arrays predicting crispr can provide valuable information on phage infection history as well as provide a potential means to subtype pathogens shariat and dudley 2014 previous studies exploring crispr cas from human body sites rho et al 2012 dairy operations horvath et al 2008 and extreme environments e g microbial mats such as microbial mats heidelberg et al 2009 hot springs snyder et al 2010 and antarctic snow lopatina et al 2016 have given us profound insights into the infection history and defense strategies of their microbial communities this is of particular importance when assessing the quality of irrigation waters because while they are not direct human pathogens phages are responsible for shaping the diversity and genetic composition of their host s frost et al 2005 therefore the overall aim of this study was to provide comprehensive foundational knowledge on the microbial communities in multiple alternative irrigation water sources highlighting putative risks to produce safety and public health to address this aim we used high throughput shotgun metagenomic sequencing which enabled us to evaluate the full genomic spectrum present in the samples with these data our specific objectives were to 1 characterize and compare bacterial community composition 2 predict and compare functional pathogenic and antibiotic resistance genes and 3 improve our understanding of phage host relationships across multiple untreated surface and reclaimed water sites sampled over the course of five weeks from october to november 2016 in the mid atlantic united states 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites water samples n 24 were collected from nine sites of four different water body types in maryland united

processing to remove the cellular fraction each water sample was vacuum filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter pall corporation mi usa microbial dna was then extracted from the filters using an enzymatic and mechanical lysis procedure currently used in our lab to extract dna from various environmental biomes chopyk et al 2017 2018 briefly the filters were added to lysing matrix tubes along with a cocktail of pbs buffer lysozyme lysostaphin and mutanolysin after incubating samples were subjected to a second lysing cocktail proteinase k and sds followed by another incubation and mechanical lysis via bead beating the resulting dna was purified with the qiamp dna mini kit qiagen ca usa and assessed with the nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer 2 4 shotgun sequencing for each sample dna was used in a tagmentation reaction followed by 12 cycles of pcr amplification using nextera i7 i5 index primers per the modified nextera xt protocol the final libraries were then quantitated by quant it hsdna kit the libraries were pooled based on their concentrations as determined by quantstudio 5 and loaded onto an agilent high sensitivity d1000 screentape system the samples were run

ncbi under the same bioproject accession number and biosample ids 3 results 3 1 sequencing effort assembly and taxonomy all processed samples n 24 were sequenced on the illumina hiseq for a total of 803 403 499 read pairs table s2 with an average of 33 475 146 per metagenome sd 9 122 444 after metagenomic assembly an average of 50 of reads within a library recruited to contigs from its assembly 11 383 477 contigs total average contigs library 474 310 150 989 sd with 48 of reads within a library able to recruit to assembled contigs 500 bp using homology searching with blast we were able to identify the putative bacterial genera and phyla that dominated each site at each time point on average 65 of contigs could be confidently assigned a taxonomic representative table s3 of these between 78 and 98 mean 91 were assigned as bacteria followed by eukaryota min 0 6 max 17 mean 4 and viruses min 0 6 max 10 mean 3 for the contigs that could be identified a normalized abundance was calculated to account for sequencing effort and assembly recruitment proficiency for those assigned as eukaryota the majority of the abundance was classified as streptophyta min 6 max 51 mean 21 arthropoda min 6 max 43 mean 15 and chordata min 8 max 30 mean 15 fig s1 for those assigned as bacteria the most frequently observed bacterial phyla relative to each sample was proteobacteria min 35 max 83 mean 55 fig 1 a this was followed by actinobacteria min 2 max 25 mean 13 bacteroidetes min 6 max 21 mean 13 or firmicutes min 4 max 12 mean 7 within the proteobacteria phylum the class betaproteobacteria was the most abundant at each of the sites with the exception of sampling dates 10 24 16 and 11 14 16 within the tidal brackish river ma04 and 11 14 16 within ma08 in which bacteria from the alphaproteobacteria class were the most abundant within the proteobacteria phylum fig 1b to further classify the taxonomic composition we considered the bacterial assignments at the genus level and compared them within and among sites fig 2 between 74 and 90 of contigs could be assigned to a bacterial genus in total there were 2207 different genera with 789 identified at some abundance in all of the samples of these 44 occurred at a relative abundance 1 in at least one sample interestingly the majority of sites were dominated by the same bacterial genera however there were some trends that demarcated specific sites for instance variovorax was the most abundant genus in 17 of the 24 samples min 2 max 32 mean 11 however in all the samples collected from the freshwater pond ma10 and the sample collected on 10 24 16 from the reclamation facility ma01 streptomyces was the most abundant similarly pusillimonas was the most abundant in ma03 a freshwater creek 11 14 16 and ma04 a brackish river 10 10 16 while nostoc was the most abundant in ma04 10 24 16 furthermore when we compared the normalized abundance of the dominant genera among the different sites and tested their significance via an anova with post hoc tukey hsd we found significant differences for the genera mesorhizobium cystobacter microvirga microcystis gimesia and prochlorococcus table s4 notably we found that ma04 a brackish river had a significantly p 0 05 higher abundance of gimesia and microcystis than all of the other sites except ma01 a reclamation facility alternatively ma01 had a significantly p 0 05 higher abundance of prochlorococcus than all of the other sites except ma04 3 2 functional analysis of bacterial assigned translated peptide orfs in addition to the taxonomic analysis the metagenomic data generated in this study allowed us to look at the putative function assigned to each of the translated peptide orfs on average 56 min 31 max 75 of translated orfs were assigned at least one go term with the majority min 81 max 98 mean 93 coming from contigs assigned as bacteria overall the dominant putative molecular functions and biological processes that could be assigned were similar among the various water sources the go terms assigned at the greatest frequency to all of the water sources were transferase activity go 0016740 min 25 max 29 mean 27 hydrolase activity go 0016787 min 25 max 27 mean 26 atp binding go 0005524 min 18 max 25 mean 20 oxidation reduction process go 0055114 min 17 max 20 mean 18 and catalytic activity go 0003824 min 15 max 18 mean 17 fig 3 a additionally we explored the presence of the go term for pathogenesis go 0009405 as well as its child term toxin activity go 0090729 and terms associated with antibiotic go 0046677 and drug resistance go 0042493 korves and colosimo 2009 again the normalized abundance was calculated and totaled for bacterial contigs containing translated orfs assigned to one or more of these go terms fig 3b the go term for pathogenesis was assigned to the greatest portion between 0 7 and 4 mean 2 with the majority of these contigs taxonomically assigned as pseudomonas min 6 max 14 mean 9 and pusillimonas min 1 max 12 mean 5 fig s3 while the greatest percentage of pathogenesis containing contigs was identified at ma03 on 11 14 16 there was no statistically significant differences among the sites 3 3 translated peptide orf clustering in addition to functional analysis the complete translated peptide orfs were clustered at 60 to assess the shared and unique functional profiles among the different sampling sites fig s2 table s5 li and godzik 2006 despite the majority of orfs assigned to the same go term most of the translated orfs clustered within site highlighting the unique peptide sequence composition at each water source the two tidal brackish rivers ma04 and ma08 had the greatest fraction of unique translated orfs 63 and 51 respectively followed by ma07 48 ma11 41 ma03 36 ma02 36 ma01 34 ma10 33 and ma06 31 the remaining fraction of translated orfs from each site clustered with one or more different sites and in some cases revealed a putative connection between reclaimed water sites and ponds in total 51 41 and 38 of the translated orfs from the reclaimed water sites ma02 ma06 and ma01 clustered with translated orfs from the ponds ma11 ma10 and ma10 respectively in addition to ma10 a large percentage of translated orfs 47 from ma06 also clustered with those from the non tidal freshwater creek ma03 additionally between 4 and 9 of the translated orfs clustered with at least one member from all the other sites representing a functional core among all the sampled water sources within this core 92 of the translated orfs were assigned a go term similar to the functional analysis the majority of these go terms were for transferase activity go 0016740 23 oxidation reduction process go 0055114 20 and hydrolase activity go 0016787 19 as well as translation go 0006412 18 and metal ion binding go 0046872 18 suggesting that the most abundant functions are those shared among the different sites not surprisingly in addition to these molecular functions and biological processes we also saw an abundance of cellular components assigned to the core such as membrane go 0016020 24 integral component of membrane go 0016021 22 and cytoplasm go 0005737 21 3 4 antibiotic resistance to further assess antibiotic resistance we conducted a blast analysis of the translated peptide orfs against card across all samples 114 translated orfs were identified as 32 unique args conferring resistance to over ten drug classes including resistance mechanisms associated with target mutations and those associated with dedicated antibiotic resistance gene products mcarthur et al 2013 for the former proteins were confirmed to carry the following mutations kasa r121k lee et al 1999 gyra s95t sulochana et al 2007 mura c117d de smet et al 1999 rpsl k88r k43r brzostek et al 2004 ballif et al 2012 rpsj v57m kubanov et al 2016 and ef tu q124k zuurmond et al 1999 overall the reclamation water sampled on 11 14 16 from ma06 contained the greatest diversity of args with 23 unique args identified from 25 arg like orfs fig 4 this was followed by the non tidal freshwater creek ma03 sampled on 10 24 16 which had 13 unique args identified from 14 arg like orfs the other non tidal freshwater creek ma07 contained the lowest diversity of args with just one unique arg identified throughout the entire sampling period we also identified the source genera and phyla of each arg like orf by parsing the contig taxa identified previously fig 5 all the arg like orfs originated from contigs assigned as bacteria with the majority coming from actinobacteria 59 of 114 52 while the majority of these were rpsl genes actinobacteria genera were also associated with 12 other unique args furthermore 32 arg like orfs were classified as proteobacteria 11 alpha 6 beta 14 gamma 1 delta and encompassed the majority of arg diversity with 20 2 unique args 3 5 crispr array abundance and taxonomy in addition to identifying traditional genes of concern we also sought to determine the phage host relationships within and among sites using crispr arrays crispr arrays were predicted in every library for a total of 612 arrays on 604 contigs for the contigs that had a predicted crispr array we calculated their normalized abundance fig 6 a overall crispr containing contigs only accounted for between 0 003 and 0 04 of the total contig abundance among all samples however on average the tidal brackish water site ma04 had both the greatest number of detected crispr arrays 238 across 234 contigs and the highest normalized abundance of the crispr containing contigs to identify the taxonomy of the contigs containing putative crispr arrays we parsed the blastp assigned taxa however similar to previous studies gogleva et al 2014 making taxonomic predictions for crispr containing contigs was difficult only 22 130 604 of crispr containing contigs could be assigned a taxa fig s4 the majority of which were of the phyla proteobacteria 45 made up of 34 gammaproteobacteria 29 alphaproteobacteria and 17 for both betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria this was followed by firmicutes 21 and cyanobacteria 11 3 6 crispr spacers within and among sites to determine the number of unique spacers we clustered all the sampling dates within each site at 97 nucleotide similarity not surprisingly considering it had the greatest number of crispr arrays ma04 a brackish river site also had the greatest number of unique spacers 1173 spacers followed by ma10 398 spacers ma11 321 spacers ma01 293 spacers ma06 269 spacers ma03 124 spacers ma08 161 spacers ma07 25 spacers and ma02 21 spacers fig 6b these unique spacers were then clustered together to produce the number of shared spacers among the different sites we observed similar trends to what was found with the peptide clustering where ponds and reclamation sites had the greatest similarity here the reclaimed sites shared the highest degree of spacers with pond sites with ma01 and ma10 sharing the most 69 spacers 4 discussion water reuse is an important practice to mitigate our dependence on dwindling groundwater supplies however across the farm to fork continuum irrigation water is a known source of microbial contamination of fresh produce and therefore must be subjected to scrutiny in the present study we utilized metagenomics to characterize multiple facets of the microbial communities from a variety of irrigation water sites including the bacterial community and functional composition phage infection history and the presence of pathogenic genes and args together these data provide a more complete picture of the microbial community consortium within alternative water sources and showcase those sources with the greatest putative risk to public health and food safety when comparing the bacterial communities amongst the different water sources the greatest differences were between the fresh and brackish waters figs 1 2 s2 this is likely due to the mixing of fresh and saline water in the brackish sites enabling the co occurrence of bacteria typically associated with both freshwater and marine systems e g alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria piwosz et al 2013 gołębiewski et al 2017 additionally the influx of saline water likely selected for microorganisms tolerant of high salinity such as some species of microcystis tonk et al 2007 ferreira et al 2016 this may be of concern considering that species of microcystis are capable of producing hepatotoxins that have demonstrated some ability to bioaccumulate in produce crush et al 2008 a potential source of toxin exposure not often considered when assessing irrigation water quality in addition to microcystis found in brackish water genera commonly associated with human disease e g streptococcus enterococcus were identified in all samples however typical environmental genera such as variovorax were the most abundant fig 2 variovorax falls within the family comamonadaceae and is phylogenetically closely related to acidovorax another widespread environmental genera anzai et al 2000 lee et al 2010 variovorax has been found throughout a variety of environments such as drinking water lee et al 2010 delafont et al 2013 freshwater riverine water nakayama et al 2017 groundwater humphries et al 2005 posman et al 2017 and soil lipson et al 2009 as a result it has been suggested that variovorax can adapt to different environmental constraints likely due to its ability to degrade a variety of organic compounds including pollutants bers et al 2011 this heterogeneity in metabolic potential may be an effective means for out competing foreign invaders such as human associated bacteria and likely the explanation for its dominance among the different water sources to further investigate the potential public health impacts of these water sources we also investigated the presence of args previous studies have identified a diverse range of args in reclaimed waters fahrenfeld et al 2013 natural surface water sites vaz moreira et al 2014 and even pristine environments e g ancient permafrost d costa et al 2011 van goethem et al 2018 these studies reflect both the natural production of antibiotics by bacteria and those introduced to the environment by way of human pollution in this study we identified args in metagenomes from the majority of sites however comparing the sites revealed the highest arg diversity in samples from the reclamation facility ma06 and the non tidal freshwater creek ma03 fig 4 in ma06 most of the args confer resistance to antibiotics commonly used in clinical and agricultural applications including aminoglycosides sulfonamides rifamycins macrolides cephalosporins fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines that function through a suite of resistance mechanisms including antibiotic inactivation and efflux as well as antibiotic target alteration protection and replacement mcarthur et al 2013 control and prevention 2014 jia et al 2016 this broad range of resistance is not surprising as wastewater treatment plants are considered hotspots of antimicrobial resistance due to traces of antibiotics in the wastewater driving selection pressure guo et al 2017 karkman et al 2017 one of the most abundant args detected in the reclaimed water was ermf which confers resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls antibiotics these antibiotics are used frequently to treat gram positive infections and have been found to withstand wastewater treatment persisting at high levels in the effluent mcardell et al 2003 szekeres et al 2017 for the freshwater creek ma03 we also observed a high arg diversity this is likely due to discharge from a wastewater treatment facility located upstream of the sampling location table 1 previous studies have identified that wastewater effluent discharge into natural lotic systems may increase the presence of antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria and args downstream iwane et al 2001 sabri et al 2018 a study of the grote beerze river in the netherlands found increased amounts of antibiotics and args up to 20 km downstream of an effluent discharge point compared to upstream samples sabri et al 2018 however it is important to note in our study that arg diversity was not consistently high throughout the entire sampling period due to the limited number of time points it is difficult to determine whether this was the result of changing abiotic and biotic factors throughout time or variability in sampling nevertheless the presence of these args in irrigation water sources raises potential concerns for the use of these waters in agricultural applications and should be investigated further for instance the arg at the highest abundance in the majority of the other water sources besides ma03 was the mutant of rpsl fig 4 mutants of rpsl are resistant to aminoglycosides including streptomycin an antibiotic produced by the soil actinobacteria streptomyces griseus and used widely in clinical and agricultural applications brzostek et al 2004 ballif et al 2012 mutations in rpsl confer resistance by disrupting interactions between the ribosomal protein and the antibiotic these types of target mutations are frequently found in environmental bacteria and are thought to be the result of spontaneous pleotropic mutations paulander et al 2009 allen et al 2010 this is consistent with the potential taxonomic origin of the majority of rpsl mutants ferrimicrobium an iron oxidizing actinobacteria found in mine waters johnson and hallberg 2003 geothermal soils stott et al 2008 and a waterlogged bog sanyika et al 2012 in fact while pathogen associated bacterial genera e g listeria vibrio escherichia were identified to be potential hosts of some args most of the putative arg hosts were traditional environmental genera fig 5 the presence of args even in environmental genera may still be a concern as previous research suggests that args may pass through horizontal gene transfer from indigenous environmental bacteria to pathogens guo et al 2017 finally to extend our study to phages a traditionally understudied component of microbial ecosystems we leveraged the crispr cas system overall we identified crispr arrays at all time points and sampling locations suggesting that this defense system is present in bacteria from surface and reclaimed waters interestingly the tidal brackish river site ma04 had the greatest abundance of crispr arrays fig 6 as described earlier the influx of saline water at this site may have selected for a unique bacterial composition including an increased abundance of microcystis figs 2 and s2 previously crispr arrays have been identified in strains of the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa isolated from a shallow eutrophic reservoir kuno et al 2012 in addition the authors found that the microcystis spacers were rarely shared among the strains which is similar to the results observed in this study within the crispr arrays the majority of spacers were unique to each site suggesting specific interactions between phages and hosts this is likely due to the native bacteria having adapted to the local phage populations at each site kunin et al 2008 as a result it has been hypothesized that spacers can be used as a molecular fingerprint to subtype bacteria and potentially track pathogen outbreaks shariat and dudley 2014 however there were samples across sites that demonstrated shared spacers with the most apparent between the reclaimed water site ma01 and the freshwater pond site ma10 this suggests a similarity in community composition that may be indicative of similar bacterial lineages and or environmental exposures for instance the reclaimed water sites were stored at least temporarily in irrigation ponds lagoons which have similar topographical features to ponds this may also explain the high percentage of shared translated peptide orfs observed between the two sites fig s2 however this connection needs to be explored in greater detail essential for the use of untreated surface and reclaimed water sources is knowledge of their risks to environmental health and food safety although this study provides valuable foundational data there are some limitations in particular our study utilizes shotgun sequencing a method that surveys all dna in a sample regardless of its host viability and activity accurately assigning taxonomy and function to unknown dna fragments with this methodology is a challenge sczyrba et al 2017 not only does the approach used for taxonomic assignment e g k mer based vs alignment based influence the accuracy of the assignments mcintyre et al 2017 but the database used in this process also plays a role nasko et al 2018 here we sought to circumvent these challenges by utilizing a widely benchmarked similarity searching tool i e blast and one of the most comprehensive non redundant reference databases i e uniref using this approach we are confident that our assignments accurately reflect microorganisms in the database with the highest degree of taxonomic and functional homology additionally due to financial constraints we were only able to shotgun sequence samples from a limited number of sampling time points that took place during a larger 2 year longitudinal study therefore we are limited in our power to detect changes through time within this subsample this is particularly evident for the reclamation facilities in which we were only able to shotgun sequence samples from two dates further limiting the assessment of these sites nevertheless the foundational knowledge gained through this study can be used to inform future studies and support the implementation of adaptive on farm technologies e g water treatment approaches and drip irrigation that can reduce the spread of pathogenic microbial constituents 5 conclusions the overall aim of our study was to provide comprehensive foundational knowledge on the microbial communities in multiple alternative water sources through the use of shotgun metagenomic sequencing with the ultimate goal of highlighting putative risks to produce safety and public health the main conclusions drawn from these data are features of the bacterial community in untreated surface and reclaimed water sources vary depending on the date sampled and the specific site in particular sites impacted by saline water had the greatest divergence with regard to putative bacterial taxonomy and functionality potential public health threats such as args were at the greatest abundance and diversity in samples from a reclamation facility and a creek impacted by run off from a nearby wastewater facility the high degree of crispr spacers shared between certain sites e g pond reclamation facility suggests similar environmental constraints and phage host relationships declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18366,recovering nitrogen from wastewater can simultaneously fulfill the roles of traditional removal technologies such as nitrification denitrification and fertilizer production processes such as haber bosch we have recently demonstrated a proof of concept for selective recovery of the fertilizer ammonium sulfate via electrochemical stripping a combination of electrodialysis and membrane stripping in this study we furthered electrochemical stripping from concept to informed practice by investigating the effects of influent concentration 30 300 and 3000 mg n l catholyte temperature 15 23 and 35 c and gas permeable membrane choice on electrochemical nitrogen removal and recovery we also proposed and validated a nitrogen mass transport model for the experimental results providing mechanistic rationale behind observed effects of varying operating parameters while changing operating parameters did affect performance electrochemical stripping exhibited robust performance over a range of realistic ambient temperatures three gas permeable membranes and three orders of magnitude of influent concentrations practically these results demonstrate that electrochemical stripping is viable across a range of waste streams and resilient to fluctuations in temperature and nitrogen concentration they also establish operational trade offs between residence time and energy consumption as a result of this work electrochemical stripping continues to mature from concept to practice and provides lessons for developing other resource recovery technologies graphical abstract image 1

can prevent eutrophication while reducing the energy demand of fertilizer production zhang et al 2019 nitrogen occurs in various forms in wastewater including organic nitrogen proteins amino acids urea total ammonia nitrogen tan sum of aqueous ammonium nh4 and aqueous ammonia nh3 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 current methods for treating nitrogen in wastewater remove rather than recover nitrogen thus expending additional energy to reduce pollution in the broader anthropogenic nitrogen cycle the haber bosch process consumes roughly 1 of the world s annual energy supply to produce nitrogen based fertilizers through fixation of nitrogen gas n2 smith 2002 humans consume this nitrogen in food and excrete it into wastewater rather than using energy chemical and monetary inputs to remove nitrogen from wastewater only to cycle it back through the haber bosch process recovering nitrogen based fertilizers from wastewater can enable a more resource efficient circular economy widely used conventional nitrogen removal techniques include microbial processes e g nitrification denitrification anammox and physicochemical processes e g ammonia stripping municipal wastewater is primarily treated with aerobic activated sludge processes in which nitrifying bacteria transform total ammonia to nitrite then nitrate nitrification coskun et al 2017 an anoxic step allows denitrifying bacteria to reduce nitrate to n2 denitrification thus achieving removal kuypers et al 2018 this two pronged process has several operational advantages over nitrification alone including savings in oxygen consumption and savings in alkalinity nitrification generates h ions dentification consumes h ions sperling 2007 alternatively partial nitrification can be combined with anammox in which anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria reduce nitrite to nh4 and directly produce n2 distinct advantages of this pairing include reduction of sludge volume and near elimination of carbon demand for denitrification cao et al 2017 daigger 2014 ammonia stripping is a physicochemical desorption process in which lime or caustic is added to wastewater until ph reaches 10 8 11 5 converting aqueous nh4

backwash or regeneration and is resilient to toxic compounds that could disrupt performance of biological systems kinidi et al 2018 although nitrification denitrification anammox and ammonia stripping are mature technologies for removing nitrogen from wastewater they offer little potential to recover chemical energy or usable products from wastewater thus these approaches perpetuate the imbalanced conversion of n2 to total ammonia and energy intensive use of n2 as an intermediate separate management of wastewater nitrogen removal and nitrogen fertilizer production leads to inherent inefficiencies that incremental improvements will not adequately address meeting the grand challenge of re engineering the anthropogenic nitrogen cycle requires transformative solutions such as considering the combined processes of nitrogen pollution prevention and fertilizer production recovering nitrogen as total ammonia from wastewater shows unrivaled potential to reduce material cost and energy inputs compared to existing nitrogen management furthermore unlike removal processes emerging resource recovery techniques such as electrochemical water treatment are easily adapted to decentralized settings lacking formal sewer infrastructures radjenovic and sedlak 2015 zodrow et al 2017 as we transition to a recovery paradigm selective separations become critical to achieve product purity in a previous work we demonstrated proof of concept for electrochemical stripping ecs a novel nitrogen recovery process that selectively extracts ammonium sulfate from wastewater ecs achieved unprecedented nitrogen recovery 93 and selectivity tarpeh et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 ecs combines electrodialysis and membrane stripping in a three chamber reactor left to right anode cathode trap chambers that separates nitrogen based on charge cation exchange membrane cem and volatility gas permeable membrane gpm compared to conventional ammonia stripping ecs exhibits two major advantages 1 replacing caustic addition with electro generated base in the cathode chamber which facilitates volatilization and transport through the gpm and 2 preserving the concentration gradient for nh3 g diffusion to the sulfuric acid trap chamber thus ecs does not require addition of strong base consumes less energy than conventional ammonia stripping can be implemented in remote settings and recovers the liquid fertilizer ammonium sulfate which can be used directly for fertigation or freeze dried to a solid ecs is differentiated from other electrochemical ammonia recovery techniques in that the entire recovery process is self contained to a single cell in which electrochemistry occurs concurrently with membrane stripping advancing electrochemical stripping from concept to practice requires understanding relative kinetics of each step and their responses to operating parameters because we previously found transmembrane fluxes across the gpm were lower than across the cem in this work we investigate two major factors expected to influence gpm fluxes catholyte temperature and gpm membrane choice to expand the potential applications of ecs beyond urine tarpeh et al 2018 and hydrothermal liquefaction effluent li et al 2018 we also vary influent concentration across three orders of magnitude for all experiments we measure concentration profiles and calculate removal and recovery efficiencies to provide a mechanistic rationale behind the observed patterns in removal and recovery efficiencies we propose and validate a robust nitrogen mass transport model with few assumptions the novelty of this work arises from combining this model with experiments to derive mechanistic insights and to predict ecs operational times and energy requirements for target removal rates lending experimental screening abilities to ecs though applied to ecs in this work our proposed mass transport model can be readily adapted for different species being removed or recovered in electrodialysis and membrane distillation systems 2 materials and methods in our earlier work we performed ecs in batch and continuous operation under a single set of operating conditions to show that nitrogen could be selectively and efficiently recovered from urine we demonstrated the selectivity of ecs and elucidated mechanistic effects of competitor cations and organic matter in increasingly realistic solutions tarpeh et al 2018 in this work we continued building upon this foundation by adapting the same batch setup adapted reactor electrodes flow pattern to probe effects of influent concentration catholyte temperature and gpm on nitrogen recovery because we have already demonstrated 90 recovery and selectivity in real urine and htl effluent we employ ammonium sulfate as influent to develop a descriptive framework for nitrogen recovery grounded in fundamental principles of mass transfer and reaction kinetics by removing contributions other species may have on nitrogen recovery such as charge shielding or concentrated mass transfer effects we invoke tractable fundamental principles to describe our experimental results and provide predictive power across solutions of varying composition 2 1 electrochemical stripping setup device and reagents we used a three chambered reactor in which three square acrylic glass frames 8 cm 8 cm were bolted together between two larger square acrylic glass plates to create the anode cathode and trap chambers the cathode working electrode in our system was stainless steel and the anode counter electrode in our system was ti mesh coated with ir mixed metal oxide 64 cm2 magneto special anodes netherlands an ag agcl reference electrode 0 20 v vs she was placed adjacent 2 cm to the cathode and used with a potentiostat reference 3000 gamry instruments inc warminster pa to measure and control applied potential the anode and cathode chambers were separated by a cation exchange membrane cmi 7000 membranes international inc ringwood nj the cathode and trap chambers were separated by one of three gas permeable membranes clarcor ql 822 clarcor industrial air overland park ks clarcor qp 952 and aquastill aquastill sittard netherlands these particular membranes were chosen because they exhibit high vapor flux vanneste et al 2018 mechanical stability marks 2017 chemical resistance lawson and lloyd 1987 zuo et al 2016 similar thermal efficiencies vanneste et al 2018 and are commercially available for membrane distillation applications easing practical feasibility we made anolyte influent catholyte and trap solutions from nanopure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm and analytical grade solid ammonium sulfate solid nacl and concentrated h2so4 respectively sigma aldrich st louis mo ammonium sulfate was used as influent because sulfate cannot be further electrochemically oxidized thus restricting the only chemical species of interest in our influent to ammonium to supplement our previous work on urine and hydrothermal liquefaction effluent we chose influent concentrations of 30 mg n l municipal wastewater metcalf and eddy inc 2003 qiu et al 2010 300 mg n l leather wastewater gutterres et al 2015 and 3000 mg n l anaerobic digestate desloover et al 2012 logan and visvanathan 2019 these concentrations were matched with trap solution concentrations of 50 mm 500 mm and 1 m respectively catholyte was always 0 1 m nacl table s1 2 2 electrolysis operation sample preparation and analysis we performed chronopotentiometric experiments at a current density of 10 ma cm 2 measured potentials were approximately 2 9 v vs ag agcl 3 1 v vs she we chose to restrict temperature control to the catholyte in order to explore its effects on mass transport across the gpm we heated and cooled catholyte by using a hot plate catholyte temperature 35 c and ice bath catholyte temperature 15 c respectively room temperature experiments were kept consistent through use of a thermostat in the laboratory 23 c anolyte catholyte and trap solutions were recirculated separately at 75 ml min 1 for 7 h in batch and all chambers were rinsed with circulating nanopure water overnight between experiments to avoid potential cross contamination experiments were conducted in triplicate for each of three gpms at each of three catholyte temperatures 9 triplicates the gpm exhibiting the highest nitrogen recovery efficiency was then selected and used for triplicate experiments at 30 mg n l and 300 mg n l 2 triplicates 2 ml samples were taken from each chamber at regular time intervals measured for ph calibrated mettler toledo le 438 ph electrode mettler toledo columbus oh and temperature values cdn dtw450l waterproof thermometer cdn portland or and aliquoted for tan concentration measurements using cation chromatography dionex ics 6000 40 mm methanesulfonic acid eluent cs12 column 30 c any aliquots with ph above 7 were acidified with 2 m h2so4 to ensure that no aqueous ammonia would go undetected during chromatography ammonium ion standards at 40 30 20 10 5 and 1 mg n l made from ammonium chloride were used to generate a calibration curve for each new sequence of samples peak areas for the ammonium ion standards were verified to be similar between runs tan concentrations in each chamber over time were then calculated from chromatography results we define two metrics for evaluating batch performance the first is nitrogen recovery efficiency from the anode to trap chamber 1 γ t t a n t t t a n a i 100 where t a n t t is the tan concentration in the trap chamber at time t and t a n a i is the initial tan concentration in the anode chamber the second metric is nitrogen removal efficiency from the anode chamber includes nitrogen remaining in cathode chamber 2 η t t a n t t t a n c t t a n a i 100 where t a n c t is the tan concentration in the cathode chamber at time t both values were calculated for each experiment in each triplicate sample standard deviations were calculated using bessel s correction for a given time point removal and recovery efficiency values were compared across groups e g 15 c catholyte vs 35 c catholyte using paired two sided t tests for equal means where we rejected the null hypothesis if p 0 05 2 3 nitrogen recovery model development model overview in our electrochemical reactor nitrogen can exist in three forms ammonium ion aqueous ammonia and gaseous ammonia in the bulk liquid of the three chambers the ratio of ammonium ion to aqueous ammonia is determined by solution ph and temperature thus the ph at which half neutralization pka of ammonium occurs varies with temperature fig s1 3 n h 3 a q t a n 1 10 0 09018 2729 92 t 273 20 p h 1 100 nitrogen can only cross the cem when it exists as ammonium while it can only cross the gpm when it exists as gaseous ammonia which forms from volatilization of aqueous ammonia to assess the transport of nitrogen between chambers and build a descriptive framework for nitrogen recovery in our system we invoke a few simplifying assumptions based on experimental observations we show in fig s2 that the anolyte ph is low enough for all times such that almost all 99 99 anodic nitrogen exists as nh4 catholyte ph is high enough for the bulk of each experiment such that the majority of cathodic nitrogen exists as nh3 in our mass transport model we assume that all cathodic nitrogen exists as nh3 for all times though this assumption overpredicts ammonia transport out of the cathode chamber more so at later time points due to decreasing ph we discuss in section 3 1 2 that the tradeoff of making this simplifying assumption for a more tractable mass transport model is justified by lack of fit test results between model and data deprotonation of ammonium in the cathode chamber and protonation of ammonia in the trap chamber are treated as instantaneous reported rate constant 1029 m 1 s 1 hemsworth et al 1974 i e nitrogen reacts in a diffusion limited regime lastly we assume each chamber is well mixed because recirculation rate restricts hydraulic residence time to 2 min while we generally sample every 15 or 45 min model construction with this set of experimentally informed assumptions we arrive at a straightforward two step process governing the recovery of nitrogen mass transport of ammonium across the cem and mass transport of ammonia across the gas gpm we lump the contributions of electromigration diffusion and convection negligible in our system because the flow is parallel to the membranes of ammonium across the cem into a single mass transport parameter h a c ac anode to cathode similarly we lump the contributions of volatilization of aqueous ammonia and subsequent diffusion across the gpm into a single mass transport parameter h c t ct cathode to trap defining these lumped parameters allows us to draw an analogy of our mass transfer model to a two step irreversible reaction mechanism which is kinetically well described a k 1 b k 2 c 4 d a d t k 1 a a t a 0 e k 1 t 5 d b d t k 1 a k 2 b b t a 0 k 1 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t 6 d c d t k 2 b c t a 0 1 k 1 k 2 k 1 e k 2 t k 2 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t at t 0 a a 0 b 0 c 0 where a represents ammonium in the anode chamber b represents aqueous ammonia in the cathode chamber and c represents recovered ammonium in the trap chamber fig 1 h a c is analogous to the rate constant k1 and parameterizes nitrogen removal from influent while h c t is analogous to the rate constant k2 and in conjunction with h a c parameterizes nitrogen recovery from influent lastly initial cathode and trap chamber nitrogen concentrations are zero b c 0 the assumption of irreversible mass transfer i e negligible diffusion from cathode to anode from the anode to cathode chamber is a consequence of 1 the applied potential which forces electromigration of cations to the cathode chamber and 2 the basicity of the cathode chamber which converts nh4 to nh3 though aqueous ammonia can diffuse through ion exchange membranes it is unlikely to do so in our system because it acts as a proton shuttle cord ruwisch et al 2011 and would therefore be moving against the proton gradient from the acidic anode to basic cathode chamber the irreversible mass transfer from the cathode to trap chamber is justified by the acidity of the trap chamber which converts all ammonia to ammonium and thus maintains an ammonia concentration gradient we provide experimental evidence for these assumptions in an earlier work tarpeh et al 2018 where we showed after 24 h that tan drops to and stays constant at 0 in the anode and cathode chambers while tan in the trap chamber remains constant at tan initial non dimensionalization to enable comparison of equations 4 6 across various magnitudes of influent concentrations we define the ratio of h a c over h c t as β h a c h c t and the characteristic timescale as τ h c t t normalizing all concentrations by a 0 we can represent dimensionless tan concentrations in the anode cathode and trap chambers as 7 a τ e β τ 8 c τ β 1 β e β τ e τ 9 t τ 1 β 1 β e τ 1 1 β e β τ where the star denotes concentration as a fraction of initial influent concentration and a c and t refer to the transient tan concentrations in the anode cathode and trap chambers respectively the recovery γ for time t is given by 10 τ h c t t 11 γ t t t a 0 t τ 1 β 1 β e τ 1 1 β e β τ we investigated how recovery changes with the ratio of mass transfer rates and the runtime of the experiment which offers the potential to screen experiments by predicting expected profiles given a certain β and or τ physically we expect that as τ γ 1 we plot predicted concentration profiles for τ from 0 to 5 and for β 0 01 0 1 0 99 10 100 in figs s3 4 model implementation based on the description of the processes above we estimated the three parameters a 0 h a c and h c t in matlab release 2018b the mathworks inc natick massachusetts for each experimental triplicate given a set of parameter values we calculated the residual at all time points by taking the difference between experimental measurement and model prediction we then found the sum of squared residuals and took the best fit parameters to be those which minimized the sum using the matlab function fminsearch to minimize this objective function see si section s1 3 for details we determined confidence intervals for the chosen parameters by adopting a parametric bootstrap approach for each time point we assume that the experimental ic measurement error is normally distributed this is a common assumption because measurement errors are an aggregate of a large number of contributing errors from sampling sample preparation detection etc the central limit theorem says that as the number of variables in a sum increases the distribution of the sum of random variables approaches the normal distribution regardless of the shape of the distribution of the individual random variables i e concentration in our experiments thus we conclude that experimental errors tend to have a normal distribution peters 2001 synthetic data were generated at time t by drawing a random number from a normal distribution scaling that number by experimental standard deviation observed at t to yield a synthetic error and adding the synthetic error to experimental mean concentration a thousand synthetic datasets were generated in matlab for each set of membrane temperature concentration conditions e g clarcor ql 822 gpm 35 c catholyte 3000 mg n l influent the same procedure was used to fit the model parameters to each synthetic dataset thereby generating 1000 fitted values for each parameter using a normal distribution for experimental error does not imply that the fitted parameters will be normally distributed we therefore choose to report the 95 confidence interval of parameter values e g 0 5 1 3 would imply that 0 5 is the fitted parameter value at the 2 50th percentile and 1 3 is the fitted parameter value at the 97 50th percentile we use lack of fit sum of squares to evaluate goodness of fit where the test statistic has an f distribution and the null hypothesis is that model predictions and data are not statistically different we reject the null hypothesis if p 0 05 therefore p 0 05 indicates no statistical difference between model predictions and experimental data 3 results and discussion based on a closed nitrogen mass balance initial and final sum of chamber concentrations exhibit 2 2 difference nitrogen does not escape from the electrochemical reactor and as stated in section 2 3 has a net movement from anode to cathode and cathode to trap chamber with negligible back diffusion in sections 3 1 and 3 2 we discuss results from varying catholyte temperature and gpm for an influent concentration of 3000 mg n l in section 3 3 we discuss the results from holding gpm and catholyte temperature constant while varying influent concentration 3000 300 30 mg n l throughout the sections we present strong agreements between our model fit to the data undergirding predictive applications of our model and practical implications in section 3 4 3 1 effects of catholyte temperature on electrochemical nitrogen recovery efficiency 3 1 1 experimental results we varied catholyte temperature because we expected temperature to influence diffusion which dominates cathode to trap chamber transport more than electromigration which dominates anode to cathode chamber transport our experimental results suggest that higher catholyte temperatures lead to higher nitrogen recovery efficiencies but do not affect nitrogen removal efficiencies all tested catholyte temperatures exhibited over 69 recovery in 7 h γ t 7 h r 69 and 75 removal in 7 h η t 7 h r 75 comparable to similar electrochemical ammonia recovery systems kuntke et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 we present the nitrogen concentration profiles in each chamber over the duration of 7 h experiments using the aquastill gpm for 15 23 and 35 c catholyte solutions in fig 2 a while concentration in the influent is unaffected by catholyte temperature differences the catholyte shows a noticeably lower maximum concentration at higher temperatures by mass balance a lower catholyte maximum implies more nitrogen has been transported to the trap chamber which we observe in the trap solution profile of the heated experiments as a result higher temperatures lead to higher nitrogen recovery efficiency fig 2b indeed at nearly all time points higher temperature enhances nitrogen recovery efficiency with 9 of 27 p values being below 0 05 table s2 thus higher catholyte temperature increases nitrogen recovery efficiency for a given time or decreases time taken to achieve a given nitrogen recovery efficiency for example the aquastill gpm took 4 5 h operating at 15 c to achieve 53 9 2 5 recovery efficiency but 3 h operating at 35 c to achieve 52 4 3 5 recovery efficiency 33 reduction in operating time in contrast to recovery nitrogen removal efficiency did not change with temperature fig 2c between all temperatures for all time points except 23 c vs 35 c at 6 h nitrogen removal efficiency from the influent did not differ statistically across catholyte temperatures table s3 we hypothesize that two main mechanisms govern nitrogen movement from the cathode to trap chamber ammonia volatilization from the aqueous phase and subsequent diffusion through the gpm to explain the observed increase in nitrogen recovery efficiency with catholyte temperature we aimed to prioritize temperature effects on volatilization and diffusion for volatilization our assumption that all cathodic nitrogen in the aqueous phase can be treated as ammonia section 2 3 model overview allows for the usual application of henry s law to a non reacting species smith and harvey 2007 the henry s constant k h decreases significantly as temperature increases from 15 to 35 c k h 15 c k h 35 c 2 5 si section s1 1 fig s5 a lower henry s constant at 35 c leads to greater volatilization contributing to the higher recovery efficiencies we experimentally observed after volatilization from the aqueous phase the gaseous ammonia must diffuse through the gpm we calculate and tabulate knudsen numbers si section s1 2 table s4 which describe the ratio of molecular mean free path to membrane pore size for the diffusion of an ammonia gas molecule through each of the gpms at stp 298 15 k 1 atm the knudsen numbers are on the order of 0 1 corresponding to a transition regime between that of knudsen flow k n 1 and molecular diffusion k n 0 01 in this regime the permeability membrane mass transfer coefficient of ammonia through the gpm with pores of area π r 2 b n h 3 is estimated from khayet 2011 12 b n h 3 π r t 1 τ δ 2 r 3 3 8 r t π m n h 3 1 p d n h 3 p a r 2 1 1 where τ is the membrane tortuosity unitless δ is the membrane thickness m d n h 3 is the diffusion coefficient of nh3 in air m 2 s p a is the pressure of air inside the membrane pores p a and r is the average radius of the membrane pores m we estimate τ using the correlation proposed by mackie and meares which has been shown to be in reasonable agreement with many manufactured membranes iversen et al 1997 srisurichan et al 2006 we use the temperature dependent diffusion coefficient of gaseous ammonia from baker 1969 holding all parameters except d n h 3 t and t constant we graph the change in permeability with temperature in fig s6 and find that b n h 3 15 c b n h 3 35 c 1 03 for all gpms therefore permeability varies weakly enough with temperature that it can be treated constant a common assumption in membrane distillation literature cai and guo 2017 based on this near constant relationship we attribute the increase in recovery with temperature to augmented ammonia partitioning to the gas phase more than changes in membrane permeability 3 1 2 model results fitted parameter values from our mass transport model corroborate experimental observations that higher catholyte temperatures lead to higher nitrogen recovery efficiencies but do not affect nitrogen removal efficiencies we present tan concentrations over time data points in each of the three chambers as fitted by the model lines and shaded regions for the 35 c aquastill in fig 3 in table 1 we show 95 confidence intervals for h a c h c t and the calculated β values obtained for each membrane across the three temperatures h c t generally increases with temperature reflecting enhanced volatilization of aqueous ammonia that leads to higher recoveries on the other hand h a c remains constant across temperatures for a given membrane suggesting that nitrogen removal efficiency is unaffected by catholyte temperature also observed experimentally in fig 2 except for a single data point in the influent at 45 min model predictions intersect with experimental error at all times in all chambers the catholyte line consistently falls slightly below experimental data points confirming our hypothesis in section 2 3 that the model overpredicts ammonia transport out of the cathode chamber however a p value of 0 21 for our lack of fit test i e we accept the model fits the data with 95 confidence leads us to conclude that our assumption has little detriment to the accuracy of the model lack of fit test results in table s5 3 2 effects of gpm on electrochemical nitrogen recovery efficiency our experimental results suggest that ecs achieves high 65 in 7 h nitrogen recovery efficiency and nitrogen removal efficiency 73 in 7 h under a range of membrane properties and that performance can be enhanced by employing thinner more porous and larger pore membranes in fig 4 a we present tan concentrations measured in the three reactor chambers from experimental triplicates of the aquastill ql 822 and qp 952 gpms at room temperature the notable difference in cathode concentrations and thus trap concentrations suggests that the aquastill gpm exhibited the fastest transport of nitrogen out of the cathode chamber we indeed calculated 12 of 27 p values below 0 05 table s7 five of which were for the last five time points of qp 952 vs aquastill and another five for the last five time points of ql 822 vs aquastill thus for fixed temperature the aquastill led to higher nitrogen recovery efficiency for each time point fig 4b for example ql 822 took 6 h to achieve 62 1 1 5 recovery efficiency while aquastill only needed 4 5 h to achieve a similar 62 4 0 4 recovery efficiency 25 reduction in operating time therefore we have identified gpm choice as an additional operational parameter that can be modified to reduce ecs operation time in contrast gpm choice exhibited no effect on nitrogen removal efficiency fig 4c for any given time point nitrogen removal efficiency exhibited no statistical differences between all gpms table s8 an equivalent way of stating this in our mass transfer model is that h a c remains constant with gpm choice while h c t changes table 1 in membrane distillation the membrane acts as a support for a vapor liquid interface and does not distinguish between solution components on a chemical basis therefore the active material of the membrane plays a large role in preventing fouling but a negligible role in determining flux lawson and lloyd 1987 rather membrane permeability is determined by an interplay of three variables from equation 12 membrane thickness tortuosity related to porosity and pore size thinner more porous large pore membranes possess larger permeabilities the clarcor membranes are less permeable than aquastill because the net contribution from their thicker less porous designs outweighs the benefit of their larger pore sizes gpm properties in table s9 3 3 influent concentration effects 3 3 1 experimental results to explore ecs performance for more dilute influents 300 and 30 mg n l we used the aquastill gpm because it exhibited the highest nitrogen recovery efficiency in section 3 2 as influent concentration becomes more dilute we observe faster recovery rates and markedly faster removal rates ecs achieved over 99 recovery and removal for both 300 and 30 mg n l influents γ t 4 5 h r 99 and η t 1 5 h r 99 for 300 mg n l and γ t 3 0 h r 99 and η t 0 13 h r 99 for 30 mg n l nitrogen is completely removed from 300 mg n l influent within 2 h fig 5 a b a markedly faster time than seen in 3000 mg n l influent as a result maximum concentration in the catholyte occurs at roughly 50 of initial concentration compared to 20 observed in 3000 mg l influent removal occurred even faster for influent concentrations of 30 mg n l fig 6 a c the maximum concentration in catholyte reaches 100 of initial concentration creating a point in which full removal but zero recovery has been achieved the likely cause of this scenario is that nitrogen removal occurs entirely under a transient current fig 6d therefore the cathode chamber does not basify quickly enough to convert incoming ammonium to ammonia resulting in a dead time between removal and recovery the removal and recovery efficiencies indicate that ecs performs robustly across solutions of varying concentrations and show promise for further investigation into the use of ecs at installations with frequent fluctuations in nitrogen concentration we expect that real waste streams will challenge the robustness of ecs due to membrane fouling such as formation of various calcium and magnesium oxy hydroxides optimizing the remediation process i e chemical treatment membrane cleaning and or voltage reversal will prove crucial to ensuring ecs remains a viable option for various waste streams 3 3 2 model results and comparison with 3000 n mg l the model cannot be applied to 30 mg n l influent because nitrogen never exists in all three chambers for any given time thereby nullifying our system of coupled differential equations equations 4 6 for 300 mg n l influent we calculate p 0 074 for the lack of fit test indicating no statistical difference between model predictions and experimental data fig s8 table s10 in table s11 we give 95 confidence intervals for h a c h c t and the calculated β values obtained for 300 mg n l influent compared to 3000 mg n l β increases an order of magnitude as concentration is lowered an order of magnitude due to h c t remaining relatively constant while h a c increases tenfold to compare the varying recovery profiles on the same basis we plot normalized concentrations equations 7 9 vs dimensionless time τ using parameters from 3000 to 300 mg n l in fig 7 the impact of β varying inversely with influent concentration is a clear experimental reflection of our modeled predictions in fig s3 larger β enhances removal and recovery furthermore larger β leads to a separation in time scale between removal and recovery with the former reaching 100 earlier than the latter as β increases 3 4 model predictions implications for practice we performed experiments and developed our mass transfer model exclusively with ammonium sulfate for two reasons 1 we previously demonstrated selectivity in complex wastewater and 2 working with ideal solutions facilitates fundamental generalizable conclusions to ensure practical applicability of our operational framework we used anaerobic digestate 200 mg n l as an influent in electrochemical stripping composition in table s12 we fit the data to the model find 95 confidence intervals for model parameters h a c h c t β table s13 fig s9 and demonstrate statistical goodness of fit p 0 32 table s14 to continue exploring practical application of ecs we intend to apply our operational framework to experiments with various wastewaters in the future with fitted model parameters h a c h c t β we leverage the predictive power of our model to investigate the practical and economic feasibility of using electrochemical stripping to achieve a certain nitrogen removal or recovery efficiency for example suppose we have a high strength wastewater containing 3 g n l and use the aquastill gpm to treat it at 23 c how long will we need to operate ecs to recover 80 of nitrogen from the influent using our fitted parameters we plot recovery vs τ fig s10 and find that we need to operate ecs for τ 11 9 roughly 7 h and 45 min to achieve 80 nitrogen recovery efficiency 99 nitrogen recovery efficiency would require 21 h of operation nearly tripling the operation time raises the issue of tradeoffs between energy input and nitrogen recovery or removal at what point is further recovery not worth the additional energy required to evaluate the energy implications of operation time we calculate electrochemical energy input per mass of nitrogen e e c m j k g n 1 as detailed by desloover et al desloover et al 2012 13 e e c v i t 1000 g n k g n 3 6 e 6 j m j j n a c where v is the measured reactor potential v i is the applied current density a m 2 t is the operation time min and j n a c is the nitrogen flux from anode to cathode as predicted by the model g n m 2 min 1 our previous work found pumping to account for less than 5 of total energy tarpeh et al 2018 so we neglect the contribution now suppose our influent is 300 mg n l such as a wastewater in the leather industry gutterres et al 2015 and local legislation requires our effluent to be lower than 15 mg l e g council of the european communities 95 removal from 300 to 15 mg n l sperling 2007 using our mass transfer model to predict j n a c and nitrogen removal efficiency we plot e e c against nitrogen removal efficiency fig 8 to find that the required 95 removal would take 32 mj kg n this value is higher than some reports of mature nitrogen removal technologies such as nitrification denitrification bozek et al 2005 panepinto et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 and anammox lackner et al 2014 and is more similar to existing bio electrochemical systems kuntke et al 2018 however we have several reasons to believe the energy input of ecs can be lowered firstly this energy calculation does not include the energy saved by recovering a value added product indeed the model predicts that in the time taken to achieve 95 nitrogen removal we have also achieved 59 nitrogen recovery as ammonium sulfate fertilizer secondly we previously observed a 30 6 mj kg n energy requirement tarpeh et al 2018 to achieve 61 nitrogen removal in real urine under continuous operation whereas our batch model predicts 60 7 mj kg n for the same nitrogen removal thus we expect the curves in fig 8 to be downshifted for continuous operation and intend to adapt the model for continuous operation in future work in addition to identifying optimization opportunities for ecs fig 8 demonstrates tradeoffs between energy input and removal efficiency for ecs and more mature nitrogen removal technologies as we approach larger removal values the slopes of the ecs curves increase reflecting longer operating times due to diminishing mass transfer driving force while we do not consider life cycle impacts in this analysis including embedded energy of electrodes membranes and chemical inputs we consider this preliminary comparison instructive for advancing ecs from concept to practice based on this analysis of operating energy requirements ecs shows promise for further development as a selective nitrogen recovery technique energy requirements for mature technologies are points in fig 8 illustrating that energy profiles for removal technologies may show curvature effects of removal efficiency and displacement effects of concentration like the ecs curves for example while nitrification is most commonly used to treat municipal wastewater sperling 2007 it has also been used to treat urine 5 000 9 000 mg n l udert and wächter 2012 energy consumption may differ across several orders of magnitude to adequately compare nitrogen removal and recovery technologies and provide maximal value to diverse stakeholders e g utility operators regulators users of value added products variations in energy consumption with influent concentration and removal recovery efficiency should be documented for all technologies by combining experiments and fundamental models in this work we advance nitrogen recovery toward informed practical implementation 4 conclusions based on complementary experimental and modeling data obtained from performing electrochemical nitrogen stripping across a broad range of operating parameters the following conclusions can be drawn ecs can produce consistent concentration recovery and removal profiles across a range of environmentally relevant temperatures 15 35 c recovery efficiency increases with temperature and the overall magnitude of achieved recovery is on par with other electrochemical recovery methods high removal 73 and recovery 65 efficiencies over three orders of magnitude of influent tan were observed as influent strength decreased a growing gap was observed between the timescales of removal and recovery with recovery taking longer to achieve than removal a mass transfer model for nitrogen recovery in the ecs process was proposed and solved analytically the model summarized nitrogen transport as two irreversible steps for which mass transfer coefficients across the cem and gpm were fitted to experimental data while hac the mass transfer coefficient from anode to cathode chamber remained relatively constant with temperature hct

18366,recovering nitrogen from wastewater can simultaneously fulfill the roles of traditional removal technologies such as nitrification denitrification and fertilizer production processes such as haber bosch we have recently demonstrated a proof of concept for selective recovery of the fertilizer ammonium sulfate via electrochemical stripping a combination of electrodialysis and membrane stripping in this study we furthered electrochemical stripping from concept to informed practice by investigating the effects of influent concentration 30 300 and 3000 mg n l catholyte temperature 15 23 and 35 c and gas permeable membrane choice on electrochemical nitrogen removal and recovery we also proposed and validated a nitrogen mass transport model for the experimental results providing mechanistic rationale behind observed effects of varying operating parameters while changing operating parameters did affect performance electrochemical stripping exhibited robust performance over a range of realistic ambient temperatures three gas permeable membranes and three orders of magnitude of influent concentrations practically these results demonstrate that electrochemical stripping is viable across a range of waste streams and resilient to fluctuations in temperature and nitrogen concentration they also establish operational trade offs between residence time and energy consumption as a result of this work electrochemical stripping continues to mature from concept to practice and provides lessons for developing other resource recovery technologies graphical abstract image 1

urea total ammonia nitrogen tan sum of aqueous ammonium nh4 and aqueous ammonia nh3 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 current methods for treating nitrogen in wastewater remove rather than recover nitrogen thus expending additional energy to reduce pollution in the broader anthropogenic nitrogen cycle the haber bosch process consumes roughly 1 of the world s annual energy supply to produce nitrogen based fertilizers through fixation of nitrogen gas n2 smith 2002 humans consume this nitrogen in food and excrete it into wastewater rather than using energy chemical and monetary inputs to remove nitrogen from wastewater only to cycle it back through the haber bosch process recovering nitrogen based fertilizers from wastewater can enable a more resource efficient circular economy widely used conventional nitrogen removal techniques include microbial processes e g nitrification denitrification anammox and physicochemical processes e g ammonia stripping municipal wastewater is primarily treated with aerobic activated sludge processes in which nitrifying bacteria transform total ammonia to nitrite then nitrate nitrification coskun et al 2017 an anoxic step allows denitrifying bacteria to reduce nitrate to n2 denitrification thus achieving removal kuypers et al 2018 this two pronged process has several operational advantages over nitrification alone including savings in oxygen consumption and savings in alkalinity nitrification generates h ions dentification consumes h ions sperling 2007 alternatively partial nitrification can be combined with anammox in which anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria reduce nitrite to nh4 and directly produce n2 distinct advantages of this pairing include reduction of sludge volume and near elimination of carbon demand for denitrification cao et al 2017 daigger 2014 ammonia stripping is a physicochemical desorption process in which lime or caustic is added to wastewater until ph reaches 10 8 11 5 converting aqueous nh4

backwash or regeneration and is resilient to toxic compounds that could disrupt performance of biological systems kinidi et al 2018 although nitrification denitrification anammox and ammonia stripping are mature technologies for removing nitrogen from wastewater they offer little potential to recover chemical energy or usable products from wastewater thus these approaches perpetuate the imbalanced conversion of n2 to total ammonia and energy intensive use of n2 as an intermediate separate management of wastewater nitrogen removal and nitrogen fertilizer production leads to inherent inefficiencies that incremental improvements will not adequately address meeting the grand challenge of re engineering the anthropogenic nitrogen cycle requires transformative solutions such as considering the combined processes of nitrogen pollution prevention and fertilizer production recovering nitrogen as total ammonia from wastewater shows unrivaled potential to reduce material cost and energy inputs compared to existing nitrogen management furthermore unlike removal processes emerging resource recovery techniques such as electrochemical water treatment are easily adapted to decentralized settings lacking formal sewer infrastructures radjenovic and sedlak 2015 zodrow et al 2017 as we transition to a recovery paradigm selective separations become critical to achieve product purity in a previous work we demonstrated proof of concept for electrochemical stripping ecs a novel nitrogen recovery process that selectively extracts ammonium sulfate from wastewater ecs achieved unprecedented nitrogen recovery 93 and selectivity tarpeh et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 ecs combines electrodialysis and membrane stripping in a three chamber reactor left to right anode cathode trap chambers that separates nitrogen based on charge cation exchange membrane cem and volatility gas permeable membrane gpm compared to conventional ammonia stripping ecs exhibits two major advantages 1 replacing caustic addition with electro generated base in the cathode chamber which facilitates volatilization and transport through the gpm and 2 preserving the concentration gradient for nh3 g diffusion to the sulfuric acid trap chamber thus ecs does not require addition of strong base consumes less energy than conventional ammonia stripping can be implemented in remote settings and recovers the liquid fertilizer ammonium sulfate which can be used directly for fertigation or freeze dried to a solid ecs is differentiated from other electrochemical ammonia recovery techniques in that the entire recovery process is self contained to a single cell in which electrochemistry occurs concurrently with membrane stripping advancing electrochemical stripping from concept to practice requires understanding relative kinetics of each step and their responses to operating parameters because we previously found transmembrane fluxes across the gpm were lower than across the cem in this work we investigate two major factors expected to influence gpm fluxes catholyte temperature and gpm membrane choice to expand the potential applications of ecs beyond urine tarpeh et al 2018 and hydrothermal liquefaction effluent li et al 2018 we also vary influent concentration across three orders of magnitude for all experiments we measure concentration profiles and calculate removal and recovery efficiencies to provide a mechanistic rationale behind the observed patterns in removal and recovery efficiencies we propose and validate a robust nitrogen mass transport model with few assumptions the novelty of this work arises from combining this model with experiments to derive mechanistic insights and to predict ecs operational times and energy requirements for target removal rates lending experimental screening abilities to ecs though applied to ecs in this work our proposed mass transport model can be readily adapted for different species being removed or recovered in electrodialysis and membrane distillation systems 2 materials and methods in our earlier work we performed ecs in batch and continuous operation under a single set of operating conditions to show that nitrogen could be selectively and efficiently recovered from urine we demonstrated the selectivity of ecs and elucidated mechanistic effects of competitor cations and organic matter in increasingly realistic solutions tarpeh et al 2018 in this work we continued building upon this foundation by adapting the same batch setup adapted reactor electrodes flow pattern to probe effects of influent concentration catholyte temperature and gpm on nitrogen recovery because we have already demonstrated 90 recovery and selectivity in real urine and htl effluent we employ ammonium sulfate as influent to develop a descriptive framework for nitrogen recovery grounded in fundamental principles of mass transfer and reaction kinetics by removing contributions other species may have on nitrogen recovery such as charge shielding or concentrated mass transfer effects we invoke tractable fundamental principles to describe our experimental results and provide predictive power across solutions of varying composition 2 1 electrochemical stripping setup device and reagents we used a three chambered reactor in which three square acrylic glass frames 8 cm 8 cm were bolted together between two larger square acrylic glass plates to create the anode cathode and trap chambers the cathode working electrode in our system was stainless steel and the anode counter electrode in our system was ti mesh coated with ir mixed metal oxide 64 cm2 magneto special anodes netherlands an ag agcl reference electrode 0 20 v vs she was placed adjacent 2 cm to the cathode and used with a potentiostat reference 3000 gamry instruments inc warminster pa to measure and control applied potential the anode and cathode chambers were separated by a cation exchange membrane cmi 7000 membranes international inc ringwood nj the cathode and trap chambers were separated by one of three gas permeable membranes clarcor ql 822 clarcor industrial air overland park ks clarcor qp 952 and aquastill aquastill sittard netherlands these particular membranes were chosen because they exhibit high vapor flux vanneste et al 2018 mechanical stability marks 2017 chemical resistance lawson and lloyd 1987 zuo et al 2016 similar thermal efficiencies vanneste et al 2018 and are commercially available for membrane distillation applications easing practical feasibility we made anolyte influent catholyte and trap solutions from nanopure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm and analytical grade solid ammonium sulfate solid nacl and concentrated h2so4 respectively sigma aldrich st louis mo ammonium sulfate was used as influent because sulfate cannot be further electrochemically oxidized thus restricting the only chemical species of interest in our influent to ammonium to supplement our previous work on urine and hydrothermal liquefaction effluent we chose influent concentrations of 30 mg n l municipal wastewater metcalf and eddy inc 2003 qiu et al 2010 300 mg n l leather wastewater gutterres et al 2015 and 3000 mg n l anaerobic digestate desloover et al 2012 logan and visvanathan 2019 these concentrations were matched with trap solution concentrations of 50 mm 500 mm and 1 m respectively catholyte was always 0 1 m nacl table s1 2 2 electrolysis operation sample preparation and analysis we performed chronopotentiometric experiments at a current density of 10 ma cm 2 measured potentials were approximately 2 9 v vs ag agcl 3 1 v vs she we chose to restrict temperature control to the catholyte in order to explore its effects on mass transport across the gpm we heated and cooled catholyte by using a hot plate catholyte temperature 35 c and ice bath catholyte temperature 15 c respectively room temperature experiments were kept consistent through use of a thermostat in the laboratory 23 c anolyte catholyte and trap solutions were recirculated separately at 75 ml min 1 for 7 h in batch and all chambers were rinsed with circulating nanopure water overnight between experiments to avoid potential cross contamination experiments were conducted in triplicate for each of three gpms at each of three catholyte temperatures 9 triplicates the gpm exhibiting the highest nitrogen recovery efficiency was then selected and used for triplicate experiments at 30 mg n l and 300 mg n l 2 triplicates 2 ml samples were taken from each chamber at regular time intervals measured for ph calibrated mettler toledo le 438 ph electrode mettler toledo columbus oh and temperature values cdn dtw450l waterproof thermometer cdn portland or and aliquoted for tan concentration measurements using cation chromatography dionex ics 6000 40 mm methanesulfonic acid eluent cs12 column 30 c any aliquots with ph above 7 were acidified with 2 m h2so4 to ensure that no aqueous ammonia would go undetected during chromatography ammonium ion standards at 40 30 20 10 5 and 1 mg n l made from ammonium chloride were used to generate a calibration curve for each new sequence of samples peak areas for the ammonium ion standards were verified to be similar between runs tan concentrations in each chamber over time were then calculated from chromatography results we define two metrics for evaluating batch performance the first is nitrogen recovery efficiency from the anode to trap chamber 1 γ t t a n t t t a n a i 100 where t a n t t is the tan concentration in the trap chamber at time t and t a n a i is the initial tan concentration in the anode chamber the second metric is nitrogen removal efficiency from the anode chamber includes nitrogen remaining in cathode chamber 2 η t t a n t t t a n c t t a n a i 100 where t a n c t is the tan concentration in the cathode chamber at time t both values were calculated for each experiment in each triplicate sample standard deviations were calculated using bessel s correction for a given time point removal and recovery efficiency values were compared across groups e g 15 c catholyte vs 35 c catholyte using paired two sided t tests for equal means where we rejected the null hypothesis if p 0 05 2 3 nitrogen recovery model development model overview in our electrochemical reactor nitrogen can exist in three forms ammonium ion aqueous ammonia and gaseous ammonia in the bulk liquid of the three chambers the ratio of ammonium ion to aqueous ammonia is determined by solution ph and temperature thus the ph at which half neutralization pka of ammonium occurs varies with temperature fig s1 3 n h 3 a q t a n 1 10 0 09018 2729 92 t 273 20 p h 1 100 nitrogen can only cross the cem when it exists as ammonium while it can only cross the gpm when it exists as gaseous ammonia which forms from volatilization of aqueous ammonia to assess the transport of nitrogen between chambers and build a descriptive framework for nitrogen recovery in our system we invoke a few simplifying assumptions based on experimental observations we show in fig s2 that the anolyte ph is low enough for all times such that almost all 99 99 anodic nitrogen exists as nh4 catholyte ph is high enough for the bulk of each experiment such that the majority of cathodic nitrogen exists as nh3 in our mass transport model we assume that all cathodic nitrogen exists as nh3 for all times though this assumption overpredicts ammonia transport out of the cathode chamber more so at later time points due to decreasing ph we discuss in section 3 1 2 that the tradeoff of making this simplifying assumption for a more tractable mass transport model is justified by lack of fit test results between model and data deprotonation of ammonium in the cathode chamber and protonation of ammonia in the trap chamber are treated as instantaneous reported rate constant 1029 m 1 s 1 hemsworth et al 1974 i e nitrogen reacts in a diffusion limited regime lastly we assume each chamber is well mixed because recirculation rate restricts hydraulic residence time to 2 min while we generally sample every 15 or 45 min model construction with this set of experimentally informed assumptions we arrive at a straightforward two step process governing the recovery of nitrogen mass transport of ammonium across the cem and mass transport of ammonia across the gas gpm we lump the contributions of electromigration diffusion and convection negligible in our system because the flow is parallel to the membranes of ammonium across the cem into a single mass transport parameter h a c ac anode to cathode similarly we lump the contributions of volatilization of aqueous ammonia and subsequent diffusion across the gpm into a single mass transport parameter h c t ct cathode to trap defining these lumped parameters allows us to draw an analogy of our mass transfer model to a two step irreversible reaction mechanism which is kinetically well described a k 1 b k 2 c 4 d a d t k 1 a a t a 0 e k 1 t 5 d b d t k 1 a k 2 b b t a 0 k 1 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t 6 d c d t k 2 b c t a 0 1 k 1 k 2 k 1 e k 2 t k 2 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t at t 0 a a 0 b 0 c 0 where a represents ammonium in the anode chamber b represents aqueous ammonia in the cathode chamber and c represents recovered ammonium in the trap chamber fig 1 h a c is analogous to the rate constant k1 and parameterizes nitrogen removal from influent while h c t is analogous to the rate constant k2 and in conjunction with h a c parameterizes nitrogen recovery from influent lastly initial cathode and trap chamber nitrogen concentrations are zero b c 0 the assumption of irreversible mass transfer i e negligible diffusion from cathode to anode from the anode to cathode chamber is a consequence of 1 the applied potential which forces electromigration of cations to the cathode chamber and 2 the basicity of the cathode chamber which converts nh4 to nh3 though aqueous ammonia can diffuse through ion exchange membranes it is unlikely to do so in our system because it acts as a proton shuttle cord ruwisch et al 2011 and would therefore be moving against the proton gradient from the acidic anode to basic cathode chamber the irreversible mass transfer from the cathode to trap chamber is justified by the acidity of the trap chamber which converts all ammonia to ammonium and thus maintains an ammonia concentration gradient we provide experimental evidence for these assumptions in an earlier work tarpeh et al 2018 where we showed after 24 h that tan drops to and stays constant at 0 in the anode and cathode chambers while tan in the trap chamber remains constant at tan initial non dimensionalization to enable comparison of equations 4 6 across various magnitudes of influent concentrations we define the ratio of h a c over h c t as β h a c h c t and the characteristic timescale as τ h c t t normalizing all concentrations by a 0 we can represent dimensionless tan concentrations in the anode cathode and trap chambers as 7 a τ e β τ 8 c τ β 1 β e β τ e τ 9 t τ 1 β 1 β e τ 1 1 β e β τ where the star denotes concentration as a fraction of initial influent concentration and a c and t refer to the transient tan concentrations in the anode cathode and trap chambers respectively the recovery γ for time t is given by 10 τ h c t t 11 γ t t t a 0 t τ 1 β 1 β e τ 1 1 β e β τ we investigated how recovery changes with the ratio of mass transfer rates and the runtime of the experiment which offers the potential to screen experiments by predicting expected profiles given a certain β and or τ physically we expect that as τ γ 1 we plot predicted concentration profiles for τ from 0 to 5 and for β 0 01 0 1 0 99 10 100 in figs s3 4 model implementation based on the description of the processes above we estimated the three parameters a 0 h a c and h c t in matlab release 2018b the mathworks inc natick massachusetts for each experimental triplicate given a set of parameter values we calculated the residual at all time points by taking the difference between experimental measurement and model prediction we then found the sum of squared residuals and took the best fit parameters to be those which minimized the sum using the matlab function fminsearch to minimize this objective function see si section s1 3 for details we determined confidence intervals for the chosen parameters by adopting a parametric bootstrap approach for each time point we assume that the experimental ic measurement error is normally distributed this is a common assumption because measurement errors are an aggregate of a large number of contributing errors from sampling sample preparation detection etc the central limit theorem says that as the number of variables in a sum increases the distribution of the sum of random variables approaches the normal distribution regardless of the shape of the distribution of the individual random variables i e concentration in our experiments thus we conclude that experimental errors tend to have a normal distribution peters 2001 synthetic data were generated at time t by drawing a random number from a normal distribution scaling that number by experimental standard deviation observed at t to yield a synthetic error and adding the synthetic error to experimental mean concentration a thousand synthetic datasets were generated in matlab for each set of membrane temperature concentration conditions e g clarcor ql 822 gpm 35 c catholyte 3000 mg n l influent the same procedure was used to fit the model parameters to each synthetic dataset thereby generating 1000 fitted values for each parameter using a normal distribution for experimental error does not imply that the fitted parameters will be normally distributed we therefore choose to report the 95 confidence interval of parameter values e g 0 5 1 3 would imply that 0 5 is the fitted parameter value at the 2 50th percentile and 1 3 is the fitted parameter value at the 97 50th percentile we use lack of fit sum of squares to evaluate goodness of fit where the test statistic has an f distribution and the null hypothesis is that model predictions and data are not statistically different we reject the null hypothesis if p 0 05 therefore p 0 05 indicates no statistical difference between model predictions and experimental data 3 results and discussion based on a closed nitrogen mass balance initial and final sum of chamber concentrations exhibit 2 2 difference nitrogen does not escape from the electrochemical reactor and as stated in section 2 3 has a net movement from anode to cathode and cathode to trap chamber with negligible back diffusion in sections 3 1 and 3 2 we discuss results from varying catholyte temperature and gpm for an influent concentration of 3000 mg n l in section 3 3 we discuss the results from holding gpm and catholyte temperature constant while varying influent concentration 3000 300 30 mg n l throughout the sections we present strong agreements between our model fit to the data undergirding predictive applications of our model and practical implications in section 3 4 3 1 effects of catholyte temperature on electrochemical nitrogen recovery efficiency 3 1 1 experimental results we varied catholyte temperature because we expected temperature to influence diffusion which dominates cathode to trap chamber transport more than electromigration which dominates anode to cathode chamber transport our experimental results suggest that higher catholyte temperatures lead to higher nitrogen recovery efficiencies but do not affect nitrogen removal efficiencies all tested catholyte temperatures exhibited over 69 recovery in 7 h γ t 7 h r 69 and 75 removal in 7 h η t 7 h r 75 comparable to similar electrochemical ammonia recovery systems kuntke et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 we present the nitrogen concentration profiles in each chamber over the duration of 7 h experiments using the aquastill gpm for 15 23 and 35 c catholyte solutions in fig 2 a while concentration in the influent is unaffected by catholyte temperature differences the catholyte shows a noticeably lower maximum concentration at higher temperatures by mass balance a lower catholyte maximum implies more nitrogen has been transported to the trap chamber which we observe in the trap solution profile of the heated experiments as a result higher temperatures lead to higher nitrogen recovery efficiency fig 2b indeed at nearly all time points higher temperature enhances nitrogen recovery efficiency with 9 of 27 p values being below 0 05 table s2 thus higher catholyte temperature increases nitrogen recovery efficiency for a given time or decreases time taken to achieve a given nitrogen recovery efficiency for example the aquastill gpm took 4 5 h operating at 15 c to achieve 53 9 2 5 recovery efficiency but 3 h operating at 35 c to achieve 52 4 3 5 recovery efficiency 33 reduction in operating time in contrast to recovery nitrogen removal efficiency did not change with temperature fig 2c between all temperatures for all time points except 23 c vs 35 c at 6 h nitrogen removal efficiency from the influent did not differ statistically across catholyte temperatures table s3 we hypothesize that two main mechanisms govern nitrogen movement from the cathode to trap chamber ammonia volatilization from the aqueous phase and subsequent diffusion through the gpm to explain the observed increase in nitrogen recovery efficiency with catholyte temperature we aimed to prioritize temperature effects on volatilization and diffusion for volatilization our assumption that all cathodic nitrogen in the aqueous phase can be treated as ammonia section 2 3 model overview allows for the usual application of henry s law to a non reacting species smith and harvey 2007 the henry s constant k h decreases significantly as temperature increases from 15 to 35 c k h 15 c k h 35 c 2 5 si section s1 1 fig s5 a lower henry s constant at 35 c leads to greater volatilization contributing to the higher recovery efficiencies we experimentally observed after volatilization from the aqueous phase the gaseous ammonia must diffuse through the gpm we calculate and tabulate knudsen numbers si section s1 2 table s4 which describe the ratio of molecular mean free path to membrane pore size for the diffusion of an ammonia gas molecule through each of the gpms at stp 298 15 k 1 atm the knudsen numbers are on the order of 0 1 corresponding to a transition regime between that of knudsen flow k n 1 and molecular diffusion k n 0 01 in this regime the permeability membrane mass transfer coefficient of ammonia through the gpm with pores of area π r 2 b n h 3 is estimated from khayet 2011 12 b n h 3 π r t 1 τ δ 2 r 3 3 8 r t π m n h 3 1 p d n h 3 p a r 2 1 1 where τ is the membrane tortuosity unitless δ is the membrane thickness m d n h 3 is the diffusion coefficient of nh3 in air m 2 s p a is the pressure of air inside the membrane pores p a and r is the average radius of the membrane pores m we estimate τ using the correlation proposed by mackie and meares which has been shown to be in reasonable agreement with many manufactured membranes iversen et al 1997 srisurichan et al 2006 we use the temperature dependent diffusion coefficient of gaseous ammonia from baker 1969 holding all parameters except d n h 3 t and t constant we graph the change in permeability with temperature in fig s6 and find that b n h 3 15 c b n h 3 35 c 1 03 for all gpms therefore permeability varies weakly enough with temperature that it can be treated constant a common assumption in membrane distillation literature cai and guo 2017 based on this near constant relationship we attribute the increase in recovery with temperature to augmented ammonia partitioning to the gas phase more than changes in membrane permeability 3 1 2 model results fitted parameter values from our mass transport model corroborate experimental observations that higher catholyte temperatures lead to higher nitrogen recovery efficiencies but do not affect nitrogen removal efficiencies we present tan concentrations over time data points in each of the three chambers as fitted by the model lines and shaded regions for the 35 c aquastill in fig 3 in table 1 we show 95 confidence intervals for h a c h c t and the calculated β values obtained for each membrane across the three temperatures h c t generally increases with temperature reflecting enhanced volatilization of aqueous ammonia that leads to higher recoveries on the other hand h a c remains constant across temperatures for a given membrane suggesting that nitrogen removal efficiency is unaffected by catholyte temperature also observed experimentally in fig 2 except for a single data point in the influent at 45 min model predictions intersect with experimental error at all times in all chambers the catholyte line consistently falls slightly below experimental data points confirming our hypothesis in section 2 3 that the model overpredicts ammonia transport out of the cathode chamber however a p value of 0 21 for our lack of fit test i e we accept the model fits the data with 95 confidence leads us to conclude that our assumption has little detriment to the accuracy of the model lack of fit test results in table s5 3 2 effects of gpm on electrochemical nitrogen recovery efficiency our experimental results suggest that ecs achieves high 65 in 7 h nitrogen recovery efficiency and nitrogen removal efficiency 73 in 7 h under a range of membrane properties and that performance can be enhanced by employing thinner more porous and larger pore membranes in fig 4 a we present tan concentrations measured in the three reactor chambers from experimental triplicates of the aquastill ql 822 and qp 952 gpms at room temperature the notable difference in cathode concentrations and thus trap concentrations suggests that the aquastill gpm exhibited the fastest transport of nitrogen out of the cathode chamber we indeed calculated 12 of 27 p values below 0 05 table s7 five of which were for the last five time points of qp 952 vs aquastill and another five for the last five time points of ql 822 vs aquastill thus for fixed temperature the aquastill led to higher nitrogen recovery efficiency for each time point fig 4b for example ql 822 took 6 h to achieve 62 1 1 5 recovery efficiency while aquastill only needed 4 5 h to achieve a similar 62 4 0 4 recovery efficiency 25 reduction in operating time therefore we have identified gpm choice as an additional operational parameter that can be modified to reduce ecs operation time in contrast gpm choice exhibited no effect on nitrogen removal efficiency fig 4c for any given time point nitrogen removal efficiency exhibited no statistical differences between all gpms table s8 an equivalent way of stating this in our mass transfer model is that h a c remains constant with gpm choice while h c t changes table 1 in membrane distillation the membrane acts as a support for a vapor liquid interface and does not distinguish between solution components on a chemical basis therefore the active material of the membrane plays a large role in preventing fouling but a negligible role in determining flux lawson and lloyd 1987 rather membrane permeability is determined by an interplay of three variables from equation 12 membrane thickness tortuosity related to porosity and pore size thinner more porous large pore membranes possess larger permeabilities the clarcor membranes are less permeable than aquastill because the net contribution from their thicker less porous designs outweighs the benefit of their larger pore sizes gpm properties in table s9 3 3 influent concentration effects 3 3 1 experimental results to explore ecs performance for more dilute influents 300 and 30 mg n l we used the aquastill gpm because it exhibited the highest nitrogen recovery efficiency in section 3 2 as influent concentration becomes more dilute we observe faster recovery rates and markedly faster removal rates ecs achieved over 99 recovery and removal for both 300 and 30 mg n l influents γ t 4 5 h r 99 and η t 1 5 h r 99 for 300 mg n l and γ t 3 0 h r 99 and η t 0 13 h r 99 for 30 mg n l nitrogen is completely removed from 300 mg n l influent within 2 h fig 5 a b a markedly faster time than seen in 3000 mg n l influent as a result maximum concentration in the catholyte occurs at roughly 50 of initial concentration compared to 20 observed in 3000 mg l influent removal occurred even faster for influent concentrations of 30 mg n l fig 6 a c the maximum concentration in catholyte reaches 100 of initial concentration creating a point in which full removal but zero recovery has been achieved the likely cause of this scenario is that nitrogen removal occurs entirely under a transient current fig 6d therefore the cathode chamber does not basify quickly enough to convert incoming ammonium to ammonia resulting in a dead time between removal and recovery the removal and recovery efficiencies indicate that ecs performs robustly across solutions of varying concentrations and show promise for further investigation into the use of ecs at installations with frequent fluctuations in nitrogen concentration we expect that real waste streams will challenge the robustness of ecs due to membrane fouling such as formation of various calcium and magnesium oxy hydroxides optimizing the remediation process i e chemical treatment membrane cleaning and or voltage reversal will prove crucial to ensuring ecs remains a viable option for various waste streams 3 3 2 model results and comparison with 3000 n mg l the model cannot be applied to 30 mg n l influent because nitrogen never exists in all three chambers for any given time thereby nullifying our system of coupled differential equations equations 4 6 for 300 mg n l influent we calculate p 0 074 for the lack of fit test indicating no statistical difference between model predictions and experimental data fig s8 table s10 in table s11 we give 95 confidence intervals for h a c h c t and the calculated β values obtained for 300 mg n l influent compared to 3000 mg n l β increases an order of magnitude as concentration is lowered an order of magnitude due to h c t remaining relatively constant while h a c increases tenfold to compare the varying recovery profiles on the same basis we plot normalized concentrations equations 7 9 vs dimensionless time τ using parameters from 3000 to 300 mg n l in fig 7 the impact of β varying inversely with influent concentration is a clear experimental reflection of our modeled predictions in fig s3 larger β enhances removal and recovery furthermore larger β leads to a separation in time scale between removal and recovery with the former reaching 100 earlier than the latter as β increases 3 4 model predictions implications for practice we performed experiments and developed our mass transfer model exclusively with ammonium sulfate for two reasons 1 we previously demonstrated selectivity in complex wastewater and 2 working with ideal solutions facilitates fundamental generalizable conclusions to ensure practical applicability of our operational framework we used anaerobic digestate 200 mg n l as an influent in electrochemical stripping composition in table s12 we fit the data to the model find 95 confidence intervals for model parameters h a c h c t β table s13 fig s9 and demonstrate statistical goodness of fit p 0 32 table s14 to continue exploring practical application of ecs we intend to apply our operational framework to experiments with various wastewaters in the future with fitted model parameters h a c h c t β we leverage the predictive power of our model to investigate the practical and economic feasibility of using electrochemical stripping to achieve a certain nitrogen removal or recovery efficiency for example suppose we have a high strength wastewater containing 3 g n l and use the aquastill gpm to treat it at 23 c how long will we need to operate ecs to recover 80 of nitrogen from the influent using our fitted parameters we plot recovery vs τ fig s10 and find that we need to operate ecs for τ 11 9 roughly 7 h and 45 min to achieve 80 nitrogen recovery efficiency 99 nitrogen recovery efficiency would require 21 h of operation nearly tripling the operation time raises the issue of tradeoffs between energy input and nitrogen recovery or removal at what point is further recovery not worth the additional energy required to evaluate the energy implications of operation time we calculate electrochemical energy input per mass of nitrogen e e c m j k g n 1 as detailed by desloover et al desloover et al 2012 13 e e c v i t 1000 g n k g n 3 6 e 6 j m j j n a c where v is the measured reactor potential v i is the applied current density a m 2 t is the operation time min and j n a c is the nitrogen flux from anode to cathode as predicted by the model g n m 2 min 1 our previous work found pumping to account for less than 5 of total energy tarpeh et al 2018 so we neglect the contribution now suppose our influent is 300 mg n l such as a wastewater in the leather industry gutterres et al 2015 and local legislation requires our effluent to be lower than 15 mg l e g council of the european communities 95 removal from 300 to 15 mg n l sperling 2007 using our mass transfer model to predict j n a c and nitrogen removal efficiency we plot e e c against nitrogen removal efficiency fig 8 to find that the required 95 removal would take 32 mj kg n this value is higher than some reports of mature nitrogen removal technologies such as nitrification denitrification bozek et al 2005 panepinto et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 and anammox lackner et al 2014 and is more similar to existing bio electrochemical systems kuntke et al 2018 however we have several reasons to believe the energy input of ecs can be lowered firstly this energy calculation does not include the energy saved by recovering a value added product indeed the model predicts that in the time taken to achieve 95 nitrogen removal we have also achieved 59 nitrogen recovery as ammonium sulfate fertilizer secondly we previously observed a 30 6 mj kg n energy requirement tarpeh et al 2018 to achieve 61 nitrogen removal in real urine under continuous operation whereas our batch model predicts 60 7 mj kg n for the same nitrogen removal thus we expect the curves in fig 8 to be downshifted for continuous operation and intend to adapt the model for continuous operation in future work in addition to identifying optimization opportunities for ecs fig 8 demonstrates tradeoffs between energy input and removal efficiency for ecs and more mature nitrogen removal technologies as we approach larger removal values the slopes of the ecs curves increase reflecting longer operating times due to diminishing mass transfer driving force while we do not consider life cycle impacts in this analysis including embedded energy of electrodes membranes and chemical inputs we consider this preliminary comparison instructive for advancing ecs from concept to practice based on this analysis of operating energy requirements ecs shows promise for further development as a selective nitrogen recovery technique energy requirements for mature technologies are points in fig 8 illustrating that energy profiles for removal technologies may show curvature effects of removal efficiency and displacement effects of concentration like the ecs curves for example while nitrification is most commonly used to treat municipal wastewater sperling 2007 it has also been used to treat urine 5 000 9 000 mg n l udert and wächter 2012 energy consumption may differ across several orders of magnitude to adequately compare nitrogen removal and recovery technologies and provide maximal value to diverse stakeholders e g utility operators regulators users of value added products variations in energy consumption with influent concentration and removal recovery efficiency should be documented for all technologies by combining experiments and fundamental models in this work we advance nitrogen recovery toward informed practical implementation 4 conclusions based on complementary experimental and modeling data obtained from performing electrochemical nitrogen stripping across a broad range of operating parameters the following conclusions can be drawn ecs can produce consistent concentration recovery and removal profiles across a range of environmentally relevant temperatures 15 35 c recovery efficiency increases with temperature and the overall magnitude of achieved recovery is on par with other electrochemical recovery methods high removal 73 and recovery 65 efficiencies over three orders of magnitude of influent tan were observed as influent strength decreased a growing gap was observed between the timescales of removal and recovery with recovery taking longer to achieve than removal a mass transfer model for nitrogen recovery in the ecs process was proposed and solved analytically the model summarized nitrogen transport as two irreversible steps for which mass transfer coefficients across the cem and gpm were fitted to experimental data while hac the mass transfer coefficient from anode to cathode chamber remained relatively constant with temperature hct the mass transfer coefficient from cathode to trap chamber exhibited a 55 increase as a result of this work electrochemical stripping continues to mature from concept to informed practice and provides

author three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy has been widely used for the analysis of water contaminants however the problems of weak signals and overlapping fluorescence peaks remain unresolved in this work we studied the impact of absorption on the spectral shape of fluorescence and found that it is a major cause of overlapping peaks and weak signals an approach is proposed to purify fluorescent signals and enhance fluorescence signatures based on the theory of fluorescence quantum yield using this theory the problems of noise amplification and singularity points were identified and an optimization algorithm was proposed related to wiener filtering for practical application to multiple compounds three overlapping cases were discussed theoretically the effectiveness of this procedure in subsequent parallel factor analysis was assessed and compared with original data by conducting experiments with six typical compounds and real water samples the results indicate that overlapping along the excitation wavelength axis can be reduced despite the existence of multiple compounds and the sensitivity of weak fluorescent signals can be significantly improved the proposed method can enhance fluorescence signatures for the separation and analysis of fluorescent components in water contaminants graphical abstract image 1 keywords excitation emission matrix effects of absorption fluorescence quantum yield qualitative analysis fluorescence signatures 1 introduction fluorescence spectroscopy has been proposed as a method for monitoring water quality owing to high sensitivity and selectivity henderson et al 2009 the most significant development in recent years has been the ability to simultaneously scan a wide range of excitation and emission wavelengths to generate a fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem baker et al 2003 also called a three dimensional spectrum three dimensional fluorescence spectra have been widely used as the fingerprint information of compounds in the analysis of organic contaminants baker 2001 boehme and coble 2000 chen et al 2003 coble 1996 coble and del castillo 1998 and identification of pollution sources qing et al 2016 however despite the widespread use of three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy problems such as weak signals and overlapping fluorescence peaks in various compounds remain unresolved which limits the use of fluorescence spectroscopy for analytical purposes various methods have been used to separate and analyze overlapping fluorescent components such as digital image processing chen et al 2016 wang et al 2016 wavelet decomposition yu et al 2014a zhai et al 2012 independent component analysis ica yu et al 2013 parallel factor analysis parafac bro 1997 wei and jin 2015 yu et al 2011a zhang et al 2011 non negative matrix factorization yang et al 2015 yu et al 2011b 2014b k means algorithm savić et al 2013 etc however these methods consider mathematical statistics rather than physical insights and theoretical analysis of these effects when fluorescence peaks overlap significantly it is difficult to separate them by only mathematical methods because their inherent feature parameter vectors are close to each other there are potential problems such as confusion errors and negative values in separated components since the spectra themselves are not improved in fact according to the principle of fluorescence generation fluorescence is proportional to the light transmitted through the cuvette and therefore is proportional to 1 10 a kasparek and smyk 2018 thus there are two independent sources of information in the measured eem fluorescence quantum yield fluorescent properties and absorbance absorptive properties the absorption coefficient 1 10 a which is a multiplication factor in the measured eem promotes the weakening of fluorescent signals with low absorbance and causes the overlapping of fluorescence peaks along the excitation wavelength axis when the absorptive bands overlap detailed discussion in section 2 3 as a result the advantages of the information in the three dimensional fluorescence spectra have not been fully realized for the discrimination and analysis of various compounds it is necessary to eliminate the effect of absorption on three dimensional spectra for the enhancement and separation of fluorescent signatures although many studies have focused on correcting the inner effect for quantitative analyses of the concentration of components holland et al 1977 kasparek and smyk 2018 parker and barnes 1957 the effect of absorption on fluorescence spectral shapes and its qualitative analysis in eem data were rarely mentioned in this work a measurement system was designed for the simultaneous collection of the absorptive and fluorescent spectra of water samples an enhancement approach was proposed by correcting the effects of absorption on fluorescent signatures in eem based on the theory of fluorescence quantum yield on that basis the problems of noise amplification and singularity points were addressed by an optimization algorithm related to the principle of wiener filtering then the condition with multiple compounds was analyzed and discussed through three cases the effect of enhanced processing on subsequent parafac analysis was assessed and compared with original data improved analysis results were obtained by conducting experiments with six typical organic chemicals and real samples of tap and river water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup in order to study and correct the absorption impact on eem measurement fluorescence and absorption spectra are both needed for one measurement nawara et al nawara and waluk 2017 proposed that simultaneous absorbance and fluorescence emission measurement was useful to resolve the misalignment between the spectrophotometer and spectrofluorometer however a commercial spectrofluorometer equipped with three detectors was used in their work which resulted in a complex structure in the present study this was improved using a y type optical fiber the system for simultaneous absorbance and eem measurement was designed and constructed with four basic components a light source monochromator sample cell and an optical receiver fig 1 a 150 w xenon lamp xbo 150 w 4 osram and monochromator 7ims3011b saifan photoelectric instrument china with 1200 grooves mm 1 gratings blazed at 300 nm were used to produce a single excitation light a spectrometer maya2000pro ocean optics usa received fluorescence or transmission light at different times from the trunk side of the y type optical fiber a quartz cuvette was held in a four way holder cuv all ocean optics usa with mirrors baffles and lens connected to the y type optical fiber in both the vertical direction and emergent direction the path of light can be switched by baffles from one direction to another three dimensional fluorescence spectra were measured in the vertical direction with excitations from 240 to 600 nm and emission wavelengths from 240 to 700 nm in steps of 5 nm and 2 nm respectively in the emergent direction the light was collected for absorption spectra from 200 to 600 nm all spectral data were stored and displayed on a computer all computations were performed using matlab the mathworks inc natick ma usa r2013a parafac models were constructed with the n way toolbox www models kvl dk andersson and bro 2000 2 2 water samples three typical contaminants lignin phenol and rhodamine b and three natural organic compounds tryptophan tyrosine and humic acid were selected and their aqueous solutions were prepared to collect their three dimensional fluorescence and absorption spectra rhodamine b is a common carcinogenic dye often found in rivers near printing and dyeing mills phenol is extensively used in industry as chemistry material while lignin is the main component of wastewater produced by paper mills tryptophan tyrosine and humic acid are common fluorescent compounds in nature aqueous solutions of each chemical were prepared by dissolving a certain amount of reagent shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co ltd china in deionized water from a milli q water purification system millipore billerica ma usa five different concentrations of each chemical were prepared in the appropriate concentration ranges determined using spectral experiments and the actual state of water environments specifically because instrument response differs in various measurement systems some initial experiments must first be performed before determining the concentration ranges of the standard compounds to be studied in measurements the fluorescence intensity and absorbance should be large enough for detection without exceeding the response range of instruments the actual state of water environments with different components should also be considered which can ensure the rationalization of the determined ranges the chemical types and purities of the six standard compounds their concentrations and number of samples are listed in table 1 in addition river water samples were obtained near wastewater discharges of a dyeing and printing plant in zhejiang province china the tap water samples were taken from building 3 yuquan campus zhejiang university china the numbers of samples are also listed in table 1 2 3 enhancement of fluorescence signatures based on the theory of fluorescence quantum yield fluorescence is related to photoluminescence hence the intensity of fluorescence is proportional to the real intensity of the excitation light and fluorescence quantum yield in theory 1 f λ e x λ e m ϕ λ e x λ e m e 0 λ e x 1 10 a λ e x where φ λ ex λ em is the map of the fluorescence quantum yield which depends on the excitation and emission wavelengths λ ex and λ em because it is related to the distribution of vibrational energy levels in the ground state and the transition probabilities of each energy level in excited states f e 0 and a are the fluorescence intensity incident light intensity and absorbance respectively to eliminate the effects associated with the dependence of instrumental component efficiency on wavelength both the excitation and emission intensities of the three dimensional fluorescence spectra were corrected following coble et al 1993 then equation 1 was modified as follows 2 f λ e x λ e m k φ λ e x λ e m 1 10 a λ e x where k is a constant coefficient and f is the intensity of the corrected fluorescence spectra which is related only to the properties of the compound from equation 2 the corrected fluorescence spectra include two sources of information fluorescent features and absorptive features as a characteristic of absorption spectroscopy technology the absorptive bands of various compounds usually overlap because of poor specificity in this case the experimentally measured fluorescence peaks of various compounds will be affected by the overlapping of absorptive bands along the axis of excitation wavelengths since this is the second multiplication factor in equation 2 similarly fluorescent signals will also become weaker when the absorbance is close to zero according to equation 2 therefore we collected both the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the samples and then divided the intensity of the corrected fluorescence spectra f by the second multiplication factor in each emission spectrum to reduce or eliminate the effect of absorption as follows 3 f λ e x λ e m f λ e x λ e m 1 10 a λ e x k ϕ λ e x λ e m for any given compound the f λ ex λ em is proportional to the fluorescence quantum yield at the given values of excitation and emission wavelengths i e the relative quantum yields of fluorescence in this case the fluorescence signatures in eem data can be enhanced and become distinct using this approach without the effect of absorption for further modeling and analysis 2 4 an optimization algorithm based on the principle of wiener filtering theoretically division operations can be used to enhance fluorescence signatures but also causes some problems the noise signals in eem data are amplified at excitation wavelengths where the absorbance is too low when the absorbance is equal to or close to zero the denominator in equation 3 will be zero which forms a singular point to avoid these problems we modified this method for optimization as we know wiener filtering is better than inverse filtering because it handles noise signals at singular points unlike direct division operation for convenience we define the divisor in equation 3 as the operator μ λ ex λ em similar to inverse filtering 4 f λ e x λ e m f λ e x λ e m 1 1 10 a λ e x f λ e x λ e m m λ e x λ e m according to the principle of wiener filtering we modified the operator as follows 5 m λ e x λ e m 1 10 a λ e x 1 10 a λ e x 2 p n λ e x λ e m p f λ e x λ e m where the p n λ ex λ em and p f λ ex λ em are the power spectra of the noise and signal respectively then the enhanced three dimensional fluorescence spectra can be modified as 6 f λ e x λ e m f λ e x λ e m m λ e x λ e m f λ e x λ e m 1 10 a λ e x 1 10 a λ e x 2 p n λ e x λ e m p f λ e x λ e m in this case if the noise is close to zero the m λ ex λ em will be the same as m λ ex λ em when there is a large noise at some points the denominator will be larger than usual hence the noise in f λ ex λ em can be completely suppressed when the absorbance is equal to or close to zero the numerator may be zero but the denominator is not zero because of the addition of a nonzero number thus singular points can also be eliminated by optimization 2 5 analysis of the case of multiple compounds in the case of only one compound the enhancement approach with the optimization algorithm can reduce the effect of absorption and enhance fluorescence signatures without amplifying noise and singular points however in the presence of multiple compounds further analysis is needed equation 3 for enhancement is written as 7 f λ e x λ e m k φ 1 λ e x λ e m 1 10 a 1 λ e x φ 2 λ e x λ e m 1 10 a 2 λ e x φ n λ e x λ e m 1 10 a n λ e x 1 10 a 1 λ e x a 2 λ e x a n λ e x where n is the serial number of the compound for convenience we discuss the case of two compounds everything else follows the same way for a certain pair of excitation and emission wavelengths λ ex0 λ em0 three cases are considered that deal with fluorescence quantum yield and absorbance values 1 a 1 λ ex0 and φ 1 λ ex0 λ em0 are equal to zero while a 2 λ ex0 and φ 2 λ ex0 λ em0 are nonzero which means that at point of λ ex0 λ em0 the first compound neither absorbs ultraviolet light nor emits fluorescence the f λ ex0 λ em0 is the same as in the case with only the second compound 8 f λ e x 0 λ e m 0 k φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 1 10 a 2 λ e x 0 1 10 a 2 λ e x 0 k φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 it is clear that the enhancement approach for a certain compound e g the second compound in equation 8 is not affected when the absorbance of other compounds is zero at a certain point λ ex0 λ em0 2 φ 1 λ ex0 λ em0 is zero whereas a λ ex0 a λ ex0 and φ 2 λ ex0 λ em0 are nonzero when two compounds absorb ultraviolet light simultaneously however only the second compound emits fluorescence the f λ ex0 λ em0 becomes smaller than the case with only the second compound because the absorbance of the first compound a 1 λ ex0 also exists in the denominator of equation 9 the larger the a 1 λ ex0 is the smaller the f λ ex0 λ em0 it will be 9 f λ e x 0 λ e m 0 k φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 1 10 a 2 λ e x 0 1 10 a 1 λ e x 0 a 2 λ e x 0 k φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 3 a 1 λ ex0 a 2 λ ex0 φ 2 λ ex0 λ em0 and φ 2 λ ex0 λ em0 are all nonzero when two compounds emit fluorescence simultaneously at this point λex0 λem0 the fluorescence peaks of the two compounds overlap in this case of overlapping each part in the f λ ex0 λ em0 of individual compounds decreases relative to the case with only one compound as shown below 10 f λ e x 0 λ e m 0 k φ 1 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 1 10 a 1 λ e x 0 φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 1 10 a 2 λ e x 0 1 10 a 1 λ e x 0 a 2 λ e x 0 obviously the more serious the overlap of fluorescence between different compounds at a certain point λ ex0 λ em0 the more f λ ex0 λ em0 will decrease by comprehensive analysis of the first and the third cases the overlap between fluorescence can be suppressed along the axis of excitation wavelengths after the enhancement process as shown in fig 2 a this involves an extreme condition where overlapping occurs in only one direction along the excitation wavelength axis at a certain emission wavelength the long vertical dotted box in fig 2 a the f λ ex0 λ em0 remains unchanged when it corresponds to the first case while the f λ ex0 λ em0 decreases at the points where the overlapping exists third case as a result the fluorescence peaks of different compounds become more distinct and sharper along the axis of excitation wavelengths through the enhancement in another extreme case shown in fig 2 b the fluorescence peaks of various compounds spread out along the emission axis and overlap at some wavelengths which agrees with the second and third cases mentioned above for one compound in each of these two cases because of the same denominator used in equations 9 and 10 f λ ex0 λ em0 decreases with the same ratio at a fixed excitation wavelength regardless of whether point λ ex0 λ em0 is in the overlapping region or not thus the fluorescence features shapes and positions of fluorescence peaks along the emission axis are retained as they are not affected in this direction in reality the overlapping of fluorescence peaks between different compounds can be analyzed from the two orthogonal directions respectively on that basis 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhancement results of the six standard compounds as spectral pre treatment the effects associated with the wavelength dependence of instrumental component efficiency on the eem data of six chemicals were corrected following coble et al 1993 then rayleigh and raman scattering were processed according to hu et al 2018 pretreated three dimensional fluorescence spectra of six standard chemicals are shown in fig 3 a f to illustrate the positional relationship between their fluorescent peaks we plotted them together in fig 3 g the fluorescent peaks of tyrosine and phenol seriously overlapped while the spectral shapes of humic acid and lignin are confusing owing to the weakening of signals which makes practical modeling and analysis difficult for further processing the absorptive spectra of the six compounds were measured and shown in fig 4 their absorptive bands seriously overlapped at 250 300 nm their peak positions were also close to each other which confirms that the effect of absorptive features aggravates the overlap between fluorescent peaks along the excitation wavelength axis to eliminate the impact of absorptive bands and handle singular points and amplified noise signals we processed the eem data from the six compounds using the method described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 to illustrate the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm the three dimensional fluorescence spectra before and after optimization are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively in fig 5 weak fluorescence signatures were enhanced especially for humic acid and lignin however because of the direct division operation there were many singular points and amplified noise signals remained in contrast fig 6 shows that the smoothness of eem data improved significantly while the shapes and positions of fluorescence peaks were unchanged thus it was confirmed that the optimization algorithm can eliminate noise and singular points without changing the appearance and features of fluorescence peaks for ease of comparison the enhanced three dimensional fluorescence spectra of the six compounds after optimization were plotted in fig 6 g compared with fig 3 g the distance of fluorescent peaks between tyrosine and phenol increased indicating that the impact of overlapping from the absorptive bands was eliminated and the real fluorescence signatures were revealed the weak fluorescent signals of humic acid and lignin were intensified and became distinct so that the fluorescent peak of lignin λex 525 nm λem 550 nm can be recognized as a distinctive feature therefore the proposed method separated and enhanced the fluorescence peaks of different compounds to some extent along the excitation axis without the impact of absorption 3 2 parafac analysis of the six standard compounds to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach to enhancing fluorescence signatures for qualitative analysis parafac analysis was performed on six organic chemicals the number of samples are listed in table 1 for comparison the eem data were analyzed before and after successive enhancement and optimization and the loading matrixes of components were plotted in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a and b the six components represent rhodamine b tryptophan phenol tyrosine lignin and humic acid and rhodamine b humic acid tyrosine tryptophan phenol and lignin in c and d in fig 7 c and d the sixth component related to lignin in the black boxes at 550 nm was enhanced considerably which indicates that the sensitivity and distinction of weak fluorescent signals was improved thus more useful and noticeable information can be utilized in practical modeling and analysis after enhancement process comparison of fig 7 a and c shows that the distance between the two peaks of components associated with phenol and tyrosine in the red boxes increased after successive enhancement and optimization thus the proposed method facilitated the separation of the closest components in parafac analysis in brief by eliminating the absorption effect and enhancing fluorescence signatures using the proposed method more noticeable and distinct components can be obtained in parafac analysis 3 3 analysis of water quality in tap and river to confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method for real water samples and other practical application we conducted experiments to analyze the quality of tap and river water near the wastewater drainage of a dyeing and printing plant their absorptive spectra and pretreated three dimensional fluorescence spectra are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 a and b their excitation and emission matrixes data were processed using the proposed approach to enhance the fluorescence signatures as shown in fig 9 c and d it was found that their fluorescent peaks became sharper and more distinct for further analysis after processing even though there are multiple compounds in real water samples in the parafac analysis of tap and river water samples the loading of components were plotted in fig 10 and were recognized as rhodamine b humic acid and tryptophan like compounds comparison of the loadings before and after the proposed successive processing showed that the components were more distinct in fig 10 c and d whereas in the component associated with rhodamine b in the black box in fig 10 a stronger false peaks were observed as well as more severe

author three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy has been widely used for the analysis of water contaminants however the problems of weak signals and overlapping fluorescence peaks remain unresolved in this work we studied the impact of absorption on the spectral shape of fluorescence and found that it is a major cause of overlapping peaks and weak signals an approach is proposed to purify fluorescent signals and enhance fluorescence signatures based on the theory of fluorescence quantum yield using this theory the problems of noise amplification and singularity points were identified and an optimization algorithm was proposed related to wiener filtering for practical application to multiple compounds three overlapping cases were discussed theoretically the effectiveness of this procedure in subsequent parallel factor analysis was assessed and compared with original data by conducting experiments with six typical compounds and real water samples the results indicate that overlapping along the excitation wavelength axis can be reduced despite the existence of multiple compounds and the sensitivity of weak fluorescent signals can be significantly improved the proposed method can enhance fluorescence signatures for the separation and analysis of fluorescent components in water contaminants graphical abstract image 1 keywords excitation emission matrix effects of absorption fluorescence quantum yield qualitative analysis fluorescence signatures 1 introduction fluorescence spectroscopy has been proposed as a method for monitoring water quality owing to high sensitivity and selectivity henderson et al 2009 the most significant development in recent years has been the ability to simultaneously scan a wide range of excitation and emission wavelengths to generate a fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem baker et al 2003 also called a three dimensional spectrum three dimensional fluorescence spectra have been widely used as the fingerprint information of compounds in the analysis of organic contaminants baker 2001 boehme and coble 2000 chen et al 2003 coble 1996 coble and del castillo 1998 and identification of pollution sources qing et al 2016 however despite the widespread use of three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy problems such as weak signals and overlapping fluorescence peaks in various compounds remain unresolved which limits the use of fluorescence spectroscopy for analytical purposes various methods have been used to separate and analyze overlapping fluorescent components such as digital image processing chen et al 2016 wang et al 2016 wavelet decomposition yu et al 2014a zhai et al 2012 independent component analysis ica yu et al 2013 parallel factor analysis parafac bro 1997 wei and jin 2015 yu et al 2011a zhang et al 2011 non negative matrix factorization yang et al 2015 yu et al 2011b 2014b k means algorithm savić et al 2013 etc however these methods consider mathematical statistics rather than physical insights and theoretical analysis of these effects when fluorescence peaks overlap significantly it is difficult to separate them by only mathematical methods because their inherent feature parameter vectors are close to each other there are potential problems such as confusion errors and negative values in separated components since the spectra themselves are not improved in fact according to the principle of fluorescence generation fluorescence is proportional to the light transmitted through the cuvette and therefore is proportional to 1 10 a kasparek and smyk 2018 thus there are two independent sources of information in the measured eem fluorescence quantum yield fluorescent properties and absorbance absorptive properties the absorption coefficient 1 10 a which is a multiplication factor in the measured eem promotes the weakening of fluorescent signals with low absorbance and causes the overlapping of fluorescence peaks along the excitation wavelength axis when the absorptive bands overlap detailed discussion in section 2 3 as a result the advantages of the information in the three dimensional fluorescence spectra have not been fully realized for the discrimination and analysis of various compounds it is necessary to eliminate the effect of absorption on three dimensional spectra for the enhancement and separation of fluorescent signatures although many studies have focused on correcting the inner effect for quantitative analyses of the concentration of components holland et al 1977 kasparek and smyk 2018 parker and barnes 1957 the effect of absorption on fluorescence spectral shapes and its qualitative analysis in eem data were rarely mentioned in this work a measurement system was designed for the simultaneous collection of the absorptive and fluorescent spectra of water samples an enhancement approach was proposed by correcting the effects of absorption on fluorescent signatures in eem based on the theory of fluorescence quantum yield on that basis the problems of noise amplification and singularity points were addressed by an optimization algorithm related to the principle of wiener filtering then the condition with multiple compounds was analyzed and discussed through three cases the effect of enhanced processing on subsequent parafac analysis was assessed and compared with original data improved analysis results were obtained by conducting experiments with six typical organic chemicals and real samples of tap and river water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup in order to study and correct the absorption impact on eem measurement fluorescence and absorption spectra are both needed for one measurement nawara et al nawara and waluk 2017 proposed that simultaneous absorbance and fluorescence emission measurement was useful to resolve the misalignment between the spectrophotometer and spectrofluorometer however a commercial spectrofluorometer equipped with three detectors was used in their work which resulted in a complex structure in the present study this was improved using a y type optical fiber the system for simultaneous absorbance and eem measurement was designed and constructed with four basic components a light source monochromator sample cell and an optical receiver fig 1 a 150 w xenon lamp xbo 150 w 4 osram and monochromator 7ims3011b saifan photoelectric instrument china with 1200 grooves mm 1 gratings blazed at 300 nm were used to produce a single excitation light a spectrometer maya2000pro ocean optics usa received fluorescence or transmission light at different times from the trunk side of the y type optical fiber a quartz cuvette was held in a four way holder cuv all ocean optics usa with mirrors baffles and lens connected to the y type optical fiber in both the vertical direction and emergent direction the path of light can be switched by baffles from one direction to another three dimensional fluorescence spectra were measured in the vertical direction with excitations from 240 to 600 nm and emission wavelengths from 240 to 700 nm in steps of 5 nm and 2 nm respectively in the emergent direction the light was collected for absorption spectra from 200 to 600 nm all spectral data were stored and displayed on a computer all computations were performed using matlab the mathworks inc natick ma usa r2013a parafac models were constructed with the n way toolbox www models kvl dk andersson and bro 2000 2 2 water samples three typical contaminants lignin phenol and rhodamine b and three natural organic compounds tryptophan tyrosine and humic acid were selected and their aqueous solutions were prepared to collect their three dimensional fluorescence and absorption spectra rhodamine b is a common carcinogenic dye often found in rivers near printing and dyeing mills phenol is extensively used in industry as chemistry material while lignin is the main component of wastewater produced by paper mills tryptophan tyrosine and humic acid are common fluorescent compounds in nature aqueous solutions of each chemical were prepared by dissolving a certain amount of reagent shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co ltd china in deionized water from a milli q water purification system millipore billerica ma usa five different concentrations of each chemical were prepared in the appropriate concentration ranges determined using spectral experiments and the actual state of water environments specifically because instrument response differs in various measurement systems some initial experiments must first be performed before determining the concentration ranges of the standard compounds to be studied in measurements the fluorescence intensity and absorbance should be large enough for detection without exceeding the response range of instruments the actual state of water environments with different components should also be considered which can ensure the rationalization of the determined ranges the chemical types and purities of the six standard compounds their concentrations and number of samples are listed in table 1 in addition river water samples were obtained near wastewater discharges of a dyeing and printing plant in zhejiang province china the tap water samples were taken from building 3 yuquan campus zhejiang university china the numbers of samples are also listed in table 1 2 3 enhancement of fluorescence signatures based on the theory of fluorescence quantum yield fluorescence is related to photoluminescence hence the intensity of fluorescence is proportional to the real intensity of the excitation light and fluorescence quantum yield in theory 1 f λ e x λ e m ϕ λ e x λ e m e 0 λ e x 1 10 a λ e x where φ λ ex λ em is the map of the fluorescence quantum yield which depends on the excitation and emission wavelengths λ ex and λ em because it is related to the distribution of vibrational energy levels in the ground state and the transition probabilities of each energy level in excited states f e 0 and a are the fluorescence intensity incident light intensity and absorbance respectively to eliminate the effects associated with the dependence of instrumental component efficiency on wavelength both the excitation and emission intensities of the three dimensional fluorescence spectra were corrected following coble et al 1993 then equation 1 was modified as follows 2 f λ e x λ e m k φ λ e x λ e m 1 10 a λ e x where k is a constant coefficient and f is the intensity of the corrected fluorescence spectra which is related only to the properties of the compound from equation 2 the corrected fluorescence spectra include two sources of information fluorescent features and absorptive features as a characteristic of absorption spectroscopy technology the absorptive bands of various compounds usually overlap because of poor specificity in this case the experimentally measured fluorescence peaks of various compounds will be affected by the overlapping of absorptive bands along the axis of excitation wavelengths since this is the second multiplication factor in equation 2 similarly fluorescent signals will also become weaker when the absorbance is close to zero according to equation 2 therefore we collected both the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the samples and then divided the intensity of the corrected fluorescence spectra f by the second multiplication factor in each emission spectrum to reduce or eliminate the effect of absorption as follows 3 f λ e x λ e m f λ e x λ e m 1 10 a λ e x k ϕ λ e x λ e m for any given compound the f λ ex λ em is proportional to the fluorescence quantum yield at the given values of excitation and emission wavelengths i e the relative quantum yields of fluorescence in this case the fluorescence signatures in eem data can be enhanced and become distinct using this approach without the effect of absorption for further modeling and analysis 2 4 an optimization algorithm based on the principle of wiener filtering theoretically division operations can be used to enhance fluorescence signatures but also causes some problems the noise signals in eem data are amplified at excitation wavelengths where the absorbance is too low when the absorbance is equal to or close to zero the denominator in equation 3 will be zero which forms a singular point to avoid these problems we modified this method for optimization as we know wiener filtering is better than inverse filtering because it handles noise signals at singular points unlike direct division operation for convenience we define the divisor in equation 3 as the operator μ λ ex λ em similar to inverse filtering 4 f λ e x λ e m f λ e x λ e m 1 1 10 a λ e x f λ e x λ e m m λ e x λ e m according to the principle of wiener filtering we modified the operator as follows 5 m λ e x λ e m 1 10 a λ e x 1 10 a λ e x 2 p n λ e x λ e m p f λ e x λ e m where the p n λ ex λ em and p f λ ex λ em are the power spectra of the noise and signal respectively then the enhanced three dimensional fluorescence spectra can be modified as 6 f λ e x λ e m f λ e x λ e m m λ e x λ e m f λ e x λ e m 1 10 a λ e x 1 10 a λ e x 2 p n λ e x λ e m p f λ e x λ e m in this case if the noise is close to zero the m λ ex λ em will be the same as m λ ex λ em when there is a large noise at some points the denominator will be larger than usual hence the noise in f λ ex λ em can be completely suppressed when the absorbance is equal to or close to zero the numerator may be zero but the denominator is not zero because of the addition of a nonzero number thus singular points can also be eliminated by optimization 2 5 analysis of the case of multiple compounds in the case of only one compound the enhancement approach with the optimization algorithm can reduce the effect of absorption and enhance fluorescence signatures without amplifying noise and singular points however in the presence of multiple compounds further analysis is needed equation 3 for enhancement is written as 7 f λ e x λ e m k φ 1 λ e x λ e m 1 10 a 1 λ e x φ 2 λ e x λ e m 1 10 a 2 λ e x φ n λ e x λ e m 1 10 a n λ e x 1 10 a 1 λ e x a 2 λ e x a n λ e x where n is the serial number of the compound for convenience we discuss the case of two compounds everything else follows the same way for a certain pair of excitation and emission wavelengths λ ex0 λ em0 three cases are considered that deal with fluorescence quantum yield and absorbance values 1 a 1 λ ex0 and φ 1 λ ex0 λ em0 are equal to zero while a 2 λ ex0 and φ 2 λ ex0 λ em0 are nonzero which means that at point of λ ex0 λ em0 the first compound neither absorbs ultraviolet light nor emits fluorescence the f λ ex0 λ em0 is the same as in the case with only the second compound 8 f λ e x 0 λ e m 0 k φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 1 10 a 2 λ e x 0 1 10 a 2 λ e x 0 k φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 it is clear that the enhancement approach for a certain compound e g the second compound in equation 8 is not affected when the absorbance of other compounds is zero at a certain point λ ex0 λ em0 2 φ 1 λ ex0 λ em0 is zero whereas a λ ex0 a λ ex0 and φ 2 λ ex0 λ em0 are nonzero when two compounds absorb ultraviolet light simultaneously however only the second compound emits fluorescence the f λ ex0 λ em0 becomes smaller than the case with only the second compound because the absorbance of the first compound a 1 λ ex0 also exists in the denominator of equation 9 the larger the a 1 λ ex0 is the smaller the f λ ex0 λ em0 it will be 9 f λ e x 0 λ e m 0 k φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 1 10 a 2 λ e x 0 1 10 a 1 λ e x 0 a 2 λ e x 0 k φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 3 a 1 λ ex0 a 2 λ ex0 φ 2 λ ex0 λ em0 and φ 2 λ ex0 λ em0 are all nonzero when two compounds emit fluorescence simultaneously at this point λex0 λem0 the fluorescence peaks of the two compounds overlap in this case of overlapping each part in the f λ ex0 λ em0 of individual compounds decreases relative to the case with only one compound as shown below 10 f λ e x 0 λ e m 0 k φ 1 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 1 10 a 1 λ e x 0 φ 2 λ e x 0 λ e m 0 1 10 a 2 λ e x 0 1 10 a 1 λ e x 0 a 2 λ e x 0 obviously the more serious the overlap of fluorescence between different compounds at a certain point λ ex0 λ em0 the more f λ ex0 λ em0 will decrease by comprehensive analysis of the first and the third cases the overlap between fluorescence can be suppressed along the axis of excitation wavelengths after the enhancement process as shown in fig 2 a this involves an extreme condition where overlapping occurs in only one direction along the excitation wavelength axis at a certain emission wavelength the long vertical dotted box in fig 2 a the f λ ex0 λ em0 remains unchanged when it corresponds to the first case while the f λ ex0 λ em0 decreases at the points where the overlapping exists third case as a result the fluorescence peaks of different compounds become more distinct and sharper along the axis of excitation wavelengths through the enhancement in another extreme case shown in fig 2 b the fluorescence peaks of various compounds spread out along the emission axis and overlap at some wavelengths which agrees with the second and third cases mentioned above for one compound in each of these two cases because of the same denominator used in equations 9 and 10 f λ ex0 λ em0 decreases with the same ratio at a fixed excitation wavelength regardless of whether point λ ex0 λ em0 is in the overlapping region or not thus the fluorescence features shapes and positions of fluorescence peaks along the emission axis are retained as they are not affected in this direction in reality the overlapping of fluorescence peaks between different compounds can be analyzed from the two orthogonal directions respectively on that basis 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhancement results of the six standard compounds as spectral pre treatment the effects associated with the wavelength dependence of instrumental component efficiency on the eem data of six chemicals were corrected following coble et al 1993 then rayleigh and raman scattering were processed according to hu et al 2018 pretreated three dimensional fluorescence spectra of six standard chemicals are shown in fig 3 a f to illustrate the positional relationship between their fluorescent peaks we plotted them together in fig 3 g the fluorescent peaks of tyrosine and phenol seriously overlapped while the spectral shapes of humic acid and lignin are confusing owing to the weakening of signals which makes practical modeling and analysis difficult for further processing the absorptive spectra of the six compounds were measured and shown in fig 4 their absorptive bands seriously overlapped at 250 300 nm their peak positions were also close to each other which confirms that the effect of absorptive features aggravates the overlap between fluorescent peaks along the excitation wavelength axis to eliminate the impact of absorptive bands and handle singular points and amplified noise signals we processed the eem data from the six compounds using the method described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 to illustrate the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm the three dimensional fluorescence spectra before and after optimization are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively in fig 5 weak fluorescence signatures were enhanced especially for humic acid and lignin however because of the direct division operation there were many singular points and amplified noise signals remained in contrast fig 6 shows that the smoothness of eem data improved significantly while the shapes and positions of fluorescence peaks were unchanged thus it was confirmed that the optimization algorithm can eliminate noise and singular points without changing the appearance and features of fluorescence peaks for ease of comparison the enhanced three dimensional fluorescence spectra of the six compounds after optimization were plotted in fig 6 g compared with fig 3 g the distance of fluorescent peaks between tyrosine and phenol increased indicating that the impact of overlapping from the absorptive bands was eliminated and the real fluorescence signatures were revealed the weak fluorescent signals of humic acid and lignin were intensified and became distinct so that the fluorescent peak of lignin λex 525 nm λem 550 nm can be recognized as a distinctive feature therefore the proposed method separated and enhanced the fluorescence peaks of different compounds to some extent along the excitation axis without the impact of absorption 3 2 parafac analysis of the six standard compounds to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach to enhancing fluorescence signatures for qualitative analysis parafac analysis was performed on six organic chemicals the number of samples are listed in table 1 for comparison the eem data were analyzed before and after successive enhancement and optimization and the loading matrixes of components were plotted in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a and b the six components represent rhodamine b tryptophan phenol tyrosine lignin and humic acid and rhodamine b humic acid tyrosine tryptophan phenol and lignin in c and d in fig 7 c and d the sixth component related to lignin in the black boxes at 550 nm was enhanced considerably which indicates that the sensitivity and distinction of weak fluorescent signals was improved thus more useful and noticeable information can be utilized in practical modeling and analysis after enhancement process comparison of fig 7 a and c shows that the distance between the two peaks of components associated with phenol and tyrosine in the red boxes increased after successive enhancement and optimization thus the proposed method facilitated the separation of the closest components in parafac analysis in brief by eliminating the absorption effect and enhancing fluorescence signatures using the proposed method more noticeable and distinct components can be obtained in parafac analysis 3 3 analysis of water quality in tap and river to confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method for real water samples and other practical application we conducted experiments to analyze the quality of tap and river water near the wastewater drainage of a dyeing and printing plant their absorptive spectra and pretreated three dimensional fluorescence spectra are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 a and b their excitation and emission matrixes data were processed using the proposed approach to enhance the fluorescence signatures as shown in fig 9 c and d it was found that their fluorescent peaks became sharper and more distinct for further analysis after processing even though there are multiple compounds in real water samples in the parafac analysis of tap and river water samples the loading of components were plotted in fig 10 and were recognized as rhodamine b humic acid and tryptophan like compounds comparison of the loadings before and after the proposed successive processing showed that the components were more distinct in fig 10 c and d whereas in the component associated with rhodamine b in the black box in fig 10 a stronger false peaks were observed as well as more severe negative loadings in fig 10 a and b this indicates that the proposed method of enhancing fluorescence signatures has the potential to analyze various compounds distinctly by sharpening and separating fluorescence peaks in real water environments 4 conclusion in this study we proposed a novel approach to enhance the fluorescence signatures and improve the capacity to distinguish various compounds by correcting the impact of absorptive factors on eem data the equation for enhancement was advanced by a division operation based on the theory of the relative quantum yield of fluorescence next an optimization algorithm was proposed to handle the noise amplification and singular points introduced in the previous step related to the principle of wiener filtering three cases of overlapping

18368,contamination of potable groundwater by pathogenic viruses from on site wastewater treatment systems owts poses a serious health risk this study investigated the attenuation and transport of rotavirus bacteriophage ms2 and dna labelled glycoprotein coated silica nanoparticles dgsnp in 2 intact cores of silt loam over gravels dosed with wastewater from an owts at 3 53 l day to simulate a worst case scenario experiments were conducted under saturated conditions the results from 6 experiments demonstrated that the rotavirus and dgsnp reductions were very similar and markedly greater than the ms2 reduction this was reflected in the peak concentrations relative mass recoveries and temporal and spatial reduction rates for a given log10 reduction the estimated soil depth required for ms2 was over twice that required for rotavirus and dgsnp this is the first study in which dgsnp was used as a rotavirus surrogate in soil under wastewater applications consistent with previous studies dgsnp showed promise at mimicking rotavirus attenuation and transport in porous media the results suggest dgsnp could be used to assess the attenuation capacity of subsurface media to rotavirus however dgsnp is not conservative and will underestimate the setback distances required for rotavirus reductions by 3 on the other hand separation distances determined using the rotavirus parameters and criteria but based on ms2 attenuation can be too conservative in some subsurface media to determine safe and realistic separation distances it would be beneficial and complementary to apply both conservative virus surrogate using ms2 bacteriophage and representative but non conservative new virus surrogates using biomolecule modified silica nanoparticles graphical abstract image 1 keywords rotavirus surrogate on site wastewater treatment system groundwater separation distance 1 introduction contamination of potable groundwater from on site wastewater treatment systems owts is a major health concern worldwide the contamination risk is particularly high when drinking water wells are located down gradient of and in close proximity to owts septic tank effluent can contain many potentially harmful contaminants including disease causing microorganisms each year in the united states contaminated groundwater causes almost half of the waterborne disease outbreaks and owts are believed to cause most of these outbreaks gerba 1999 many outbreaks associated with contaminated groundwater are caused by viral agents gerba 1999 some viral disease outbreaks have been traced to the consumption of groundwater contaminated by sewage from owts keswick and gerba 1980 cogger 1988 borchardt et al 2011 wallender et al 2014 human enteric viruses are particularly problematic unlike bacteria and protozoa viruses are not readily filtered out by subsurface media due to their extremely small sizes 100 nm compared with enteric bacteria enteric viruses have higher infection risks haas et al 1993 and they can survive for much longer periods who 2011 the risk of waterborne viral infection is commonly assessed by using rotavirus as a model because ingesting a single rotavirus particle can cause illness graham et al 1987 rotavirus is the leading cause of severe childhood gastroenteritis dose response estimations indicate that the maximum allowable concentration for rotavirus in drinking water is 2 22 10 7 particles l to reduce the risk of infection to 10 4 person year regli et al 1991 rotavirus shedding rates from infected individuals can be as high as 1012 rotavirus particles g of faeces gerba 2000 guardabassi et al 2003 christensen 1995 walter 2000 charles et al 2003 and virus shedding can continue for up to 30 days guardabassi et al 2003 thus when a member of a household with an owts is infected with rotavirus the rotavirus concentrations in the septic tank effluent can be extremely high up to 8 1010 rotavirus particles l during the peak shedding period and 106 rotavirus particles l 30 days after the peak period charles et al 2003 rotavirus is relatively stable and it can persist in groundwater for up to 7 months espinosa et al 2008 sometimes it is detected in potable groundwater bradbury et al 2013 and causes disease outbreaks hopkins et al 1985 kukkula et al 1997 given its high infectivity prevalence and persistence the maximum allowable concentration for rotavirus in drinking water has been used to determine separation distances for groundwater protection schijven et al 2006 moore et al 2010 blaschke et al 2016 subsurface media act as natural filters and they can remove faecal contaminants through attachment straining and inactivation processes schijven et al 2017 bradford et al 2015 given adequate separation distances sufficient virus reductions can be achieved by natural attenuation processes in subsurface media so that the quality of the receiving water is acceptable for consumption in new zealand for example on the canterbury plains and in many parts of the world many owts are constructed on alluvial plains where free draining stony alluvial soils are widespread the presence of preferential flow paths and macropores render free draining stony soils vulnerable to microbial leaching which poses a risk to the quality of the underlying groundwater little is known about rotavirus removal in soils underlying owts fields and only limited relevant information is available from experiments conducted with bacteriophages which is summarised in a review by pang 2009 given their different physiochemical properties e g size surface charge and hydrophobicity bacteriophages may not be representative of rotavirus in terms of its attenuation and transport in subsurface media indeed it has been found that ms2 bacteriophage ms2 the most widely used traditional virus surrogate could differ from rotavirus in their reduction in porous media by a few orders of magnitude in a study involving slow sand filters wang et al 2016 observed a 5 log10 reduction in the rotavirus concentration after 31 days but only a 1 2 log10 reduction in the ms2 concentration after 42 days arraj et al 2005 reported a mean 9 2 log10 reduction for rotavirus simian sa11 but only a 3 2 log10 reduction for ms2 in laboratory pilot plants of sewage treatment by activated sludge pang et al 2014 found that ms2 over predicted rotavirus vr 2018 strain concentrations by 2 orders of magnitude in filtration experiments conducted with coastal sand in laboratory drainage experiments involving 40 cm of coral sand conditioned with domestic effluent humphries et al 2019 reported a mean 7 0 log10 reduction for rotavirus but only a 5 7 log10 reduction for ms2 in contrast ms2 is not a conservative surrogate for rotavirus in hydrophobic conditions this is because ms2 is highly hydrophobic while rotavirus is hydrophilic farkas et al 2015 in a batch study involving unmodified and modified hydrophobic sand ms2 displayed a markedly greater level of adsorption than rotavirus vr 2018 strain to hydrophobic sand farkas et al 2015 ms2 has been also found to strongly adsorb to plastic experimental apparatus burbery et al 2015 again indicating that ms2 is highly hydrophobic recently novel rotavirus surrogates have been developed using dna labelled protein coated silica nanoparticles pang et al 2014 these include surrogates made from dna labelled 70 nm silica nanoparticles coated with glycoprotein protein a or a α1 microglobulin bikunin precursor the modified particles had sizes zeta potentials pang et al 2014 and hydrophobicity farkas et al 2015 similar to those of rotavirus the surrogates have been validated in filtration experiments involving coastal sand pang et al 2014 and in adsorption experiments involving unmodified and modified hydrophobic sand farkas et al 2015 in both studies the surrogates significantly outperformed ms2 at mimicking rotavirus attenuation and they showed the same magnitude of concentration reductions as rotavirus while preliminary test results suggested that these new surrogates were detectable in environmental waters and wastewaters pang et al 2014 they have not been validated in studies involving the application of wastewater to soils the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the rotavirus attenuation capacity of stony alluvial soils specifically silt loam over gravels following on site wastewater applications and 2 examine the representativeness of ms2 and the newly developed rotavirus surrogate namely dna labelled glycoprotein coated silica nanoparticles dgsnp to rotavirus the implications and limitations of the research findings in the context of vertical separation distances for groundwater protection are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 intact cores intact cores of a lismore soil formation were taken from a research farm near lincoln which is 20 km south of christchurch two intact cores were collected from trenches at a depth of 0 5 1 m below the surface omitting the topsoil to simulate the application of septic effluent to the subsurface the cores were cylindrical 40 cm long and 30 cm wide and they were contained in a polyvinyl chloride pvc outer layer the space between the soil core and the pvc layer was filled with warm petroleum jelly that subsequently solidified to prevent preferential flow down the perimeter of the core despite being extracted from the same field site the cores exhibited natural heterogeneity in their physical properties core 1 comprised sandy silt loam at 0 11 cm sandy loam at 11 19 cm and sandy gravels at 19 40 cm core 2 comprised sandy silt loam at 0 20 cm and sandy gravels at 20 40 cm notably cracks and macropores were visible in the top sandy silt loam layers in both cores especially in core 2 the structure of the intact cores is shown in the computed tomography scan images fig 1 the saturated hydraulic conductivities k s determined from the darcy experiment were 0 53 m day for core 1 and 0 55 m day for core 2 the tops and bottoms of the cores were covered with 2 cm of sterilised coarse sand fine gravels and the bottoms of the cores were additionally covered with perforated pvc plates before the wastewater applications and between the transport experiments deaerated tap water sourced from untreated groundwater was constantly applied to the tops of the cores above the coarse sand fine gravels to maintain saturation 2 2 wastewater application secondary treated wastewater was taken from an oasis 2000 humes 2015 aerated owts which served a family of 4 in fernside canterbury the residence was constantly occupied over the collection period wastewater was collected approximately every 2 weeks from the pump chamber of the wastewater system using a peristaltic pump the wastewater was monitored for ph carbonaceous biological oxygen demand cbod5 total suspended solids tss and dissolved oxygen do at the time of collection as well as during use and storage the wastewater used during the conditioning period and the experiments had an average cbod5 8 5 mg l 3 5 and tss 8 3 mg l 3 8 and it consistently met the secondary wastewater criteria of cbod5 20 mg l and tss 20 mg l as nzs 1547 2012 the mean do and ph remained constant at 6 0 mg l 1 1 and 8 4 0 8 respectively the core saturation apparatus was designed to mimic owts disposal field conditions in the laboratory wastewater was introduced to a reservoir supplying the cores and it was mixed constantly using a magnetic stirrer to prevent it becoming anaerobic and to retain an even distribution of the constituents the wastewater was applied to the top of the core from a distribution system buried within the sterilised fine gravels coarse sand to mimic a primary disposal field the wastewater was evenly distributed through a perforated tube at 5 evenly spaced locations the experimental set up is illustrated in fig 2 the cores were conditioned by applying wastewater for 2 weeks before and during the transport experiments the wastewater was applied at a loading rate of 3 53 l day which equated to a loading rate of 50 mm m2 day and reflects the maximum design loading rate for secondary treated effluent in free draining soils standards new zealand 2012 the design loading rate was delivered evenly in 3 doses every 24 h at 1 176 l dose to mimic an owts pump chamber discharge system 2 3 dosing experiments prior to the experiments the solutions of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp were prepared for injection the rotavirus stock vr 1516 sourced from the american type culture collection atcc was grown in an ma104 cell monolayer using a method adapted from rutjes et al 2009 and li et al 2010 the infected cells were washed and subjected to freeze thaw cycles before storage at 80 c until use the ms2 stock 15597 b1 atcc was propagated using the agar overlay method and salmonella typhimurium wg 49 as the host organism american public health association 2005 the ms2 was scraped from the overlay agar and then separated by shaking and centrifugation followed by filtration weaver et al 2013 the stock was stored at 20 c until use the dgsnp were synthesised by covalently coating α1 acid glycoprotein and a double stranded 302 base pair synthetic dna onto 70 nm carboxylated silica nanoparticles using the method described in pang et al 2014 the dgsnp solution was stored at 4 c until use before the injections the rotavirus and ms2 stocks were thawed overnight at 4 c then they were sonicated in a water bath for 2 min and vortexed after conditioning the cores with wastewater for 14 days 3 experiments were conducted on each core every 2 weeks over a 6 week period to investigate the effect of wastewater conditioning on virus reduction over time during each experiment 1 wastewater dosing event 1 176 l was spiked with potassium bromide kbr rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp table 1 kbr is a non reactive solute tracer and it was used to indicate the movement of the water flow the injection solutions were applied at a rate of 300 ml min to mimic the discharge rate in an owts disposal field time series samples were taken at regular intervals over 8 h table 1 shows the detailed experimental conditions to minimise particle attachment to the experimental apparatus plastic equipment was avoided and glass fittings and tygon tubing were used between the spiking experiments the cores were kept saturated by flushing them with deaerated tap water from untreated groundwater as described in section 2 1 the samples were stored in 100 ml glass schott bottles and they were refrigerated overnight at 4 c in preparation for the ms2 plaque and the kbr analyses the kbr samples were analysed using a bromide ion selective electrode thermo fisher scientific aliquots 200 μl were sub sampled and stored at 80 c for up to 1 week before the rotavirus and dgsnp samples were analysed using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the rotavirus samples were defrosted and rotavirus rna was extracted using the high pure viral nucleic acid kit roche applied science mannheim germany the purified rna was reverse transcribed using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit invitrogen carlsbad ca it was then amplified using a 2 step qpcr and platinum quantitative pcr supermix udg invitrogen adapted from pang et al 2004 the dgsnp samples were defrosted and bovine serum albumin was added to provide some resistance to amplification inhibitors comey et al 1994 for example humic and fulvic acids which are present in wastewater the samples were analysed using a sybr green based 1 step qpcr as described in pang et al 2014 the ms2 samples were analysed using the overlay pour plating method american public health association 2005 with escherichia coli f amp as the host 2 4 data analysis and modelling rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp attenuations were evaluated using relative peak concentrations the spatial reduction rates and relative mass recoveries the relative peak concentration c max c 0 is the peak leachate concentration c max normalised by its input concentration c 0 the spatial reduction rate f was estimated from the log10 reduction in the peak concentration over its transport length x as follows f log10 c max c 0 x the relative mass recovery rb in the samples collected was normalised against that of kbr as follows rb particle mass recovery kbr mass recovery to avoid extrapolation errors we did not estimate the mass recovery from the whole experiment but only that from the samples collected this is because sampling was intermittent and the total volume sampled was only 3 13 of the total leachate volume of an experiment the transport of kbr rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp through the saturated intact soil cores under steady flow was simulated using the cxtfit programme toride et al 1995 that fits an advection dispersion equilibrium model and incorporates a first order reduction term r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x λ c where c is the leachate concentration c c 0 dimensionless t is the time since tracer injection min x is the vertical transport distance along the soil core cm v is the average pore water velocity cm min d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 min r is the retardation factor dimensionless and λ is the temporal reduction rate min 1 the values of v and d were initially estimated from the kbr data then these values were kept constant when optimising the r and λ values of the particles student s t tests were performed on the parameter values to compare paired differences in the mean values between rotavirus and ms2 and between rotavirus and dgsnp a probability value of p 0 05 was considered significantly different 3 results and discussion fig 3 shows the breakthrough curves for the kbr ms2 phage rotavirus and dgsnp concentrations observed during the experiments involving cores 1 and 2 that were carried out every 2 weeks during wastewater conditioning the cxtfit simulated concentration data are also compared with the observed data in fig 3 table 2 presents the parameter values determined from the experiments and table 3 provides the results from the cxtfit modelling the experimental results are presented and discussed in the following sections 3 1 reduction and transport of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp 3 1 1 reduction of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp the relative concentrations fig 3 and relative peak concentrations c max c 0 table 2 tended to be lower for rotavirus and dgsnp compared with those for ms2 the mass recoveries rb of ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp relative to kbr table 2 were variable during all of the experiments involving both cores but the mass recovery of ms2 remained substantially lower compared with those for rotavirus and dgsnp ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp detachment may have occurred in the intact cores during the experiments because of the disruption of the attached particles or competition for binding sites this would have led to the variability observed in the mass recoveries of ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp the experimental results demonstrated that the rotavirus reduction was very similar to the dgsnp reduction but was markedly greater than the ms2 reduction the average peak concentration c max c 0 8 25 10 3 and relative mass recovery rb 6 71 10 2 derived from rotavirus were very similar to those derived from dgsnp c max c 0 9 88 10 3 rb 1 39 10 2 these values were 1 order of magnitude lower than those derived from ms2 c max c 0 8 91 10 2 rb 5 46 10 1 the mean log reduction values calculated from log10 c max c 0 were similar for rotavirus 2 53 1 50 3 39 and dgsnp 2 61 1 34 3 41 but tended to be lower for ms2 1 2 0 74 1 99 likewise the average temporal reduction rate λ table 2 derived from rotavirus 2 03 10 2 min 1 was very similar to that derived from dgsnp 2 17 10 2 min 1 but it was 1 order of magnitude higher than that derived from ms2 4 33 10 3 min 1 the average spatial reduction rate f log10 c max c 0 x table 3 derived from rotavirus 6 32 log10 m was very similar to that derived from dgsnp 6 53 log10 m but it was more than twice the value derived from ms2 2 99 log10 m the lower reduction of ms2 compared with that of rotavirus could be attributed to its smaller size 26 nm and lower isoelectric point ph 3 6 compared with the size 75 nm and isoelectric point ph 4 5 of rotavirus gutierrez et al 2009 we consider that the likely mechanisms underlying the reductions of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp in the soils involved in this study are 1 the irreversible or reversible attachment to the soil media which could either protect them from or accelerate inactivation degradation 2 physical straining when they were associated with larger colloids in the wastewater especially during clogging processes and 3 the inactivation of rotavirus and ms2 and the degradation of the dna marker on dgsnp induced by microbial activity enzymes and chemicals present in the wastewater and soils for the rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp particles that were not associated with larger colloids in the effluent removal by straining would be negligible as their particles sizes are too small relative to the sizes of the soil grains as suggested from the t test results which were based on 6 paired mean values tables 2 and 3 the above parameter values were not significantly different between rotavirus and dgsnp p 0 216 0 860 but were significantly different between rotavirus and ms2 p 0 002 0 023 the similarities between the rotavirus and dgsnp reductions and the dissimilarities between the rotavirus and ms2 reductions are consistent with the observations from previous studies in sand filtration experiments pang et al 2014 found that ms2 over predicted the relative concentrations of rotavirus by 2 orders of magnitude and that the relative concentrations and filtration efficiencies of the new surrogates including dgsnp were similar to those of rotavirus farkas et al 2015 observed that the new surrogates including dgsnp closely mimicked rotavirus adsorption to both unmodified and modified hydrophobic sand but ms2 showed a markedly greater level of adsorption to the hydrophobic sand because of its hydrophobic nature likewise humphries et al 2019 showed that ms2 under predicted the rotavirus reduction by 1 1 log in coral sand conditioned with domestic effluent although data describing rotavirus attenuation in stony alluvial soils are not available in the literature information is available that describes bacteriophage attenuation in these soils lismore soils comprising silt loam over gravels were studied in relation to the attenuation of salmonella phage using saturated intact cores 46 cm wide 70 cm long under dairy shed effluent irrigation pang et al 2008 these authors derived salmonella phage reduction rates of λ 5 57 10 3 3 69 7 02 10 3 min 1 and f 1 98 0 99 2 53 log10 m these values are similar to those determined in this study for ms2 λ 4 33 10 3 0 00 1 48 10 2 min 1 and f 2 99 1 85 4 99 log10 m although lismore soils were used in both studies the soil media used in the current study were less permeable saturated hydraulic conductivity k s 0 53 0 55 m day than those used in the previous study k s 2 74 17 35 m day 3 1 2 transport of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp the breakthrough curves fig 3 for all of the inputs clearly show decreases in the speed of transport of kbr rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp through the intact soil cores as wastewater conditioning progressed and clogging reduced the flow rate these decreases in transport are also reflected in the delayed breakthrough times for the peak concentrations t peak table 2 of kbr rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp however the flow rate did not have a clear impact on the retardations r of ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp relative to kbr table 3 core 2 consistently showed earlier breakthroughs of kbr ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp compared with core 1 in experiments 1 and 2 on days 14 and 28 this is demonstrated by the concentration breakthrough curves fig 3 and the breakthrough times of the peak concentrations table 2 however in experiment 3 the differences between the cores were reduced these findings may be explained by the higher flow rates in core 2 than in core 1 in experiments 1 and 3 but similar flow rates in experiments 3 compared with the non reactive kbr solute tracer the peak concentrations of ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp commonly appeared earlier fig 3 table 2 this phenomenon is often observed during colloid transport in heterogeneous media because colloidal particles are excluded from small pores and they tend to move through interconnected larger pores rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp did not differ significantly p 0 324 0 782 regarding the degree of velocity enhancement defined as the ratio of the peak concentration time relative to kbr although the peak concentrations of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp mostly appeared earlier than that of kbr the centres of mass which were derived from the modelling results in the rotavirus and dgsnp breakthrough curves were slightly retarded in some experiments r 1 66 table 3 because multiple peaks were present the centre of mass for ms2 also showed velocity enhancement in most of the experiments r 1 however the overall transport was not significantly different among rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp p 0 115 0 568 3 2 impact of the experimental conditions 3 2 1 flow rate dissolved organic matter loading and ph the intact cores became increasingly clogged while they were being conditioned with the wastewater even though the effluent was of reasonable quality with tss 20 mg l as a result the flow rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity reduced over time despite the flow rate remaining reasonably stable during each transport experiment table 1 the k s values decreased from 0 53 m day to 0 16 m day in core 1 and from 0 55 m day to 0 23 m day in core 2 decreases in the flow rate and hydraulic conductivity could promote particle attenuation as a consequence of a longer attenuation time and reductions in the effective pore sizes due to clogging in contrast progressive loading with dissolved organic matter dom from wastewater could mobilise particle transport and promote particle detachment from the porous media as a result of competition for attachment sites many researchers have reported that the transport of microbes is enhanced in the presence of organic matter powelson et al 1991 jimenez sanchez et al 2015 pieper et al 1997 zhuang and jin 2003 increased ms2 mass recoveries were found in filtration experiments involving progressive dom conditioning weaver et al 2013 wall et al 2008 in addition the increases in the ph that were observed after each wastewater application may have hindered particle attenuation because increasing ph reduces the filtration of ms2 walshe et al 2010 in this study we did not see clear trends in particle attenuation in relation to the flow rate dom loading and the ph as wastewater conditioning proceeded as all of the processes described above were occurring concurrently during the study the greater attenuation of the particles as the flow rate decreased was probably offset by the opposing effects of dom and the ph on particle attenuation 3 2 2 input concentration the ms2 and dgsnp reductions seemed to increase with the input concentrations with low rb values relating to high c o values and vice versa this was noticeable for ms2 in the experiments with core 1 and dgsnp in the experiments with core 2 however the effects of the input concentrations on the ms2 and dgsnp reductions were not remarkable despite the c o values for dgsnp ranging from 8 51 106 copies ml to 1 99 1010 copies ml table 1 its rb values 1 52 10 3 4 28 10 2 varied by only 1 order of magnitude table 2 the c o values for ms2 varied from 6 20 104 plaque forming units pfu ml to 2 50 105 pfu ml but its rb values 3 15 10 1 9 23 10 1 remained within the same order of magnitude the impact of the c o on the rotavirus rb value was not apparent although a relatively low rb value 1 72 10 3 corresponded to the highest c o value 1 15 108 copies ml in experiment 2 involving core 1 in fact when the results from this experiment were excluded the rotavirus rb values varied by 2 orders of magnitude 5 67 10 3 2 10 10 1 while the c o values remained fairly constant 1 38 107 3 44 107 copies ml as mentioned previously the experimental results were also affected by other concurrent processes therefore particle attenuation cannot be measured using the input concentration alone the input concentrations c 0 of rotavirus dgsnp and ms2 appear to be very different table 1 this was mainly a consequence of different quantification targets to enable reliable qpcr quantifications the rotavirus c 0 values used were all in the order of 107 genome copies gc ml except for 1 experiment for which the c 0 was in the order of 108 gc ml the gc numbers represent the numbers of live and dead virus particles the dgsnp concentrations measured using the qpcr represent the numbers of dna copies bound to the dgsnp surfaces rather than the particle numbers when the c 0 value for the dgsnp was close to 107 dna copies ml in the earlier experiments involving core 1 the dgsnp concentrations in the leachate samples determined by the qpcr were too low which may have been a consequence of the presence of inhibitors in the wastewater that hinder detection using the qpcr thus in the subsequent experiments high dgsnp c o values were used to facilitate better qpcr quantifications although the dgsnp c o values were high in the experiments involving core 2 the actual particle concentrations should be lower in contrast although the ms2 c 0 was low with respect to the plaque concentrations the actual ms2 particle concentrations could be much higher this is because plaque assays often underestimate the actual numbers of virus particles due to virus aggregation espinosa et al 2008 fongaro et al 2013 and the plaque assay only counts live virus particles the ms2 plaque assay counts a plaque as a single ms2 particle but a plaque can sometimes contain many ms2 particles for example he and jiang 2005 found that real time pcr methods yielded viral counts in sewage samples that were 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than the plaque assay results and tsai and parker 1998 obtained 6 105 copies of poliovirus genomes for 1 plaque of poliovirus if the ms2 c 0 used was in the order of 107 pfu ml the actual ms2 particle concentration would have been much higher and many more dilution steps would be required for plaque counting thereby increasing the associated analytical errors although variations existed in the input concentrations and in the results of the individual experiments the above conclusions regarding the similarity of rotavirus to dgsnp and the dissimilarity between rotavirus and ms2 remain valid when the average parameter values are compared a total of 6 experiments were performed which was sufficient to balance any biases 3 3 implications in vertical separation distances for groundwater protection our experimental results suggest that at a transport depth of 0 4 m in soils the log10 reduction values calculated from log10 c max c 0 are on average 2 53 1 50 3 39 for rotavirus 2 61 1 34 3 41 for dgsnp and 1 20 0 74 1 99 for ms2 these results were derived from saturated conditions which depict a worst case scenario in which the disposal field is saturated by rainfall high groundwater levels or a failing owts separation distances are determined for both the vertical and horizontal dimensions virus removal in soils underlying owts partially contributes to the vertical separation distance for groundwater protection the vertical separation distance includes the soil and vadose zone media between the bottom of a disposal field and the seasonal high groundwater table while the horizontal setback distance is within the aquifer media between the disposal field and a drinking water well when a drinking water well is located down gradient and in very close proximity to the disposal field groundwater protection will largely rely on the vertical separation distance moore et al 2010 proposed a 16 2 log10 reduction in the rotavirus concentration from the point at which it entered a septic tank to the point at which it reached a drinking water well to achieve an infection risk of 10 4 person year this value was based on an estimated concentration of 4 4 1010 rotavirus particles l 95th percentile entering a septic tank and a maximum acceptable concentration of 7 9 10 7 rotavirus particles l in a drinking water well the total 16 2 log reduction included rotavirus reductions in the sewage tank disposal field underlying soil vadose zone and aquifer virus concentration reductions are 0 6 log and 1 0 log in primary and secondary treatment systems respectively and in a disposal field the reductions are 0 36 log in pea gravels and 0 49 log in sand moore et al 2010 based on the average spatial reduction rates of rotavirus 6 32 3 76 8 47 log10 m dgsnp 6 53 3 36 8 53 log10 m and ms2 2 99 1 85 4 99 log10 m for a given log reduction the soil depth required for a dgsnp reduction is similar and only 3 less than that required for a rotavirus reduction in contrast the soil depth required for an ms2 reduction is more than twice the soil depth or 111 greater required for a rotavirus reduction these results suggest that risk assessments and setback distances determined using the rotavirus parameters and criteria but based on ms2 as the surrogate can be too conservative in some subsurface media to determine safe and realistic separation distances it would be beneficial and complementary to apply both conservative virus surrogate using ms2 bacteriophage and representative but non conservative new virus surrogates using biomolecule modified silica nanoparticles it should be noted that the reduction rates of rotavirus dgsnp and ms2 determined in this study are applicable to soils that comprise 0 4 m of silt loam over gravels under similar experimental conditions but they may not be applicable to the vadose zones of sandy gravels according to a review and analysis pang 2009 the spatial reduction rates of ms2 prd1 phages and poliovirus derived from experiments with sewage effluent are mostly in the range of 0 12 0 53 log10 m in the vadose zones of coarse sand and sandy gravels table 11 pang 2009 the significantly greater reduction of rotavirus compared with ms2 in porous media observed in this study concurs with the findings of previous studies humphries et al 2019 wang et al 2016 pang et al 2014 arraj et al 2005 all of these studies were conducted at relatively slow flow rates namely 0 96 6 86 m day in this study 2 02 2 30 m day in pang et al 2014 and slow sand filtration at 0 51 l min in wang et al 2016 a slow flow system generates a sufficient hydraulic residence time that enables particles to interact with porous media this leads to the differences in the reductions of rotavirus and ms2 owning to their different biophysicochemical properties in fast flowing gravel karst and fractured rock aquifers virus transport can be rapid via preferential flow paths hence the variations among the different microorganisms regarding their attenuation may not be so great due to the short residence times during which the particles interact with the porous media on the other hand the ms2 reduction can be significantly greater than the rotavirus reduction in hydrophobic conditions as observed by farkas et al 2015 because ms2 is hydrophobic and rotavirus is hydrophilic 4 conclusions our experimental results demonstrated that the rotavirus and dgsnp reductions were very similar and markedly greater than the ms2 reduction rotavirus and dgsnp were very similar in relation to their average peak concentrations relative mass recoveries log reduction values and spatial and temporal reduction rates p 0 216 0 860 in contrast rotavirus and ms2 differed significantly in relation to all of these parameter values p 0 002 0 023 for a given log10 reduction the estimated soil depth required for ms2 is more than twice the estimated soil depths required for rotavirus and dgsnp this is the first study to use biomolecule modified silica nanoparticles as a rotavirus surrogate in soils under effluent applications the results from this study have shown that the new surrogate is promising for evaluations of rotavirus reductions in soils under on site wastewater applications hence the surrogate can be used in laboratory and field studies of owts to better understand the transport and attenuation of rotavirus without the need to use a pathogenic virus compared with labour intensive plaque counting of ms2 phage the new surrogate can be rapidly analysed using the qpcr additionally the stability of the new surrogate in secondary treated wastewater also demonstrates that it could be a useful tool for evaluating rotavirus in other wastewater applications we recommend further investigations into the transport and attenuation of rotavirus from owts to generate data from different soil types under a variety of conditions to enable the establishment of separation distances for groundwater protection declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18368,contamination of potable groundwater by pathogenic viruses from on site wastewater treatment systems owts poses a serious health risk this study investigated the attenuation and transport of rotavirus bacteriophage ms2 and dna labelled glycoprotein coated silica nanoparticles dgsnp in 2 intact cores of silt loam over gravels dosed with wastewater from an owts at 3 53 l day to simulate a worst case scenario experiments were conducted under saturated conditions the results from 6 experiments demonstrated that the rotavirus and dgsnp reductions were very similar and markedly greater than the ms2 reduction this was reflected in the peak concentrations relative mass recoveries and temporal and spatial reduction rates for a given log10 reduction the estimated soil depth required for ms2 was over twice that required for rotavirus and dgsnp this is the first study in which dgsnp was used as a rotavirus surrogate in soil under wastewater applications consistent with previous studies dgsnp showed promise at mimicking rotavirus attenuation and transport in porous media the results suggest dgsnp could be used to assess the attenuation capacity of subsurface media to rotavirus however dgsnp is not conservative and will underestimate the setback distances required for rotavirus reductions by 3 on the other hand separation distances determined using the rotavirus parameters and criteria but based on ms2 attenuation can be too conservative in some subsurface media to determine safe and realistic separation distances it would be beneficial and complementary to apply both conservative virus surrogate using ms2 bacteriophage and representative but non conservative new virus surrogates using biomolecule modified silica nanoparticles graphical abstract image 1 keywords rotavirus surrogate on site wastewater treatment system groundwater separation distance 1 introduction contamination of potable groundwater from on site wastewater treatment systems owts is a major health concern worldwide the contamination risk is particularly high when drinking water wells are located down gradient of and in close proximity to owts septic tank effluent can contain many potentially harmful contaminants including disease causing microorganisms each year in the united states contaminated groundwater causes almost half of the waterborne disease outbreaks and owts are believed to cause most of these outbreaks gerba 1999 many outbreaks associated with contaminated groundwater are caused by viral agents gerba 1999 some viral disease outbreaks have been traced to the consumption of groundwater contaminated by sewage from owts keswick and gerba 1980 cogger 1988 borchardt et al 2011 wallender et al 2014 human enteric viruses are particularly problematic unlike bacteria and protozoa viruses are not readily filtered out by subsurface media due to their extremely small sizes 100 nm compared with enteric bacteria enteric viruses have higher infection risks haas et al 1993 and they can survive for much longer periods who 2011 the risk of waterborne viral infection is commonly assessed by using rotavirus as a model because ingesting a single rotavirus particle can cause illness graham et al 1987 rotavirus is the leading cause of severe childhood gastroenteritis dose response estimations indicate that the maximum allowable concentration for rotavirus in drinking water is 2 22 10 7 particles l to reduce the risk of infection to 10 4 person year regli et al 1991 rotavirus shedding rates from infected individuals can be as high as 1012 rotavirus particles g of faeces gerba 2000 guardabassi et al 2003 christensen 1995 walter 2000 charles et al 2003 and virus shedding can continue for up to 30 days guardabassi et al 2003 thus when a member of a household with an owts is infected with rotavirus the rotavirus concentrations in the septic tank effluent can be extremely high up to 8 1010 rotavirus particles l during the peak shedding period and 106 rotavirus particles l 30 days after the peak period charles et al 2003 rotavirus is relatively stable and it can persist in groundwater for up to 7 months espinosa et al 2008 sometimes it is detected in potable groundwater bradbury et al 2013 and causes disease outbreaks hopkins et al 1985 kukkula et al 1997 given its high infectivity prevalence and persistence the maximum allowable concentration for rotavirus in drinking water has been used to determine separation distances for groundwater protection schijven et al 2006 moore et al 2010 blaschke et al 2016 subsurface media act as natural filters and they can remove faecal contaminants through attachment straining and inactivation processes schijven et al 2017 bradford et al 2015 given adequate separation distances sufficient virus reductions can be achieved by natural attenuation processes in subsurface media so that the quality of the receiving water is acceptable for consumption in new zealand for example on the canterbury plains and in many parts of the world many owts are constructed on alluvial plains where free draining stony alluvial soils are widespread the presence of preferential flow paths and macropores render free draining stony soils vulnerable to microbial leaching which poses a risk to the quality of the underlying groundwater little is known about rotavirus removal in soils underlying owts fields and only limited relevant information is available from experiments conducted with bacteriophages which is summarised in a review by pang 2009 given their different physiochemical properties e g size surface charge and hydrophobicity bacteriophages may not be representative of rotavirus in terms of its attenuation and transport in subsurface media indeed it has been found that ms2 bacteriophage ms2 the most widely used traditional virus surrogate could differ from rotavirus in their reduction in porous media by a few orders of magnitude in a study involving slow sand filters wang et al 2016 observed a 5 log10 reduction in the rotavirus concentration after 31 days but only a 1 2 log10 reduction in the ms2 concentration after 42 days arraj et al 2005 reported a mean 9 2 log10 reduction for rotavirus simian sa11 but only a 3 2 log10 reduction for ms2 in laboratory pilot plants of sewage treatment by activated sludge pang et al 2014 found that ms2 over predicted rotavirus vr 2018 strain concentrations by 2 orders of magnitude in filtration experiments conducted with coastal sand in laboratory drainage experiments involving 40 cm of coral sand conditioned with domestic effluent humphries et al 2019 reported a mean 7 0 log10 reduction for rotavirus but only a 5 7 log10 reduction for ms2 in contrast ms2 is not a conservative surrogate for rotavirus in hydrophobic conditions this is because ms2 is highly hydrophobic while rotavirus is hydrophilic farkas et al 2015 in a batch study involving unmodified and modified hydrophobic sand ms2 displayed a markedly greater level of adsorption than rotavirus vr 2018 strain to hydrophobic sand farkas et al 2015 ms2 has been also found to strongly adsorb to plastic experimental apparatus burbery et al 2015 again indicating that ms2 is highly hydrophobic recently novel rotavirus surrogates have been developed using dna labelled protein coated silica nanoparticles pang et al 2014 these include surrogates made from dna labelled 70 nm silica nanoparticles coated with glycoprotein protein a or a α1 microglobulin bikunin precursor the modified particles had sizes zeta potentials pang et al 2014 and hydrophobicity farkas et al 2015 similar to those of rotavirus the surrogates have been validated in filtration experiments involving coastal sand pang et al 2014 and in adsorption experiments involving unmodified and modified hydrophobic sand farkas et al 2015 in both studies the surrogates significantly outperformed ms2 at mimicking rotavirus attenuation and they showed the same magnitude of concentration reductions as rotavirus while preliminary test results suggested that these new surrogates were detectable in environmental waters and wastewaters pang et al 2014 they have not been validated in studies involving the application of wastewater to soils the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the rotavirus attenuation capacity of stony alluvial soils specifically silt loam over gravels following on site wastewater applications and 2 examine the representativeness of ms2 and the newly developed rotavirus surrogate namely dna labelled glycoprotein coated silica nanoparticles dgsnp to rotavirus the implications and limitations of the research findings in the context of vertical separation distances for groundwater protection are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 intact cores intact cores of a lismore soil formation were taken from a research farm near lincoln which is 20 km south of christchurch two intact cores were collected from trenches at a depth of 0 5 1 m below the surface omitting the topsoil to simulate the application of septic effluent to the subsurface the cores were cylindrical 40 cm long and 30 cm wide and they were contained in a polyvinyl chloride pvc outer layer the space between the soil core and the pvc layer was filled with warm petroleum jelly that subsequently solidified to prevent preferential flow down the perimeter of the core despite being extracted from the same field site the cores exhibited natural heterogeneity in their physical properties core 1 comprised sandy silt loam at 0 11 cm sandy loam at 11 19 cm and sandy gravels at 19 40 cm core 2 comprised sandy silt loam at 0 20 cm and sandy gravels at 20 40 cm notably cracks and macropores were visible in the top sandy silt loam layers in both cores especially in core 2 the structure of the intact cores is shown in the computed tomography scan images fig 1 the saturated hydraulic conductivities k s determined from the darcy experiment were 0 53 m day for core 1 and 0 55 m day for core 2 the tops and bottoms of the cores were covered with 2 cm of sterilised coarse sand fine gravels and the bottoms of the cores were additionally covered with perforated pvc plates before the wastewater applications and between the transport experiments deaerated tap water sourced from untreated groundwater was constantly applied to the tops of the cores above the coarse sand fine gravels to maintain saturation 2 2 wastewater application secondary treated wastewater was taken from an oasis 2000 humes 2015 aerated owts which served a family of 4 in fernside canterbury the residence was constantly occupied over the collection period wastewater was collected approximately every 2 weeks from the pump chamber of the wastewater system using a peristaltic pump the wastewater was monitored for ph carbonaceous biological oxygen demand cbod5 total suspended solids tss and dissolved oxygen do at the time of collection as well as during use and storage the wastewater used during the conditioning period and the experiments had an average cbod5 8 5 mg l 3 5 and tss 8 3 mg l 3 8 and it consistently met the secondary wastewater criteria of cbod5 20 mg l and tss 20 mg l as nzs 1547 2012 the mean do and ph remained constant at 6 0 mg l 1 1 and 8 4 0 8 respectively the core saturation apparatus was designed to mimic owts disposal field conditions in the laboratory wastewater was introduced to a reservoir supplying the cores and it was mixed constantly using a magnetic stirrer to prevent it becoming anaerobic and to retain an even distribution of the constituents the wastewater was applied to the top of the core from a distribution system buried within the sterilised fine gravels coarse sand to mimic a primary disposal field the wastewater was evenly distributed through a perforated tube at 5 evenly spaced locations the experimental set up is illustrated in fig 2 the cores were conditioned by applying wastewater for 2 weeks before and during the transport experiments the wastewater was applied at a loading rate of 3 53 l day which equated to a loading rate of 50 mm m2 day and reflects the maximum design loading rate for secondary treated effluent in free draining soils standards new zealand 2012 the design loading rate was delivered evenly in 3 doses every 24 h at 1 176 l dose to mimic an owts pump chamber discharge system 2 3 dosing experiments prior to the experiments the solutions of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp were prepared for injection the rotavirus stock vr 1516 sourced from the american type culture collection atcc was grown in an ma104 cell monolayer using a method adapted from rutjes et al 2009 and li et al 2010 the infected cells were washed and subjected to freeze thaw cycles before storage at 80 c until use the ms2 stock 15597 b1 atcc was propagated using the agar overlay method and salmonella typhimurium wg 49 as the host organism american public health association 2005 the ms2 was scraped from the overlay agar and then separated by shaking and centrifugation followed by filtration weaver et al 2013 the stock was stored at 20 c until use the dgsnp were synthesised by covalently coating α1 acid glycoprotein and a double stranded 302 base pair synthetic dna onto 70 nm carboxylated silica nanoparticles using the method described in pang et al 2014 the dgsnp solution was stored at 4 c until use before the injections the rotavirus and ms2 stocks were thawed overnight at 4 c then they were sonicated in a water bath for 2 min and vortexed after conditioning the cores with wastewater for 14 days 3 experiments were conducted on each core every 2 weeks over a 6 week period to investigate the effect of wastewater conditioning on virus reduction over time during each experiment 1 wastewater dosing event 1 176 l was spiked with potassium bromide kbr rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp table 1 kbr is a non reactive solute tracer and it was used to indicate the movement of the water flow the injection solutions were applied at a rate of 300 ml min to mimic the discharge rate in an owts disposal field time series samples were taken at regular intervals over 8 h table 1 shows the detailed experimental conditions to minimise particle attachment to the experimental apparatus plastic equipment was avoided and glass fittings and tygon tubing were used between the spiking experiments the cores were kept saturated by flushing them with deaerated tap water from untreated groundwater as described in section 2 1 the samples were stored in 100 ml glass schott bottles and they were refrigerated overnight at 4 c in preparation for the ms2 plaque and the kbr analyses the kbr samples were analysed using a bromide ion selective electrode thermo fisher scientific aliquots 200 μl were sub sampled and stored at 80 c for up to 1 week before the rotavirus and dgsnp samples were analysed using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the rotavirus samples were defrosted and rotavirus rna was extracted using the high pure viral nucleic acid kit roche applied science mannheim germany the purified rna was reverse transcribed using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit invitrogen carlsbad ca it was then amplified using a 2 step qpcr and platinum quantitative pcr supermix udg invitrogen adapted from pang et al 2004 the dgsnp samples were defrosted and bovine serum albumin was added to provide some resistance to amplification inhibitors comey et al 1994 for example humic and fulvic acids which are present in wastewater the samples were analysed using a sybr green based 1 step qpcr as described in pang et al 2014 the ms2 samples were analysed using the overlay pour plating method american public health association 2005 with escherichia coli f amp as the host 2 4 data analysis and modelling rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp attenuations were evaluated using relative peak concentrations the spatial reduction rates and relative mass recoveries the relative peak concentration c max c 0 is the peak leachate concentration c max normalised by its input concentration c 0 the spatial reduction rate f was estimated from the log10 reduction in the peak concentration over its transport length x as follows f log10 c max c 0 x the relative mass recovery rb in the samples collected was normalised against that of kbr as follows rb particle mass recovery kbr mass recovery to avoid extrapolation errors we did not estimate the mass recovery from the whole experiment but only that from the samples collected this is because sampling was intermittent and the total volume sampled was only 3 13 of the total leachate volume of an experiment the transport of kbr rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp through the saturated intact soil cores under steady flow was simulated using the cxtfit programme toride et al 1995 that fits an advection dispersion equilibrium model and incorporates a first order reduction term r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x λ c where c is the leachate concentration c c 0 dimensionless t is the time since tracer injection min x is the vertical transport distance along the soil core cm v is the average pore water velocity cm min d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 min r is the retardation factor dimensionless and λ is the temporal reduction rate min 1 the values of v and d were initially estimated from the kbr data then these values were kept constant when optimising the r and λ values of the particles student s t tests were performed on the parameter values to compare paired differences in the mean values between rotavirus and ms2 and between rotavirus and dgsnp a probability value of p 0 05 was considered significantly different 3 results and discussion fig 3 shows the breakthrough curves for the kbr ms2 phage rotavirus and dgsnp concentrations observed during the experiments involving cores 1 and 2 that were carried out every 2 weeks during wastewater conditioning the cxtfit simulated concentration data are also compared with the observed data in fig 3 table 2 presents the parameter values determined from the experiments and table 3 provides the results from the cxtfit modelling the experimental results are presented and discussed in the following sections 3 1 reduction and transport of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp 3 1 1 reduction of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp the relative concentrations fig 3 and relative peak concentrations c max c 0 table 2 tended to be lower for rotavirus and dgsnp compared with those for ms2 the mass recoveries rb of ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp relative to kbr table 2 were variable during all of the experiments involving both cores but the mass recovery of ms2 remained substantially lower compared with those for rotavirus and dgsnp ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp detachment may have occurred in the intact cores during the experiments because of the disruption of the attached particles or competition for binding sites this would have led to the variability observed in the mass recoveries of ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp the experimental results demonstrated that the rotavirus reduction was very similar to the dgsnp reduction but was markedly greater than the ms2 reduction the average peak concentration c max c 0 8 25 10 3 and relative mass recovery rb 6 71 10 2 derived from rotavirus were very similar to those derived from dgsnp c max c 0 9 88 10 3 rb 1 39 10 2 these values were 1 order of magnitude lower than those derived from ms2 c max c 0 8 91 10 2 rb 5 46 10 1 the mean log reduction values calculated from log10 c max c 0 were similar for rotavirus 2 53 1 50 3 39 and dgsnp 2 61 1 34 3 41 but tended to be lower for ms2 1 2 0 74 1 99 likewise the average temporal reduction rate λ table 2 derived from rotavirus 2 03 10 2 min 1 was very similar to that derived from dgsnp 2 17 10 2 min 1 but it was 1 order of magnitude higher than that derived from ms2 4 33 10 3 min 1 the average spatial reduction rate f log10 c max c 0 x table 3 derived from rotavirus 6 32 log10 m was very similar to that derived from dgsnp 6 53 log10 m but it was more than twice the value derived from ms2 2 99 log10 m the lower reduction of ms2 compared with that of rotavirus could be attributed to its smaller size 26 nm and lower isoelectric point ph 3 6 compared with the size 75 nm and isoelectric point ph 4 5 of rotavirus gutierrez et al 2009 we consider that the likely mechanisms underlying the reductions of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp in the soils involved in this study are 1 the irreversible or reversible attachment to the soil media which could either protect them from or accelerate inactivation degradation 2 physical straining when they were associated with larger colloids in the wastewater especially during clogging processes and 3 the inactivation of rotavirus and ms2 and the degradation of the dna marker on dgsnp induced by microbial activity enzymes and chemicals present in the wastewater and soils for the rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp particles that were not associated with larger colloids in the effluent removal by straining would be negligible as their particles sizes are too small relative to the sizes of the soil grains as suggested from the t test results which were based on 6 paired mean values tables 2 and 3 the above parameter values were not significantly different between rotavirus and dgsnp p 0 216 0 860 but were significantly different between rotavirus and ms2 p 0 002 0 023 the similarities between the rotavirus and dgsnp reductions and the dissimilarities between the rotavirus and ms2 reductions are consistent with the observations from previous studies in sand filtration experiments pang et al 2014 found that ms2 over predicted the relative concentrations of rotavirus by 2 orders of magnitude and that the relative concentrations and filtration efficiencies of the new surrogates including dgsnp were similar to those of rotavirus farkas et al 2015 observed that the new surrogates including dgsnp closely mimicked rotavirus adsorption to both unmodified and modified hydrophobic sand but ms2 showed a markedly greater level of adsorption to the hydrophobic sand because of its hydrophobic nature likewise humphries et al 2019 showed that ms2 under predicted the rotavirus reduction by 1 1 log in coral sand conditioned with domestic effluent although data describing rotavirus attenuation in stony alluvial soils are not available in the literature information is available that describes bacteriophage attenuation in these soils lismore soils comprising silt loam over gravels were studied in relation to the attenuation of salmonella phage using saturated intact cores 46 cm wide 70 cm long under dairy shed effluent irrigation pang et al 2008 these authors derived salmonella phage reduction rates of λ 5 57 10 3 3 69 7 02 10 3 min 1 and f 1 98 0 99 2 53 log10 m these values are similar to those determined in this study for ms2 λ 4 33 10 3 0 00 1 48 10 2 min 1 and f 2 99 1 85 4 99 log10 m although lismore soils were used in both studies the soil media used in the current study were less permeable saturated hydraulic conductivity k s 0 53 0 55 m day than those used in the previous study k s 2 74 17 35 m day 3 1 2 transport of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp the breakthrough curves fig 3 for all of the inputs clearly show decreases in the speed of transport of kbr rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp through the intact soil cores as wastewater conditioning progressed and clogging reduced the flow rate these decreases in transport are also reflected in the delayed breakthrough times for the peak concentrations t peak table 2 of kbr rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp however the flow rate did not have a clear impact on the retardations r of ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp relative to kbr table 3 core 2 consistently showed earlier breakthroughs of kbr ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp compared with core 1 in experiments 1 and 2 on days 14 and 28 this is demonstrated by the concentration breakthrough curves fig 3 and the breakthrough times of the peak concentrations table 2 however in experiment 3 the differences between the cores were reduced these findings may be explained by the higher flow rates in core 2 than in core 1 in experiments 1 and 3 but similar flow rates in experiments 3 compared with the non reactive kbr solute tracer the peak concentrations of ms2 rotavirus and dgsnp commonly appeared earlier fig 3 table 2 this phenomenon is often observed during colloid transport in heterogeneous media because colloidal particles are excluded from small pores and they tend to move through interconnected larger pores rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp did not differ significantly p 0 324 0 782 regarding the degree of velocity enhancement defined as the ratio of the peak concentration time relative to kbr although the peak concentrations of rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp mostly appeared earlier than that of kbr the centres of mass which were derived from the modelling results in the rotavirus and dgsnp breakthrough curves were slightly retarded in some experiments r 1 66 table 3 because multiple peaks were present the centre of mass for ms2 also showed velocity enhancement in most of the experiments r 1 however the overall transport was not significantly different among rotavirus ms2 and dgsnp p 0 115 0 568 3 2 impact of the experimental conditions 3 2 1 flow rate dissolved organic matter loading and ph the intact cores became increasingly clogged while they were being conditioned with the wastewater even though the effluent was of reasonable quality with tss 20 mg l as a result the flow rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity reduced over time despite the flow rate remaining reasonably stable during each transport experiment table 1 the k s values decreased from 0 53 m day to 0 16 m day in core 1 and from 0 55 m day to 0 23 m day in core 2 decreases in the flow rate and hydraulic conductivity could promote particle attenuation as a consequence of a longer attenuation time and reductions in the effective pore sizes due to clogging in contrast progressive loading with dissolved organic matter dom from wastewater could mobilise particle transport and promote particle detachment from the porous media as a result of competition for attachment sites many researchers have reported that the transport of microbes is enhanced in the presence of organic matter powelson et al 1991 jimenez sanchez et al 2015 pieper et al 1997 zhuang and jin 2003 increased ms2 mass recoveries were found in filtration experiments involving progressive dom conditioning weaver et al 2013 wall et al 2008 in addition the increases in the ph that were observed after each wastewater application may have hindered particle attenuation because increasing ph reduces the filtration of ms2 walshe et al 2010 in this study we did not see clear trends in particle attenuation in relation to the flow rate dom loading and the ph as wastewater conditioning proceeded as all of the processes described above were occurring concurrently during the study the greater attenuation of the particles as the flow rate decreased was probably offset by the opposing effects of dom and the ph on particle attenuation 3 2 2 input concentration the ms2 and dgsnp reductions seemed to increase with the input concentrations with low rb values relating to high c o values and vice versa this was noticeable for ms2 in the experiments with core 1 and dgsnp in the experiments with core 2 however the effects of the input concentrations on the ms2 and dgsnp reductions were not remarkable despite the c o values for dgsnp ranging from 8 51 106 copies ml to 1 99 1010 copies ml table 1 its rb values 1 52 10 3 4 28 10 2 varied by only 1 order of magnitude table 2 the c o values for ms2 varied from 6 20 104 plaque forming units pfu ml to 2 50 105 pfu ml but its rb values 3 15 10 1 9 23 10 1 remained within the same order of magnitude the impact of the c o on the rotavirus rb value was not apparent although a relatively low rb value 1 72 10 3 corresponded to the highest c o value 1 15 108 copies ml in experiment 2 involving core 1 in fact when the results from this experiment were excluded the rotavirus rb values varied by 2 orders of magnitude 5 67 10 3 2 10 10 1 while the c o values remained fairly constant 1 38 107 3 44 107 copies ml as mentioned previously the experimental results were also affected by other concurrent processes therefore particle attenuation cannot be measured using the input concentration alone the input concentrations c 0 of rotavirus dgsnp and ms2 appear to be very different table 1 this was mainly a consequence of different quantification targets to enable reliable qpcr quantifications the rotavirus c 0 values used were all in the order of 107 genome copies gc ml except for 1 experiment for which the c 0 was in the order of 108 gc ml the gc numbers represent the numbers of live and dead virus particles the dgsnp concentrations measured using the qpcr represent the numbers of dna copies bound to the dgsnp surfaces rather than the particle numbers when the c 0 value for the dgsnp was close to 107 dna copies ml in the earlier experiments involving core 1 the dgsnp concentrations in the leachate samples determined by the qpcr were too low which may have been a consequence of the presence of inhibitors in the wastewater that hinder detection using the qpcr thus in the subsequent experiments high dgsnp c o values were used to facilitate better qpcr quantifications although the dgsnp c o values were high in the experiments involving core 2 the actual particle concentrations should be lower in contrast although the ms2 c 0 was low with respect to the plaque concentrations the actual ms2 particle concentrations could be much higher this is because plaque assays often underestimate the actual numbers of virus particles due to virus aggregation espinosa et al 2008 fongaro et al 2013 and the plaque assay only counts live virus particles the ms2 plaque assay counts a plaque as a single ms2 particle but a plaque can sometimes contain many ms2 particles for example he and jiang 2005 found that real time pcr methods yielded viral counts in sewage samples that were 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than the plaque assay results and tsai and parker 1998 obtained 6 105 copies of poliovirus genomes for 1 plaque of poliovirus if the ms2 c 0 used was in the order of 107 pfu ml the actual ms2 particle concentration would have been much higher and many more dilution steps would be required for plaque counting thereby increasing the associated analytical errors although variations existed in the input concentrations and in the results of the individual experiments the above conclusions regarding the similarity of rotavirus to dgsnp and the dissimilarity between rotavirus and ms2 remain valid when the average parameter values are compared a total of 6 experiments were performed which was sufficient to balance any biases 3 3 implications in vertical separation distances for groundwater protection our experimental results suggest that at a transport depth of 0 4 m in soils the log10 reduction values calculated from log10 c max c 0 are on average 2 53 1 50 3 39 for rotavirus 2 61 1 34 3 41 for dgsnp and 1 20 0 74 1 99 for ms2 these results were derived from saturated conditions which depict a worst case scenario in which the disposal field is saturated by rainfall high groundwater levels or a failing owts separation distances are determined for both the vertical and horizontal dimensions virus removal in soils underlying owts partially contributes to the vertical separation distance for groundwater protection the vertical separation distance includes the soil and vadose zone media between the bottom of a disposal field and the seasonal high groundwater table while the horizontal setback distance is within the aquifer media between the disposal field and a drinking water well when a drinking water well is located down gradient and in very close proximity to the disposal field groundwater protection will largely rely on the vertical separation distance moore et al 2010 proposed a 16 2 log10 reduction in the rotavirus concentration from the point at which it entered a septic tank to the point at which it reached a drinking water well to achieve an infection risk of 10 4 person year this value was based on an estimated concentration of 4 4 1010 rotavirus particles l 95th percentile entering a septic tank and a maximum acceptable concentration of 7 9 10 7 rotavirus particles l in a drinking water well the total 16 2 log reduction included rotavirus reductions in the sewage tank disposal field underlying soil vadose zone and aquifer virus concentration reductions are 0 6 log and 1 0 log in primary and secondary treatment systems respectively and in a disposal field the reductions are 0 36 log in pea gravels and 0 49 log in sand moore et al 2010 based on the average spatial reduction rates of rotavirus 6 32 3 76 8 47 log10 m dgsnp 6 53 3 36 8 53 log10 m and ms2 2 99 1 85 4 99 log10 m for a given log reduction the soil depth required for a dgsnp reduction is similar and only 3 less than that required for a rotavirus reduction in contrast the soil depth required for an ms2 reduction is more than twice the soil depth or 111 greater required for a rotavirus reduction these results suggest that risk assessments and setback distances determined using the rotavirus parameters and criteria but based on ms2 as the surrogate can be too conservative in some subsurface media to determine safe and realistic separation distances it would be beneficial and complementary to apply both conservative virus surrogate using ms2 bacteriophage and representative but non conservative new virus surrogates using biomolecule modified silica nanoparticles it should be noted that the reduction rates of rotavirus dgsnp and ms2 determined in this study are applicable to soils that comprise 0 4 m of silt loam over gravels under similar experimental conditions but they may not be applicable to the vadose zones of sandy gravels according to a review and analysis pang 2009 the spatial reduction rates of ms2 prd1 phages and poliovirus derived from experiments with sewage effluent are mostly in the range of 0 12 0 53 log10 m in the vadose zones of coarse sand and sandy gravels table 11 pang 2009 the significantly greater reduction of rotavirus compared with ms2 in porous media observed in this study concurs with the findings of previous studies humphries et al 2019 wang et al 2016 pang et al 2014 arraj et al 2005 all of these studies were conducted at relatively slow flow rates namely 0 96 6 86 m day in this study 2 02 2 30 m day in pang et al 2014 and slow sand filtration at 0 51 l min in wang et al 2016 a slow flow system generates a sufficient hydraulic residence time that enables particles to interact with porous media this leads to the differences in the reductions of rotavirus and ms2 owning to their different biophysicochemical properties in fast flowing gravel karst and fractured rock aquifers virus transport can be rapid via preferential flow paths hence the variations among the different microorganisms regarding their attenuation may not be so great due to the short residence times during which the particles interact with the porous media on the other hand the ms2 reduction can be significantly greater than the rotavirus reduction in hydrophobic conditions as observed by farkas et al 2015 because ms2 is hydrophobic and rotavirus is hydrophilic 4 conclusions our experimental results demonstrated that the rotavirus and dgsnp reductions were very similar and markedly greater than the ms2 reduction rotavirus and dgsnp were very similar in relation to their average peak concentrations relative mass recoveries log reduction values and spatial and temporal reduction rates p 0 216 0 860 in contrast rotavirus and ms2 differed significantly in relation to all of these parameter values p 0 002 0 023 for a given log10 reduction the estimated soil depth required for ms2 is more than twice the estimated soil depths required for rotavirus and dgsnp this is the first study to use biomolecule modified silica nanoparticles as a rotavirus surrogate in soils under effluent applications the results from this study have shown that the new surrogate is promising for evaluations of rotavirus reductions in soils under on site wastewater applications hence the surrogate can be used in laboratory and field studies of owts to better understand the transport and attenuation of rotavirus without the need to use a pathogenic virus compared with labour intensive plaque counting of ms2 phage the new surrogate can be rapidly analysed using the qpcr additionally the stability of the new surrogate in secondary treated wastewater also demonstrates that it could be a useful tool for evaluating rotavirus in other wastewater applications we recommend further investigations into the transport and attenuation of rotavirus from owts to generate data from different soil types under a variety of conditions to enable the

aquatic species including bpa canesi and fabbri 2015 phthalates net et al 2015 and bfrs ezechiáš et al 2014 however exposure to leached plastic additive mixtures has received far less attention and knowledge regarding fate and effects is limited the leaching of additives from plastic materials is differently modulated by the permeability of the polymer matrix gaps between polymer molecules physicochemical properties of the additives properties of the surrounding medium e g salinity temperature ph and time kwan and takada 2016 although a high number of chemical compounds may leach from plastics these can be at concentrations lower than analytical detection limits or not included in routine analysis protocols this reduces the potential for identifying and quantifying the chemical composition of leachates and subsequently establishing possible links between observed toxicity and specific leachate constituents nevertheless adverse effects from leachate exposures have been documented on several organisms including fish he et al 2011 photosynthetic bacteria tetu et al 2019 daphnia spp lithner et al 2009 2012 thaysen et al 2018 barnacle nauplii li et al 2016 and brown mussels gandara e silva et al 2016 this study assesses the chemical composition of aqueous leachates from plastic materials and evaluates the effects of leachates on the growth of microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata freshwater and skeletonema costatum marine and on the mediterranean mussel mytilus galloprovincialis microalgae and marine mussels were selected as model organisms owing to their key ecological roles i e primary producer and filter feeder respectively within aquatic ecosystems and therefore increase the level of inference of the obtained results to real environmental settings additionally the selected species are widely distributed in aquatic environment show a high responsiveness to chemical stressors fabbri et al 2014 and can be readily grown or maintained in laboratory conditions the study aimed to relate any observed toxicity to specific additives or additive groups the organic and inorganic constituents of leachates generated from different types of synthetic thermoplastic and ctr were characterized following an initial non target screening of each plastic reference material biological endpoints studied encompassed algal growth inhibition impairment of mussel early stages processes such as gamete fertilization embryotoxicity and larvae survival and motility and lysosomal biomarkers i e lysosomal membrane stability toxicity tests were performed over a wide range of leachate dilutions to identify and quantify eventual dose response relationships for each selected endpoint 2 materials and methods 2 1 test materials and their

darmstadt germany reference inorganic chemical standards were supplied by inorganic ventures va usa a suite of pp pet ps pvc cryomilled 1000 μm sieved fraction and ctr derived granulate 1 2 mm reference materials was procured from carat gmbh germany and ragnsells norway si table s1 the materials were subjected to a non target screening for organic additive chemicals by solvent extracting the polymers and analyzing the extracts by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms as previously reported cole et al 2019 details of the additive extraction method from the polymers and the analytical chemical conditions can be found in the supplementary information si section s1 tentatively identified compounds were filtered based on their observed presence in at least 3 of 6 replicates for each polymer and 90 match to nist 2017 library mass spectra biogenic compounds or compounds of possible biogenic origin were removed from the data set all compounds found in control samples were removed from the data set 2 2 leachate preparation leachates of each plastic and ctr material were generated in three different media seawater marine algae growth media dm and freshwater algae growth media tg201 all media were sterilized and adjusted to 20 c before use the composition of dm and tg201 is presented in the si tables s2 and s3 the plastic water ratio was kept constant at 80 g l with a leachate volume of 100 250 ml the samples were shaken in a rotating incubator 125 rpm at room temperature 25 c for 14 d in the dark upon sampling the leachate was isolated by passing each sample through a sterile filter 0 2 μm nalgene subsamples for chemical analysis 3 x 2 ml for both organics and metals analysis were acidified 15 hcl ph 2 and stored under dark and cool conditions until further processing additionally the ph in the leachates was measured and compared to the ph in control media that had been shaking for the same length of time 2 3 leachate characterization and semi quantification 2 3 1 extraction of organic additives samples 2 ml of aqueous leachate were spiked with surrogate internal standards 25 08 ng naphthalene d8 4 86 ng chrysene d12 and dcm n hexane 1 1 v v 1 ml was added samples were then vortexed for 1 min followed by centrifugation for 2 min at 2 000 rpm after centrifugation the upper organic phase removed and transferred to a glass vial the addition of solvent vortexing and centrifugation was repeated three times the combined extract was dried with anhydrous na2so4 and evaporated under a gentle stream of n2 to approximately 400 μl finally a recovery internal standard 9 84 ng fluorene d10 was added prior to gc ms analysis 2 3 2 gc ms analysis of organic additive leachate extracts the leachate extracts were first analyzed by gc ms using the non target screening method described above si section s1 after initial inspection of chromatograms peaks were deconvoluted using unknowns algorithms and best hits from nist 2017 library were extracted acetophenone benzothiazole bisphenol a bpa n cyclohexylformamide and phthalide were obtained as reference standards and a 6 level calibration curve 0 01 1 ng ml in dcm was prepared for quantification purposes leachates were re analyzed using a gc ms selected ion monitoring sim method tables s4 and si and analytes were quantified by linear regression after peak areas were normalized to fluorene d10 finally recovery of surrogate standards of comparable volatility chrysene d10 for bisphenol a otherwise naphthalene d8 was used to correct for losses during extraction 2 3 3 icp ms analysis for metals inorganics the leachates generated from each of the polymer materials were also subjected to an elemental screening for metal content for metal determination aqueous samples were first diluted in milliq water before 103rh and 115in was added as internal standards analysis was performed using an agilent 8800 triple quadrupole icp ms icp qqq fitted with a sps 4 autosampler quantification was achieved using standards obtained from inorganic ventures 2 4 toxicity to freshwater and marine algae toxicity of leachates towards freshwater raphidocelis subcapitata and marine microalgae skeletonema costatum was determined as inhibition of growth over 72 h at 21 1 c oecd 2011 an initial 72 h test was performed without replicates to determine the range of leachate dilutions that were suitable for the full test in the full test three replicates of each dilution were prepared and growth measured after 0 24 48 and 72 h growth in control samples media and algae culture alone was determined with six replicates dilutions for each leachate and each species are described in the si table s5 algal growth was assessed by measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence td 700 fluorometer excitation 340 500 nm emission 665 nm 2 5 mussel toxicity test 2 5 1 animal holding and experimental treatments the toxicity of the prepared leachates was screened on the mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis using a set of assays performed on different life stages including spermatozoa eggs embryos d shaped veliger larvae and adult hemocytes and biological levels cellular to organism sexually mature mussels 5 6 cm length were collected from a government certified farm copralmo cesenatico italy immediately transported to the laboratory and acclimated for 5 d in 0 22 μm filtered seawater at 16 c 5 mussels l 1 in all mussel tests treatments encompassed a range of dilutions including 0 6 1 2 4 6 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 of the prepared leachates regardless of the bioassay performed a control condition containing only 0 22 μm filtered seawater was run in parallel all experiments were performed at 16 1 c as previously reported capolupo et al 2018a replicate numbers n employed in each bioassay are provided in the following sections 2 5 2 lysosomal membrane stability the lysosomal membrane stability lms of the mussel hemocytes was evaluated using the neutral red retention assay nrra according to martínez gómez et al 2015 aliquots of hemocytes from 10 randomly selected mussels were placed on microscope slides previously treated with 0 01 poly l lysine and stained using 0 01 neutral red nr acidophile dye after 15 min hemocytes were spiked with selected dilutions of the plastic leachates and checked microscopically at 15 min intervals the nrra was performed in quadruplicate n 4 and the lms assessed as the capability of lysosomes to retain the nr within lysosomes results were expressed as mean standard error of the mean sem of the nr retention time nrrt which is the time min at which more than the 50 of the lysosomes released the dye into the cytosol 2 5 3 gamete fertilization and embryotoxicity tests adult mussels were experimentally induced to spawn according to the astm 2004 standard protocol which consists of a 10 c thermal shock from 16 to 26 c sperm and eggs were sieved through 50 μm and 100 μm nylon meshes to remove impurities and checked for quality egg shape size spermatozoa motility using an inverted light microscope optech ib series munich germany 40 magnification pools of gametes from at least three specimens per sex were employed the effect of plastic leachates on mussel gamete fertilization was assessed according to the method reported by capolupo et al 2018b with slight modifications briefly an aliquot of spermatozoa was added to 96 well plates previously spiked with selected dilutions of the plastic leachates at 60 min after spiking oocytes were added at a 1 5 proportion with spermatozoa according to astm 2004 after 30 min the test was blocked by adding calcium buffered formalin 4 to each well the fertilization success was assessed by inverted microscopy carl zeiss primovert series oberkochen germany 40 magnification adopted criteria were the appearance of the polar lobe and or the cell division initiation capolupo et al 2018b data were expressed as the mean standard error of the mean sem n 5 of the percentage of fertilization success attained at each tested condition the tests validity was set at a mean fertilization rate for controls of 60 and 98 environment canada 2011 the embryotoxicity test was performed as described by fabbri et al 2014 mussel eggs and spermatozoa were mixed in 96 well plates 1 5 egg to spermatozoa ratio to allow for fertilization after 30 min the 80 fertilization success was microscopically verified and leachate spiked at the chosen dilution after a 48 h incubation period samples were fixed with calcium buffered formalin 4 and examined by optical microscopy using an inverted microscope a larva veliger was considered normal when it had reached the d shelled veliger stage straight hinge and the velum did not protrude out of the shell and malformed if had not reached the typical 48 h post fertilization pf stage trocophore or earlier stages or in the presence of developmental defects concave malformed or damaged shell protruding velum the recorded endpoint was the mean sem n 5 of the percentage of normal larvae the acceptability of test results was based on controls for a percentage of normal d shaped veligers 70 astm 2004 2 5 4 survival immobilization test the effects of plastic leachates on the survival and motility of mussel early stages were tested using d shaped veliger larvae obtained in laboratory rearing conditions oocyte fertilization was performed in 2 l glass beakers containing 1 5 l filtered seawater starting from 48 h post fertilization pf larvae were fed daily with a suspension of microalgae nannochloropsis oculata 1 200 cell ml 1 until 5 d pf at 6 d pf larvae were collected by sieving the culture on a 20 μm pore nylon mesh and added to 96 well plates 50 individuals well previously spiked with selected leachate dilutions all treatments were performed in quadruplicate n 4 based on the results obtained in preliminary trials the number of motile and viable larvae was recorded after 48 and 144 h of exposure respectively using an inverted optical microscope 40 100 magnification criteria for mortality assessment included the clearly visible degradation decomposition of the soft tissue and or the absence of visceral movement and heart cilia beating conversely a larva was recorded as immobilized when it showed no swimming or spiral circulatory movements typical of mussel d shaped veligers sprung et al 1984 although in the presence of visceral heart and or cilia beating data for survival were expressed as the mean sem of the percentage of viable larvae while immobilization was expressed as the mean sem of the percentage of non motile larvae over the proportion of viable larvae 2 6 statistical analysis chemical data were subjected to a t test using the r software drc package to evaluate the presence of statistically significant changes between the water concentrations of organic and inorganic compounds before and after the leaching process data obtained in marine mussel toxicity tests were analyzed for significant differences compared to controls using a non parametric analysis of variance kruskal wallis test followed by the dunn s corrected test for multiple comparison using the statistical package sigmaplot 13 systat software inc san jose ca usa deviations from normality and homoscedasticity were screened using the shapiro wilk and bartlett s test respectively and statistical significance was accepted for p 0 05 data from algae toxicity tests mussel gamete fertilization embryotoxicity and survival immobilization tests were subject to a non linear regression analysis four parameter dose response model bottom plateau constrained to 0 and ec50 calculation including the 95 confidence interval using graphpad prism 7 mussel tests or r drc package algae tests according to ritz et al 2015 to ensure precision and accuracy of the dose response analysis ec50 calculations were considered applicable only to data showing statistically significant differences compared to controls or in the absence of significant treatments a nonlinear regression coefficient r squared 0 70 according to the guidelines reported by noel et al 2018 ec50 values calculated as beyond the range of tested dosages i e 100 leachate concentration were reported as 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 additives in the polymer test materials and leaching into aqueous media a broad range of organic additive chemicals were identified in the solvent extracts generated from the polymer test materials representing plasticizers antioxidants antimicrobials lubricants and vulcanizers a list of the organic compounds found in the polymer extracts that were tentatively identified by a 90 mass spectral match to reference compounds in the nist 2017 mass spectral library is presented in the supplementary information table s6 this list was used as a basis for studying the additive compounds present in the leachates the highest number of tentatively identified organic compounds in the polymer extracts was found in pp 19 followed by ctr 17 pvc 9 ps 9 and pet 1 with only one identifiable organic additive compound found in the original polymer material the pet particles were the purest material used in the present study of the tentatively identified compounds in the polymer extracts si table s6 only a few were found in detectable amounts in the full scan analyses of the corresponding leachate samples freshwater and marine media acetophenone and phenoxyethanol were found in the pp particles and in both the pp leachates freshwater and marine phthalide was found in pvc particles and in both pvc leachates benzothiazole 2 3h benzothiazolone and phthalimide were found in the ctr particles and both ctr leachates a number of compounds including n cyclohexylformamide in the case of the ctr particles were identified only in the leachates and not in the polymer extracts this could be due to the more complex nature of the polymer extracts compared to the leachate extracts rendering the compound peaks unresolvable in the chromatograms from the polymer extracts the presence of specific compounds in the leachates of specific polymers together with their absence in control samples suggests that these are not the result of contamination introduced during sample processing from the suite of organic compounds tentatively identified in the polymer extracts and leachates four commercially available compounds were purchased as reference standards acetophenone benzothiazole phthalide and n cyclohexylformamide in addition bpa was included as a standard compound of interest in the target analyte study of the leachates table 1 for each respective target compound the highest concentrations were found in leachates of polymers where the compound had already been identified as present in the polymer by non target screening the concentrations of the different additives varied from tens of ng to hundreds of μg l for example benzothiazole was found in the highest concentrations in the freshwater and marine leachates of ctr 2 313 and 1 460 μg l respectively but not present in any other leachate the sensitivity of the gc ms sim method allowed the quantification of some additives in polymer leachates where the compounds had not been observable under non target screening analysis for example acetophenone was identified in the polymer extracts of pp and ps but was present in the freshwater leachates of pp ps and pvc as well as the marine leachates of pp ps pvc and ctr n cyclohexylformamide was also found in high quantities in the ctr freshwater and marine leachates 1 059 and 788 μg l respectively despite not being observed in the polymer extract samples this suggests n cyclohexylformamide concentrations in ctr may be relatively low but that the chemical leaches out from ctr far more readily than other additives finally bpa was not observed in any of the polymer extracts or the leachate extracts subjected to non target analysis but was observed in the freshwater leachates of pp and ps 1 0 and 3 6 μg l respectively and the marine leachates of ctr pp ps and pvc 6 4 2 8 2 4 and 0 3 μg l respectively when analyzed using the sim method levels of these compounds ranged from being significantly p 0 05 to highly significantly p 0 005 greater than their concentrations in the media control samples indicating they were present due to polymer leaching based on these preliminary investigations of polymer leachates using a combination of target and non target approaches it is probable that the true complexity is far greater a larger number of organic additive chemicals are likely to be identified if several other analytical methods were also applied i e liquid chromatography while the general trend in organic additive concentrations was similar between freshwater and marine media for organic compounds this varied more for inorganics table 2 for example freshwater ps leachates exhibited al concentrations of 12 355 347 μg l while concentrations in the marine leachate were 755 16 μg l a similar trend was observed for sr in the pvc leachates the highest metal concentrations in the freshwater and marine leachates were observed for zn in ctr 12 130 152 and 5 138 128 μg l respectively and pvc 2 806 54 and 6 357 140 μg l respectively this is consistent with the high levels of zn used in ctr and also the high zn concentration in pvc leachates recently reported by tetu et al 2019 furthermore a 2 6 increase of pb levels relatively to controls was obtained in the pp seawater leachate which may be noteworthy given its known toxicity to aquatic organisms deforest and meyer 2015 interestingly the presence of the polymer particles also modified the chemical composition of the media by sorbing some inorganic nutrients thus significantly reducing their media concentration relative to controls this was particularly evident in the ps particle leachates which showed up to a 99 decrease in mg concentration following the leaching process a similar process was observed for pb which decreased in the seawater leachates of ctr pet and pvc by 35 48 and 81 respectively an increase in ph relative to control samples without particles was observed in both ps leachates and in the pet freshwater leachate not marine in contrast ctr pp and pvc leachates lowered the ph of both media si table s7 the ph change was considered an effect of leaching and ph was therefore not adjusted prior to toxicity studies 3 2 acute leachate toxicity to freshwater and marine algae preliminary trials showed that pet leachates did not cause growth inhibition in either freshwater r subcapitata or marine algae s costatum even at the 100 leachate concentration this is supported by the low additive chemical content determined in the pet extracts and leachates full toxicity tests were therefore performed only for leachates from ctr pp ps and pvc materials the results in form of 50 effect concentrations ec50 are summarized in table 3 the leachate toxicities varied between the different polymers and there were also observable differences in toxicity for some of the leachates between the two algal species ctr produced the most toxic leachate with ec50 values of 0 5 and 19 of total leachate towards the freshwater and marine algae respectively pp exhibited a similar toxicity towards marine algae to that observed for crt ec50 18 but showed the lowest toxicity towards freshwater algae ec50 64 pvc had high toxicity towards freshwater algae ec50 1 6 of total leachate but the second lowest toxicity towards marine algae ec50 35 the ps leachate was toxic only at the highest concentrations towards the marine algae ec50 100 and was the second least toxic ec50 26 towards the freshwater algae pp being the least toxic the higher toxicity of ctr and pvc leachates could be directly linked to the higher additive chemical content of these leachates both in terms of organics and metals particularly zn a limitation to the current study is the non quantifiable influence of the reduction in dissolved nutrients in exposure media due to sorption by the particles however this effect would be pronounced only at the highest exposure concentrations as the media dilutions would make it negligible at lower concentrations 3 3 leachate toxicity to marine mussels data from this study provide clear evidence for the toxicity of polymer leachates on cellular and developmental parameters measured in the mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis the results of the lms test performed on mussel hemocyte treated with increasing leachate concentrations are shown in fig 1 in agreement with safety standards reported in the unep ramoge manual 1999 lms data from control treatments showed nrrts 100 min corresponding to the lms physiological condition in the mussels fig 1 the ctr leachate proved to be the most toxic with respect to lms fig 1a where significant reductions relative to the control were observed in the range of 10 100 significantly lower lms levels were also recorded for exposures representing 40 100 of the pvc leachate figs 1d 40 100 of ps leachate figs 1c 40 and 80 and 100 of pp leachate fig 1b conversely none of the pet leachate treatments affected the lms in mussel hemocytes fig 1e which is consistent with the low levels of organic and inorganic additives present in this polymer material lms reduction in mussel hemocytes is a well known biomarker of cellular and general stress which has been recognized as prognostic of alterations to higher functions such as growth and or reproduction martinez gomez et al 2017 moore et al 2006 some of the chemicals detected in the tested leachates were previously found to induce lysosomal dysfunctions in bivalve hemocytes in an in vitro investigation canesi et al 2005 found that bpa affected lms at concentrations one order of magnitude higher than those detected in the current study suggesting that further additives may have contributed to the observed lms modulation s for instance benzothiazole highly concentrated in the ctr leachate 146 μg l is known to display metal chelating properties able to interfere with membrane linked processes and lysosomal hydrolases activity wever and verachtert 1997 zinc which is essential to mussel cell metabolism at natural seawater levels olmedo et al 2013 was found to affect lms and induce hemocyte necrosis in the μg to mg l range as in ctr pvc and pp leachates or in combination with pb cu and cr giamberini and pihan 1997 hietanen et al 1988 in bivalves hemocytes play a crucial role in the host activated immune response and in modulating cell detoxification and degradation pathways viarengo et al 2007 the lms results in the current study highlight the need for a more comprehensive assessment of the effects of plastic leachates on the mussel adaptability to microbiological and or physicochemical stressors the effects induced by the leachates on mussel gamete fertilization are summarized in fig 2 in the control treatment 84 4 of eggs were fertilized thus falling within the standard thresholds for test validity environment canada 2011 conversely the 60 min exposure of mussel spermatozoa to increasing leachate concentrations significantly suppressed egg fertilization success the pp leachate had the highest number of treatments that were significantly different to control values with responses following exposure to the 6 10 40 80 and 100 fig 2b a significant down regulation was also triggered in ctr ps and pvc leachates at 40 100 fig 2a c d the lowest effects were induced by pet which exhibited a significant decrease only following exposure to the 80 100 of leachate fig 2e dose response curves of egg fertilization data including r2 and hill slope are presented in the si fig s2 table s8 fertilization data for the ctr pp and pvc leachates showed ec50 values in the range of 16 45 79 15 and were ranked in the order pvc ctr pp fig 2 conversely the ec50 values for ps and pet leachates were 100 of the exposure concentrations fig 2 to our knowledge this study represents the first attempt at evaluating the effects of leached chemicals on the gamete fertilization of an aquatic species according to the results leachates from ctr and pvc displayed a higher magnitude of effects and a stronger dose responsiveness in terms of ec50 than the other leachates tested however a greater effect from the pp leachates was observed when analyzed in terms of the significance relative to the controls likely reflecting the higher sensitivity of mussel gametes to the specific group of chemical additives leached by this polymer in mussels the inhibition of gamete fertilization has frequently been associated with toxicant induced alterations of the cellular structure involved in the regulation of energetic metabolism and motility of spermatozoa in the current study cu was present at the highest concentration in the pp leachates 260 μg l previous studies have showed that in vitro exposure to 100 μg l of cu severely altered the mitochondrial activity in mytilus spp spermatozoa leading a subsequent inhibition of motility and fertilization rate au et al 2000 fitzpatrick et al 2008 similarly riba et al 2016 highlighted mechanistic links between the presence of 10 200 μg l of pb ni cu and zn in marine sediment elutriates and decreased egg fertilization in mussels mytilus edulis with an ec50 of 6 3 of the total elutriate a synergistic effect might also be expected following co exposure to acetophenone and bpa both exhibited significant enrichment in the ctr and pvc leachates as both chemicals are known to display a marked spermistatic activity in mammals and fish cariati et al 2019 canesi and fabbri 2015 the results of the 48 h embryotoxicity test performed on m galloprovincialis are shown in fig 3 the percentage of normal d shaped veliger larvae in controls was 70 which is consistent with the standard requirements for test validity astm 2004 all leachates induced a statistically significant p 0 05 inhibition of normal embryonic development with respect to controls notably significant reductions were observed following exposure to 2 100 of the ctr leachate figs 3a 10 100 of the pp leachate figs 3b 40 100 of the ps leachate figs 3c 4 100 of the pvc leachate figs 3d and 60 100 of the pet leachate fig 3e embryotoxicity data for all polymer leachates showed a r2 0 70 fig s3 table s8 ec50 values were in the range of 2 22 96 84 and were ranked in the order ctr pvc pp ps pet according to the obtained results embryonic development was the most sensitive endpoint measured in the mussels based on existing literature such an adverse outcome may reasonably be linked to the sensitivity of the embryos to some of the leached inorganic additives previous 48 h embryotoxicity testing of cu zn and pb on m galloprovincialis showed ec50 values of 9 6 99 and 63 μg l respectively nadella et al 2009 2013 these values are well below the levels of these elements detected in ctr pvc and or pp leachates in the current study an alternative explanation may be the co occurrence of bpa in the leachates which is known to exert transcriptional and embryotoxic effects in m galloprovincialis as a result of its endocrine disrupting activity fabbri et al 2014 balbi et al 2016 in addition heterocyclic aromatic compounds such as the benzothiazole and phthalide present in the ctr and pvc leachates are known to be embryotoxic in fish and or mammal models sheftel 2000 this suggests that the main alterations could involve early embryogenic processes i e cleavage to gastrulation which are phylogenetically more conserved across taxa interestingly recent studies performed on sea urchins showed that a leachate from virgin pvc microplastics elicited significantly higher embryotoxicity than a direct particle administration through the same test medium nobre et al 2015 oliviero et al 2019 similarly our previous study showed that exposure to 3 μm ps particles did not affect mussel embryonic development capolupo et al 2018a leading to the hypothesis that sole embryo exposure to waterborne plastics may not allow reliable estimation of plastic additive effects the effects induced by leachates on the motility and survival of mussel d shaped veligers are presented in fig 4 ctr leachates significantly reduced larvae motility 48 h and survival 144 h following exposure to leachates in the range of 10 100 and 40 100 respectively fig 4a the pp leachate did not induce any effects on the motility of mussel larvae but caused a significant decrease in survival at the 100 concentration fig 4b no effect on either motility or survival was induced by the ps and pet leachates fig 4c e while a significant reduction of both parameters was induced by the pvc leachate in the range 20 100 fig 4d according to the nonlinear regression analysis an r squared value greater than 0 70 selected as a prerequisite for ec50 calculations could only be calculated for survival data for the ctr pp and pvc leachates and for motility data for the ctr and pvc leachates fig s4 table s8 the ec50 values for survival and motility for the ctr and pvc leachates were in the range of tested concentrations while the effective concentration for survival after exposure to the pp leachate treatments was calculated to be 100 fig 4 the lowest ec50 value for motility 18 75 of the total concentration was observed for the ctr leachate while the pvc leachates induced the lowest ec50 for survival at 54 04 fig 4 these results clearly indicate that leachates derived from different polymers vary considerably in their impacts on mussel larvae survival and motility this is consistent with previous studies lithner et al 2009 2012 that showed leachates from 20 out of 58 commercial plastic products affected the mobility of the freshwater cladoceran daphnia magna while effects on the survival of barnacle amphibalanus amphitrite nauplii were recorded in response to a range of plastic leachates including pvc pp ps and pet li et al 2016 only pp pvc and bioplastic derived leachates caused mortality in the copepod nitocra spinipes bejgarn et al 2015 this suggests that species or stage specific traits may influence the overall toxicity of leached additives although different additive chemical profiles in plastics comprised of the same polymer type may also play a role unlike embryos mussel larvae possess d shaped shells and well developed chemoreceptors that allow them to respond to chemical stressors by closing their valves and reducing the filtration rate wong and gerstenberger 2015 although these mechanisms would explain the absence of effects or the slight effects observed for exposure to the pp ps and pet leachates in the current study they contrast with the dose related response induced by exposure to ctr and pvc leachates it is possible that this might be related to the lower ph values i e ph 7 5 table s7 observed in both leachates relative to controls ph 8 1 a recent study demonstrated that exposure to ph lower than 7 6 inhibits compensatory mechanisms in mytilus larvae leading to metabolic alterations in the short term and increased mortality after prolonged exposure ventura et al 2016 4 conclusions this study provides new knowledge on the chemical characterization and ecotoxicological effects of chemical additive leachates from plastic and rubber materials under freshwater and marine conditions the chemical composition of leachates was complex and varied considerably among tested polymers with the main additives identified as plasticizers antioxidants antimicrobials lubricants vulcanizers and metals in line with the relatively high content of organic and inorganic compounds in the parent materials leachates from ctr and pvc exhibited the highest toxicity on algae growth and mussel early stages development survival and motility the lowest effects were generally observed for the pet leachates which contained the lowest number and concentration of measured additives evidence of toxicity were also observed for mussel gamete fertilization and the lms assessed in hemocytes suggesting that leachate exposure may affect different stages of the life cycle of aquatic organisms the magnitude of effects observed in this study suggest that organic and inorganic additives leached from plastic rubber polymers may cause substantially higher ecotoxicity than those previously reported following plastic ingestion although additives are subjected to a substantial dilution in natural environment ec50 values determined in this study showed that leachate concentrations of less than 3 may because for concern in enclosed ecosystems e g bays lagoons or lakes or oceanic hotspots where plastics tend to accumulate gesamp 2016 current knowledge on ecotoxicological effects of plastic leachates is based upon a small number of studies conducted using acute toxicity tests and different leaching processes further efforts are therefore required to standardize methods for leachate preparation and sublethal effects testing to

18369,synthetic polymer based materials are ubiquitous in aquatic environments where weathering processes lead to their progressive fragmentation and the leaching of additive chemicals the current study assessed the chemical content of freshwater and marine leachates produced from car tire rubber ctr polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc microplastics and their adverse effects on the microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata freshwater and skeletonema costatum marine and the mediterranean mussel mytilus galloprovincialis a combination of non target and target chemical analysis revealed a number of organic and metal compounds in the leachates including representing plasticizers antioxidants antimicrobials lubricants and vulcanizers ctr and pvc materials and their corresponding leachates had the highest content of tentatively identified organic additives while pet had the lowest the metal content varied both between polymer leachates and between freshwater and seawater notable additives identified in high concentrations were benzothiazole ctr phthalide pvc acetophenone pp cobalt ctr pet zinc ctr pvc lead pp and antimony pet all leachates except pet inhibited algal growth with ec50 values ranging from 0 5 ctr and 64 pp of the total leachate concentration leachates also affected mussel endpoints including the lysosomal membrane stability and early stages endpoints as gamete fertilization embryonic development and larvae motility and survival embryonic development was the most sensitive parameter in mussels with ec50 values ranging from 0 8 ctr to 65 pet of the total leachate the lowest impacts were induced on d shell larvae survival reflecting their ability to down regulate motility and filtration in the presence of chemical stressors this study provides evidence of the relationship between chemical composition and toxicity of plastic rubber leachates consistent with increasing contamination by organic and inorganic additives the leachates ranged from slightly to highly toxic to mussels and algae highlighting the need for a better understanding of the overall impact of plastic associated chemicals on aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic additives dissolution marine mussels microalgae in vitro toxicity 1 introduction contamination of the oceans by plastic has been estimated to cause an annual loss of 1 5 in ecosystem services resulting in economic damages of approximately us 2 5 billion per year beaumont et al 2019 owing to the increasing rate of discharge now

deleterious effects kühn et al 2015 barboza et al 2019 gesamp 2016 in addition to the risks associated to conventional thermoplastics e g pvc pet polyethylene or polystyrene concerns are emerging about the possible impacts of other polymer based materials including microparticles derived from car tire rubber ctr wagner et al 2018 ctr microparticles generated during use or through processing end of life tires elts are regarded as one of the greatest contributors to microplastic pollution these fragments which fall within the definition of microplastics are increasingly employed in a range of products and in sport facilities and are estimated to reach the marine environment at a rate of half million tons per year hann et al 2018 most thermoplastics are made by mixing the basic polymer s with a variety of chemicals that either aid the production process or impart specific properties that render the final product commercially more desirable or more appropriate for its intended application hermabessiere et al 2017 these chemicals include amongst others low molecular weight oligomers catalyst materials solvents and a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds turner 2016

protect from chemical degradation or impart a desired color thompson et al 2009 turner 2016 ctr also contains a broad range of components including fillers carbon black clay silica calcium carbonate stabilizers antioxidants antiozonants waxes cross linking agents sulfur accelerators activators and secondary components such as pigments oils resins and short fibers potentially harmful to health and environment canepari et al 2018 rodgers and waddell 2013 most additives are not covalently bound to the plastic polymer and so they can migrate to the material surface potentially being released into the environment hermabessiere et al 2017 paluselli et al 2019 schmidt et al 2019 indeed additives have been found in effluents from waste water treatment plants surface and marine waters al odaini et

wildlife and humans echa 2018 unep 2017 bpa is widely used to obtain clear and tough plastics and has been detected in food and beverages following release from packaging vandermeersch et al 2015 high molecular weight phthalates which allow production of flexible vinyl plastics e g pvc and organophosphate esters have widely been found at μg l concentrations in surface waters golshan et al 2015 schmidt et al 2019 in addition brominated flame retardants bfrs are known to leach from plastics into the surrounding matrix engler 2012 meeker et al 2009 compounds leaching from ctr include benzothiazoles phthalates and phenols where benzothiazole is typically observed in the highest quantities li et al 2010 llompart et al 2013 several additives have been shown to adversely affect aquatic species including bpa canesi and fabbri 2015 phthalates net et al 2015 and bfrs ezechiáš et al 2014 however exposure to leached plastic additive mixtures has received far less attention and knowledge regarding fate and effects is limited the leaching of additives from plastic materials is differently modulated by the permeability of the polymer matrix gaps between polymer molecules physicochemical properties of the additives properties of the surrounding medium e g salinity temperature ph and time kwan and takada 2016 although a high number of chemical compounds may leach from plastics these can be at concentrations lower than analytical detection limits or not included in routine analysis protocols this reduces the potential for identifying and quantifying the chemical composition of leachates and subsequently establishing possible links between observed toxicity and specific leachate constituents nevertheless adverse effects from leachate exposures have been documented on several organisms including fish he et al 2011 photosynthetic bacteria tetu et al 2019 daphnia spp lithner et al 2009 2012 thaysen et al 2018 barnacle nauplii li et al 2016 and brown mussels gandara e silva et al 2016 this study assesses the chemical composition of aqueous leachates from plastic materials and evaluates the effects of leachates on the growth of microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata freshwater and skeletonema costatum marine and on the mediterranean mussel mytilus galloprovincialis microalgae and marine mussels were selected as model organisms owing to their key ecological roles i e primary producer and filter feeder respectively within aquatic ecosystems and therefore increase the level of inference of the obtained results to real environmental settings additionally the selected species are widely distributed in aquatic environment show a high responsiveness to chemical stressors fabbri et al 2014 and can be readily grown or maintained in laboratory conditions the study aimed to relate any observed toxicity to specific additives or additive groups the organic and inorganic constituents of leachates generated from different types of synthetic thermoplastic and ctr were characterized following an initial non target screening of each plastic reference material biological endpoints studied encompassed algal growth inhibition impairment of mussel early stages processes such as gamete fertilization embryotoxicity and larvae survival and motility and lysosomal biomarkers i e lysosomal membrane stability toxicity tests were performed over a wide range of leachate dilutions to identify and quantify eventual dose response relationships for each selected endpoint 2 materials and methods 2 1 test materials and their preparation all organic solvents and salts were of analytical grade solvent purity was verified in house prior to use by pre concentration 200x followed by screening analysis using the same methods as applied for the samples deionized water was of millipore milliq quality natural seawater was collected from 90 m in trondheimsfjorden norway and 20 m depth at cesenatico italy filtered to remove coarse particles and subjected to sterile filtration 0 22 μm sterivex prior to use in the experiments reference organic chemical standards were supplied by chiron as trondheim norway and sigma aldrich darmstadt germany reference inorganic chemical standards were supplied by inorganic ventures va usa a suite of pp pet ps pvc cryomilled 1000 μm sieved fraction and ctr derived granulate 1 2 mm reference materials was procured from carat gmbh germany and ragnsells norway si table s1 the materials were subjected to a non target screening for organic additive chemicals by solvent extracting the polymers and analyzing the extracts by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms as previously reported cole et al 2019 details of the additive extraction method from the polymers and the analytical chemical conditions can be found in the supplementary information si section s1 tentatively identified compounds were filtered based on their observed presence in at least 3 of 6 replicates for each polymer and 90 match to nist 2017 library mass spectra biogenic compounds or compounds of possible biogenic origin were removed from the data set all compounds found in control samples were removed from the data set 2 2 leachate preparation leachates of each plastic and ctr material were generated in three different media seawater marine algae growth media dm and freshwater algae growth media tg201 all media were sterilized and adjusted to 20 c before use the composition of dm and tg201 is presented in the si tables s2 and s3 the plastic water ratio was kept constant at 80 g l with a leachate volume of 100 250 ml the samples were shaken in a rotating incubator 125 rpm at room temperature 25 c for 14 d in the dark upon sampling the leachate was isolated by passing each sample through a sterile filter 0 2 μm nalgene subsamples for chemical analysis 3 x 2 ml for both organics and metals analysis were acidified 15 hcl ph 2 and stored under dark and cool conditions until further processing additionally the ph in the leachates was measured and compared to the ph in control media that had been shaking for the same length of time 2 3 leachate characterization and semi quantification 2 3 1 extraction of organic additives samples 2 ml of aqueous leachate were spiked with surrogate internal standards 25 08 ng naphthalene d8 4 86 ng chrysene d12 and dcm n hexane 1 1 v v 1 ml was added samples were then vortexed for 1 min followed by centrifugation for 2 min at 2 000 rpm after centrifugation the upper organic phase removed and transferred to a glass vial the addition of solvent vortexing and centrifugation was repeated three times the combined extract was dried with anhydrous na2so4 and evaporated under a gentle stream of n2 to approximately 400 μl finally a recovery internal standard 9 84 ng fluorene d10 was added prior to gc ms analysis 2 3 2 gc ms analysis of organic additive leachate extracts the leachate extracts were first analyzed by gc ms using the non target screening method described above si section s1 after initial inspection of chromatograms peaks were deconvoluted using unknowns algorithms and best hits from nist 2017 library were extracted acetophenone benzothiazole bisphenol a bpa n cyclohexylformamide and phthalide were obtained as reference standards and a 6 level calibration curve 0 01 1 ng ml in dcm was prepared for quantification purposes leachates were re analyzed using a gc ms selected ion monitoring sim method tables s4 and si and analytes were quantified by linear regression after peak areas were normalized to fluorene d10 finally recovery of surrogate standards of comparable volatility chrysene d10 for bisphenol a otherwise naphthalene d8 was used to correct for losses during extraction 2 3 3 icp ms analysis for metals inorganics the leachates generated from each of the polymer materials were also subjected to an elemental screening for metal content for metal determination aqueous samples were first diluted in milliq water before 103rh and 115in was added as internal standards analysis was performed using an agilent 8800 triple quadrupole icp ms icp qqq fitted with a sps 4 autosampler quantification was achieved using standards obtained from inorganic ventures 2 4 toxicity to freshwater and marine algae toxicity of leachates towards freshwater raphidocelis subcapitata and marine microalgae skeletonema costatum was determined as inhibition of growth over 72 h at 21 1 c oecd 2011 an initial 72 h test was performed without replicates to determine the range of leachate dilutions that were suitable for the full test in the full test three replicates of each dilution were prepared and growth measured after 0 24 48 and 72 h growth in control samples media and algae culture alone was determined with six replicates dilutions for each leachate and each species are described in the si table s5 algal growth was assessed by measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence td 700 fluorometer excitation 340 500 nm emission 665 nm 2 5 mussel toxicity test 2 5 1 animal holding and experimental treatments the toxicity of the prepared leachates was screened on the mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis using a set of assays performed on different life stages including spermatozoa eggs embryos d shaped veliger larvae and adult hemocytes and biological levels cellular to organism sexually mature mussels 5 6 cm length were collected from a government certified farm copralmo cesenatico italy immediately transported to the laboratory and acclimated for 5 d in 0 22 μm filtered seawater at 16 c 5 mussels l 1 in all mussel tests treatments encompassed a range of dilutions including 0 6 1 2 4 6 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 of the prepared leachates regardless of the bioassay performed a control condition containing only 0 22 μm filtered seawater was run in parallel all experiments were performed at 16 1 c as previously reported capolupo et al 2018a replicate numbers n employed in each bioassay are provided in the following sections 2 5 2 lysosomal membrane stability the lysosomal membrane stability lms of the mussel hemocytes was evaluated using the neutral red retention assay nrra according to martínez gómez et al 2015 aliquots of hemocytes from 10 randomly selected mussels were placed on microscope slides previously treated with 0 01 poly l lysine and stained using 0 01 neutral red nr acidophile dye after 15 min hemocytes were spiked with selected dilutions of the plastic leachates and checked microscopically at 15 min intervals the nrra was performed in quadruplicate n 4 and the lms assessed as the capability of lysosomes to retain the nr within lysosomes results were expressed as mean standard error of the mean sem of the nr retention time nrrt which is the time min at which more than the 50 of the lysosomes released the dye into the cytosol 2 5 3 gamete fertilization and embryotoxicity tests adult mussels were experimentally induced to spawn according to the astm 2004 standard protocol which consists of a 10 c thermal shock from 16 to 26 c sperm and eggs were sieved through 50 μm and 100 μm nylon meshes to remove impurities and checked for quality egg shape size spermatozoa motility using an inverted light microscope optech ib series munich germany 40 magnification pools of gametes from at least three specimens per sex were employed the effect of plastic leachates on mussel gamete fertilization was assessed according to the method reported by capolupo et al 2018b with slight modifications briefly an aliquot of spermatozoa was added to 96 well plates previously spiked with selected dilutions of the plastic leachates at 60 min after spiking oocytes were added at a 1 5 proportion with spermatozoa according to astm 2004 after 30 min the test was blocked by adding calcium buffered formalin 4 to each well the fertilization success was assessed by inverted microscopy carl zeiss primovert series oberkochen germany 40 magnification adopted criteria were the appearance of the polar lobe and or the cell division initiation capolupo et al 2018b data were expressed as the mean standard error of the mean sem n 5 of the percentage of fertilization success attained at each tested condition the tests validity was set at a mean fertilization rate for controls of 60 and 98 environment canada 2011 the embryotoxicity test was performed as described by fabbri et al 2014 mussel eggs and spermatozoa were mixed in 96 well plates 1 5 egg to spermatozoa ratio to allow for fertilization after 30 min the 80 fertilization success was microscopically verified and leachate spiked at the chosen dilution after a 48 h incubation period samples were fixed with calcium buffered formalin 4 and examined by optical microscopy using an inverted microscope a larva veliger was considered normal when it had reached the d shelled veliger stage straight hinge and the velum did not protrude out of the shell and malformed if had not reached the typical 48 h post fertilization pf stage trocophore or earlier stages or in the presence of developmental defects concave malformed or damaged shell protruding velum the recorded endpoint was the mean sem n 5 of the percentage of normal larvae the acceptability of test results was based on controls for a percentage of normal d shaped veligers 70 astm 2004 2 5 4 survival immobilization test the effects of plastic leachates on the survival and motility of mussel early stages were tested using d shaped veliger larvae obtained in laboratory rearing conditions oocyte fertilization was performed in 2 l glass beakers containing 1 5 l filtered seawater starting from 48 h post fertilization pf larvae were fed daily with a suspension of microalgae nannochloropsis oculata 1 200 cell ml 1 until 5 d pf at 6 d pf larvae were collected by sieving the culture on a 20 μm pore nylon mesh and added to 96 well plates 50 individuals well previously spiked with selected leachate dilutions all treatments were performed in quadruplicate n 4 based on the results obtained in preliminary trials the number of motile and viable larvae was recorded after 48 and 144 h of exposure respectively using an inverted optical microscope 40 100 magnification criteria for mortality assessment included the clearly visible degradation decomposition of the soft tissue and or the absence of visceral movement and heart cilia beating conversely a larva was recorded as immobilized when it showed no swimming or spiral circulatory movements typical of mussel d shaped veligers sprung et al 1984 although in the presence of visceral heart and or cilia beating data for survival were expressed as the mean sem of the percentage of viable larvae while immobilization was expressed as the mean sem of the percentage of non motile larvae over the proportion of viable larvae 2 6 statistical analysis chemical data were subjected to a t test using the r software drc package to evaluate the presence of statistically significant changes between the water concentrations of organic and inorganic compounds before and after the leaching process data obtained in marine mussel toxicity tests were analyzed for significant differences compared to controls using a non parametric analysis of variance kruskal wallis test followed by the dunn s corrected test for multiple comparison using the statistical package sigmaplot 13 systat software inc san jose ca usa deviations from normality and homoscedasticity were screened using the shapiro wilk and bartlett s test respectively and statistical significance was accepted for p 0 05 data from algae toxicity tests mussel gamete fertilization embryotoxicity and survival immobilization tests were subject to a non linear regression analysis four parameter dose response model bottom plateau constrained to 0 and ec50 calculation including the 95 confidence interval using graphpad prism 7 mussel tests or r drc package algae tests according to ritz et al 2015 to ensure precision and accuracy of the dose response analysis ec50 calculations were considered applicable only to data showing statistically significant differences compared to controls or in the absence of significant treatments a nonlinear regression coefficient r squared 0 70 according to the guidelines reported by noel et al 2018 ec50 values calculated as beyond the range of tested dosages i e 100 leachate concentration were reported as 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 additives in the polymer test materials and leaching into aqueous media a broad range of organic additive chemicals were identified in the solvent extracts generated from the polymer test materials representing plasticizers antioxidants antimicrobials lubricants and vulcanizers a list of the organic compounds found in the polymer extracts that were tentatively identified by a 90 mass spectral match to reference compounds in the nist 2017 mass spectral library is presented in the supplementary information table s6 this list was used as a basis for studying the additive compounds present in the leachates the highest number of tentatively identified organic compounds in the polymer extracts was found in pp 19 followed by ctr 17 pvc 9 ps 9 and pet 1 with only one identifiable organic additive compound found in the original polymer material the pet particles were the purest material used in the present study of the tentatively identified compounds in the polymer extracts si table s6 only a few were found in detectable amounts in the full scan analyses of the corresponding leachate samples freshwater and marine media acetophenone and phenoxyethanol were found in the pp particles and in both the pp leachates freshwater and marine phthalide was found in pvc particles and in both pvc leachates benzothiazole 2 3h benzothiazolone and phthalimide were found in the ctr particles and both ctr leachates a number of compounds including n cyclohexylformamide in the case of the ctr particles were identified only in the leachates and not in the polymer extracts this could be due to the more complex nature of the polymer extracts compared to the leachate extracts rendering the compound peaks unresolvable in the chromatograms from the polymer extracts the presence of specific compounds in the leachates of specific polymers together with their absence in control samples suggests that these are not the result of contamination introduced during sample processing from the suite of organic compounds tentatively identified in the polymer extracts and leachates four commercially available compounds were purchased as reference standards acetophenone benzothiazole phthalide and n cyclohexylformamide in addition bpa was included as a standard compound of interest in the target analyte study of the leachates table 1 for each respective target compound the highest concentrations were found in leachates of polymers where the compound had already been identified as present in the polymer by non target screening the concentrations of the different additives varied from tens of ng to hundreds of μg l for example benzothiazole was found in the highest concentrations in the freshwater and marine leachates of ctr 2 313 and 1 460 μg l respectively but not present in any other leachate the sensitivity of the gc ms sim method allowed the quantification of some additives in polymer leachates where the compounds had not been observable under non target screening analysis for example acetophenone was identified in the polymer extracts of pp and ps but was present in the freshwater leachates of pp ps and pvc as well as the marine leachates of pp ps pvc and ctr n cyclohexylformamide was also found in high quantities in the ctr freshwater and marine leachates 1 059 and 788 μg l respectively despite not being observed in the polymer extract samples this suggests n cyclohexylformamide concentrations in ctr may be relatively low but that the chemical leaches out from ctr far more readily than other additives finally bpa was not observed in any of the polymer extracts or the leachate extracts subjected to non target analysis but was observed in the freshwater leachates of pp and ps 1 0 and 3 6 μg l respectively and the marine leachates of ctr pp ps and pvc 6 4 2 8 2 4 and 0 3 μg l respectively when analyzed using the sim method levels of these compounds ranged from being significantly p 0 05 to highly significantly p 0 005 greater than their concentrations in the media control samples indicating they were present due to polymer leaching based on these preliminary investigations of polymer leachates using a combination of target and non target approaches it is probable that the true complexity is far greater a larger number of organic additive chemicals are likely to be identified if several other analytical methods were also applied i e liquid chromatography while the general trend in organic additive concentrations was similar between freshwater and marine media for organic compounds this varied more for inorganics table 2 for example freshwater ps leachates exhibited al concentrations of 12 355 347 μg l while concentrations in the marine leachate were 755 16 μg l a similar trend was observed for sr in the pvc leachates the highest metal concentrations in the freshwater and marine leachates were observed for zn in ctr 12 130 152 and 5 138 128 μg l respectively and pvc 2 806 54 and 6 357 140 μg l respectively this is consistent with the high levels of zn used in ctr and also the high zn concentration in pvc leachates recently reported by tetu et al 2019 furthermore a 2 6 increase of pb levels relatively to controls was obtained in the pp seawater leachate which may be noteworthy given its known toxicity to aquatic organisms deforest and meyer 2015 interestingly the presence of the polymer particles also modified the chemical composition of the media by sorbing some inorganic nutrients thus significantly reducing their media concentration relative to controls this was particularly evident in the ps particle leachates which showed up to a 99 decrease in mg concentration following the leaching process a similar process was observed for pb which decreased in the seawater leachates of ctr pet and pvc by 35 48 and 81 respectively an increase in ph relative to control samples without particles was observed in both ps leachates and in the pet freshwater leachate not marine in contrast ctr pp and pvc leachates lowered the ph of both media si table s7 the ph change was considered an effect of leaching and ph was therefore not adjusted prior to toxicity studies 3 2 acute leachate toxicity to freshwater and marine algae preliminary trials showed that pet leachates did not cause growth inhibition in either freshwater r subcapitata or marine algae s costatum even at the 100 leachate concentration this is supported by the low additive chemical content determined in the pet extracts and leachates full toxicity tests were therefore performed only for leachates from ctr pp ps and pvc materials the results in form of 50 effect concentrations ec50 are summarized in table 3 the leachate toxicities varied between the different polymers and there were also observable differences in toxicity for some of the leachates between the two algal species ctr produced the most toxic leachate with ec50 values of 0 5 and 19 of total leachate towards the freshwater and marine algae respectively pp exhibited a similar toxicity towards marine algae to that observed for crt ec50 18 but showed the lowest toxicity towards freshwater algae ec50 64 pvc had high toxicity towards freshwater algae ec50 1 6 of total leachate but the second lowest toxicity towards marine algae ec50 35 the ps leachate was toxic only at the highest concentrations towards the marine algae ec50 100 and was the second least toxic ec50 26 towards the freshwater algae pp being the least toxic the higher toxicity of ctr and pvc leachates could be directly linked to the higher additive chemical content of these leachates both in terms of organics and metals particularly zn a limitation to the current study is the non quantifiable influence of the reduction in dissolved nutrients in exposure media due to sorption by the particles however this effect would be pronounced only at the highest exposure concentrations as the media dilutions would make it negligible at lower concentrations 3 3 leachate toxicity to marine mussels data from this study provide clear evidence for the toxicity of polymer leachates on cellular and developmental parameters measured in the mediterranean mussel m galloprovincialis the results of the lms test performed on mussel hemocyte treated with increasing leachate concentrations are shown in fig 1 in agreement with safety standards reported in the unep ramoge manual 1999 lms data from control treatments showed nrrts 100 min corresponding to the lms physiological condition in the mussels fig 1 the ctr leachate proved to be the most toxic with respect to lms fig 1a where significant reductions relative to the control were observed in the range of 10 100 significantly lower lms levels were also recorded for exposures representing 40 100 of the pvc leachate figs 1d 40 100 of ps leachate figs 1c 40 and 80 and 100 of pp leachate fig 1b conversely none of the pet leachate treatments affected the lms in mussel hemocytes fig 1e which is consistent with the low levels of organic and inorganic additives present in this polymer material lms reduction in mussel hemocytes is a well known biomarker of cellular and general stress which has been recognized as prognostic of alterations to higher functions such as growth and or reproduction martinez gomez et al 2017 moore et al 2006 some of the chemicals detected in the tested leachates were previously found to induce lysosomal dysfunctions in bivalve hemocytes in an in vitro investigation canesi et al 2005 found that bpa affected lms at concentrations one order of magnitude higher than those detected in the current study suggesting that further additives may have contributed to the observed lms modulation s for instance benzothiazole highly concentrated in the ctr leachate 146 μg l is known to display metal chelating properties able to interfere with membrane linked processes and lysosomal hydrolases activity wever and verachtert 1997 zinc which is essential to mussel cell metabolism at natural seawater levels olmedo et al 2013 was found to affect lms and induce hemocyte necrosis in the μg to mg l range as in ctr pvc and pp leachates or in combination with pb cu and cr giamberini and pihan 1997 hietanen et al 1988 in bivalves hemocytes play a crucial role in the host activated immune response and in modulating cell detoxification and degradation pathways viarengo et al 2007 the lms results in the current study highlight the need for a more comprehensive assessment of the effects of plastic leachates on the mussel adaptability to microbiological and or physicochemical stressors the effects induced by the leachates on mussel gamete fertilization are summarized in fig 2 in the control treatment 84 4 of eggs were fertilized thus falling within the standard thresholds for test validity environment canada 2011 conversely the 60 min exposure of mussel spermatozoa to increasing leachate concentrations significantly suppressed egg fertilization success the pp leachate had the highest number of treatments that were significantly different to control values with responses following exposure to the 6 10 40 80 and 100 fig 2b a significant down regulation was also triggered in ctr ps and pvc leachates at 40 100 fig 2a c d the lowest effects were induced by pet which exhibited a significant decrease only following exposure to the 80 100 of leachate fig 2e dose response curves of egg fertilization data including r2 and hill slope are presented in the si fig s2 table s8 fertilization data for the ctr pp and pvc leachates showed ec50 values in the range of 16 45 79 15 and were ranked in the order pvc ctr pp fig 2 conversely the ec50 values for ps and pet leachates were 100 of the exposure concentrations fig 2 to our knowledge this study represents the first attempt at evaluating the effects of leached chemicals on the gamete fertilization of an aquatic species according to the results leachates from ctr and pvc displayed a higher magnitude of effects and a stronger dose responsiveness in terms of ec50 than the other leachates tested however a greater effect from the pp leachates was observed when analyzed in terms of the significance relative to the controls likely reflecting the higher sensitivity of mussel gametes to the specific group of chemical additives leached by this polymer in mussels the inhibition of gamete fertilization has frequently been associated with toxicant induced alterations of the cellular structure involved in the regulation of energetic metabolism and motility of spermatozoa in the current study cu was present at the highest concentration in the pp leachates 260 μg l previous studies have showed that in vitro exposure to 100 μg l of cu severely altered the mitochondrial activity in mytilus spp spermatozoa leading a subsequent inhibition of motility and fertilization rate au et al 2000 fitzpatrick et al 2008 similarly riba et al 2016 highlighted mechanistic links between the presence of 10 200 μg l of pb ni cu and zn in marine sediment elutriates and decreased egg fertilization in mussels mytilus edulis with an ec50 of 6 3 of the total elutriate a synergistic effect might also be expected following co exposure to acetophenone and bpa both exhibited significant enrichment in the ctr and pvc leachates as both chemicals are known to display a marked spermistatic activity in mammals and fish cariati et al 2019 canesi and fabbri 2015 the results of the 48 h embryotoxicity test performed on m galloprovincialis are shown in fig 3 the percentage of normal d shaped veliger larvae in controls was 70 which is consistent with the standard requirements for test validity astm 2004 all leachates induced a statistically significant p 0 05 inhibition of normal embryonic development with respect to controls notably significant reductions were observed following exposure to 2 100 of the ctr leachate figs 3a 10 100 of the pp leachate figs 3b 40 100 of the ps leachate figs 3c 4 100 of the pvc leachate figs 3d and 60 100 of the pet leachate fig 3e embryotoxicity data for all polymer leachates showed a r2 0 70 fig s3 table s8 ec50 values were in the range of 2 22 96 84 and were ranked in the order ctr pvc pp ps pet according to the obtained results embryonic development was the most sensitive endpoint measured in the mussels based on existing literature such an adverse outcome may reasonably be linked to the sensitivity of the embryos to some of the leached inorganic additives previous 48 h embryotoxicity testing of cu zn and pb on m galloprovincialis showed ec50 values of 9 6 99 and 63 μg l respectively nadella et al 2009 2013 these values are well below the levels of these elements detected in ctr pvc and or pp leachates in the current study an alternative explanation may be the co occurrence of bpa in the leachates which is known to exert transcriptional and embryotoxic effects in m galloprovincialis as a result of its endocrine disrupting activity fabbri et al 2014 balbi et al 2016 in addition heterocyclic aromatic compounds such as the benzothiazole and phthalide present in the ctr and pvc leachates are known to be embryotoxic in fish and or mammal models sheftel 2000 this suggests that the main alterations could involve early embryogenic processes i e cleavage to gastrulation which are phylogenetically more conserved across taxa interestingly recent studies performed on sea urchins showed that a leachate from virgin pvc microplastics elicited significantly higher embryotoxicity than a direct particle administration through the same test medium nobre et al 2015 oliviero et al 2019 similarly our previous study showed that exposure to 3 μm ps particles did not affect mussel embryonic development capolupo et al 2018a leading to the hypothesis that sole embryo exposure to waterborne plastics may not allow reliable estimation of plastic additive effects the effects induced by leachates on the motility and survival of mussel d shaped veligers are presented in fig 4 ctr leachates significantly reduced larvae motility 48 h and survival 144 h following exposure to leachates in the range of 10 100 and 40 100 respectively fig 4a the pp leachate did not induce any effects on the motility of mussel larvae but caused a significant decrease in survival at the 100 concentration fig 4b no effect on either motility or survival was induced by the ps and pet leachates fig 4c e while a significant reduction of both parameters was induced by the pvc leachate in the range 20 100 fig 4d according to the nonlinear regression analysis an r squared value greater than 0 70 selected as a prerequisite for ec50 calculations could only be calculated for survival data for the ctr pp and pvc leachates and for motility data for the ctr and pvc leachates fig s4 table s8 the ec50 values for survival and motility for the ctr and pvc leachates were in the range of tested concentrations while the effective concentration for survival after exposure to the pp leachate treatments was calculated to be 100 fig 4 the lowest ec50 value for motility 18 75 of the total concentration was observed for the ctr leachate while the pvc leachates induced the lowest ec50 for survival at 54 04 fig 4 these results clearly indicate that leachates derived from different polymers vary considerably in their impacts on mussel larvae survival and motility this is consistent with previous studies lithner et al 2009 2012 that showed leachates from 20 out of 58 commercial plastic products affected the mobility of the freshwater cladoceran daphnia magna while effects on the survival of barnacle amphibalanus amphitrite nauplii were recorded in response to a range of plastic leachates including pvc pp ps and pet li et al 2016 only pp pvc and bioplastic derived leachates caused mortality in the copepod nitocra spinipes bejgarn et al 2015 this suggests that species or stage specific traits may influence the overall toxicity of leached additives although different additive chemical profiles in plastics comprised of the same polymer type may also play a role unlike embryos mussel larvae possess d shaped shells and well developed chemoreceptors that allow them to respond to chemical stressors by closing their valves and reducing the filtration rate wong and gerstenberger 2015 although these mechanisms would explain the absence of effects or the slight effects observed for exposure to the pp ps and pet leachates in the current study they contrast with the dose related response induced by exposure to ctr and pvc leachates it is possible that this might be related to the lower ph values i e ph 7 5 table s7 observed in both leachates relative to controls ph 8 1 a recent study demonstrated that exposure to ph lower than 7 6 inhibits compensatory mechanisms in mytilus larvae leading to metabolic alterations in the short term and increased mortality after prolonged exposure ventura et al 2016 4 conclusions this study provides new knowledge on the chemical characterization and ecotoxicological effects of chemical additive leachates from plastic and rubber materials under freshwater and marine conditions the chemical composition of leachates was complex and varied considerably among tested polymers with the main additives identified as plasticizers antioxidants antimicrobials lubricants vulcanizers and metals in line with the relatively high content of organic and inorganic compounds in the parent materials leachates from ctr and pvc exhibited the highest toxicity on algae growth and mussel early stages development survival and motility the lowest effects were generally observed for the pet leachates which contained the lowest number and concentration of measured additives evidence of toxicity were also observed for mussel gamete fertilization and the lms assessed in hemocytes suggesting that leachate exposure may affect different stages of the life cycle of aquatic organisms the magnitude of effects observed in this study suggest that organic and inorganic additives leached from plastic rubber polymers may cause substantially higher ecotoxicity than those previously reported following plastic ingestion although additives are subjected to a substantial dilution in natural environment ec50 values determined in this study showed that leachate concentrations of less than 3 may because for concern in enclosed ecosystems e g bays lagoons or lakes or oceanic hotspots where plastics tend to accumulate gesamp 2016 current knowledge on ecotoxicological effects of plastic leachates is based upon a small number of studies conducted using acute toxicity tests and different leaching processes further efforts are therefore required to standardize methods for leachate preparation and sublethal effects testing to obtain a more detailed understanding on the long term effects of plastic additive exposure to aquatic biota declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
