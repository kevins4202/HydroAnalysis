13965,eutrophication caused by excessive nitrogen phosphorous in water body has considerably serious impacts on the production and life of human being activated sludge a biological removal process is regarded as a promising and sustainable technology for wastewater treatment in this study a novel strain of denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism dpao was isolated from the activated sludge conducted the acclimation of anaerobic anoxic a o stage and anaerobic aerobic a a stage the removal efficiencies of no3 n and po4 3 p in bioreactor were 98 7 and 90 7 respectively the metabolic activity of dpaos was improved from 34 43 98 28 after a a stage the genetic identiﬁcation and morphological and biochemical characteristics of isolated strain were analyzed and discussed to determine it as a non fermentative delftia tsuruhatensis sodium acetate and ammonium sulfate peptone were testified to be optimal carbon source and nitrogen for the growth of this strain respectively furthermore the orthogonal test was measured and calculated to find that the order of key factors affecting the growth of this strain was ph nitrogen carbon according to computer response surface methodology the most suitable medium group for this strain as 4450 mg l of sodium acetate carbon source 1320 mg l of ammonium sulfate peptone nitrogen source and 7 85 of ph the ﬁndings of this work broadened up our comprehension of the biological removal process for dpaos during enhanced biological phosphorus removal keywords dpao non fermentative bacterium delftia tsuruhatensis growth conditions 1 introduction the eutrophication in freshwater and seawater around the world is becoming increasingly serious which has become one of the serious water environment problems facing human beings the main factors causing eutrophication are nitrogen and phosphorus 1 therefore the development and improvement of economical and sustainable techniques for reducing nitrogen and phosphorus content is an important priority for researchers to work in this area 2 3 chemical and biological methods are used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus however the cost for most chemical methods is high due to the addition of chemical agents accordingly struvite has also been proposed as a method to recover nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 2 because struvite is a valuable fertilizer to produce extra incomes for offsetting the high cost of chemical treatment 4 5 whereas economic feasibility and product quality of struvite formation may be still a problem in real wwtps thus the number of industrial scale applications is small 6 nevertheless enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr due to the high treatment performance is widely used in wwtps worldwide the ebpr technology has been a hot point in the field of sewage treatment worldwide the contradictions exposed problems and the phenomena found in the long term experiment of denitrification and dephosphorization technology have been studied by many publications 7 9 to put forward some new technologies viewpoints inferences and models some bacteria such as denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos in sludge from wwtps are isolated they can use nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 instead of oxygen o2 as electron acceptor to accumulate excessive phosphorous at anoxic condition 10 11 however dpaos are acclimatized with alteration condition of anaerobic anoxic a a becoming some bacteria using only no3 as electron acceptor the feature for using only no3 as electron acceptor is capable of saving 30 of o2 consumption and correspondingly reduce 50 of the amount of sludge 11 12 and during the last decade 40 excess sludge is used for agriculture and composting to gain extra benefits in the europe 13 biological phosphorus removal and denitrifying nitrogen removal can be completed in a denitrifying dephosphorization process by dpaos which is known as an eco friendly process for phosphorus and nitrogen removal up to now only a few strains have been purely identified performing the total physiological denitrifying and accumulating phosphorous process which includes a cycle of phosphate accumulation and release under aerobic conditions and anaerobic conditions it was the first time to use plate culture technology to isolate microorganisms pertaining to biological phosphorus removal more than 30 years ago 14 which confirmed that acinetobacter was the main bacterium to remove phosphorous it has been considered as the only phosphate accumulating organism pao in biological phosphorus removal for a long time however with the application of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish 16s rrna cloning library or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge many other microbial communities pertaining in biological phosphorus removal sludge were found 15 16 specific fish probes showed that acinetobacter is not superior to other strains such as betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria in actual treatment operation 17 the advance of high throughput sequencing hts provides a possible path for metagenomic information of various bacteria in full scale wttps to investigate bacteria communities and metabolic relationship via phylogenetic tree 18 19 the denitrification and phosphorous removal of dechloromonas a species dpao could be strengthened synergistically by zoogloea which was responsible for endogenous denitrification through hts 20 the population level structure and dynamic of accumulibacter were revealed using hts of polyphosphate kinase1 gene ppk1 and 16s rrna gene simultaneously 8 indicating that co occurrence of accumulibacter communities partially supported the exclusivity of two types although many molecular biology methods rapidly advance in recent years there are few dpaos can be purely cultured it is partly because some dpaos are not purely cultured by traditional methods or partly because some dpaos are unable to survive individually in media the physiological and biochemical characteristics of isolated dpaos are essential to the performance of denitrification and dephosphorization process nowadays denitrifying and phosphate accumulating process and its mechanism are the research interests in both academia and industry whereas the existence and growth of dpaos are key to develop the novel efficient and economic phosphorus removal equipment and optimize the technology of phosphorus and nitrogen removal the optimal conditions for dpaos are helpful to promote the development and progress of denitrifying phosphate accumulating technology however there are few reports on the characteristics of the pure dpaos presently especially on the optimization of the growth conditions of dpaos by computer response surface methodology in this study dpaos were enriched through the operation of intermittent sequencing batch reactor sbr including anaerobic anoxic a o stage and a a stage and the dpaos were tested to evaluate their metabolic activity after a o stage and after a a stage respectively suggesting whether dpaos majored in the acclimated activated sludge then the combinations of traditional and modern microbial separation and identification were used to separate microorganisms and determine the type of dpaos furthermore serval carbon sources and nitrogen sources on dpaos were performed respectively to consider which sources were beneficial to culture simultaneously orthogonal test and response surface methodology were both run to optimize the growth conditions of this isolated dpao this study is expected to provide theoretical basis for enrichment and domestication of dpaos development and improvement of traditional denitrifying phosphate accumulating technology of high efficiency and low energy consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and cultural medium the activated sludge utilized in this work was obtained from the end of the aeration tank in datansha wwtp a2 o technology guangzhou city china the cultured liquid medium with high phosphate content in this study was made up according to previous study 21 including ch3coona 3h2o na2hpo4 2h2o nh4cl mgso4 7h2o k2so4 cacl2 2h2o and trace mental elements per 1 l as shown in table 1 the wastewater was aerated with nitrogen gas for 20 min and stored in a refrigerator with temperature of 4 then adjusted to ph 7 0 5 and cultural solid medium was made of cultural liquid medium and agar 15 20 g l with adjusting ph 7 0 5 via sodium hydroxide solution 2 2 design of experimental system the batch bioreactor was made of plexiglass of which effective working volume was 15 l as indicated in fig 1 in the vertical direction of the reactor wall three sampling ports with drainage function were set at 2 l 6 l and 10 l a b c from the bottom the mixture harbouring sludge and cultural liquid medium was poured into bioreactor via water inlet on the cover plate the supernatant was discharged from the water outlet after sedimentation the cultured system was not aerated but was mixed evenly through agitator ta2 i shangtai the cod and phosphorus concentrations of influent water were controlled through different dosages of sodium acetate and k2hpo4 in order to avoid oxygen into reactor a plastic foam was placed on water surface and maintained well the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the mixture at low level less than 0 5 mg l dpaos were enriched processing in two stages keeping water temperature at 26 1 in each stage including 20 cycles of a o stage and 107 cycles a a stage the a o stage contained 5 5 h dividing anaerobic phase 3 h aerobic phase 2 h and sedimentation phase 0 5 h at a a stage anaerobic phase sedimentation phase anoxic phase and sedimentation phase lasted for 3 h 0 5 h 4 h and 0 5 respectively 22 before anoxic stage certain concentration of potassium nitrate solution was added to acclimate and enrich dpaos the dissolved oxygen in control system was kept and monitored below 0 5 mg l though portable redox potential meter ts 2 in anaerobic stage the wastewater entering anoxic sage was prepared according to 1 1 of no3 n po4 3 p without cod 2 3 analytical methods various nutrient parameters including total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 n phosphate po4 3 p and cod was measured each cycle according to the study of lu et al 22 glycogen was measured by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc and the analysis of intracellular phb in bacterial cells was performed based to the method as described in previous study 21 the outcomes of experiments and tests were expressed as means standard deviation values 2 4 metabolic activity on dpaos relative metabolic activity rma of dpaos was measured grounded on a previous literature 21 the two collected activated sludge samples 300 ml before and after a a stage went through three times wash by distilled water before transferred into reactor to mix with synthetic wastewater the ph and temperature in sbr systems were kept at 7 5 0 5 and 22 1 c the system was carried out in an anaerobic condition for 3 h then the two sludges were divided into two parts to culture in anoxic condition and aerobic condition for 4 h respectively phosphate concentrations were tested each hour thus rmas of dpaos to paos were calculated based to eq 1 this quotient would represent the metabolic activity of dpaos by revealing the ratio of dnpaos paos 1 rma po4 3 p1 po4 3 p2 po4 3 p1 po4 3 p3 100 where po4 3 p1 is the concentration of po4 3 p at the end of anaerobic stage po4 3 p2 is the concentration of po4 3 p at the end of anoxic stage and po4 3 p3 was the concentration of po4 3 p at the end of aerobic stage 2 5 isolation and identiﬁcation of strain a small amount of sludge taken out from the last cycle of a a stage was poured into a 50 ml flat bottom plastic centrifuge tube with 3 5 glass beads to disperse the bacterial micelles via shaking 1 2 min the sample was diluted by sterile water with 10 000 times in laminar flow the diluted cultural liquid by taking sterile syringe was injected into sterilized cultural medium without oxygen adding rubber plug and aluminum cap to seal and fix the cultural liquid contained anhydrous sodium acetate 5 0 g kh2po4 0 25 g mgso4 7h2o 0 5 g cacl2 h2o 0 2 g nh4 2so4 2 0 g trace element 1 0 ml per 1 l distilled water with ph 7 0 and trace element fecl3 1 5 mg cuso4 0 03 mg ki 0 18 mg mncl2 0 12 mg znso4 0 12 mg cocl3 0 15 edta 10 0 mg per 1 l the cultured medium was wrapped with black cloth and put into constant temperature oscillator to culture for 5 7 days at 30 and 150 rmp min isolated strain by inoculation loop was cultivated on cultural solid medium through dilution plating method genomic dna of isolated strain strain zk 1 was extracted by using ezup dna extraction kit sk8255 sangon biotech shanghai china according to the company s instruction partial 16s rdna gene sequence was subjected to polymerase chain reaction pcr ampliﬁcation using the following primers 27f 5 agrgtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and 1492 r 5 gytaccttgttacgactt 3 based on previous described method 21 the resulting 16s rrna gene sequences were aligned and compared with known sequences in genbank database http www ncbi nlm nih gov via using basic local alignment search tool blast using clustalx to align sequences the phylogenetic tree was made by mega software version 5 01 2 6 identiﬁcation of morphological and biochemical characteristics shape and size of bacterial cells were observed by optical microscope tests of biochemical characteristics including gram reaction oxidase test catalase contact enzyme test glucose fermentation test indole production test nitrate reduction test and oxygen demand test were carried out according to our previous study 21 characteristics of isolated strain were compared with those of reported strains grounded to bergey s manual of determinative bacteriology 2 7 optimal cultural tests on strain zk 1 to identify the optimal growth conditions the cultural tests of strain zk 1 were studied in the flasks with beforementioned cultured media except where ammonium sulfate was applied as nitrogen source and different carbon sources in addition various nitrogen sources were also used to study the growth of strain zk 1 with optimal carbon source based on the level table of experimental factors l9 33 orthogonal test was designed by spss statistical software spss 25 to demonstrate the influences of different factors on the growth activity of strain zk 1 table 2 these tests remained 140 rpm 30 and their turbidity was measured after 3 days by measuring absorbance in 650 nm by visible spectrophotometer absorbance and the key growth factors were preliminarily determined 2 8 response surface methodology on growth conditions according to the main factors affecting the growth of microorganisms including carbon source nitrogen source and ph as the result of single factor test analysis were selected as research objects the turbidity of bacteria was a response value to design response surface analysis test containing 27 groups of tests grounded to the test design table table 3 per 1 l distilled water besides other components and operations was assistant with descried section 2 7 the central composite response surface design expert 12 0 was used for processing to obtain the optimization conditions of computer response surface test 3 result and discussion 3 1 source of acclimatized activated sludge the original activated sludge was carried out in 20 cycles of a o stage and 107 cycles of a a stage as mentioned in section 2 2 the acclimatized activated sludge chose in last cycles of a o stage was used to study its strains when the removal efficiencies of no3 n and po4 3 p were 98 7 and 90 7 respectively the results in this work were basically in accordance with the study of lu et al 22 meaning that the acclimatized activated sludge had already achieved certain level for denitrifying and accumulating phosphorous 3 2 changes of metabolic activities of dpaos wachtmeister et al 23 and mino et al 24 reported that the changes of rma of dpaos could be embodied by the phosphate removal rate at aerobic stage and anoxic stage to show the ratio of dpaos to paos as schematized in fig 2 a phosphate concentration before a a stage decreased from 35 50 mg l to 0 34 mg l and 23 40 mg l under aerobic condition 4 h and anoxic condition 4 h respectively rma calculated based on eq 1 was 34 43 before the acclimatization of a a stage nevertheless fig 2 b found that the sludge sample after a a stage considerably dropped at anoxic and aerobic stages in this work the removal efficiency of po4 3 p at anoxic and aerobic stages reached 82 89 and 92 70 respectively which coincided with section 3 1 it was noted that rma was improved to reach 98 28 which was much higher than that reported by previous studies 20 25 since the sludge in previous studies 20 25 were directly pumped into anoxic stage without performing a o stage to enhance the proportion of dpaos interestingly phosphate concentration at aerobic stage was always lower than that at anoxic stage which coincided with the fact that dpaos were capable of utilizing o2 and no3 as electron acceptor while paos were merely able to use o2 as electron acceptor 26 meanwhile phosphate concentration at aerobic stage decreased dramatically fig 2 which was because the content and activity of dpaos were relatively high after conducting acclimation the outcomes in fig 2 strongly revealed that dpaos was enriched successfully and these dpaos had well the function of denitrification and dephosphorization 3 3 strain identiﬁcation 3 3 1 genetic identiﬁcation of strain zk 1 the pcr amplification on 16s rdna of strain zk 1 was conducted and the length of the sequenced fragment was 1500 bp this sequence was compared with genbank database by blast program including nuclear collection nr nt and 16s rrna sequences bacteria and archaea the 1400 bp 16s rdna sequence of strain zk 1 was submitted to ncbi accession number mt012187 and aligned against known gene sequences using blast to determine homology the phylogenetic tree of strain zk 1 and related species was shown in fig 3 showing that strain zk 1 and delftia tsuruhatensis gathered into one branch this strain had 99 homology with delftia tsuruhatensis strain bn hky6 delftia tsuruhatensis strain t7 and delftia tsuruhatensis strain nbrc 16741 consequently it was prettily likely to be the same strain as delftia tsuruhatensis 3 3 2 morphological and biochemical characteristics of strain zk 1 the surface of cultured colonies was smooth slightly convex translucent even edge and did not form pigments on agar plate the microscopic examination of the strains obtained in section 2 4 showed that the morphology of the bacteria was mainly slightly curved short rod shaped with different lengths 0 7 1 2 2 4 4 0 μm and the strain arranged in the form of individual or pairs and was a gram negative bacillus these features were greatly coincided with the description of shigematsu et al et al 27 based to bergey s manual of determinative bacteriology strain zk 1 was classified as delftia sp on account of its related species physiological and biochemical indexes table 4 it possessed contact enzyme and oxidase not conduct hydrolysis carbohydrates reaction concerning starch and gelatin generally which was somehow in accord with the study of juárez jiménez et al 28 and other species related genus delftia 27 29 32 table 4 phosphohydrolase was found in some species cell revealing that polyphosphate if exist would be degraded and assimilated simultaneously the deficiency of glucose fermentation and the partial usage of fructose implied that strain zk 1 didn t have enough energy merely depending on its own growth 28 the results was assistant with morphological and biochemical characteristics of delftia tsuruhatensis 27 while delftia tsuruhatensis in study of shigematsu et al 27 was enriched by assimilating terephthalate as unique carbon source and energy arabinose mannitol glucose and xylose were not used by strain zk 1 whereas strain zk 1 was able to reduce nitrate into nitrite utilize phosphate and degrade phb as energy which meat that strain zk 1 was a dpao bacteria in activated sludge could be divided into two categories namely non fermentative and fermentative bacteria according to their biochemical characteristics 33 the strain zk 1 was continuously acclimated with acetic then its non fermentative function was strengthened the abilities of denitrification and dephosphorization would have good appearance as shown in section 3 2 accordingly since non fermentative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa had the stronger function of denitrifying and accumulating phosphate because the more complete the decomposition of phosphorus was at anaerobic stage accordingly the greater the amount of polyphosphate was at anoxic stage 21 however other related species on genus delftia could be also assumed that they possess the ability of accumulating phosphate additionally delftia sp was capable of strongly enduring to oxygen than microvirgula aerodenitrificans which could remove 5 3 6 15 of no3 n under 64 96 of saturation on dissolved oxygen in 3 days 34 meaning that delftia survived in a o stage was possible delftia tsuruhatensis in this work was capable of accumulating phosphorous and denitrifying as a non fermentative dpao delftia sp was typically considered as denitrifier which could reduce nitrate into other nitrogen oxides such as nitric oxide 35 nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide 27 via nitrite firstly and its mechanism of denitrification was widely analyzed by previous stuies 27 36 37 thus this strain would be used to remove contaminants containing nitrogen for potential commercial application in industry this fact that d tsuruhatensis was denitrifying bacteria was comprehensively reported by many literatures however as we are concerned the phenomenon that d tsuruhatensis act as a dpao is not still discovered until to now 3 4 optimization of growth conditions of strain zk 1 3 4 1 optimal carbon source generally carbon source as an important factor influencing nitrogen removal could sustain the life of heterotrophic bacteria by providing energy source 38 and carbon is the skeleton of various organic substances in cells strain zk 1 belongs to chemoheterotrophic bacteria it is necessary to synthesize phb from volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid and in water body to provide energy to ensure excessive accumulation for phosphate under anoxic condition and glucose and yeast extract are common carbon sources for bacterial culture 39 accordingly the outcomes for diverse carbon sources table 5 indicated a phenomenon that the growth conditions of strain zk 1 appeared a big difference it could be explained by insight that there might be different mechanisms for strain zk 1 to perform denitrification and dephosphorization on different carbon source overall the growth situation of strain zk 1 with compound carbon source was better than that of single carbon source since the diversity of carbon source was beneficial for avoiding toxicity with high concentration and a strain typically possess was capable of assimilating a broad range of organic carbon sources as illustrated in table 5 the turbidity of strain zk 1 grown with glucose yeast extract serving as carbon source reached 0 613 after culturing 3 days and that with sodium acetate glucose followed meanwhile the turbidity with sodium acetate and sodium acetate yeast was 0 732 and 0 503 respectively which revealed that sodium acetate was degraded and assimilated by dpao at a higher absorption rate and the zk 1 cells existed with the form of relative satiation therefore they could rapidly complete their growth and reproduction without depleting their own energy and material 40 nevertheless when glucose was only carbon source the turbidity of bacteria was only 0 322 which indicated that glucose was not absorbed well and phbs producing at anaerobic stage via absorbing carbon source were rarely stored and transformed 1 because strain zk 1 was most similar to delftia tsuruhatensis which could consume sodium acetate but not glucose as a non fermentative bacterium 27 accordingly the best carbon source was sodium acetate which was identical with previous papers considered that dpaos growing with sodium acetate as sole carbon source showed best performance on phosphate accumulating and denitrifying 1 41 3 4 2 optimal nitrogen source the different growth conditions on strain zk 1 in various nitrogen sources were shown in table 5 the highest bacterial turbidity of strain zk 1 was 1 438 and 1 189 when bacteria grew medium with peptone and sulfate peptone respectively such a behavior about od650 on performing with peptone was a little higher than the previous literature 42 the main reason for this phenomenon was that strain zk 1 experiencing the acclimatization at a o and a a stage had better growth activity nevertheless combined with plate test and microscopy test the cultural medium with peptone as nitrogen source was easier to be infected by spores and in culture process the growth of spores was dominant which resulted in high turbidity of bacteria in the medium with peptone thereby the data was greatly interfered by spores however strain zk 1 was cultured with ammonium sulfate for 3 days od650 was only 0 314 showing that organic nitrogen source was better than inorganic nitrogen source for the growth of strain zk 1 however the culture medium with ammonium sulfate and peptone was not infected by spores which was mainly because the growth of spores was able to be inhibited by peptone 43 in the microscopy test it showed that the morphology of bacteria was single which was consistent with morphological character of d tsuruhatensis therefore the optimal nitrogen source of d tsuruhatensis was ammonium sulfate peptone the various growth status of strain zk 1 in different nitrogen sources substrates demonstrated organic nitrogen was more conducive to growth than inorganic nitrogen and the mixed organic nitrogen source far superior to that on a single organic or inorganic nitrogen source meaning that the nutrient of complex organic nitrogen source for strain zk 1 was affluent these characteristics on nitrogen sources coincided with thauera linaloolentis accession number nr025283 1 in genbank ncbi 42 3 4 3 analysis of orthogonal test results the three basic nutrients of microorganisms are water carbonaceous substance and nitrogen containing substance the physiological activity of bacteria is closely related to the ph in environment generally speaking the optimal ph value range of microorganisms involved in sewage treatment is 6 5 8 5 44 and the optimal environment ph for most bacteria growth is 6 8 45 therefore coupled with biochemical characteristics of strain zk 1 three factors including nitrogen source nitrogen source and ph table 6 were used to design test scheme to preliminarily study the growth conditions of strain zk 1 it could be seen from table 6 that the r of ph was the largest followed by that of nitrogen source and that of carbon source is the smallest consequently ph was the vital factor affecting the growth of strain zk 1 followed by nitrogen source and carbon source has the least effect on the growth of strain zk 1 for microorganisms ph has a great influence on their life activities which is mainly used to change the charge of proteins nucleic acids and other biological macromolecules ph can also change the charge of cell membrane which leads to changes in the ability of microbial cells to absorb nutrients also to change the availability of nutrients in the environment and the toxicity of harmful substances 46 at the same time the increase in ph would increase the number of free ammonia whose toxicity was more violent than ionic ammonia under the condition of alkalescence also the ph in the cultured system influenced nitrification process to some extent since it was able to change nh3 nh4 n and hno2 no2 equilibrium 3 47 nevertheless slightly alkaline habitat would facilitate nitrification bacterium because ammonia monooxygenase would take advantage of more nh3 contained in medium as the actual substrate instead of having a priority for nh4 48 hence ph has the most significant impact on the growth of strain zk 1 consequently ammonia in nitrogen source was closely associated to ph the effect of nitrogen source on the growth of strain zk 1 was greater than that of carbon source by comparing the k of each factor the fact that k3 of ph was the largest table 6 in addition the k2 of nitrogen source and carbon source was the largest among three k accordingly it was preliminarily determined that the optimal ph for strain zk 1 growth was 8 the optimal nitrogen source was 1 0 g and the optimal carbon source was 2 5 g the optimal conditions for nitrogen source carbon source and ph were pretty close with aforementioned cultural medium nevertheless under low ph the excessive high concentration of hydrogen ion destroys the communication between the sensor located in the cytoplasmic membrane and the regulator located in the cytoplasmic membrane resulting in the loss of control of the phosphate regulator controlling the phosphorus metabolism of bacteria in this way more acetate is needed for phosphate absorption rate per unit mass released at low ph at the same time since the energy released by phosphate decomposition can not be used to convert acetate into phb for storage anaerobic phosphorus release and further nitrogen and phosphorus removal at anoxic condition were inhibited 49 it s important to note from table 6 that when ph was only 6 the od650 approached to 0 indicating the survival of strain zk 1 in little low ph was severely restrained when the ph is too high it will lead to the precipitation of metal phosphate but will affect the phosphorus release effect of strain zk 1 in anaerobic environment therefore the optimal condition for ph was kept partial alkalinity combined with its physiological and biochemical characteristics besides this strain zk 1 showed high growth performance with a wide range of carbon and nitrogen indicating strain zk 1 had high application potential in ebpr including the piggery waste with c n of 4 7 and the municipal landﬁll leachate with high c n 50 these outcomes implied that c n ratio did not play a vital role in the process of denitriﬁcation and dephosphorization of strain zk 1 whereas due to taking cost effectiveness into consideration c n ratio should not be applied at high level in the future application 3 4 4 analysis of computer response surface methodology in order to screen the important variables affected the growth conditions of strain zk 1 a 26 runs design was used to screen three factors the response was the average bacterial turbidity after 3 days of incubation and all experiments were conducted in two replicates table 7 the f value p value and lack of fit were 30 077 0 0001 and 0 212 of model table 8 indicating that the quadratic equation model was extremely significant ph and b2 and d2 in the quadratic term were all significant factors simultaneously p 0 5 whereas the other interactions were insignificant p 0 05 under the tested range fig 4 elaborated that the predicted value of model was basically consistent with actual value and had good linear correlation accordingly the model was feasible in practical application within the level range of factors selected in this paper according to established mathematical model the optimal growth conditions of strain zk 1 were as follows carbon source sodium acetate was 4 45 g 4450 mg l nitrogen source ammonium sulfate peptone was 1 32 g 1320 mg l ph value was 7 85 and bacterial turbidity would reach 1 239 this meant that the ability of denitrifying and phosphate accumulating of strain zk 1 was well inspired which was in accord with the previous studies 1 51 however delftia tsuruhatensis reached optimal condition when ph was 7 which differed from a previous study 27 the reason could be partially because delftia tsuruhatensis in this study was acclimated to denitrify and phosphorous accumulating while that in a previous study 27 was enriched to treat terephthalate from activated sludge the divergence of goal to domesticate this strain and media to culture this strain effected the optimal cultural requirement for ph and because strain zk 1 could show better performance at alkaline condition due to nh4 as nitrogen source under the condition of the above prediction parameters three parallel experiments were conducted and spss10 0 was used to test the reliability of the model the mean value of turbidity was 1 241 the degree of freedom was 3 and the p value was 0 038 which implied that optimized process parameters are feasible 3 5 interaction between factors the quadratic regression fitting equations of carbon source nitrogen source and ph influencing growth of strain zk 1 were calculated by design expert software as shown in eq 2 2 od650 1 04 0 7 a 0 027 b 0 41 c 0 031 a 0 078 a c 0 012 b c 0 1 a2 0 32 b2 0 28 c2 where a b and c represent carbon source nitrogen source and ph respectively some publications have revealed that the major factors affecting the growth of dpaos are nitrogen sources carbon sources and ph 52 53 the turbidity of bacteria would gradually increase with the increase in carbon source or nitrogen source but after exceeding 4 06 g for carbon source or exceeded 1 40 g for carbon source od650 began to decrease fig 5 a this might be due to the fact that the amount of carbon and nitrogen sources at this ph value exceeded that required for bacterial growth resulting in the formation of adverse components inside the bacteria however nitrogen source had a signiﬁcant impact on od650 for any of the initial concentrations of carbon source suggesting that nitrogen source could have great influence on the growth of strain zk 1 the outcome was able to coincide with orthogonal test while carbon source was normally more vital than nitrogen source for most organisms the importance for nitrogen source in this work was because strain zk 1 as dpao much relied on nitrogen relative to carbon to denitrification meanwhile fig 5 b showed the interaction of carbon source amount and ph on the growth of strain zk 1 most dpaos perform phosphorus removal denitriﬁcation and normal metabolic activity by utilizing carbon sources as the nutrient for microbial growth in denitriﬁcation phosphorus removal systems 54 when the ph was fixed biomass concentration increased gradually with the increase in carbon source then when carbon source increased to a certain extent the bacterial turbidity increased gently fig 5 b an increase in bacterial turbidity with an increase in carbon source concentration was due to the fact that biomass is mainly controlled by the carbon source and is essential for building up biomass 55 on the other hand no matter how much carbon source was added bacterial turbidity increased with the increase of ph ranging from 6 to 8 in comparison with one factor at a time approach in this study the suitable decrease in the amount of carbon source concentration can remarkably reduce the cost of cultivation since the cost of glucose is estimated to be 80 of total medium cost 56 otherwise alternatively cheaper and more optimal carbon sources have been suggested to replace acetic acid for lowering culture costs the highest growth was achieved at a ph of 8 when the od650 rose to 1 16 since the charge state and redox potential was changed following the ph in the culture medium to affect enzymatic reactions and microbial absorption of nutrients 57 the combination of nitrogen source concentration and ﬂow rate manifested a relatively even response with function to the growth of strain zk 1 than fig 5 a b fig 5 c showed that when the amount of nitrogen source was from 0 5 g to 1 25 g the bacterial turbidity increased gradually with the increase in ph and increased gradually with the increase in the amount of nitrogen source at ph 7 5 8 when nitrogen source attained 1 12 g and ph was 7 76 the bacterial turbidity reached a highest situation when the amount of nitrogen source was 1 25 2 00 g biomass production would increase following the increase in ph but decrease after ph passed 7 5 the result might be because that the partial ionic ammonia changed to free ammonia under the condition of alkalescency while free ammonia had stronger toxicity than ionic ammonia which would poison microorganisms 50 4 conclusion in this work the raw activated sludge at the end of aeration tank of sewage treatment plant ran 20 cycles of a o stage and successive 107 cycles of a a stage in intermittent phosphate accumulating and nitrogen device the changes of metabolic activity of dpaos were analyzed at a o and a a stages proving that the relative abundant of dpaos had great enhancement between a o stage and a a stage a strain had function of denitrification and dephosphorization was isolated lonely from the aforementioned sludge which was named as strain zk 1 the 16s rdna identification and characteristics on physiological and biochemical indexes of strain zk 1 from the perspective of molecular biology were tested respectively suggesting that strain zk 1 was identified as delftia tsuruhatensis the strain was likely to be a new non fermentative dpao was proved the results grounded on optimal tests showed that the best carbon source and nitrogen source were sodium acetate and ammonium sulfate peptone respectively the orthogonal test based on optimal carbon source and nitrogen source was measured and calculated finding that

13965,eutrophication caused by excessive nitrogen phosphorous in water body has considerably serious impacts on the production and life of human being activated sludge a biological removal process is regarded as a promising and sustainable technology for wastewater treatment in this study a novel strain of denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism dpao was isolated from the activated sludge conducted the acclimation of anaerobic anoxic a o stage and anaerobic aerobic a a stage the removal efficiencies of no3 n and po4 3 p in bioreactor were 98 7 and 90 7 respectively the metabolic activity of dpaos was improved from 34 43 98 28 after a a stage the genetic identiﬁcation and morphological and biochemical characteristics of isolated strain were analyzed and discussed to determine it as a non fermentative delftia tsuruhatensis sodium acetate and ammonium sulfate peptone were testified to be optimal carbon source and nitrogen for the growth of this strain respectively furthermore the orthogonal test was measured and calculated to find that the order of key factors affecting the growth of this strain was ph nitrogen carbon according to computer response surface methodology the most suitable medium group for this strain as 4450 mg l of sodium acetate carbon source 1320 mg l of ammonium sulfate peptone nitrogen source and 7 85 of ph the ﬁndings of this work broadened up our comprehension of the biological removal process for dpaos during enhanced biological phosphorus removal keywords dpao non fermentative bacterium delftia tsuruhatensis growth conditions 1 introduction the eutrophication in freshwater and seawater around the world is becoming increasingly serious which has become one of the serious water environment problems facing human beings the main factors causing eutrophication are nitrogen and phosphorus 1 therefore the development and improvement of economical and sustainable techniques for reducing nitrogen and phosphorus content is an important priority for researchers to work in this area 2 3 chemical and biological methods are used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus however the cost for most chemical methods is high due to the addition of chemical agents accordingly struvite has also been proposed as a method to recover nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 2 because struvite is a valuable fertilizer to produce extra incomes for offsetting the high cost of chemical treatment 4 5 whereas economic feasibility and product quality of struvite formation may be still a problem in real wwtps thus the number of industrial scale applications is small 6 nevertheless enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr due to the high treatment performance is widely used in wwtps worldwide the ebpr technology has been a hot point in the field of sewage treatment worldwide the contradictions exposed problems and the phenomena found in the long term experiment of denitrification and dephosphorization technology have been studied by many publications 7 9 to put forward some new technologies viewpoints inferences and models some bacteria such as denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos in sludge from wwtps are isolated they can use nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 instead of oxygen o2 as electron acceptor to accumulate excessive phosphorous at anoxic condition 10 11 however dpaos are acclimatized with alteration condition of anaerobic anoxic a a becoming some bacteria using only no3 as electron acceptor the feature for using only no3 as electron acceptor is capable of saving 30 of o2 consumption and correspondingly reduce 50 of the amount of sludge 11 12 and during the last decade 40 excess sludge is used for agriculture and composting to gain extra benefits in the europe 13 biological phosphorus removal and denitrifying nitrogen removal can be completed in a denitrifying dephosphorization process by dpaos which is known as an eco friendly process for phosphorus and nitrogen removal up to now only a few strains have been purely identified performing the total physiological denitrifying and accumulating phosphorous process which includes a cycle of phosphate accumulation and release under aerobic conditions and anaerobic conditions it was the first time to use plate culture technology to isolate microorganisms pertaining to biological phosphorus removal more than 30 years ago 14 which confirmed that acinetobacter was the main bacterium to remove phosphorous it has been considered as the only phosphate accumulating organism pao in biological phosphorus removal for a long time however with the application of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish 16s rrna cloning library or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge many other microbial communities pertaining in biological phosphorus removal sludge were found 15 16 specific fish probes showed that acinetobacter is not superior to other strains such as betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria in actual treatment operation 17 the advance of high throughput sequencing hts provides a possible path for metagenomic information of various bacteria in full scale wttps to investigate bacteria communities and metabolic relationship via phylogenetic tree 18 19 the denitrification and phosphorous removal of dechloromonas a species dpao could be strengthened synergistically by zoogloea which was responsible for endogenous denitrification through hts 20 the population level structure and dynamic of accumulibacter were revealed using hts of polyphosphate kinase1 gene ppk1 and 16s rrna gene simultaneously 8 indicating that co occurrence of accumulibacter communities partially supported the exclusivity of two types although many molecular biology methods rapidly advance in recent years there are few dpaos can be purely cultured it is partly because some dpaos are not purely cultured by traditional methods or partly because some dpaos are unable to survive individually in media the physiological and biochemical characteristics of isolated dpaos are essential to the performance of denitrification and dephosphorization process nowadays denitrifying and phosphate accumulating process and its mechanism are the research interests in both academia and industry whereas the existence and growth of dpaos are key to develop the novel efficient and economic phosphorus removal equipment and optimize the technology of phosphorus and nitrogen removal the optimal conditions for dpaos are helpful to promote the development and progress of denitrifying phosphate accumulating technology however there are few reports on the characteristics of the pure dpaos presently especially on the optimization of the growth conditions of dpaos by computer response surface methodology in this study dpaos were enriched through the operation of intermittent sequencing batch reactor sbr including anaerobic anoxic a o stage and a a stage and the dpaos were tested to evaluate their metabolic activity after a o stage and after a a stage respectively suggesting whether dpaos majored in the acclimated activated sludge then the combinations of traditional and modern microbial separation and identification were used to separate microorganisms and determine the type of dpaos furthermore serval carbon sources and nitrogen sources on dpaos were performed respectively to consider which sources were beneficial to culture simultaneously orthogonal test and response surface methodology were both run to optimize the growth conditions of this isolated dpao this study is expected to provide theoretical basis for enrichment and domestication of dpaos development and improvement of traditional denitrifying phosphate accumulating technology of high efficiency and low energy consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and cultural medium the activated sludge utilized in this work was obtained from the end of the aeration tank in datansha wwtp a2 o technology guangzhou city china the cultured liquid medium with high phosphate content in this study was made up according to previous study 21 including ch3coona 3h2o na2hpo4 2h2o nh4cl mgso4 7h2o k2so4 cacl2 2h2o and trace mental elements per 1 l as shown in table 1 the wastewater was aerated with nitrogen gas for 20 min and stored in a refrigerator with temperature of 4 then adjusted to ph 7 0 5 and cultural solid medium was made of cultural liquid medium and agar 15 20 g l with adjusting ph 7 0 5 via sodium hydroxide solution 2 2 design of experimental system the batch bioreactor was made of plexiglass of which effective working volume was 15 l as indicated in fig 1 in the vertical direction of the reactor wall three sampling ports with drainage function were set at 2 l 6 l and 10 l a b c from the bottom the mixture harbouring sludge and cultural liquid medium was poured into bioreactor via water inlet on the cover plate the supernatant was discharged from the water outlet after sedimentation the cultured system was not aerated but was mixed evenly through agitator ta2 i shangtai the cod and phosphorus concentrations of influent water were controlled through different dosages of sodium acetate and k2hpo4 in order to avoid oxygen into reactor a plastic foam was placed on water surface and maintained well the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the mixture at low level less than 0 5 mg l dpaos were enriched processing in two stages keeping water temperature at 26 1 in each stage including 20 cycles of a o stage and 107 cycles a a stage the a o stage contained 5 5 h dividing anaerobic phase 3 h aerobic phase 2 h and sedimentation phase 0 5 h at a a stage anaerobic phase sedimentation phase anoxic phase and sedimentation phase lasted for 3 h 0 5 h 4 h and 0 5 respectively 22 before anoxic stage certain concentration of potassium nitrate solution was added to acclimate and enrich dpaos the dissolved oxygen in control system was kept and monitored below 0 5 mg l though portable redox potential meter ts 2 in anaerobic stage the wastewater entering anoxic sage was prepared according to 1 1 of no3 n po4 3 p without cod 2 3 analytical methods various nutrient parameters including total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 n phosphate po4 3 p and cod was measured each cycle according to the study of lu et al 22 glycogen was measured by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc and the analysis of intracellular phb in bacterial cells was performed based to the method as described in previous study 21 the outcomes of experiments and tests were expressed as means standard deviation values 2 4 metabolic activity on dpaos relative metabolic activity rma of dpaos was measured grounded on a previous literature 21 the two collected activated sludge samples 300 ml before and after a a stage went through three times wash by distilled water before transferred into reactor to mix with synthetic wastewater the ph and temperature in sbr systems were kept at 7 5 0 5 and 22 1 c the system was carried out in an anaerobic condition for 3 h then the two sludges were divided into two parts to culture in anoxic condition and aerobic condition for 4 h respectively phosphate concentrations were tested each hour thus rmas of dpaos to paos were calculated based to eq 1 this quotient would represent the metabolic activity of dpaos by revealing the ratio of dnpaos paos 1 rma po4 3 p1 po4 3 p2 po4 3 p1 po4 3 p3 100 where po4 3 p1 is the concentration of po4 3 p at the end of anaerobic stage po4 3 p2 is the concentration of po4 3 p at the end of anoxic stage and po4 3 p3 was the concentration of po4 3 p at the end of aerobic stage 2 5 isolation and identiﬁcation of strain a small amount of sludge taken out from the last cycle of a a stage was poured into a 50 ml flat bottom plastic centrifuge tube with 3 5 glass beads to disperse the bacterial micelles via shaking 1 2 min the sample was diluted by sterile water with 10 000 times in laminar flow the diluted cultural liquid by taking sterile syringe was injected into sterilized cultural medium without oxygen adding rubber plug and aluminum cap to seal and fix the cultural liquid contained anhydrous sodium acetate 5 0 g kh2po4 0 25 g mgso4 7h2o 0 5 g cacl2 h2o 0 2 g nh4 2so4 2 0 g trace element 1 0 ml per 1 l distilled water with ph 7 0 and trace element fecl3 1 5 mg cuso4 0 03 mg ki 0 18 mg mncl2 0 12 mg znso4 0 12 mg cocl3 0 15 edta 10 0 mg per 1 l the cultured medium was wrapped with black cloth and put into constant temperature oscillator to culture for 5 7 days at 30 and 150 rmp min isolated strain by inoculation loop was cultivated on cultural solid medium through dilution plating method genomic dna of isolated strain strain zk 1 was extracted by using ezup dna extraction kit sk8255 sangon biotech shanghai china according to the company s instruction partial 16s rdna gene sequence was subjected to polymerase chain reaction pcr ampliﬁcation using the following primers 27f 5 agrgtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and 1492 r 5 gytaccttgttacgactt 3 based on previous described method 21 the resulting 16s rrna gene sequences were aligned and compared with known sequences in genbank database http www ncbi nlm nih gov via using basic local alignment search tool blast using clustalx to align sequences the phylogenetic tree was made by mega software version 5 01 2 6 identiﬁcation of morphological and biochemical characteristics shape and size of bacterial cells were observed by optical microscope tests of biochemical characteristics including gram reaction oxidase test catalase contact enzyme test glucose fermentation test indole production test nitrate reduction test and oxygen demand test were carried out according to our previous study 21 characteristics of isolated strain were compared with those of reported strains grounded to bergey s manual of determinative bacteriology 2 7 optimal cultural tests on strain zk 1 to identify the optimal growth conditions the cultural tests of strain zk 1 were studied in the flasks with beforementioned cultured media except where ammonium sulfate was applied as nitrogen source and different carbon sources in addition various nitrogen sources were also used to study the growth of strain zk 1 with optimal carbon source based on the level table of experimental factors l9 33 orthogonal test was designed by spss statistical software spss 25 to demonstrate the influences of different factors on the growth activity of strain zk 1 table 2 these tests remained 140 rpm 30 and their turbidity was measured after 3 days by measuring absorbance in 650 nm by visible spectrophotometer absorbance and the key growth factors were preliminarily determined 2 8 response surface methodology on growth conditions according to the main factors affecting the growth of microorganisms including carbon source nitrogen source and ph as the result of single factor test analysis were selected as research objects the turbidity of bacteria was a response value to design response surface analysis test containing 27 groups of tests grounded to the test design table table 3 per 1 l distilled water besides other components and operations was assistant with descried section 2 7 the central composite response surface design expert 12 0 was used for processing to obtain the optimization conditions of computer response surface test 3 result and discussion 3 1 source of acclimatized activated sludge the original activated sludge was carried out in 20 cycles of a o stage and 107 cycles of a a stage as mentioned in section 2 2 the acclimatized activated sludge chose in last cycles of a o stage was used to study its strains when the removal efficiencies of no3 n and po4 3 p were 98 7 and 90 7 respectively the results in this work were basically in accordance with the study of lu et al 22 meaning that the acclimatized activated sludge had already achieved certain level for denitrifying and accumulating phosphorous 3 2 changes of metabolic activities of dpaos wachtmeister et al 23 and mino et al 24 reported that the changes of rma of dpaos could be embodied by the phosphate removal rate at aerobic stage and anoxic stage to show the ratio of dpaos to paos as schematized in fig 2 a phosphate concentration before a a stage decreased from 35 50 mg l to 0 34 mg l and 23 40 mg l under aerobic condition 4 h and anoxic condition 4 h respectively rma calculated based on eq 1 was 34 43 before the acclimatization of a a stage nevertheless fig 2 b found that the sludge sample after a a stage considerably dropped at anoxic and aerobic stages in this work the removal efficiency of po4 3 p at anoxic and aerobic stages reached 82 89 and 92 70 respectively which coincided with section 3 1 it was noted that rma was improved to reach 98 28 which was much higher than that reported by previous studies 20 25 since the sludge in previous studies 20 25 were directly pumped into anoxic stage without performing a o stage to enhance the proportion of dpaos interestingly phosphate concentration at aerobic stage was always lower than that at anoxic stage which coincided with the fact that dpaos were capable of utilizing o2 and no3 as electron acceptor while paos were merely able to use o2 as electron acceptor 26 meanwhile phosphate concentration at aerobic stage decreased dramatically fig 2 which was because the content and activity of dpaos were relatively high after conducting acclimation the outcomes in fig 2 strongly revealed that dpaos was enriched successfully and these dpaos had well the function of denitrification and dephosphorization 3 3 strain identiﬁcation 3 3 1 genetic identiﬁcation of strain zk 1 the pcr amplification on 16s rdna of strain zk 1 was conducted and the length of the sequenced fragment was 1500 bp this sequence was compared with genbank database by blast program including nuclear collection nr nt and 16s rrna sequences bacteria and archaea the 1400 bp 16s rdna sequence of strain zk 1 was submitted to ncbi accession number mt012187 and aligned against known gene sequences using blast to determine homology the phylogenetic tree of strain zk 1 and related species was shown in fig 3 showing that strain zk 1 and delftia tsuruhatensis gathered into one branch this strain had 99 homology with delftia tsuruhatensis strain bn hky6 delftia tsuruhatensis strain t7 and delftia tsuruhatensis strain nbrc 16741 consequently it was prettily likely to be the same strain as delftia tsuruhatensis 3 3 2 morphological and biochemical characteristics of strain zk 1 the surface of cultured colonies was smooth slightly convex translucent even edge and did not form pigments on agar plate the microscopic examination of the strains obtained in section 2 4 showed that the morphology of the bacteria was mainly slightly curved short rod shaped with different lengths 0 7 1 2 2 4 4 0 μm and the strain arranged in the form of individual or pairs and was a gram negative bacillus these features were greatly coincided with the description of shigematsu et al et al 27 based to bergey s manual of determinative bacteriology strain zk 1 was classified as delftia sp on account of its related species physiological and biochemical indexes table 4 it possessed contact enzyme and oxidase not conduct hydrolysis carbohydrates reaction concerning starch and gelatin generally which was somehow in accord with the study of juárez jiménez et al 28 and other species related genus delftia 27 29 32 table 4 phosphohydrolase was found in some species cell revealing that polyphosphate if exist would be degraded and assimilated simultaneously the deficiency of glucose fermentation and the partial usage of fructose implied that strain zk 1 didn t have enough energy merely depending on its own growth 28 the results was assistant with morphological and biochemical characteristics of delftia tsuruhatensis 27 while delftia tsuruhatensis in study of shigematsu et al 27 was enriched by assimilating terephthalate as unique carbon source and energy arabinose mannitol glucose and xylose were not used by strain zk 1 whereas strain zk 1 was able to reduce nitrate into nitrite utilize phosphate and degrade phb as energy which meat that strain zk 1 was a dpao bacteria in activated sludge could be divided into two categories namely non fermentative and fermentative bacteria according to their biochemical characteristics 33 the strain zk 1 was continuously acclimated with acetic then its non fermentative function was strengthened the abilities of denitrification and dephosphorization would have good appearance as shown in section 3 2 accordingly since non fermentative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa had the stronger function of denitrifying and accumulating phosphate because the more complete the decomposition of phosphorus was at anaerobic stage accordingly the greater the amount of polyphosphate was at anoxic stage 21 however other related species on genus delftia could be also assumed that they possess the ability of accumulating phosphate additionally delftia sp was capable of strongly enduring to oxygen than microvirgula aerodenitrificans which could remove 5 3 6 15 of no3 n under 64 96 of saturation on dissolved oxygen in 3 days 34 meaning that delftia survived in a o stage was possible delftia tsuruhatensis in this work was capable of accumulating phosphorous and denitrifying as a non fermentative dpao delftia sp was typically considered as denitrifier which could reduce nitrate into other nitrogen oxides such as nitric oxide 35 nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide 27 via nitrite firstly and its mechanism of denitrification was widely analyzed by previous stuies 27 36 37 thus this strain would be used to remove contaminants containing nitrogen for potential commercial application in industry this fact that d tsuruhatensis was denitrifying bacteria was comprehensively reported by many literatures however as we are concerned the phenomenon that d tsuruhatensis act as a dpao is not still discovered until to now 3 4 optimization of growth conditions of strain zk 1 3 4 1 optimal carbon source generally carbon source as an important factor influencing nitrogen removal could sustain the life of heterotrophic bacteria by providing energy source 38 and carbon is the skeleton of various organic substances in cells strain zk 1 belongs to chemoheterotrophic bacteria it is necessary to synthesize phb from volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid and in water body to provide energy to ensure excessive accumulation for phosphate under anoxic condition and glucose and yeast extract are common carbon sources for bacterial culture 39 accordingly the outcomes for diverse carbon sources table 5 indicated a phenomenon that the growth conditions of strain zk 1 appeared a big difference it could be explained by insight that there might be different mechanisms for strain zk 1 to perform denitrification and dephosphorization on different carbon source overall the growth situation of strain zk 1 with compound carbon source was better than that of single carbon source since the diversity of carbon source was beneficial for avoiding toxicity with high concentration and a strain typically possess was capable of assimilating a broad range of organic carbon sources as illustrated in table 5 the turbidity of strain zk 1 grown with glucose yeast extract serving as carbon source reached 0 613 after culturing 3 days and that with sodium acetate glucose followed meanwhile the turbidity with sodium acetate and sodium acetate yeast was 0 732 and 0 503 respectively which revealed that sodium acetate was degraded and assimilated by dpao at a higher absorption rate and the zk 1 cells existed with the form of relative satiation therefore they could rapidly complete their growth and reproduction without depleting their own energy and material 40 nevertheless when glucose was only carbon source the turbidity of bacteria was only 0 322 which indicated that glucose was not absorbed well and phbs producing at anaerobic stage via absorbing carbon source were rarely stored and transformed 1 because strain zk 1 was most similar to delftia tsuruhatensis which could consume sodium acetate but not glucose as a non fermentative bacterium 27 accordingly the best carbon source was sodium acetate which was identical with previous papers considered that dpaos growing with sodium acetate as sole carbon source showed best performance on phosphate accumulating and denitrifying 1 41 3 4 2 optimal nitrogen source the different growth conditions on strain zk 1 in various nitrogen sources were shown in table 5 the highest bacterial turbidity of strain zk 1 was 1 438 and 1 189 when bacteria grew medium with peptone and sulfate peptone respectively such a behavior about od650 on performing with peptone was a little higher than the previous literature 42 the main reason for this phenomenon was that strain zk 1 experiencing the acclimatization at a o and a a stage had better growth activity nevertheless combined with plate test and microscopy test the cultural medium with peptone as nitrogen source was easier to be infected by spores and in culture process the growth of spores was dominant which resulted in high turbidity of bacteria in the medium with peptone thereby the data was greatly interfered by spores however strain zk 1 was cultured with ammonium sulfate for 3 days od650 was only 0 314 showing that organic nitrogen source was better than inorganic nitrogen source for the growth of strain zk 1 however the culture medium with ammonium sulfate and peptone was not infected by spores which was mainly because the growth of spores was able to be inhibited by peptone 43 in the microscopy test it showed that the morphology of bacteria was single which was consistent with morphological character of d tsuruhatensis therefore the optimal nitrogen source of d tsuruhatensis was ammonium sulfate peptone the various growth status of strain zk 1 in different nitrogen sources substrates demonstrated organic nitrogen was more conducive to growth than inorganic nitrogen and the mixed organic nitrogen source far superior to that on a single organic or inorganic nitrogen source meaning that the nutrient of complex organic nitrogen source for strain zk 1 was affluent these characteristics on nitrogen sources coincided with thauera linaloolentis accession number nr025283 1 in genbank ncbi 42 3 4 3 analysis of orthogonal test results the three basic nutrients of microorganisms are water carbonaceous substance and nitrogen containing substance the physiological activity of bacteria is closely related to the ph in environment generally speaking the optimal ph value range of microorganisms involved in sewage treatment is 6 5 8 5 44 and the optimal environment ph for most bacteria growth is 6 8 45 therefore coupled with biochemical characteristics of strain zk 1 three factors including nitrogen source nitrogen source and ph table 6 were used to design test scheme to preliminarily study the growth conditions of strain zk 1 it could be seen from table 6 that the r of ph was the largest followed by that of nitrogen source and that of carbon source is the smallest consequently ph was the vital factor affecting the growth of strain zk 1 followed by nitrogen source and carbon source has the least effect on the growth of strain zk 1 for microorganisms ph has a great influence on their life activities which is mainly used to change the charge of proteins nucleic acids and other biological macromolecules ph can also change the charge of cell membrane which leads to changes in the ability of microbial cells to absorb nutrients also to change the availability of nutrients in the environment and the toxicity of harmful substances 46 at the same time the increase in ph would increase the number of free ammonia whose toxicity was more violent than ionic ammonia under the condition of alkalescence also the ph in the cultured system influenced nitrification process to some extent since it was able to change nh3 nh4 n and hno2 no2 equilibrium 3 47 nevertheless slightly alkaline habitat would facilitate nitrification bacterium because ammonia monooxygenase would take advantage of more nh3 contained in medium as the actual substrate instead of having a priority for nh4 48 hence ph has the most significant impact on the growth of strain zk 1 consequently ammonia in nitrogen source was closely associated to ph the effect of nitrogen source on the growth of strain zk 1 was greater than that of carbon source by comparing the k of each factor the fact that k3 of ph was the largest table 6 in addition the k2 of nitrogen source and carbon source was the largest among three k accordingly it was preliminarily determined that the optimal ph for strain zk 1 growth was 8 the optimal nitrogen source was 1 0 g and the optimal carbon source was 2 5 g the optimal conditions for nitrogen source carbon source and ph were pretty close with aforementioned cultural medium nevertheless under low ph the excessive high concentration of hydrogen ion destroys the communication between the sensor located in the cytoplasmic membrane and the regulator located in the cytoplasmic membrane resulting in the loss of control of the phosphate regulator controlling the phosphorus metabolism of bacteria in this way more acetate is needed for phosphate absorption rate per unit mass released at low ph at the same time since the energy released by phosphate decomposition can not be used to convert acetate into phb for storage anaerobic phosphorus release and further nitrogen and phosphorus removal at anoxic condition were inhibited 49 it s important to note from table 6 that when ph was only 6 the od650 approached to 0 indicating the survival of strain zk 1 in little low ph was severely restrained when the ph is too high it will lead to the precipitation of metal phosphate but will affect the phosphorus release effect of strain zk 1 in anaerobic environment therefore the optimal condition for ph was kept partial alkalinity combined with its physiological and biochemical characteristics besides this strain zk 1 showed high growth performance with a wide range of carbon and nitrogen indicating strain zk 1 had high application potential in ebpr including the piggery waste with c n of 4 7 and the municipal landﬁll leachate with high c n 50 these outcomes implied that c n ratio did not play a vital role in the process of denitriﬁcation and dephosphorization of strain zk 1 whereas due to taking cost effectiveness into consideration c n ratio should not be applied at high level in the future application 3 4 4 analysis of computer response surface methodology in order to screen the important variables affected the growth conditions of strain zk 1 a 26 runs design was used to screen three factors the response was the average bacterial turbidity after 3 days of incubation and all experiments were conducted in two replicates table 7 the f value p value and lack of fit were 30 077 0 0001 and 0 212 of model table 8 indicating that the quadratic equation model was extremely significant ph and b2 and d2 in the quadratic term were all significant factors simultaneously p 0 5 whereas the other interactions were insignificant p 0 05 under the tested range fig 4 elaborated that the predicted value of model was basically consistent with actual value and had good linear correlation accordingly the model was feasible in practical application within the level range of factors selected in this paper according to established mathematical model the optimal growth conditions of strain zk 1 were as follows carbon source sodium acetate was 4 45 g 4450 mg l nitrogen source ammonium sulfate peptone was 1 32 g 1320 mg l ph value was 7 85 and bacterial turbidity would reach 1 239 this meant that the ability of denitrifying and phosphate accumulating of strain zk 1 was well inspired which was in accord with the previous studies 1 51 however delftia tsuruhatensis reached optimal condition when ph was 7 which differed from a previous study 27 the reason could be partially because delftia tsuruhatensis in this study was acclimated to denitrify and phosphorous accumulating while that in a previous study 27 was enriched to treat terephthalate from activated sludge the divergence of goal to domesticate this strain and media to culture this strain effected the optimal cultural requirement for ph and because strain zk 1 could show better performance at alkaline condition due to nh4 as nitrogen source under the condition of the above prediction parameters three parallel experiments were conducted and spss10 0 was used to test the reliability of the model the mean value of turbidity was 1 241 the degree of freedom was 3 and the p value was 0 038 which implied that optimized process parameters are feasible 3 5 interaction between factors the quadratic regression fitting equations of carbon source nitrogen source and ph influencing growth of strain zk 1 were calculated by design expert software as shown in eq 2 2 od650 1 04 0 7 a 0 027 b 0 41 c 0 031 a 0 078 a c 0 012 b c 0 1 a2 0 32 b2 0 28 c2 where a b and c represent carbon source nitrogen source and ph respectively some publications have revealed that the major factors affecting the growth of dpaos are nitrogen sources carbon sources and ph 52 53 the turbidity of bacteria would gradually increase with the increase in carbon source or nitrogen source but after exceeding 4 06 g for carbon source or exceeded 1 40 g for carbon source od650 began to decrease fig 5 a this might be due to the fact that the amount of carbon and nitrogen sources at this ph value exceeded that required for bacterial growth resulting in the formation of adverse components inside the bacteria however nitrogen source had a signiﬁcant impact on od650 for any of the initial concentrations of carbon source suggesting that nitrogen source could have great influence on the growth of strain zk 1 the outcome was able to coincide with orthogonal test while carbon source was normally more vital than nitrogen source for most organisms the importance for nitrogen source in this work was because strain zk 1 as dpao much relied on nitrogen relative to carbon to denitrification meanwhile fig 5 b showed the interaction of carbon source amount and ph on the growth of strain zk 1 most dpaos perform phosphorus removal denitriﬁcation and normal metabolic activity by utilizing carbon sources as the nutrient for microbial growth in denitriﬁcation phosphorus removal systems 54 when the ph was fixed biomass concentration increased gradually with the increase in carbon source then when carbon source increased to a certain extent the bacterial turbidity increased gently fig 5 b an increase in bacterial turbidity with an increase in carbon source concentration was due to the fact that biomass is mainly controlled by the carbon source and is essential for building up biomass 55 on the other hand no matter how much carbon source was added bacterial turbidity increased with the increase of ph ranging from 6 to 8 in comparison with one factor at a time approach in this study the suitable decrease in the amount of carbon source concentration can remarkably reduce the cost of cultivation since the cost of glucose is estimated to be 80 of total medium cost 56 otherwise alternatively cheaper and more optimal carbon sources have been suggested to replace acetic acid for lowering culture costs the highest growth was achieved at a ph of 8 when the od650 rose to 1 16 since the charge state and redox potential was changed following the ph in the culture medium to affect enzymatic reactions and microbial absorption of nutrients 57 the combination of nitrogen source concentration and ﬂow rate manifested a relatively even response with function to the growth of strain zk 1 than fig 5 a b fig 5 c showed that when the amount of nitrogen source was from 0 5 g to 1 25 g the bacterial turbidity increased gradually with the increase in ph and increased gradually with the increase in the amount of nitrogen source at ph 7 5 8 when nitrogen source attained 1 12 g and ph was 7 76 the bacterial turbidity reached a highest situation when the amount of nitrogen source was 1 25 2 00 g biomass production would increase following the increase in ph but decrease after ph passed 7 5 the result might be because that the partial ionic ammonia changed to free ammonia under the condition of alkalescency while free ammonia had stronger toxicity than ionic ammonia which would poison microorganisms 50 4 conclusion in this work the raw activated sludge at the end of aeration tank of sewage treatment plant ran 20 cycles of a o stage and successive 107 cycles of a a stage in intermittent phosphate accumulating and nitrogen device the changes of metabolic activity of dpaos were analyzed at a o and a a stages proving that the relative abundant of dpaos had great enhancement between a o stage and a a stage a strain had function of denitrification and dephosphorization was isolated lonely from the aforementioned sludge which was named as strain zk 1 the 16s rdna identification and characteristics on physiological and biochemical indexes of strain zk 1 from the perspective of molecular biology were tested respectively suggesting that strain zk 1 was identified as delftia tsuruhatensis the strain was likely to be a new non fermentative dpao was proved the results grounded on optimal tests showed that the best carbon source and nitrogen source were sodium acetate and ammonium sulfate peptone respectively the orthogonal test based on optimal carbon source and nitrogen source was measured and calculated finding that the order of key factors affecting the growth of zk 1 was ph nitrogen carbon according to computer response surface methodology the most suitable medium group for strain zk 1 was 4450 mg l of sodium acetate carbon source 1320 mg l of ammonium sulfate peptone nitrogen source and 7 85 of ph and various types of carbon source and nitrogen source and wide range of ph all were affected by strain zk 1 implying activated sludge harbouring this strain would have broad application in the future the isolation of new dpaos and the definition and exploration for physiological and biochemical characteristics of dpaos will be conducive to the development of ebrp in the field of wastewater treatment in the real world declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts to declare

process consisting of coagulation and subsequent flocculation sedimentation coagulation is the destabilization of the electrostatic potential of insoluble particles by adding a chemical providing positive ions there are different coagulation regimes 23 which require different dosing strategies depending on water parameters such as colloidal surface area this destabilization process overcomes the repulsive forces and particles come together forming flocs that can readily sediment the flocculation process can optionally be enhanced by the addition of flocculants typically long polymeric molecules bridging together particles into larger flocs c f is common in drinking water production and wastewater treatment but has been sparsely investigated in the urban stormwater management context despite its destabilization mechanism with the potential to effectively sediment the small particle fractions previous studies have described or investigated coagulation and flocculation of

loader pollutants in the snow were a result of accumulation throughout the entire winter season since no removal of snowbanks had been performed at the time of collection the road was located in luleå northern sweden and had an annual average daily traffic of 20 000 vehicles an equal volume of pristine surface snow was collected away from traffic in a secluded park area the snow was stored in plastic high density polyethylene boxes at 10 c until further use before jar testing the snow was allowed to completely thaw at room temperature for one and a half days before preparing the semi synthetic stormwater by mixing equal volumes of traffic impacted snow with the pristine snow coarser particles entrained in the snow were allowed to settle out during one hour before decantation this process was done to achieve a water quality similar to that of meltwater in terms of suspended solids and turbidity entering the urban drainage systems during the natural thawing season 29 2 2

out on eight individual coagulants and seven combinations of a primary coagulant and a flocculant aid table 1 after the screening tests five coagulants were selected and subjected to a testing regime encompassing additional parameters and carried out in three replicates a portable jar testing apparatus flocculator provided by kemira was used for all jar tests the apparatus consisted of six detachable flat bladed impeller inserts and a control unit with dials to regulate impeller rotational speed and time individually for each beaker and protocol phase rapid mixing slow mixing and sedimentation the jar testing procedure was identical for all tests and included rapid mixing g 190 s 1 60 s during which the chemicals were injected followed by slow mixing g 15 s 1 15 min to promote floc aggregation and lastly sedimentation for 30 min to measure water quality parameters a water sample of 600 ml was extracted from each beaker at the end of the jar test using a siphon below the water surface six one liter beakers were included in the jar testing experimental setup one beaker was used as a control no addition of a water treatment chemical and the remaining five beakers contained series of increasing concentrations of primary coagulant or flocculant aid no ph adjustment was performed for any of the coagulants if no optimal dose was determined the jar tests were repeated with a modified concentration series in the screening tests where a combination of a primary coagulant and a flocculant aid was used the coagulant dose giving the highest turbidity reduction was repeated with an increased concentration of polymer to investigate if the addition of a flocculant aid would increase the reduction of solids subsequently the dose of the polymer giving the highest turbidity reduction was kept and the jar test was repeated with a set up where the coagulant concentrations were decreased to test if the reduction effect could be maintained at lower concentrations alum pax 215 pax xl360 pix 111 and chitosan were subjected to a more comprehensive jar testing regime in three replicates to further determine coagulation characteristics after the addition of the coagulant in the rapid mixing phase 500 μl were extracted into a dts1070 cuvette and ζ potential was measured on a zetasizer nano zs instrument malvern instruments worcestershire

radiometer analytical lyon france and calculated as mg l as caco3 3 results and discussion 3 1 semi synthetic stormwater for the screening tests twelve semi synthetic stormwater batches were prepared and a total of 37 sub batches were used in the jar tests ph alkalinity turbidity and tss differed between sub batches table 2 and between batches the greatest variation was observed between batches both turbidity and tss table 2 were in agreement with measurements taken from snowmelt studies in the same city previously 29 32 alkalinity is an important water quality parameter to consider for c f and influences the choice of coagulant utilized previous studies have shown that urban runoff contains relatively low alkalinity 33 35 in the range of 10 90 mg l as caco3 for urban snowmelt alkalinity is between 2 90 mg l as caco3 varying greatly between location 36 the alkalinity of the semi synthetic stormwater was relatively low 30 mg l on average table 2 implying a risk of ph drop resulting in sub optimal coagulation 3 2 reduction of solids table 3 presents the treatment results for the optimal dose for each tested primary coagulant concerning the reduction of solids fig 1 shows the turbidity reduction as a function of the coagulant concentration together with the reduction in ph treatment with all primary coagulants showed a high turbidity reduction of above 99 in some cases table 3 pix 111 along with pax xl360 and pax xl100 had the highest turbidity reduction at 99 alum showed slightly lower reduction performance than the polymerized aluminium coagulants which was expected pix 111 pax xl360 and pax 215 were the only coagulants that reduced the turbidity to below 10 ntu these observed reduction rates for turbidity were in line with previously reported rates heinzmann 24 attained a residual of 10 mg l tss and 10 ntu with c f using alum at a pilot plant for stormwater treatment trejo gaytan 26 achieved 10 ntu with poly aluminium chlorides using streaming current measurements to adjust the dose when treating urban runoff kang 28 reported residual turbidity in treated highway runoff of around 5 ntu with a sweep floc mechanism after the treatment with limewater and chitosan fig 1 the water phase retained a visible milky hue residual turbidity of 70 ntu for limewater 45 ntu for chitosan indicating a fraction of suspended particles which were unable to coagulate like turbidity tss was greatly reduced by the treatment table 3 pix 111 achieved the lowest residual tss of 5 mg l followed closely by the polymerized aluminium chlorides overall the reduction of tss was highly collinear with the decrease in turbidity with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 99 for the screening study and 0 97 for the extended jar testing regime no measurable treatment effect from using drinking water sludge as a coagulant was observed to reuse sludge as a sustainable coagulant it might be necessary to perform an initial enrichment step using an acidification process to extract the residual coagulant 37 3 3 coagulant dose and ph sensitivity the optimal dose at which the greatest solids clarification occurred for each tested primary coagulant is shown in table 3 for alum the optimal dose was 5 mg l which reduced ph from 8 to 7 8 for the polymerized aluminium products pax 215 pax xl100 pax xl360 the optimal dose was lower than for alum 1 5 3 mg l and ph decreased from 8 to 7 5 the iron chloride product pix 111 required higher concentrations 8 mg l to reach optimal solids reduction and the ph decrease was greater as compared to the aluminium based products from 7 9 to 6 4 for limewater 300 mg l was needed to attain a high clarification this increased ph from 7 3 to 11 8 when using chitosan as a primary coagulant a dose of 2 mg l was needed and resulted in a minimal effect on the water ph 7 7 to 7 6 the optimal ph range for coagulation with alum is generally considered to be from 6 to 7 while that for iron chloride is from 5 5 to 6 5 depending on the application and effluent characteristics 22 the addition of alum to the semi synthetic stormwater resulted in a ph slightly higher 7 8 7 5 7 6 and 7 2 respectively than the optimal range for the iron chloride product pix 111 the greatest solid reduction occurred at ph 6 4 which is within the reported optimal range the optimal doses for the coagulants observed in this study table 3 are very similar to previous studies on stormwater coagulation heinzmann 24 reported an optimal dose of a polymerized aluminium chloride equivalent to 0 06 mmol l al3 1 6 mg l and 0 18 mg l cationic polymer harper 25 reported between 5 10 mg l of alum as optimal however results from one previous study stand in contrast to the present study kang et al 28 observed an increase in turbidity at low doses of coagulant comparable to optimal doses in this study instead high turbidity reduction was observed first when sweep flocs were produced at higher concentrations 40 500 mg l 3 4 flocculant aids the five flocculant aids table 1 tested with primary coagulants did not affect the turbidity reduction in any combination of primary coagulant and flocculant aid up to 0 5 mg l furthermore it was not possible to retain the turbidity reduction by reducing the coagulant dose although the use of a flocculant aid did not affect the magnitude of the turbidity reduction the formation of the flocs was visually distinctly different with the use of a flocculant aid the flocs were more voluminous and appeared earlier in the slow mixing phase the results from using a combination of a primary coagulant and a flocculant aid stand in contrast to what has been reported by heinzmann 24 who observed optimal reduction of solids using polymerized aluminium chloride in combination with polyacrylamide kang 28 identified a decreased mixing time as another benefit of using a flocculant aid bratby 22 described other benefits associated with the use of a flocculant aid that were not evaluated in this study such as an increase in size density and shear strength of the flocs however there are also toxicity concerns to consider related to both residual coagulant 38 and residual polymer 39 40 in effluent discharged to receiving waters in the present study no residual coagulant was observed as final concentrations of iron and aluminium were lower than the initial concentration 3 5 coagulation characteristics in an extended jar testing regime additional parameters zeta potential alkalinity and conductivity were measured to further elucidate coagulation characteristics for the semi synthetic stormwater the average ζ potential of the batches was 20 mv and the conductivity was 111 μs cm a key parameter for an efficient coagulation process is the ph it determines the speciation of the hydrolysis products which heavily influence treatment performance 41 in this study ph was deliberately not controlled as one of the objectives was to gauge the feasibility of applying a coagulation flocculation technique to stormwater without adjusting for alkalinity and or ph despite adjustment of neither ph nor alkalinity it was possible to attain a high turbidity reduction 90 using multiple linear regression a 95 confidence interval for alkalinity consumption mg alkalinity as caco3 per mg active substance was estimated for the primary coagulants alum 0 20 98 mg mg pax 215 1 39 7 63 mg mg pax xl360 1 04 3 21 mg mg pix 111 1 31 3 06 mg mg and for chitosan 0 52 to 3 10 mg mg with the determined optimal doses the total impact of polymerized coagulants on ph and alkalinity was lower for example than that of alum and pix 111 the results indicated that treatment with chitosan has a negligible alkalinity consumption which would be advantageous when the buffer capacity is low generally with increasing doses of coagulant the surface potential measured as ζ potential increased fig 2 as the negative hydrolysis species adsorbed onto particles their net charge was reduced in raw water applications using ζ potential as dosing control typically optimal performance for organic matter removal has been reported for a ζ potential in the span from 10 mv to 5 mv 42 this is in line with the findings in this study table 4 although at positive ζ potential the risk of charge reversal characterized by increased turbidity was observed the ζ potential ph and dose at which charge reversal was observed for the primary coagulants tested in the extended regime are outlined in table 4 the ζ potential at which maximum turbidity reduction occurred differed between coagulants for alum the maximal effect occurred at 13 4 mv for pax 215 at 9 3 mv for pax xl360 at 0 6 mv for pix 111 at 0 5 mv and lastly chitosan at 6 4 mv to elucidate the coagulation mechanisms the optimal doses observed in this study were overlaid onto design and operation or coagulation domain diagrams fig 3 for water and wastewater 43 44 according to these diagrams the coagulation mechanism of aluminium coagulants in this study is in the sweep coagulation domain possibly combined with charge neutralization and almost exclusively sweep coagulation for pix 111 however the occurrence of charge reversal characterized as a nullification of treatment effect at a certain coagulant dose threshold and the non existence of amorphous metal hydroxide flocs instead the flocs were small and point like in appearance typical of sweep coagulation suggest that the primary mechanism behind the coagulation experiments carried out is most likely charge neutralization this is corroborated by the stoichiometric relationship between the coagulant dose and turbidity up until charge reversal occurs fig 2 the non agreement between observations in this study and the probable coagulation mechanism according to the coagulation domain diagrams might be explained by the high particle content and large colloidal surface area of the semi synthetic stormwater which shift the regime boundaries it has previously been noted that the colloidal surface area is an important factor in determining the primary coagulation mechanism 23 45 and that at high colloid concentrations the stoichiometric charge neutralization mechanism is predominant sweep flocculation of the semi synthetic stormwater is unlikely to occur due to the high colloid content and low alkalinity 4 conclusions coagulation flocculation experiments were carried out using jar tests on semi synthetic stormwater without ph adjustment or addition of alkalinity despite low alkalinity 30 mg l as caco3 in the stormwater overall high turbidity and tss reductions were observed 90 99 for both parameters the use of polymerized coagulants required the lowest coagulant dose which is important from both an economical and a toxicological point of view the iron chloride compound pix 111 showed the greatest tss reduction 99 and the lowest residual tss 5 mg l but also incurred the greatest decrease in ph chitosan a biopolymer constitutes a biodegradable coagulant with a minimal effect on the water ph and alkalinity however with the treatment effect observed 95 96 the residual turbidity 45 ntu and tss 32 mg l were considerably higher than for the traditional coagulants 10 ntu and 10 mg l despite low alkalinity in the semi synthetic stormwater mean 30 mg l as caco3 a high treatment effect was achieved for all coagulants maximal treatment effect occurred when the ζ potential was in the span of 14 to 1 mv the semi synthetic stormwater in this study was characterized by low alkalinity and contained a high proportion of colloidal sized particles the observed coagulation mechanism for this semi synthetic stormwater was charge neutralization with an initially stoichiometric relationship between coagulant dose and colloid concentration beyond this zone further coagulant dosing led to relatively little improvement before eventually resulting in a charge reversal and increased colloid concentrations the results of this study suggest that a c f treatment regime for stormwater should be based on the stoichiometric charge neutralization mechanism due to the relatively low alkalinity of stormwater and snowmelt a polymerized coagulant is better suited than a non polymerized coagulant using initial turbidity and online ζ potential as control parameters may be a useful dosing

radiometer analytical lyon france and calculated as mg l as caco3 3 results and discussion 3 1 semi synthetic stormwater for the screening tests twelve semi synthetic stormwater batches were prepared and a total of 37 sub batches were used in the jar tests ph alkalinity turbidity and tss differed between sub batches table 2 and between batches the greatest variation was observed between batches both turbidity and tss table 2 were in agreement with measurements taken from snowmelt studies in the same city previously 29 32 alkalinity is an important water quality parameter to consider for c f and influences the choice of coagulant utilized previous studies have shown that urban runoff contains relatively low alkalinity 33 35 in the range of 10 90 mg l as caco3 for urban snowmelt alkalinity is between 2 90 mg l as caco3 varying greatly between location 36 the alkalinity of the semi synthetic stormwater was relatively low 30 mg l on average table 2 implying a risk of ph drop resulting in sub optimal coagulation 3 2 reduction of solids table 3 presents the treatment results for the optimal dose for each tested primary coagulant concerning the reduction of solids fig 1 shows the turbidity reduction as a function of the coagulant concentration together with the reduction in ph treatment with all primary coagulants showed a high turbidity reduction of above 99 in some cases table 3 pix 111 along with pax xl360 and pax xl100 had the highest turbidity reduction at 99 alum showed slightly lower reduction performance than the polymerized aluminium coagulants which was expected pix 111 pax xl360 and pax 215 were the only coagulants that reduced the turbidity to below 10 ntu these observed reduction rates for turbidity were in line with previously reported rates heinzmann 24 attained a residual of 10 mg l tss and 10 ntu with c f using alum at a pilot plant for stormwater treatment trejo gaytan 26 achieved 10 ntu with poly aluminium chlorides using streaming current measurements to adjust the dose when treating urban runoff kang 28 reported residual turbidity in treated highway runoff of around 5 ntu with a sweep floc mechanism after the treatment with limewater and chitosan fig 1 the water phase retained a visible milky hue residual turbidity of 70 ntu for limewater 45 ntu for chitosan indicating a fraction of suspended particles which were unable to coagulate like turbidity tss was greatly reduced by the treatment table 3 pix 111 achieved the lowest residual tss of 5 mg l followed closely by the polymerized aluminium chlorides overall the reduction of tss was highly collinear with the decrease in turbidity with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 99 for the screening study and 0 97 for the extended jar testing regime no measurable treatment effect from using drinking water sludge as a coagulant was observed to reuse sludge as a sustainable coagulant it might be necessary to perform an initial enrichment step using an acidification process to extract the residual coagulant 37 3 3 coagulant dose and ph sensitivity the optimal dose at which the greatest solids clarification occurred for each tested primary coagulant is shown in table 3 for alum the optimal dose was 5 mg l which reduced ph from 8 to 7 8 for the polymerized aluminium products pax 215 pax xl100 pax xl360 the optimal dose was lower than for alum 1 5 3 mg l and ph decreased from 8 to 7 5 the iron chloride product pix 111 required higher concentrations 8 mg l to reach optimal solids reduction and the ph decrease was greater as compared to the aluminium based products from 7 9 to 6 4 for limewater 300 mg l was needed to attain a high clarification this increased ph from 7 3 to 11 8 when using chitosan as a primary coagulant a dose of 2 mg l was needed and resulted in a minimal effect on the water ph 7 7 to 7 6 the optimal ph range for coagulation with alum is generally considered to be from 6 to 7 while that for iron chloride is from 5 5 to 6 5 depending on the application and effluent characteristics 22 the addition of alum to the semi synthetic stormwater resulted in a ph slightly higher 7 8 7 5 7 6 and 7 2 respectively than the optimal range for the iron chloride product pix 111 the greatest solid reduction occurred at ph 6 4 which is within the reported optimal range the optimal doses for the coagulants observed in this study table 3 are very similar to previous studies on stormwater coagulation heinzmann 24 reported an optimal dose of a polymerized aluminium chloride equivalent to 0 06 mmol l al3 1 6 mg l and 0 18 mg l cationic polymer harper 25 reported between 5 10 mg l of alum as optimal however results from one previous study stand in contrast to the present study kang et al 28 observed an increase in turbidity at low doses of coagulant comparable to optimal doses in this study instead high turbidity reduction was observed first when sweep flocs were produced at higher concentrations 40 500 mg l 3 4 flocculant aids the five flocculant aids table 1 tested with primary coagulants did not affect the turbidity reduction in any combination of primary coagulant and flocculant aid up to 0 5 mg l furthermore it was not possible to retain the turbidity reduction by reducing the coagulant dose although the use of a flocculant aid did not affect the magnitude of the turbidity reduction the formation of the flocs was visually distinctly different with the use of a flocculant aid the flocs were more voluminous and appeared earlier in the slow mixing phase the results from using a combination of a primary coagulant and a flocculant aid stand in contrast to what has been reported by heinzmann 24 who observed optimal reduction of solids using polymerized aluminium chloride in combination with polyacrylamide kang 28 identified a decreased mixing time as another benefit of using a flocculant aid bratby 22 described other benefits associated with the use of a flocculant aid that were not evaluated in this study such as an increase in size density and shear strength of the flocs however there are also toxicity concerns to consider related to both residual coagulant 38 and residual polymer 39 40 in effluent discharged to receiving waters in the present study no residual coagulant was observed as final concentrations of iron and aluminium were lower than the initial concentration 3 5 coagulation characteristics in an extended jar testing regime additional parameters zeta potential alkalinity and conductivity were measured to further elucidate coagulation characteristics for the semi synthetic stormwater the average ζ potential of the batches was 20 mv and the conductivity was 111 μs cm a key parameter for an efficient coagulation process is the ph it determines the speciation of the hydrolysis products which heavily influence treatment performance 41 in this study ph was deliberately not controlled as one of the objectives was to gauge the feasibility of applying a coagulation flocculation technique to stormwater without adjusting for alkalinity and or ph despite adjustment of neither ph nor alkalinity it was possible to attain a high turbidity reduction 90 using multiple linear regression a 95 confidence interval for alkalinity consumption mg alkalinity as caco3 per mg active substance was estimated for the primary coagulants alum 0 20 98 mg mg pax 215 1 39 7 63 mg mg pax xl360 1 04 3 21 mg mg pix 111 1 31 3 06 mg mg and for chitosan 0 52 to 3 10 mg mg with the determined optimal doses the total impact of polymerized coagulants on ph and alkalinity was lower for example than that of alum and pix 111 the results indicated that treatment with chitosan has a negligible alkalinity consumption which would be advantageous when the buffer capacity is low generally with increasing doses of coagulant the surface potential measured as ζ potential increased fig 2 as the negative hydrolysis species adsorbed onto particles their net charge was reduced in raw water applications using ζ potential as dosing control typically optimal performance for organic matter removal has been reported for a ζ potential in the span from 10 mv to 5 mv 42 this is in line with the findings in this study table 4 although at positive ζ potential the risk of charge reversal characterized by increased turbidity was observed the ζ potential ph and dose at which charge reversal was observed for the primary coagulants tested in the extended regime are outlined in table 4 the ζ potential at which maximum turbidity reduction occurred differed between coagulants for alum the maximal effect occurred at 13 4 mv for pax 215 at 9 3 mv for pax xl360 at 0 6 mv for pix 111 at 0 5 mv and lastly chitosan at 6 4 mv to elucidate the coagulation mechanisms the optimal doses observed in this study were overlaid onto design and operation or coagulation domain diagrams fig 3 for water and wastewater 43 44 according to these diagrams the coagulation mechanism of aluminium coagulants in this study is in the sweep coagulation domain possibly combined with charge neutralization and almost exclusively sweep coagulation for pix 111 however the occurrence of charge reversal characterized as a nullification of treatment effect at a certain coagulant dose threshold and the non existence of amorphous metal hydroxide flocs instead the flocs were small and point like in appearance typical of sweep coagulation suggest that the primary mechanism behind the coagulation experiments carried out is most likely charge neutralization this is corroborated by the stoichiometric relationship between the coagulant dose and turbidity up until charge reversal occurs fig 2 the non agreement between observations in this study and the probable coagulation mechanism according to the coagulation domain diagrams might be explained by the high particle content and large colloidal surface area of the semi synthetic stormwater which shift the regime boundaries it has previously been noted that the colloidal surface area is an important factor in determining the primary coagulation mechanism 23 45 and that at high colloid concentrations the stoichiometric charge neutralization mechanism is predominant sweep flocculation of the semi synthetic stormwater is unlikely to occur due to the high colloid content and low alkalinity 4 conclusions coagulation flocculation experiments were carried out using jar tests on semi synthetic stormwater without ph adjustment or addition of alkalinity despite low alkalinity 30 mg l as caco3 in the stormwater overall high turbidity and tss reductions were observed 90 99 for both parameters the use of polymerized coagulants required the lowest coagulant dose which is important from both an economical and a toxicological point of view the iron chloride compound pix 111 showed the greatest tss reduction 99 and the lowest residual tss 5 mg l but also incurred the greatest decrease in ph chitosan a biopolymer constitutes a biodegradable coagulant with a minimal effect on the water ph and alkalinity however with the treatment effect observed 95 96 the residual turbidity 45 ntu and tss 32 mg l were considerably higher than for the traditional coagulants 10 ntu and 10 mg l despite low alkalinity in the semi synthetic stormwater mean 30 mg l as caco3 a high treatment effect was achieved for all coagulants maximal treatment effect occurred when the ζ potential was in the span of 14 to 1 mv the semi synthetic stormwater in this study was characterized by low alkalinity and contained a high proportion of colloidal sized particles the observed coagulation mechanism for this semi synthetic stormwater was charge neutralization with an initially stoichiometric relationship between coagulant dose and colloid concentration beyond this zone further coagulant dosing led to relatively little improvement before eventually resulting in a charge reversal and increased colloid concentrations the results of this study suggest that a c f treatment regime for stormwater should be based on the stoichiometric charge neutralization mechanism due to the relatively low alkalinity of stormwater and snowmelt a polymerized coagulant is better suited than a non polymerized coagulant using initial turbidity and online ζ potential as control parameters may be a useful dosing

13967,the rapidly increasing occurrence of heavy and toxic metals in water bodies harms health and ecosystem globally heavy metals accumulated in soil and water bodies enter into the food chain and their hazardous effects on human health have been investigated extensively chromium and arsenic represent the toxic metals widely present in wastewater and their high concentrations cause a life threatening impact on human health many nano adsorbents have been developed to reduce the level of cr and as ions from wastewater however their efficiencies are low recently various carbonaceous nanomaterials have been developed with extraordinary and tunable physical chemical properties to exhibit outstanding adsorption efficacy for heavy metals the application of various carbonaceous nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes graphene and chemically modified forms and modifications have been discussed in detail in the present review article for the removal of cr and as ions from wastewater keywords carbonaceous materials graphene oxide carbon nanotube arsenic chromium water pollution adsorption nanocomposites 1 introduction water is the primary need for the survival of human and animal beings among various sources responsible for water pollution heavy metals are one of the primary sources 1 heavy metals are naturally occurring elements with high atomic weight and density as high as five times as water 2 weathering of soils and rocks volcanic eruption various anthropogenic activities including mining processing or use of metal pollutants are the sources of heavy metal introduction into the water system the most common water polluting heavy metals are arsenic chromium cadmium copper nickel lead and mercury heavy metals tend to bioaccumulate in the body and their consumption above bio recommended limits leads to various biotoxic effects to the body 3 among all the heavy metals arsenic as and chromium cr are the major causes of water pollution by anthropogenic and natural sources arsenic is known to be highly toxic to all life forms and has been classiﬁed by the world health organization who as a group 1 human carcinogenic substance 4 5 the chronic intake of inorganic as above 50 μg l in drinking water causes different kinds of skin disorders e g hyperpigmentation hyperkeratosis and cancer skin lung kidney bladder which are collectively known as arsenicosis 6 it has been reported that as is a metalloid that can exist in its organic forms as monomethylarsonic acid mma dimethylarsinic acid dma and trimethylarsine oxide and it also exists as trivalent arsenite as iii and pentavalent arsenate as v in its inorganic forms the toxicity of these species increases in the order dma mma arsenate arsenite 7 as iii is more harmful to human health than as v as it is more cytotoxic genotoxic mobile and soluble it has been well reported that the toxicity of arsenic is decided by the various factors including the exposure dose frequency duration biological species age gender individual susceptibilities genetic and nutritional values 8 as iii can inactivate about 200 enzymes in the body and as v can replace phosphate involved in many biochemical reactions and hence shows various adverse effects on different organ systems 9 therefore the who recommended maximum contaminant limit mcl of 10 μg l for arsenic in drinking water instead of its previous guideline 50 μg l the mcl recommended for chromium in drinking water is 0 1 mg l the high concentration of cr also exerts strong toxic effects as it can diffuse through the cell membranes oxidize biological molecules and create a potential risk of living being healthy cr ions usually exist as cr iii and cr vi in the water sources the cr vi is about 100 times more toxic than cr iii and it is a well known carcinogenic element present in drinking water 10 cr vi occurs in the form of cro4 or cr2o7 2 oxyanions in water cr vi is responsible for skin tumors in animals and it also damages the dna by forming the cr dna adduct cr vi is known to be responsible for stomach cancer as well various methods including adsorption dialysis extraction ion exchange and precipitation have been used to remediate as and cr ions from waste water 11 due to the cost effectiveness ease in availability and operation high efficiency for heavy metal removal and regeneration after use the adsorption technique is one of the promising methods of choice carbonaceous materials with microporous and mesoporous structures large surface area and versatile adsorption qualities find their potential in the removal of heavy metal ions from polluted water reservoirs 12 nanotechnology has gained broad interest in almost every field of science as nanosized materials offer improved qualities and find potential in widespread applications 13 maitlo et al recently published a review article based on the application of nanomaterials for chromium removal from water highlighting the influence of various factors synergetic effect and a possible mechanism for adsorption phenomenon 14 another recent review article by baby et al 15 demonstrated the varied applications of different carbon nanomaterials in the removal of varying water pollutants including heavy metals they have also focused on the bio compatibility of different carbon structures which offers an additional advantage to their use in environmental remediation agarwal et al reported the recent advances in the application of commercially available nano adsorbents and bio adsorbents in the removal of heavy metals from water 16 yang et al 17 described the importance of carbon nanomaterials zero valent metal nanoparticles metal oxide nanoparticles and different other nanocomposites in the separation of heavy metals from wastewater kalarikkal et al have prepared various nanomaterials for a wide range of applications 18 19 20 their research group fabricated polylactic acid nano chitosan based composite fibers for effective adsorption of cadmium ions from water 21 they have also developed ionic liquids modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes embedded with styrene butadiene rubber for the preparation of membranes which was used for the selective removal of toluene from the azeotropic mixture of toluene and methanol 22 it was observed that the benzyl group of the ionic liquid unit plays a vital role in selective binding with toluene gopakumar et al reported the development of nanocellulose materials for different applications 23 25 they reported the synthesis of antibacterial nanopaper for the removal of anionic dyes 26 they also prepared cellulose nanofiber aerogels through silanization process for their environmental remediation application 27 these nanostructures can be easily synthesized for their commercialized use by the easy economical and environmentally friendly method these nanomaterials can effectively remove dyes from the water they have developed nanocellolulose materials for water purification applications 28 31 gopi et al reported the synthesis of 3 d cross linked hydrogels using graphene oxide materials and borax crosslinker 32 the nanostructure possessed high surface area and exhibited high adsorption efficiency for heavy metals and dyes they developed cellulose acetate chitosan 33 and cellulose acetate carboxymethyl cellulose 34 blend films by eco friendly solvent casting method and used them for the removal of dyes from the water they reported the fabrication hybrid bioaerogels using cellulose nanofibers and chitin nanocrystals and used them for the removal of dyes 35 vadakkekara et al also worked on the development of different modified and functionalized nanocellulose materials they synthesized nanocellulose using cheap and readily available jute fiber and then grafted it with sodium itaconate this nanomaterial acted as an excellent adsorbent for lead ions via the ion exchange process 36 they also reported the modification of nanocellulose with maleic acid which was a superb chemisorbant for the removal of lead from water 37 they also modified cellulose nanofiber with meldrum s acid and then developed its polyvinylidene fluoride based microfiltration membrane for the removal of dyes from water 38 beeran et al reported the modification of cellulose nanofibrils by graphene oxide incorporated 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidin 1 yl oxyl for the removal of dyes from water 39 they also developed film like xerogels and porous cryogels from cellulose nanofibrils and reduced graphene oxide 40 the recent development in the synthesis and processing of 2 d nanomaterials with the desired structure large surface area and broad applicability has also been reported by their group 41 in recent years nanosized carbonaceous materials have also been reported to show enhanced efficiency in water remediation technologies 42 43 carbon nanomaterials are gaining more importance over other nanomaterials due to its different advantageous properties including high surface area mechanical strength electric and optical properties layered structure lightweight chemical stability high ease of biodegradation porous framework controlled pore size distribution intense binding energy and high π π electrostatic forces various carbonaceous materials used for removal of as and cr heavy metal ions include graphene oxide carbon nanotubes and activated carbon materials the applications and modifications of various carbonaceous materials for the removal of as and cr ions from wastewater has been discussed in the present review 2 carbonaceous nanomaterials and their nanocomposites for the removal of as and cr ions in recent decades different types of carbon based nanomaterials have been used widely for heavy metal remediation it has been demonstrated that the nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes cnts graphene activated carbons carbon fibers etc play an essential role in the wastewater treatment processes by effectively removing as and cr ions from water samples the variable adsorption mechanisms have been anticipated to act simultaneously on the surface of carbonaceous nanomaterials depending upon the surface functionalization and environmental test conditions 44 as the adsorption relies on the availability of active sites in the case of activated charcoal adsorbent physical chemical activation need to be performed for efficient adsorption phenomenon on the other hand nano dimensional graphene having high surface area disperses and unfolds in aqueous media providing higher interaction and adsorption sites for the pollutants as compared to activated carbon graphene oxide contains various oxygen containing surface functional groups such as hydroxyl carbonyl carboxylic epoxide etc which not only helps in its homogeneous dispersion but also interact with multiple pollutants via electrostatic interaction and π π interaction 45 the adsorption mechanism of heavy metals by cnts relies on the surface feature electrochemical potential and ion exchange process the pristine cnt shows meager adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions but that could be significantly enhanced by oxidation with hno3 naocl or kmno4 44 the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of cnts allow for binding metal ions and organic pollutants via physical adsorption electrostatic interaction precipitation and chemical interactions 46 besides surface functional groups of carbon nanomaterials it was observed that an increase in solution ph and temperature also increased the adsorption of metal ions this may be attributed to the higher diffusion rate of metal ions lower activation energy of adsorption solution viscosity and structural changes 47 although as an adsorbent every carbonaceous nanomaterial offer unique structural and functional characteristics they all have active surface functional groups in common providing physical chemical interactions responsible for the adsorption of heavy metals 48 the impact of the presence of surface functional groups on separation application is well established in the literature 49 by using physical chemical modification methods functionality and quantity of the heteroatom o n s containing functional groups can be enhanced on the surface of carbonaceous nanomaterials fig 1 such modification may lead to the alteration enhancement of the various surface properties of carbon nanomaterials such as specific surface area pore size distribution volume etc 50 there are various mechanisms responsible for the separation adsorption of heavy metals like as and cr by carbonaceous nanomaterials including physical adsorption electrostatic interaction ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation it depends upon the surface chemistry of carbonaceous nanomaterial as adsorbents ionic environment of the aqueous media and nature of the adsorbate as depicted in fig 2 50 a thorough molecular dynamic simulation study for adsorption of metal ions by surface functionalized cnt s was reported by anitha et al 47 it has been reported that the cnt coo surface effectively adsorbs over 150 230 more metal ions compared to the bare cnt surface on the other hand oh and conh2 are relatively weak functional groups where excess metal ions adsorption compared to the bare cnt is in the range 10 47 the effect of the various functional groups of nanomaterials on maximum adsorption capacity qmax is listed in table 1 2 1 graphene or oxide graphene has gained considerable attention in the field of water treatment due to its remarkable adsorption capability it can be easily obtained from graphite and hence offers a non expensive method to remove heavy metal ions and other pollutants from wastewater it occurs in the form of a carbon sheet with an sp2 hybridized structure and possesses a large surface area however it gets challenging to separate graphene from the water after adsorption of contaminants that may lead to nanotoxicity or recontamination hence researchers have explored different functionalized graphene materials to get better outcomes of graphene properties 57 among the chemically functionalized graphene graphene oxide go acts as remarkable adsorbent material decorated with a variety of hydrophilic oxygen containing functional groups such as carbonyl c o carboxyl cooh epoxy c o c and hydroxyl oh throughout the go sheets 58 graphene oxide can be easily synthesized from graphene by treating with acid using a modified hummers procedure 59 the increased surface area and presence of oxygen containing functional groups of go allow the formation of the membrane with enhanced water permeability through the graphene oxide sheets they hence offer increased potential for its use in water remediation 60 it has been used for the efficient removal of heavy metal ions and other organic and inorganic pollutants from waste water 61 63 owing to its great beneficial uses in water remediation researchers have explored further functionalization of go to achieve even better results 64 65 it can be obtained either by chemical reactions at oxygen containing functional groups or non covalent interactions of other molecules with go or its reduced form 2 1 1 removal of as ions the modification of go by magnetic nanoparticles has been widely explored for the removal of organic and inorganic water pollutants chandra et al have reported the application of water dispersible magnetite modified reduced go for the removal of as ions from aqueous media 66 adsorption data calculated from the langmuir model shows maximum adsorption capacity for as v and as iii as 5 83 mg g and 13 10 mg g respectively it has been well established that as v exist in the anionic form h2aso3 and as iii exist in its neutral form h3aso4 over a wide range of ph thus emphasizing the role of ph in adsorption phenomenon it has been reported that at ph point of zero charges the adsorbent is negatively charged and at ph point of zero cost the adsorbent is positively charged thereby adsorbent exhibits high as v adsorption at low ph however at high ph the adsorption process is followed by surface complexation rather than electrostatic interactions as high as iii adsorption was observed at high ph value hang et al have reported the maximum adsorption capacity for as iii and as v as 54 18 mg g and 26 76 m g respectively using magnetic iron oxide go with the iron content of 51 wt 67 interestingly the elemental distribution map generated through the x ray fluorescent technique suggests that as v is preferentially associated with iron oxides during the adsorption process and that the distribution of fe and as is directly correlated yan et al have reported the synthesis of three dimensional nanostructured fe3o4 graphene aerogels for the removal of as ions from water 68 the aerogels exhibit a significant capacity of as v ions adsorption up to 40 048 mg g the adsorption isotherm has been well correlated with the langmuir model which follows pseudo second order kinetics for the adsorption process suresh kumar et al has reported the excellent adsorption properties of nanohybrids of single layer go and magnetic manganese ferrite for pb and as ions 69 the go mnfe2o4 nanocomposite effectively removes heavy metals and the nano adsorbent could be easily recovered using external magnet from the water sample fig 3 adsorption mechanism of as on these manganese ferrites go nanohybrids have been explained on the behaviour of as and adsorbent at different ph conditions as v exists in different ionic and neutral forms such as h3aso4 ph 2 1 h2aso4 2 1 ph 6 9 haso4 2 6 9 ph 11 5 and aso4 3 ph 11 5 70 whereas in natural environmental ph 4 8 conditions as iii exists in as oh 3 and aso oh 2 and as v exists in h2aso4 and haso42 ionic forms 71 72 at ph below 4 3 h2aso4 species remain in higher concentration whereas the oh groups on nanoparticles convert to oh2 ions favoring the adsorption of as v 72 conversion of as iii to as v is attributed to the presence of an enormous number of the active site in the manganese environment to expedite the adsorption process the decrease in the solution ph due to precipitation of manganese ii arsenate also favours the adsorption process 73 change in the solution ph before and after adsorption process the effect of temperature and other parameters are well illustrated in the concerned literature shahrin et al reported two new hybrid nanomaterials go manganese ferrite gmf and titania nanotube manganese ferrite tmf for their application in removal of as v by adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity for as v removal using gmf and tmf was found to be 102 mg g and 80 8 mg g respectively 74 rezaee et al have developed go based nanocomposite membranes by modified hummer s method for as v removal from aqueous media it has been found that increased go coating on membrane increases the rejection of arsenate ions with the initial concentration of 1000 μg l 1 the maximum percentage of arsenate rejection was 86 7 the removal of as ions by the nanostructure is attributed to the exceptional hydrophilic behaviour of go 75 chitosan a natural biopolymer has been widely explored for environmental remediation due to its versatile properties biodegradability non toxicity and the presence of numerous hydrophilic amine and hydroxyl functional groups jiang et al have devolved chitosan modified go as an efficient adsorbent for as ion removal from aqueous solution 76 the several responsible interactions such as cation π interaction rnh3 aromatic π system electrostatic interaction h2aso4 haso42 nh3r inter and intermolecular hydrogen bonding as well as anion π interaction r coo aromatic π system and r o aromatic π system have been proposed for as removal from aqueous media using chitosan modified go 2 1 2 removal of cr ions kumar et al have reported the modification of go with ionic liquid il for the improved extraction of hexavalent chromium from waste water 77 the enhanced adsorption property of the nanocomposite is attributed to the electrostatic interaction of hexachromate anion with ionic moieties of il recently jiang et al have proposed a sandwich nanocomposite of go iron oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles manganese dioxide nanowires and polypyrrole for efficient removal of hexavalent cr from wastewater using adsorption reduction mechanism 78 go provides the functional groups with the large surface area for effective adsorption while magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles offered easy separation and recovery from water mno2 acted as an oxidant and template for polymerization of pyrrole on the activated surface of nanocomposite go mno2 fe3o4 ppy gmfp the effect of ph on adsorption has also been demonstrated and partial reduction of adsorbed cr vi to cr iii leading to effective adsorption has been explained li et al have developed a modified go complex with magnetic cyclodextrin chitosan that showed productive potential in chromium vi removal 79 functionalization with magnetic complex imparted enhanced adsorption qualities to graphene oxide due to improved surface charge concentration larger surface area and better binding sites wang et al developed a nanocomposite of reduced graphene oxide rgo polyethyleneimine pei and magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 through oxidation reduction reaction which effectively adsorbed cr vi via electrostatic attraction and then partially reduced them to less toxic cr iii 80 the optimal nanocomposite of rgo pei fe3o4 was represented as ortf a magnet can easily recover the orpf after adsorption of cr ions with its maximum removal capacity of 266 6 mg g fig 4 2 2 carbon nanotubes cnts carbon nanotubes cnt are one of the most promising carbon based nanomaterials discovered by iijima 81 having unique structural electronic mechanical optoelectronic semiconductor and physiochemical properties due to their unique structure and properties they represent an attractive class of carbon based nanomaterials that have found wide application in the removal of heavy metals and dyes in wastewater treatment 82 83 according to their superstructure cnt can be classified as single walled and multiwalled cnts single walled cnt is one sheet of graphene rolled in a cylindrical form in contrast multi wall cnts are multiple layers of graphene sheets rolled over each other in a cylindrical shape with a spacing of 0 34 nm between adjacent layers the characteristic properties of cnt can be improved by functionalization with different types of metals resulting in the increase of oxygen nitrogen and other surface functional groups with enhanced dispersibility and specific surface area a wide range of studies for the removal of heavy metals by cnt has been reported for water remediation 84 cnt has excellent potential to remove many types of heavy metals including pb cd ni cu as etc 85 to enhance the sorption capacities cnts can be modified by oxidation combining with other metal ions or metal oxides and coupling with organic compounds 85 the mechanism for metal ion adsorption on cnt was attributed to the electrostatic interaction and chemical interaction between metal ion and surface functional groups of cnt 2 2 1 removal of as ions al omar et al has reported the functionalization of cnt using deep eutectic solvents dess based on n n diethyl ethanol ammonium chloride and glycerol for the removal of as iii from water 86 optimum removal conditions for as iii 17 mg g were found to be at ph 6 0 with an adsorbent dosage of 20 mg and contact time of 55 min using response surface methodology central composite experimental design setup multistage functionalized mwcnt was developed by budimirovic et al with enhanced surface terminal amino groups followed by subsequent modification by iron oxy hydroxide for as v removal 87 this study reports 91 97 adsorption of as v on the developed mwcnt at ph value lower than 7 12 phpzc due to the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged adsorbent surface and negatively charged monovalent anion h2aso4 pka1 2 3 kausar et al fabricated polystyrene nanocomposite films with 4 aminophenyl methyl sulphone and cnt as nanofiller and studied their biodegradation behaviour and as v sorption capabilities sorption result indicates that cnt formed some network with polystyrene which can be used for the removal of as v upto 99 efficiency 88 aranda et al have developed a method for the determination of ultra trace amount of as v present in water sample adsorbed on mwcnt modified with tertiary amine aliquot using the xrf x ray fluorescence technique the author suggests the applicability of the method for better selectivity detection limit wide ph range reproducibility and exemption of organic solvents for estimation of trace amount of as in water sample 89 various modifications and functionalization of cnt s have been reported to overcome the aggregation problem and insolubility issue of cnt s in aqueous media especially incorporating the magnetic behaviour of iron oxide with adsorption properties of cnt is of great interest due to the fast and effective action in the removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater bo chen et al have synthesized magnetic iron oxide cnt through a solid phase method and subsequently functionalized it by glutathione through a facile chemical route for enhanced as iii adsorption capacity these magnetic heterogeneous cnt surfaces have shown a maximum adsorption capacity of 19 12 mg g 1 for as iii 90 to overcome the tedious uneconomical and environmentally unfriendly liquid phase synthesis procedure chen et al have developed a one pot solid phase synthetic methodology for the development of magnetic iron oxide cnt for as removal 91 the synthesized magnetic iron oxide cnts bear characteristics of an ideal adsorbent including high specific surface area high dispersibility and desirable magnetic properties with a high adsorption capacity of 47 41 mg g and 24 04 mg g for as iii and as v respectively vadahanambi et al developed graphene cnt iron oxide nanostructures by microwave route with amino functionalization which exhibited excellent as removal efficiency due to its porous structure and the high surface volume ratio 92 fig 5 nalini et al have reported the development of zero valent iron nanoparticles impregnated mwcnts multi walled carbon nanotubes for as removal from aqueous media 93 edta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid used as a chelating agent in the mwcnt was responsible for the preservation of the zerovalent state of iron the as adsorption data fitted to the langmuir model have shown maximum adsorption capacity of 111 mg g and 66 mg g for as iii and as v the presence of surface functional groups including hydroxyl amino and carboxyl groups played an essential role in the adsorption of as on the synthesized mwcnt recycling studies indicate the performance of this adsorbent up to 5 cycles without any considerable reduction in the adsorption capacity in a study tio2 coated cnt network filter was prepared by the filtration steam hydrolysis method and further evaluated for the as removal in aqueous media 94 a 5 5 nm thick tio2 coating has wholly covered the cnt surface and enhanced the surface area upto196 mg g almost two fold more significant than the pristine cnt electro assisted sorption capacity of these network filters was found to be about 1 8 and 1 3 mg g for as iii and as v respectively cnts can also be functionalized to increase removal efﬁciency for metal ions peg polyethylene glycol functionalized cnt has been studied by velickovic et al for the removal of as from waste water 95 it was reported that the maximum adsorption capacity of this adsorbent for as was 13 mg g using initial concentration as of 10 mg l at ph 4 the magnetron sputtering technique has reported the functionalization of cnt without chemical treatment by depositing copper on the cnt membrane cu cnt 96 the removal of as iii using cu cnt was compared with cu mce mce mixed cellulose ester which possesses similar permeability the as iii removal efficiency was more than 90 with cu cnt whereas only 75 removal efficiency was observed with cu mce the as ions removal took place in two steps firstly cu catalyzed oxidation of as iii to as v takes place and then there is efficient adsorption of as v on the membrane fig 6 2 2 2 removal of cr ions mohammadkhani et al have described the removal of cr iii using mwcnts modified with mno2 particles using batch equilibrium experiments the modified mwcnts showed enhanced adsorption capability in the removal of chromium ions from waste water 97 song and group have reported the synthesis of reticulated vitreous carbon cnt rvc cnt electrode as a more efficient biocathode in a microbial fuel cell mfc for improved removal of hexavalent chromium ions from wastewater along with the generation of electricity 98 the rvc cnt offered enhanced electron transfer rate and electrical conductivity which in turn facilitated enhanced cr vi reduction by providing more reaction sites tawabini and co workers have reported the efficient removal of cr iii from wastewater using modified multi walled carbon nanotubes with varying conditions of adsorbent dose ph agitation speed and contact time they demonstrated that the physical and chemical properties of modified cnts m cnts best suited the affinity of cr iii ions to get adsorbed onto m cnts and hence enhanced adsorption efficiency of cnts could be obtained for cr iii removal from wastewater 99 gupta and colleagues have also determined the role of swcnts single walled carbon nanotubes and mwcnts multi walled carbon nanotubes inefficient removal of cr vi ions from wastewater under different experimental conditions including ph contact time initial cr vi ions concentration and adsorption capacity of adsorbent materials in the presence of competing for anion such as sulfate ions 100 they demonstrated the vital role of competing anions and ph as fighting for sulfate anions hindered the adsorption of cr vi ions on the cnt s adsorption sites swcnts and mwcnts showed their maximum adsorption potential at an optimum ph of 2 5 tseng et al 101 have reported the enhanced adsorption efficiency of multi walled carbon nanotubes by functionalizing them with ionic liquids in contrast huang et al have introduced magnetic properties to mwcnts to improve their adsorption efficiency for the effective removal of cr ions 102 ionic liquids provided the interesting electrostatic interactions between quaternary ammonium cations and oxygen containing carboxyl and hydroxy groups present on the surface of mwcnts they hence acted as robust adsorption material to host the adsorption of cr ions and other polluting metal ions from wastewater the cation π anion π and other electrostatic interactions amongst the mwcnts il complex and chromium ions enhances the adsorption of chromium ions onto mwcnts il complex and hence justifies the improved potential of modified cnts in water remediation on the other hand magnetic cnts can be easily dispersed in water and separated from water as well due to the presence of a magnet and hence poses like a supermodel for effective removal of heavy metal ions with no post contamination which is an important criterion to be considered in water remediation techniques atieh has described the use of carbon nanotubes supported with activated carbon for efficient removal of chromium vi ions from wastewater 103 he demonstrated that the adsorption efficiency of carbon nanotubes for cr removal gets enhanced on the coating with activated carbon hence it can be concluded that cnts act as robust adsorbent material for the effective removal of heavy metal ions and find great potential in water remediation 2 3 activated carbon ac activated carbon ac is one of the forms of carbonaceous materials that possess a highly porous internal structure and can be derived from different sources including bamboo coal wood nutshells and other organic materials using chemical treatment or pyrolysis approach 104 activation treatment of carbon material results in the generation of high surface area with a large number of binding sites that facilitate adsorbent to interact with different species including metal ions activated carbon composition comprises 80 of carbon material with 20 of other oxygen or nitrogen containing species that get introduced to content while the activation process 105 ac usually binds to chemical moieties by π π interactions however various modifications including acidic primary and other treatment results in stronger binding capacity of its metal impregnated acs have shown improved efficiency towards the removal of heavy metal ions and other contaminants from wastewater by offering more adsorption sites to these species 106 the metal impregnation of acs can be easily achieved either by adsorption of pre prepared metal nanoparticles onto acs or by reduction of metal salt solution 106 2 3 1 removal of as ions although the adsorption by ac is the most current technology for pollutant removal it has a disadvantage of the high application cost this can be overcome by preparing activated carbon from natural biomass and modifying it for better removal efficiency 107 low cost plant prosopisspicigera l derived silver impregnated carbon sic and its precursor un impregnated was designed characterized and investigated for the as iii removal 108 an increase in ph shows no regular trend for as removal as two ph were obtained for maximum extraction of as at ph 4 and ph 10 for 98 2 mg g and 207 5 mg g respectively under the acidic condition oxidation of metallic ag to ag leads to the reaction between aso3 and the formation of ag3aso3 precipitate adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent however under the alkaline conditions h2aso3 and haso3 2 also get adsorbed on the sic surface and lead to an increase in adsorption capacity arsenic removal was found to increase with an increase in temperature and 59 19 mg g adsorption capacity was observed at 45 c the adsorption data were found to follow the langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics model in another work activated carbon prepared from shea cake was used for the removal of as from aqueous media 109 the batch adsorption method was found to follow first order kinetics and langmuir adsorption model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 7 87 μg g of as activated carbon was used with a maximum adsorption capacity of 2 18 mg g for as removal from aqueous media 110 fazeli et al have physio chemically modified activated charcoal obtained from the walnut shell using phosphoric acid 5 v v and investigated for as removal 111 this modification led to the improvement in the surface area of the adsorbent from 1067 to 1437 m2 g 1 and decreased the mean pore size from 3 28 to 2 08 nm equilibrium time was obtained within 3 min with 98 removal efficiency for as in aqueous media the adsorption isotherm was found to obey the langmuir adsorption isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 120 μg g of as it has been suggested that the introduction of high amounts of free carboxyl groups through acidification of adsorbents resulting in ample physical and chemical interactions to absorb as ions on the surface ceria coated powdered activated carbon was used for the removal of as from aqueous media with a maximum adsorption capacity of 10 3 and 12 2 mg g for as iii and as v respectively 112 an increase in ph has not shown any variation in the as iii removal percentage below ph 9 2 due to the lack of any electrostatic interaction between adsorbent and neutral h3aso3 species this strong interaction between as iii and adsorbent is supposed to be quite applicable over a wide range of ph for as v the highest removal was observed at ph 8 as it exists in the anionic form within the ph range of 4 10 113 the more negative nature of the arsenic species facilitates the higher adsorption on the positively charged adsorbent at ph 8 and hence the most top removal iron compounds have been widely explored for the removal of arsenic from the aqueous media 114 116 numerous studies are available for arsenic removal using iron impregnated activated charcoal carbon which considerably improves its as adsorption tendency recently mn impregnated iron modiﬁed ac was developed by a simple and efficient method characterized and investigated for the removal of arsenic v from aqueous solutions 117 the presence of iron in activated charcoal increased the adsorption capacity to 11 05 mg g from 4 mg g for raw carbon which was further found to enhance by 19 35 mg g after incorporating mn to the iron activated charcoal surface complex formation of as v at the specific aqueous arsenate fe mn oxide interface was suggested to be the responsible mechanism for as v adsorption on the synthesized novel adsorbents in a similar pattern of studies the adsorption of as iii on iron oxide coated granular activated charcoal has been studied 118 the ph range of 7 5 9 5 was found to be suitable for maximum adsorption of as iii as the initial concentration was found to decrease by 10 μg l within 90 min of contact time from an initial level of 100 μg l the ph of zero point charge phzpc for iron oxide coated granular activated charcoal was observed at ph 8 2 at ph above 8 2 the surface of adsorbent becomes positively charge that facilitates the adsorption of negatively charged as iii species due to electrostatic interaction and hence high adsorption was observed iron impregnated granular activated charcoal was used for the removal of as from water and to access the portioning behaviour of as under different conditions 119 a range of ferric concentrations was used for the synthesis of iron impregnated activated carbon which has shown 92 98 removal capacity for as v and 42 65 for as as iii langmuir adsorption isotherm has well fitted the adsorption data suggesting the adsorption capacity of 125 mg g and 98 4 mg g for as v and as iii respectively which was well explained based on ph dependent behaviour of arsenic and adsorbent similarly yao et al 120 have reported the as v removal studies using iron impregnated activated charcoal with 98 removal capacity within 60 min of contact time in the ph range of 3 5 8 2 3 2 removal of cr ions in case of activated carbon ac several investigations have shown that the maximum removal of cr vi from aqueous solutions take place in acidic conditions probably due to the neutralization of negative charges on the surface of the adsorbents by excess hydrogen ions thereby enabling the diffusion of hydrogen chromate ions hcro4 and then subsequent adsorption 121 in a recent study by su et al ac was modified with micro sized geothite mfeooh using a facile and cost effective impregnation method for enhanced cr vi removal from aqueous solutions via adsorption reduction and co precipitation mechanism with a maximum adsorption capacity of 28 1 mg g as represented in fig 7 122 huang et al 123 proposed three mechanisms physical electrostatic and chemical redox reaction for the removal of cr vi by the chitosan mwcnts cooh composite as shown in fig 8 the first physical adsorption was due to the electrostatic interaction between anionic cr vi and cationic amino and carboxylate groups at the surface of the composite simultaneously the chemical redox reaction occurred where cr vi reduced to cr iii which further desorbed and released into the solution due to electrostatic repulsion finally a second chemical redox reaction also occurred via the direct reduction of free cr vi anionic species to cr iii where the later was subsequently adsorbed by the chitosan mwcnts cooh composite the maximum adsorption efficiency of cr ion observed was 163 mg g within 30 min at ph 2 using these composite materials azari et al used the technique to modify acs with bimetallic nanoparticles comprising zero valent iron and silver for efficient removal of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solution this modified bimetallic activated carbon nanocomposite act as magnetic adsorbent as well and showed enhanced potential in the removal of cr vi 124 acs can also be functionalized with cnts to enhance the adsorption efficiency for efficient removal of heavy metal ions and other contaminants from wastewater pehlivan and group have synthesized the nanocomposite of activated carbon supported carbon nanotubes to accomplish the removal of cr vi ions from aqueous solution they compared the adsorption capacity of nanocomposites having different shapes such as tubular and spherical ac cnt complexes and determined that tubular composite exhibits better adsorption potential rather than its spherical counterpart and hence showed improved efficiency in removal of cr vi from aqueous solution 125 recently a new kind of adsorbent is synthesized using waste sludge for efficient removal of cr vi by adsorption on activated carbon 126 these studies show that carbonaceous materials offer remarkable adsorption capabilities for efficient removal of chromium and other heavy metal ions and contribute effectively towards water remediation the adsorption capacities of different carbon nanomaterials for the removal of as and cr ions from water samples have been tabulated in table 2 and table 3 the data reveals the impact of functionalization and modification on the adsorption tendency of nanocarbon materials to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions 2 4 miscellaneous nano carbon materials for removal of as and cr ions carbon nanospheres have been prepared by the spray pyrolysis method and used to remove as and se ions from various water samples deionized canal and well water through adsorption mechanism 133 the microporous nanospheres exhibited useful adsorption tendency due to primary functional groups present on the surface and high surface volume ratio venkateswarlu et al developed an economic graphene oxide like 2d carbon flake material 2d cf using waste onion sheathing and then modified it with magnetite nanoparticles for the removal of as iii from water 134 the adsorption capacity of bioinspired nanocomposite material was 57 47 mg g with pseudo second order kinetics the mechanism of as iii adsorption has been demonstrated in fig 9 ge et al have established the effective removal of arsenite adsorption capacity 103 4 mg g and arsenate adsorption capacity 172 9 mg g ions from the aqueous solution using β feooh nanorods modified 3d carbon foams 135 the abundant active sites presence of hydroxyl groups and hierarchical porous structure of nanostructure help in the effective binding of as ions fullerenes extracted soot modified with ethylenediamine has also been developed for adsorption of cr vi ions from aqueous solution 136 pathan et al reported the synthesis of nanoporous carbon structures by pyrolysis of grass and this acid functionalized porous nanocarbon was used for the removal of cr vi ions magnetic carbon particles mcps and magnetic carbon fibers mcfs were also prepared by different methods to study the effect of morphology on the adsorption process mcfs showed three times better adsorption capacity 43 17 mg g as compared to mcps 15 88 mg g for the removal of cr vi ions at ph 1 137 this is ascribed to more active sites in the fibrillar sample and their mechanism of removal has been given in fig 10 the nano hydrogels based on feedstock has also been developed as renewable bio based materials for as removal applications 138 calixarenes based nanomaterials have also been developed for effective removal of as and cr ions nanofibres of calixarene derivatives supported on polymeric polyacrylonitrile material were prepared by the electrospinning method 139 the nanofibre mats exhibited excellent adsorption capacity for chromate anion in aqueous solution magnetite modified calixarene nanomaterials have also been developed for the removal of arsenate and dichromate from the aqueous solution 140 the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding play an essential role in the adsorption process the development of newer carbon based nanomaterials provides a unique platform for the water remediation process by effectively removing as and cr ions from the aqueous solution rahman et al have developed new nanocomposites fabricated electrode with polyaniline graphene carbon nanotubes pani g cnts nanostructures for selective sensing of 4 aminophenol by the electrochemical method 141 the potential of immiscible polymer bends in membrane development for separation applications has also been analyzed and the role of surface modification and precise pore size distribution on separation techniques have also been studied 142 the significant challenge to develop carbon nanostructure is the use of costly and harmful chemicals gaddam et al addressed this issue by developing carbon nanomaterials derived from camphor for the separation of heavy metals 143 shivaprasad et al have studied the removal of fluorine from drinking water using nano alumia 144 satapathi et al developed an eco friendly multimodal nano based sensor which has magnetic and fluorescent components and exhibited excellent detection and removal efficiency for mercury ions from the water with significant low detection limits 145 ma et al developed magnesium oxide based different nanostructures such as nanoflowers and nano wires 146 the nanowires of magnesium oxide showed promising removal tendency for arsenate and phosphates from the water the electrostatic interaction was considered to be responsible for the adsorption process sharma et al reported the efficient removal of arsenic iii from water using nano tin ferrous oxide modified graphene oxide sheets with a sorption capacity of 105 mg g 147 the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics was followed and the new developed nanomaterial obeyed langmuir isotherm manish et al elaborated on the synthetic procedures for the development of carbon nanodots with tunable emission tendencies and high luminescence the applications of carbon nanodots in the detection of different metal ions have also been discussed 148 the carbonaceous material also acts as a stabilizing agent for nanostructures dutta et al reported the synthesis of silver bio nano composite using citric acid as a reducing agent and chitosan as a stabilizer 149 they examined the size dependent antibacterial activity of these nanosilver structures zhao et al reported the effective removal of chromium vi ions along with rhodamine b and methylene blue dyes using hydrothermally fabricated tio2 moo3 nanomaterials 150 because of the burning issue for the removal of two toxic metals cr and as from wastewater tremendous research data and reviews are available however limited patents are found recently in a patent the investigators claimed to modify a filter using gravity and dip coating method involving a polymer carbon based nanocomposite poly n vinyl carbazole graphene graphene oxide to significantly improve the efficiency of filtration separation and remediation of a broad range of pollutants 151 in another patent carbon magnetite nanocomposites have been developed using renewable resources for the removal of arsenic from water 152 2 5 separation reusability and toxicity of carbon nanomaterials due to the porosity high adsorption capacity chemical inertness and environment friendly nature various nanomaterials including carbon based materials activated carbon are most widely used as an adsorbent for the remediation of effluent water treatment however their high cost agglomeration tendency and restriction to recycle and reuse limit their use on a large scale 153 154 therefore to overcome these shortcomings efforts have been made to load carbon nanoparticles on the surface of natural minerals like attapulgite illite palygorskite montmorillonite etc to obtain carbon nanocomposites with enhanced surface activity than singel carbon nanomaterial 155 nanocomposite a multiphase solid material offers multifunctionality which is generally not found in conventional materials 156 the enhanced properties of polymer carbon nanocomposites as compared to traditional composite materials depends upon the quality of dispersion processing methods loading of the particles aspect ratio of the nanoparticles modification of the surfaces of nanoparticles compatibility of particle and host polymer size of particles etc nanocomposites as nano adsorbents offer high sorption efficiency and rapid process kinetics due to their large specific surface area pore size distribution and easily accessible sorption sites 157 158 the presence of non metallic minerals provides enhancement of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of carbon nanocomposites with improved capacity for adsorption separation of pollutants heavy metals from the wastewater with cost effectiveness recently sun et al have reported efficient removal of cr vi 142 8 mg g from wastewater using carboxyl rich carbon nanocomposite based on natural diatomite in this study diatomite has been selected for its high ion exchange capacity availability of abundant adsorption sites high porosity strong permeability and chemical inertness the synthesized carboxyl abundant carbon based nanocomposites were free from the agglomeration problem with improved adsorption capacity and reduced cost the material can be recycled and reused effectively up to four times after washing with alkali 155 it is reported that polypyrrole fe3o4 nanocomposite is an excellent adsorbent for the removal of cr vi from wastewater 155 salam et al prepared multi walled cnts chitosan nanocomposite by sonicating the chitosan and cnts suspension and then cross linking them with glutaraldehyde for efficient removal of metal ions 159 hayati et al 160 have synthesized cnt coated poly amidoamine dendrimer nanocomposite for adsorption of as iii in a fixed bed system with maximum uptake efficiency of 432 mg g gupta et al designed the swcnts polysulfone nanocomposite based membrane with reduced pore size smoother surface and higher rejection capacity for the removal of 96 8 cr vi and 87 6 as iii metal ions 161 in another study bankole et al used poly hydroxybutyrate functionalized carbon nanotubes phb cnts a composite of biodegradable and biocompatible polymer with carbon nanotubes with low toxicity ease of production and high availability the author has suggested that the metal adsorption phenomenon is not only influenced by the surface area but indirectly by composite s water holding capacity and attached functionality finally the metal treated phb cnts composite as adsorbate meets the water quality standard for re use either for industrial or agricultural irrigation activities 162 due to the complex nature of cr vi adsorbent interactions mentioned earlier researchers have found ways to capitalize on the different synergies by producing adsorbents that address two or more mechanisms 163 graphene and go rgo based materials have been extensively reported to remove heavy metals from wastewater 17 164 ali et al 46 published a detailed survey of go in its pristine and modified form for the removal of heavy metals and organic pollutants the synergism of cnt with go in the way of nanocomposites at a commercial level is limited because of the formation of stable and concentrated dispersion of cnts and go as starting material especially in the water system beyond 0 01 to 0 1 even in the presence of surfactants which is undesirable at times 165 efforts have been made to increase the water solubility of go and cnt by modification with resol type phenol formaldehyde resins in an alkaline medium with improved compatibility and distribution characteristics 166 an important property of the carbonaceous nanomaterials as adsorbent should be their ability to reuse after the regeneration process these nanomaterials should possess a high adsorption capacity with a good desorption property which considerably reduces the total cost of the adsorbent to reuse the metal adsorbed carbonaceous nanomaterials an efficient methodology is required for efficient extraction removal of the metals so that the desired material can be utilized for further metal adsorption cycles these carbon nanomaterials can be reused after washing with alkali solutions budimirovic et al have reported the removal of various metal ions using functionalized mwcnts and found ph dependent desorption of as v after adsorption about 30 of as v is desorbed at ph 6 5 the sudden desorption increase occurs at ph 6 5 and reaches a value of 78 at ph 10 167 the metal adsorbed carbon nanomaterials should meet the water quality standard for re use either for industrial or agricultural irrigation activities researchers have suggested that instead of chemically oxidized multiwalled cnts plasma oxidized multiwalled cnts may be used as sorbents for various metals compared with chemically oxidized cnts plasma oxidized tubes showed an increased sorption capacity mainly due to the addition of oxygen containing functional groups to the cnt surface the study of the regeneration process showed that the metal ions are easily desorbed from the plasma oxidized cnts 168 the toxicity of carbon nanotubes is a controversial topic nowadays even after various in vitro and in vivo studies the exact defined cause of cnt toxicity is not yet fully understood it has been reported that the accumulation of cnt and subsequently generated reactive oxygen species could be the most probable cause of cnt toxicity however to confirm the toxicity of cnt s a vast study is required taking into consideration the physio chemical parameters like cnts length diameters mass particle concentration defective reactive sites surface functionalization absorption aggregation agglomeration states metallic impurities etc 169 170 2 6 cost benefit analysis carbon based nanomaterials have been extensively explored for their enhanced removal efficiency of heavy metals in water due to their exceptional physiochemical properties despite various advantages offered by the carbon based nanomaterials cnts graphene go rgo for the removal of pollutants heavy metals from wastewater they are still associated with various drawbacks some certain issues and challenges need to be addressed for the successful employment of these carbon based nanomaterials at a large scale for the removal of heavy metals most of the research using these nanomaterials or heavy metal removal is at their preliminary stage and required extensive research for practical application high manufacture and modification cost difficulty in separation after adsorption of pollutants high treatment cost of pollutant heavy metal adsorbed nanomaterials regeneration recycling and toxicity of these nanomaterials are the crucial matters of top consideration 171 primarily the synthesis and operational cost of the nanomaterials need to be minimized and optimized from the economic point of view tremendous efforts for the large scale production of these nanomaterials using green research methodology are required for their application in the treatment of actual industrial wastewater irrespective of the available laboratory level research data the toxicity and biocompatibility of these carbonaceous nanomaterials for the environment and human beings should be abundantly explored from the economic point of view methods to improve metal removal efficiency by overcoming their agglomeration tendency regeneration reuse and recycling of the heavy metal adsorbed carbon nanomaterials is highly mandatory and required extensive research for the development 171 2 7 challenges and prospects the high concentration of heavy metals in particular arsenic and chromium in water bodies due to natural and anthropogenic routes has aroused a great concern worldwide their presence in the environment in more than the recommended values of the world health organization in most of the parts of the world necessitates the need for a very selective economical and efficient system to remove them from water the toxicity of arsenic includes abdominal pain watery diarrhea with blood encephalopathy skin thickening and darkening heart disease and numbness its high concentration in the body is also linked to affect the gut microflora and thereby could lead to metabolism and digestion alarms accompanied with several kinds of cancer and other diseases 172 the intake of a high percentage of chromium ions is also known to cause bronchial carcinomas 173 the poisoning of chromium ions causes dermatitis eczematous skin effects hepatocellular deficiency mucous membrane ulceration nasal septum perforation allergic asthmatic problems gastro enteritis and renal oligo anuric deficiency problem 173 therefore there is a social urge to remove and arsenic and chromium ions from water through adsorption and thereby prevent the main entry route of heavy metals into the physiological system the carbonaceous nanomaterials have been reported with remarkable adsorption capabilities at the laboratory scale however for the actual treatment of wastewater these nanomaterials are still facing many challenges that need to be resolved for practical application to remove pollutants mainly as and cr like heavy metals simple cost effective and extensive scale fabrication methods are required for the development of carbonaceous nanomaterials for a variety of applications the natural recovery and reusability of these materials could make the process cost effective and sustainable however their modifications with magnetic nanoparticles have been performed for their magnetic separation the processing at the industrial level need to be analyzed for commercialization agglomeration of carbonaceous nanomaterials like cnt and go in aqueous media is one of the major hindrances in pollutant removal from wastewater which results in a lack of surface area and reduction in the number of active sites therefore there is an urgent need for the surface modification of these nanomaterials for efficient adsorption selection and affinity for as and cr ions despite the exceptional properties of cnts and other carbon nanostructures the development and applications of carbon materials are mainly limited by their low volume of production low removal efficiency limited selectivity and high cost 174 also carbon nanomaterials cannot be used alone without any supporting medium 175 the toxicity of various carbonaceous nanomaterials needs to be investigated on an urgent basis for human beings living things and the environment cnts have been a growing concern since their discovery in the early 90 s recently many reports have come up regarding health concerns 176 177 besides this the ph of the water sample is an essential parameter for the effective removal of as and cr by functionalized carbon nanostructures for actual wastewater treatment synthesis and surface modification of the carbonaceous materials are required to be scaled up which could be costly in some cases disposal of pollutant adsorbed carbonaceous nanomaterials need attention so that the accumulation of second generation waste materials can be avoided however these limitations can be addressed methodically and the usefulness of carbonaceous nanomaterials can be improved for real life applications the modification of nano carbons with biomaterials and their bio inspired synthesis opens a new avenue in the development of green and economical materials where large scale production can effectively be carried out for the removal of toxic as and cr ions from real industrial waste the combined remediation approach involving redox and adsorption mechanism by carbon nanomaterials modified by redox active metals or organic moieties is the future of new generation materials for converting more toxic metal ions into its less deadly form such as as v turns to as iii and cr vi changes to cr iii followed by adsorption on the porous carbon nanomaterials the functionalization to introduce selectivity in hybrid carbon nanostructures progresses their structural and chemical aspects developing the promising potential for the pollutants and heavy metal removal from the wastewater system 2 8 conclusion the water pollution by heavy metals like as and cr is getting increased day by day and causing grave concern to aquatic and human life due to their inability to self purification bio accumulative effect chemical toxicity and smooth migration and transformation carbonaceous materials show promising potential to remove as and cr ions from wastewater due to their unique structural and chemical properties the nano carbon materials such as cnts swcnts and mwcnts graphene oxide and activated carbon possess incredibly high surface area and porosity which is responsible for faster adsorption rate of as and cr ions from aqueous solution carbon nanomaterials can be synthesized and modified by simple processes to introduce endowed selectivity tunability and performances these materials can penetrate deeper and thus can treat water wastewater which is generally not possible by conventional technologies graphene carbon nanotubes and activated carbon based materials are the most widely developed carbon nanostructures for their application in heavy metals as and cr removal from water bodies nowadays their bio based modifications and chemical free modification techniques are growing to provide a green solution to the water pollution problem the hybrid materials with a coupled mechanistic approach involving redox and adsorption techniques are producing astonishing results they have the potential to take this nanotechnological approach to the next level of commercial growth the ph and nature of functional groups present on carbon nanomaterials are essential parameters for the success of designed functional nanomaterials as a promising candidate for the potential removal of as and cr ions via adsorption mechanism there is an urgent need to address all the challenges for the revolution of carbon nanomaterials from laboratory scale research to the commercial level platform the promising future of carbon nanostructures may provide an ultimate solution to the water pollution problem by effectively removing toxic heavy metals

13967,the rapidly increasing occurrence of heavy and toxic metals in water bodies harms health and ecosystem globally heavy metals accumulated in soil and water bodies enter into the food chain and their hazardous effects on human health have been investigated extensively chromium and arsenic represent the toxic metals widely present in wastewater and their high concentrations cause a life threatening impact on human health many nano adsorbents have been developed to reduce the level of cr and as ions from wastewater however their efficiencies are low recently various carbonaceous nanomaterials have been developed with extraordinary and tunable physical chemical properties to exhibit outstanding adsorption efficacy for heavy metals the application of various carbonaceous nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes graphene and chemically modified forms and modifications have been discussed in detail in the present review article for the removal of cr and as ions from wastewater keywords carbonaceous materials graphene oxide carbon nanotube arsenic chromium water pollution adsorption nanocomposites 1 introduction water is the primary need for the survival of human and animal beings among various sources responsible for water pollution heavy metals are one of the primary sources 1 heavy metals are naturally occurring elements with high atomic weight and density as high as five times as water 2 weathering of soils and rocks volcanic eruption various anthropogenic activities including mining processing or use of metal pollutants are the sources of heavy metal introduction into the water system the most common water polluting heavy metals are arsenic chromium cadmium copper nickel lead and mercury heavy metals tend to bioaccumulate in the body and their consumption above bio recommended limits leads to various biotoxic effects to the body 3 among all the heavy metals arsenic as and chromium cr are the major causes of water pollution by anthropogenic and natural sources arsenic is known to be highly toxic to all life forms and has been classiﬁed by the world health organization who as a group 1 human carcinogenic substance 4 5 the chronic intake of inorganic as above 50 μg l in drinking water causes different kinds of skin disorders e g hyperpigmentation hyperkeratosis and cancer skin lung kidney bladder which are collectively known as arsenicosis 6 it has been reported that as is a metalloid that can exist in its organic forms as monomethylarsonic acid mma dimethylarsinic acid dma and trimethylarsine oxide and it also exists as trivalent arsenite as iii and pentavalent arsenate as v in its inorganic forms the toxicity of these species increases in the order dma mma arsenate arsenite 7 as iii is more harmful to human health than as v as it is more cytotoxic genotoxic mobile and soluble it has been well reported that the toxicity of arsenic is decided by the various factors including the exposure dose frequency duration biological species age gender individual susceptibilities genetic and nutritional values 8 as iii can inactivate about 200 enzymes in the body and as v can replace phosphate involved in many biochemical reactions and hence shows various adverse effects on different organ systems 9 therefore the who recommended maximum contaminant limit mcl of 10 μg l for arsenic in drinking water instead of its previous guideline 50 μg l the mcl recommended for chromium in drinking water is 0 1 mg l the high concentration of cr also exerts strong toxic effects as it can diffuse through the cell membranes oxidize biological molecules and create a potential risk of living being healthy cr ions usually exist as cr iii and cr vi in the water sources the cr vi is about 100 times more toxic than cr iii and it is a well known carcinogenic element present in drinking water 10 cr vi occurs in the form of cro4 or cr2o7 2 oxyanions in water cr vi is responsible for skin tumors in animals and it also damages the dna by forming the cr dna adduct cr vi is known to be responsible for stomach cancer as well various methods including adsorption dialysis extraction ion exchange and precipitation have been used to remediate as and cr ions from waste water 11 due to the cost effectiveness ease in availability and operation high efficiency for heavy metal removal and regeneration after use the adsorption technique is one of the promising methods of choice carbonaceous materials with microporous and mesoporous structures large surface area and versatile adsorption qualities find their potential in the removal of heavy metal ions from polluted water reservoirs 12 nanotechnology has gained broad interest in almost every field of science as nanosized materials offer improved qualities and find potential in widespread applications 13 maitlo et al recently published a review article based on the application of nanomaterials for chromium removal from water highlighting the influence of various factors synergetic effect and a possible mechanism for adsorption phenomenon 14 another recent review article by baby et al 15 demonstrated the varied applications of different carbon nanomaterials in the removal of varying water pollutants including heavy metals they have also focused on the bio compatibility of different carbon structures which offers an additional advantage to their use in environmental remediation agarwal et al reported the recent advances in the application of commercially available nano adsorbents and bio adsorbents in the removal of heavy metals from water 16 yang et al 17 described the importance of carbon nanomaterials zero valent metal nanoparticles metal oxide nanoparticles and different other nanocomposites in the separation of heavy metals from wastewater kalarikkal et al have prepared various nanomaterials for a wide range of applications 18 19 20 their research group fabricated polylactic acid nano chitosan based composite fibers for effective adsorption of cadmium ions from water 21 they have also developed ionic liquids modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes embedded with styrene butadiene rubber for the preparation of membranes which was used for the selective removal of toluene from the azeotropic mixture of toluene and methanol 22 it was observed that the benzyl group of the ionic liquid unit plays a vital role in selective binding with toluene gopakumar et al reported the development of nanocellulose materials for different applications 23 25 they reported the synthesis of antibacterial nanopaper for the removal of anionic dyes 26 they also prepared cellulose nanofiber aerogels through silanization process for their environmental remediation application 27 these nanostructures can be easily synthesized for their commercialized use by the easy economical and environmentally friendly method these nanomaterials can effectively remove dyes from the water they have developed nanocellolulose

tetramethylpiperidin 1 yl oxyl for the removal of dyes from water 39 they also developed film like xerogels and porous cryogels from cellulose nanofibrils and reduced graphene oxide 40 the recent development in the synthesis and processing of 2 d nanomaterials with the desired structure large surface area and broad applicability has also been reported by their group 41 in recent years nanosized carbonaceous materials have also been reported to show enhanced efficiency in water remediation technologies 42 43 carbon nanomaterials are gaining more importance over other nanomaterials due to its different advantageous properties including high surface area mechanical strength electric and optical properties layered structure lightweight chemical stability high ease of biodegradation porous framework controlled pore size distribution intense binding energy and high π π electrostatic forces various carbonaceous materials used for removal of as and cr heavy metal ions include graphene oxide carbon nanotubes and activated carbon materials the applications and modifications of various carbonaceous materials for the removal of as and cr ions from wastewater has been discussed in the present review 2 carbonaceous nanomaterials and their nanocomposites for the removal of as and cr ions in recent decades different types of carbon based nanomaterials have been used widely for heavy metal remediation it has been demonstrated that the nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes cnts graphene activated carbons carbon fibers etc play an essential role in the wastewater treatment processes by effectively removing as and cr ions from water samples the variable adsorption mechanisms have been anticipated to act simultaneously on the surface of carbonaceous nanomaterials depending upon the surface functionalization and environmental test conditions 44 as the adsorption relies on the availability of active sites in the case of activated charcoal adsorbent physical chemical activation need to be performed for efficient adsorption phenomenon on the other hand nano dimensional graphene having high surface area disperses and unfolds in aqueous media providing higher interaction and adsorption sites for the pollutants as compared to activated carbon graphene oxide contains various oxygen containing surface functional groups such as hydroxyl carbonyl carboxylic epoxide etc which not only helps in its homogeneous dispersion but also interact with multiple pollutants via electrostatic interaction and π π interaction 45 the adsorption mechanism of heavy metals by cnts relies on the surface feature electrochemical potential and ion exchange process the pristine cnt shows meager adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions but that could be significantly enhanced by oxidation with hno3 naocl or kmno4 44 the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of cnts allow for binding metal ions and organic pollutants via physical adsorption electrostatic interaction precipitation and chemical interactions 46 besides surface functional groups of carbon nanomaterials it was observed that an increase in solution ph and temperature also increased the adsorption of metal ions this may be attributed to the higher diffusion rate of metal ions lower activation energy of adsorption solution viscosity and structural changes 47 although as an adsorbent every carbonaceous nanomaterial offer unique structural and functional characteristics they all have active surface functional groups in common providing physical chemical interactions responsible for the adsorption of heavy metals 48 the impact of the presence of surface functional groups on separation application is well established in the literature 49 by using physical chemical modification methods functionality and quantity of the heteroatom o n s containing functional groups can be enhanced on the surface of carbonaceous nanomaterials fig 1 such modification may lead to the alteration enhancement of the various surface properties of carbon nanomaterials such as specific surface area pore size distribution volume etc 50 there are various mechanisms responsible for the separation adsorption of heavy metals like as and cr by carbonaceous nanomaterials including physical adsorption electrostatic interaction ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation it depends upon the surface chemistry of carbonaceous nanomaterial as adsorbents ionic environment of the aqueous media and nature of the adsorbate as depicted in fig 2 50 a thorough molecular dynamic simulation study for adsorption of metal ions by surface functionalized cnt s was reported by anitha et al 47 it has been reported that the cnt coo surface effectively adsorbs over 150 230 more metal ions compared to the bare cnt surface on the other hand oh and conh2 are relatively weak functional groups where excess metal ions adsorption compared to the bare cnt is in the range 10 47 the effect of the various functional groups of nanomaterials on maximum adsorption capacity qmax is listed in table 1 2 1 graphene or oxide graphene has gained considerable attention in the field of water treatment due to its remarkable adsorption capability it can be easily obtained from graphite and hence offers a non expensive method to remove heavy metal ions and other pollutants from wastewater it occurs in the form of a carbon sheet with an sp2 hybridized structure and possesses a large surface area however it gets challenging to separate graphene from the water after adsorption of contaminants that may lead to nanotoxicity or recontamination hence researchers have explored different functionalized graphene materials to get better outcomes of graphene properties 57 among the chemically functionalized graphene graphene oxide go acts as remarkable adsorbent material decorated with a variety of hydrophilic oxygen containing functional groups such as carbonyl c o carboxyl cooh epoxy c o c and hydroxyl oh throughout the go sheets 58 graphene oxide can be easily synthesized from graphene by treating with acid using a modified hummers procedure 59 the increased surface area and presence of oxygen containing functional groups of go allow the formation of the membrane with enhanced water permeability through the graphene oxide sheets they hence offer increased potential for its use in water remediation 60 it has been used for the efficient removal of heavy metal ions and other organic and inorganic pollutants from waste water 61 63 owing to its great beneficial uses in water remediation researchers have explored further functionalization of go to achieve even better results 64 65 it can be obtained either by chemical reactions at oxygen containing functional groups or non covalent interactions of other molecules with go or its reduced form 2 1 1 removal of as ions the modification of go by magnetic nanoparticles has been widely explored for the removal of organic and inorganic water pollutants chandra et al have reported the application of water dispersible magnetite modified reduced go for the removal of as ions from aqueous media 66 adsorption data calculated from the langmuir model shows maximum adsorption capacity for as v and as iii as 5 83 mg g and 13 10 mg g respectively it has been well established that as v exist in the anionic form h2aso3 and as iii exist in its neutral form h3aso4 over a wide range of ph thus emphasizing the role of ph in adsorption phenomenon it has been reported that at ph point of zero charges the adsorbent is negatively charged and at ph point of zero cost the adsorbent is positively charged thereby adsorbent exhibits high as v adsorption at low ph however at high ph the adsorption process is followed by surface complexation rather than electrostatic interactions as high as iii adsorption was observed at high ph value hang et al have reported the maximum adsorption capacity for as iii and as v as 54 18 mg g and 26 76 m g respectively using magnetic iron oxide go with the iron content of 51 wt 67 interestingly the elemental distribution map generated through the x ray fluorescent technique suggests that as v is preferentially associated with iron oxides during the adsorption process and that the distribution of fe and as is directly correlated yan et al have reported the synthesis of three dimensional nanostructured fe3o4 graphene aerogels for the removal of as ions from water 68 the aerogels exhibit a significant capacity of as v ions adsorption up to 40 048 mg g the adsorption isotherm has been well correlated with the langmuir model which follows pseudo second order kinetics for the adsorption process suresh kumar et al has reported the excellent adsorption properties of nanohybrids of single layer go and magnetic manganese ferrite for pb and as ions 69 the go mnfe2o4 nanocomposite effectively removes heavy metals and the nano adsorbent could be easily recovered using external magnet from the water sample fig 3 adsorption mechanism of as on these manganese ferrites go nanohybrids have been explained on the behaviour of as and adsorbent at different ph conditions as v exists in different ionic and neutral forms such as h3aso4 ph 2 1 h2aso4 2 1 ph 6 9 haso4 2 6 9 ph 11 5 and aso4 3 ph 11 5 70 whereas in natural environmental ph 4 8 conditions as iii exists in as oh 3 and aso oh 2 and as v exists in h2aso4 and haso42 ionic forms 71 72 at ph below 4 3 h2aso4 species remain in higher concentration whereas the oh groups on nanoparticles convert to oh2 ions favoring the adsorption of as v 72 conversion of as iii to as v is attributed to the presence of an enormous number of the active site in the manganese environment to expedite the adsorption process the decrease in the solution ph due to precipitation of manganese ii arsenate also favours the adsorption process 73 change in the solution ph before and after adsorption process the effect of temperature and other parameters are well illustrated in the concerned literature shahrin et al reported two new hybrid nanomaterials go manganese ferrite gmf and titania nanotube manganese ferrite tmf for their application in removal of as v by adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity for as v removal using gmf and tmf was found to be 102 mg g and 80 8 mg g respectively 74 rezaee et al have developed go based nanocomposite membranes by modified hummer s method for as v removal from aqueous media it has been found that increased go coating on membrane increases the rejection of arsenate ions with the initial concentration of 1000 μg l 1 the maximum percentage of arsenate rejection was 86 7 the removal of as ions by the nanostructure is attributed to the exceptional hydrophilic behaviour of go 75 chitosan a natural biopolymer has been widely explored for environmental remediation due to its versatile properties biodegradability non toxicity and the presence of numerous hydrophilic amine and hydroxyl functional groups jiang et al have devolved chitosan modified go as an efficient adsorbent for as ion removal from aqueous solution 76 the several responsible interactions such as cation π interaction rnh3 aromatic π system electrostatic interaction h2aso4 haso42 nh3r inter and intermolecular hydrogen bonding as well as anion π interaction r coo aromatic π system and r o aromatic π system have been proposed for as removal from aqueous media using chitosan modified go 2 1 2 removal of cr ions kumar et al have reported the modification of go with ionic liquid il for the improved extraction of hexavalent chromium from waste water 77 the enhanced adsorption property of the nanocomposite is attributed to the electrostatic interaction of hexachromate anion with ionic moieties of il recently jiang et al have proposed a sandwich nanocomposite of go iron oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles manganese dioxide nanowires and polypyrrole for efficient removal of hexavalent cr from wastewater using adsorption reduction mechanism 78 go provides the functional groups with the large surface area for effective adsorption while magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles offered easy separation and recovery from water mno2 acted as an oxidant and template for polymerization of pyrrole on the activated surface of nanocomposite go mno2 fe3o4 ppy gmfp the effect of ph on adsorption has also been demonstrated and partial reduction of adsorbed cr vi to cr iii leading to effective adsorption has been explained li et al have developed a modified go complex with magnetic cyclodextrin chitosan that showed productive potential in chromium vi removal 79 functionalization with magnetic complex imparted enhanced adsorption qualities to graphene oxide due to improved surface charge concentration larger surface area and better binding sites wang et al developed a nanocomposite of reduced graphene oxide rgo polyethyleneimine pei and magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 through oxidation reduction reaction which effectively adsorbed cr vi via electrostatic attraction and then partially reduced them to less toxic cr iii 80 the optimal nanocomposite of rgo pei fe3o4 was represented as ortf a magnet can easily recover the orpf after adsorption of cr ions with its maximum removal capacity of 266 6 mg g fig 4 2 2 carbon nanotubes cnts carbon nanotubes cnt are one of the most promising carbon based nanomaterials discovered by iijima 81 having unique structural electronic mechanical optoelectronic semiconductor and physiochemical properties due to their unique structure and properties they represent an attractive class of carbon based nanomaterials that have found wide application in the removal of heavy metals and dyes in wastewater treatment 82 83 according to their superstructure cnt can be classified as single walled and multiwalled cnts single walled cnt is one sheet of graphene rolled in a cylindrical form in contrast multi wall cnts are multiple layers of graphene sheets rolled over each other in a cylindrical shape with a spacing of 0 34 nm between adjacent layers the characteristic properties of cnt can be improved by functionalization with different types of metals resulting in the increase of oxygen nitrogen and other surface functional groups with enhanced dispersibility and specific surface area a wide range of studies for the removal of heavy metals by cnt has been reported for water remediation 84 cnt has excellent potential to remove many types of heavy metals including pb cd ni cu as etc 85 to enhance the sorption capacities cnts can be modified by oxidation combining with other metal ions or metal oxides and coupling with organic compounds 85 the mechanism for metal ion adsorption on cnt was attributed to the electrostatic interaction and chemical interaction between metal ion and surface functional groups of cnt 2 2 1 removal of as ions al omar et al has reported the functionalization of cnt using deep eutectic solvents dess based on n n diethyl ethanol ammonium chloride and glycerol for the removal of as iii from water 86 optimum removal conditions for as iii 17 mg g were found to be at ph 6 0 with an adsorbent dosage of 20 mg and contact time of 55 min using response surface methodology central composite experimental design setup multistage functionalized mwcnt was developed by budimirovic et al with enhanced surface terminal amino groups followed by subsequent modification by iron oxy hydroxide for as v removal 87 this study reports 91 97 adsorption of as v on the developed mwcnt at ph value lower than 7 12 phpzc due to the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged adsorbent surface and negatively charged monovalent anion h2aso4 pka1 2 3 kausar et al fabricated polystyrene nanocomposite films with 4 aminophenyl methyl sulphone and cnt as nanofiller and studied their biodegradation behaviour and as v sorption capabilities sorption result indicates that cnt formed some network with polystyrene which can be used for the removal of as v upto 99 efficiency 88 aranda et al have developed a method for the determination of ultra trace amount of as v present in water sample adsorbed on mwcnt modified with tertiary amine aliquot using the xrf x ray fluorescence technique the author suggests the applicability of the method for better selectivity detection limit wide ph range reproducibility and exemption of organic solvents for estimation of trace amount of as in water sample 89 various modifications and functionalization of cnt s have been reported to overcome the aggregation problem and insolubility issue of cnt s in aqueous media especially incorporating the magnetic behaviour of iron oxide with adsorption properties of cnt is of great interest due to the fast and effective action in the removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater bo chen et al have synthesized magnetic iron oxide cnt through a solid phase method and subsequently functionalized it by glutathione through a facile chemical route for enhanced as iii adsorption capacity these magnetic heterogeneous cnt surfaces have shown a maximum adsorption capacity of 19 12 mg g 1 for as iii 90 to overcome the tedious uneconomical and environmentally unfriendly liquid phase synthesis procedure chen et al have developed a one pot solid phase synthetic methodology for the development of magnetic iron oxide cnt for as removal 91 the synthesized magnetic iron oxide cnts bear characteristics of an ideal adsorbent including high specific surface area high dispersibility and desirable magnetic properties with a high adsorption capacity of 47 41 mg g and 24 04 mg g for as iii and as v respectively vadahanambi et al developed graphene cnt iron oxide nanostructures by microwave route with amino functionalization which exhibited excellent as removal efficiency due to its porous structure and the high surface volume ratio 92 fig 5 nalini et al have reported the development of zero valent iron nanoparticles impregnated mwcnts multi walled carbon nanotubes for as removal from aqueous media 93 edta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid used as a chelating agent in the mwcnt was responsible for the preservation of the zerovalent state of iron the as adsorption data fitted to the langmuir model have shown maximum adsorption capacity of 111 mg g and 66 mg g for as iii and as v the presence of surface functional groups including hydroxyl amino and carboxyl groups played an essential role in the adsorption of as on the synthesized mwcnt recycling studies indicate the performance of this adsorbent up to 5 cycles without any considerable reduction in the adsorption capacity in a study tio2 coated cnt network filter was prepared by the filtration steam hydrolysis method and further evaluated for the as removal in aqueous media 94 a 5 5 nm thick tio2 coating has wholly covered the cnt surface and enhanced the surface area upto196 mg g almost two fold more significant than the pristine cnt electro assisted sorption capacity of these network filters was found to be about 1 8 and 1 3 mg g for as iii and as v respectively cnts can also be functionalized to increase removal efﬁciency for metal ions peg polyethylene glycol functionalized cnt has been studied by velickovic et al for the removal of as from waste water 95 it was reported that the maximum adsorption capacity of this adsorbent for as was 13 mg g using initial concentration as of 10 mg l at ph 4 the magnetron sputtering technique has reported the functionalization of cnt without chemical treatment by depositing copper on the cnt membrane cu cnt 96 the removal of as iii using cu cnt was compared with cu mce mce mixed cellulose ester which possesses similar permeability the as iii removal efficiency was more than 90 with cu cnt whereas only 75 removal efficiency was observed with cu mce the as ions removal took place in two steps firstly cu catalyzed oxidation of as iii to as v takes place and then there is efficient adsorption of as v on the membrane fig 6 2 2 2 removal of cr ions mohammadkhani et al have described the removal of cr iii using mwcnts modified with mno2 particles using batch equilibrium experiments the modified mwcnts showed enhanced adsorption capability in the removal of chromium ions from waste water 97 song and group have reported the synthesis of reticulated vitreous carbon cnt rvc cnt electrode as a more efficient biocathode in a microbial fuel cell mfc for improved removal of hexavalent chromium ions from wastewater along with the generation of electricity 98 the rvc cnt offered enhanced electron transfer rate and electrical conductivity which in turn facilitated enhanced cr vi reduction by providing more reaction sites tawabini and co workers have reported the efficient removal of cr iii from wastewater using modified multi walled carbon nanotubes with varying conditions of adsorbent dose ph agitation speed and contact time they demonstrated that the physical and chemical properties of modified cnts m cnts best suited the affinity of cr iii ions to get adsorbed onto m cnts and hence enhanced adsorption efficiency of cnts could be obtained for cr iii removal from wastewater 99 gupta and colleagues have also determined the role of swcnts single walled carbon nanotubes and mwcnts multi walled carbon nanotubes inefficient removal of cr vi ions from wastewater under different experimental conditions including ph contact time initial cr vi ions concentration and adsorption capacity of adsorbent materials in the presence of competing for anion such as sulfate ions 100 they demonstrated the vital role of competing anions and ph as fighting for sulfate anions hindered the adsorption of cr vi ions on the cnt s adsorption sites swcnts and mwcnts showed their maximum adsorption potential at an optimum ph of 2 5 tseng et al 101 have reported the enhanced adsorption efficiency of multi walled carbon nanotubes by functionalizing them with ionic liquids in contrast huang et al have introduced magnetic properties to mwcnts to improve their adsorption efficiency for the effective removal of cr ions 102 ionic liquids provided the interesting electrostatic interactions between quaternary ammonium cations and oxygen containing carboxyl and hydroxy groups present on the surface of mwcnts they hence acted as robust adsorption material to host the adsorption of cr ions and other polluting metal ions from wastewater the cation π anion π and other electrostatic interactions amongst the mwcnts il complex and chromium ions enhances the adsorption of chromium ions onto mwcnts il complex and hence justifies the improved potential of modified cnts in water remediation on the other hand magnetic cnts can be easily dispersed in water and separated from water as well due to the presence of a magnet and hence poses like a supermodel for effective removal of heavy metal ions with no post contamination which is an important criterion to be considered in water remediation techniques atieh has described the use of carbon nanotubes supported with activated carbon for efficient removal of chromium vi ions from wastewater 103 he demonstrated that the adsorption efficiency of carbon nanotubes for cr removal gets enhanced on the coating with activated carbon hence it can be concluded that cnts act as robust adsorbent material for the effective removal of heavy metal ions and find great potential in water remediation 2 3 activated carbon ac activated carbon ac is one of the forms of carbonaceous materials that possess a highly porous internal structure and can be derived from different sources including bamboo coal wood nutshells and other organic materials using chemical treatment or pyrolysis approach 104 activation treatment of carbon material results in the generation of high surface area with a large number of binding sites that facilitate adsorbent to interact with different species including metal ions activated carbon composition comprises 80 of carbon material with 20 of other oxygen or nitrogen containing species that get introduced to content while the activation process 105 ac usually binds to chemical moieties by π π interactions however various modifications including acidic primary and other treatment results in stronger binding capacity of its metal impregnated acs have shown improved efficiency towards the removal of heavy metal ions and other contaminants from wastewater by offering more adsorption sites to these species 106 the metal impregnation of acs can be easily achieved either by adsorption of pre prepared metal nanoparticles onto acs or by reduction of metal salt solution 106 2 3 1 removal of as ions although the adsorption by ac is the most current technology for pollutant removal it has a disadvantage of the high application cost this can be overcome by preparing activated carbon from natural biomass and modifying it for better removal efficiency 107 low cost plant prosopisspicigera l derived silver impregnated carbon sic and its precursor un impregnated was designed characterized and investigated for the as iii removal 108 an increase in ph shows no regular trend for as removal as two ph were obtained for maximum extraction of as at ph 4 and ph 10 for 98 2 mg g and 207 5 mg g respectively under the acidic condition oxidation of metallic ag to ag leads to the reaction between aso3 and the formation of ag3aso3 precipitate adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent however under the alkaline conditions h2aso3 and haso3 2 also get adsorbed on the sic surface and lead to an increase in adsorption capacity arsenic removal was found to increase with an increase in temperature and 59 19 mg g adsorption capacity was observed at 45 c the adsorption data were found to follow the langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics model in another work activated carbon prepared from shea cake was used for the removal of as from aqueous media 109 the batch adsorption method was found to follow first order kinetics and langmuir adsorption model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 7 87 μg g of as activated carbon was used with a maximum adsorption capacity of 2 18 mg g for as removal from aqueous media 110 fazeli et al have physio chemically modified activated charcoal obtained from the walnut shell using phosphoric acid 5 v v and investigated for as removal 111 this modification led to the improvement in the surface area of the adsorbent from 1067 to 1437 m2 g 1 and decreased the mean pore size from 3 28 to 2 08 nm equilibrium time was obtained within 3 min with 98 removal efficiency for as in aqueous media the adsorption isotherm was found to obey the langmuir adsorption isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 120 μg g of as it has been suggested that the introduction of high amounts of free carboxyl groups through acidification of adsorbents resulting in ample physical and chemical interactions to absorb as ions on the surface ceria coated powdered activated carbon was used for the removal of as from aqueous media with a maximum adsorption capacity of 10 3 and 12 2 mg g for as iii and as v respectively 112 an increase in ph has not shown any variation in the as iii removal percentage below ph 9 2 due to the lack of any electrostatic interaction between adsorbent and neutral h3aso3 species this strong interaction between as iii and adsorbent is supposed to be quite applicable over a wide range of ph for as v the highest removal was observed at ph 8 as it exists in the anionic form within the ph range of 4 10 113 the more negative nature of the arsenic species facilitates the higher adsorption on the positively charged adsorbent at ph 8 and hence the most top removal iron compounds have been widely explored for the removal of arsenic from the aqueous media 114 116 numerous studies are available for arsenic removal using iron impregnated activated charcoal carbon which considerably improves its as adsorption tendency recently mn impregnated iron modiﬁed ac was developed by a simple and efficient method characterized and investigated for the removal of arsenic v from aqueous solutions 117 the presence of iron in activated charcoal increased the adsorption capacity to 11 05 mg g from 4 mg g for raw carbon which was further found to enhance by 19 35 mg g after incorporating mn to the iron activated charcoal surface complex formation of as v at the specific aqueous arsenate fe mn oxide interface was suggested to be the responsible mechanism for as v adsorption on the synthesized novel adsorbents in a similar pattern of studies the adsorption of as iii on iron oxide coated granular activated charcoal has been studied 118 the ph range of 7 5 9 5 was found to be suitable for maximum adsorption of as iii as the initial concentration was found to decrease by 10 μg l within 90 min of contact time from an initial level of 100 μg l the ph of zero point charge phzpc for iron oxide coated granular activated charcoal was observed at ph 8 2 at ph above 8 2 the surface of adsorbent becomes positively charge that facilitates the adsorption of negatively charged as iii species due to electrostatic interaction and hence high adsorption was observed iron impregnated granular activated charcoal was used for the removal of as from water and to access the portioning behaviour of as under different conditions 119 a range of ferric concentrations was used for the synthesis of iron impregnated activated carbon which has shown 92 98 removal capacity for as v and 42 65 for as as iii langmuir adsorption isotherm has well fitted the adsorption data suggesting the adsorption capacity of 125 mg g and 98 4 mg g for as v and as iii respectively which was well explained based on ph dependent behaviour of arsenic and adsorbent similarly yao et al 120 have reported the as v removal studies using iron impregnated activated charcoal with 98 removal capacity within 60 min of contact time in the ph range of 3 5 8 2 3 2 removal of cr ions in case of activated carbon ac several investigations have shown that the maximum removal of cr vi from aqueous solutions take place in acidic conditions probably due to the neutralization of negative charges on the surface of the adsorbents by excess hydrogen ions thereby enabling the diffusion of hydrogen chromate ions hcro4 and then subsequent adsorption 121 in a recent study by su et al ac was modified with micro sized geothite mfeooh using a facile and cost effective impregnation method for enhanced cr vi removal from aqueous solutions via adsorption reduction and co precipitation mechanism with a maximum adsorption capacity of 28 1 mg g as represented in fig 7 122 huang et al 123 proposed three mechanisms physical electrostatic and chemical redox reaction for the removal of cr vi by the chitosan mwcnts cooh composite as shown in fig 8 the first physical adsorption was due to the electrostatic interaction between anionic cr vi and cationic amino and carboxylate groups at the surface of the composite simultaneously the chemical redox reaction occurred where cr vi reduced to cr iii which further desorbed and released into the solution due to electrostatic repulsion finally a second chemical redox reaction also occurred via the direct reduction of free cr vi anionic species to cr iii where the later was subsequently adsorbed by the chitosan mwcnts cooh composite the maximum adsorption efficiency of cr ion observed was 163 mg g within 30 min at ph 2 using these composite materials azari et al used the technique to modify acs with bimetallic nanoparticles comprising zero valent iron and silver for efficient removal of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solution this modified bimetallic activated carbon nanocomposite act as magnetic adsorbent as well and showed enhanced potential in the removal of cr vi 124 acs can also be functionalized with cnts to enhance the adsorption efficiency for efficient removal of heavy metal ions and other contaminants from wastewater pehlivan and group have synthesized the nanocomposite of activated carbon supported carbon nanotubes to accomplish the removal of cr vi ions from aqueous solution they compared the adsorption capacity of nanocomposites having different shapes such as tubular and spherical ac cnt complexes and determined that tubular composite exhibits better adsorption potential rather than its spherical counterpart and hence showed improved efficiency in removal of cr vi from aqueous solution 125 recently a new kind of adsorbent is synthesized using waste sludge for efficient removal of cr vi by adsorption on activated carbon 126 these studies show that carbonaceous materials offer remarkable adsorption capabilities for efficient removal of chromium and other heavy metal ions and contribute effectively towards water remediation the adsorption capacities of different carbon nanomaterials for the removal of as and cr ions from water samples have been tabulated in table 2 and table 3 the data reveals the impact of functionalization and modification on the adsorption tendency of nanocarbon materials to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions 2 4 miscellaneous nano carbon materials for removal of as and cr ions carbon nanospheres have been prepared by the spray pyrolysis method and used to remove as and se ions from various water samples deionized canal and well water through adsorption mechanism 133 the microporous nanospheres exhibited useful adsorption tendency due to primary functional groups present on the surface and high surface volume ratio venkateswarlu et al developed an economic graphene oxide like 2d carbon flake material 2d cf using waste onion sheathing and then modified it with magnetite nanoparticles for the removal of as iii from water 134 the adsorption capacity of bioinspired nanocomposite material was 57 47 mg g with pseudo second order kinetics the mechanism of as iii adsorption has been demonstrated in fig 9 ge et al have established the effective removal of arsenite adsorption capacity 103 4 mg g and arsenate adsorption capacity 172 9 mg g ions from the aqueous solution using β feooh nanorods modified 3d carbon foams 135 the abundant active sites presence of hydroxyl groups and hierarchical porous structure of nanostructure help in the effective binding of as ions fullerenes extracted soot modified with ethylenediamine has also been developed for adsorption of cr vi ions from aqueous solution 136 pathan et al reported the synthesis of nanoporous carbon structures by pyrolysis of grass and this acid functionalized porous nanocarbon was used for the removal of cr vi ions magnetic carbon particles mcps and magnetic carbon fibers mcfs were also prepared by different methods to study the effect of morphology on the adsorption process mcfs showed three times better adsorption capacity 43 17 mg g as compared to mcps 15 88 mg g for the removal of cr vi ions at ph 1 137 this is ascribed to more active sites in the fibrillar sample and their mechanism of removal has been given in fig 10 the nano hydrogels based on feedstock has also been developed as renewable bio based materials for as removal applications 138 calixarenes based nanomaterials have also been developed for effective removal of as and cr ions nanofibres of calixarene derivatives supported on polymeric polyacrylonitrile material were prepared by the electrospinning method 139 the nanofibre mats exhibited excellent adsorption capacity for chromate anion in aqueous solution magnetite modified calixarene nanomaterials have also been developed for the removal of arsenate and dichromate from the aqueous solution 140 the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding play an essential role in the adsorption process the development of newer carbon based nanomaterials provides a unique platform for the water remediation process by effectively removing as and cr ions from the aqueous solution rahman et al have developed new nanocomposites fabricated electrode with polyaniline graphene carbon nanotubes pani g cnts nanostructures for selective sensing of 4 aminophenol by the electrochemical method 141 the potential of immiscible polymer bends in membrane development for separation applications has also been analyzed and the role of surface modification and precise pore size distribution on separation techniques have also been studied 142 the significant challenge to develop carbon nanostructure is the use of costly and harmful chemicals gaddam et al addressed this issue by developing carbon nanomaterials derived from camphor for the separation of heavy metals 143 shivaprasad et al have studied the removal of fluorine from drinking water using nano alumia 144 satapathi et al developed an eco friendly multimodal nano based sensor which has magnetic and fluorescent components and exhibited excellent detection and removal efficiency for mercury ions from the water with significant low detection limits 145 ma et al developed magnesium oxide based different nanostructures such as nanoflowers and nano wires 146 the nanowires of magnesium oxide showed promising removal tendency for arsenate and phosphates from the water the electrostatic interaction was considered to be responsible for the adsorption process sharma et al reported the efficient removal of arsenic iii from water using nano tin ferrous oxide modified graphene oxide sheets with a sorption capacity of 105 mg g 147 the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics was followed and the new developed nanomaterial obeyed langmuir isotherm manish et al elaborated on the synthetic procedures for the development of carbon nanodots with tunable emission tendencies and high luminescence the applications of carbon nanodots in the detection of different metal ions have also been discussed 148 the carbonaceous material also acts as a stabilizing agent for nanostructures dutta et al reported the synthesis of silver bio nano composite using citric acid as a reducing agent and chitosan as a stabilizer 149 they examined the size dependent antibacterial activity of these nanosilver structures zhao et al reported the effective removal of chromium vi ions along with rhodamine b and methylene blue dyes using hydrothermally fabricated tio2 moo3 nanomaterials 150 because of the burning issue for the removal of two toxic metals cr and as from wastewater tremendous research data and reviews are available however limited patents are found recently in a patent the investigators claimed to modify a filter using gravity and dip coating method involving a polymer carbon based nanocomposite poly n vinyl carbazole graphene graphene oxide to significantly improve the efficiency of filtration separation and remediation of a broad range of pollutants 151 in another patent carbon magnetite nanocomposites have been developed using renewable resources for the removal of arsenic from water 152 2 5 separation reusability and toxicity of carbon nanomaterials due to the porosity high adsorption capacity chemical inertness and environment friendly nature various nanomaterials including carbon based materials activated carbon are most widely used as an adsorbent for the remediation of effluent water treatment however their high cost agglomeration tendency and restriction to recycle and reuse limit their use on a large scale 153 154 therefore to overcome these shortcomings efforts have been made to load carbon nanoparticles on the surface of natural minerals like attapulgite illite palygorskite montmorillonite etc to obtain carbon nanocomposites with enhanced surface activity than singel carbon nanomaterial 155 nanocomposite a multiphase solid material offers multifunctionality which is generally not found in conventional materials 156 the enhanced properties of polymer carbon nanocomposites as compared to traditional composite materials depends upon the quality of dispersion processing methods loading of the particles aspect ratio of the nanoparticles modification of the surfaces of nanoparticles compatibility of particle and host polymer size of particles etc nanocomposites as nano adsorbents offer high sorption efficiency and rapid process kinetics due to their large specific surface area pore size distribution and easily accessible sorption sites 157 158 the presence of non metallic minerals provides enhancement of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of carbon nanocomposites with improved capacity for adsorption separation of pollutants heavy metals from the wastewater with cost effectiveness recently sun et al have reported efficient removal of cr vi 142 8 mg g from wastewater using carboxyl rich carbon nanocomposite based on natural diatomite in this study diatomite has been selected for its high ion exchange capacity availability of abundant adsorption sites high porosity strong permeability and chemical inertness the synthesized carboxyl abundant carbon based nanocomposites were free from the agglomeration problem with improved adsorption capacity and reduced cost the material can be recycled and reused effectively up to four times after washing with alkali 155 it is reported that polypyrrole fe3o4 nanocomposite is an excellent adsorbent for the removal of cr vi from wastewater 155 salam et al prepared multi walled cnts chitosan nanocomposite by sonicating the chitosan and cnts suspension and then cross linking them with glutaraldehyde for efficient removal of metal ions 159 hayati et al 160 have synthesized cnt coated poly amidoamine dendrimer nanocomposite for adsorption of as iii in a fixed bed system with maximum uptake efficiency of 432 mg g gupta et al designed the swcnts polysulfone nanocomposite based membrane with reduced pore size smoother surface and higher rejection capacity for the removal of 96 8 cr vi and 87 6 as iii metal ions 161 in another study bankole et al used poly hydroxybutyrate functionalized carbon nanotubes phb cnts a composite of biodegradable and biocompatible polymer with carbon nanotubes with low toxicity ease of production and high availability the author has suggested that the metal adsorption phenomenon is not only influenced by the surface area but indirectly by composite s water holding capacity and attached functionality finally the metal treated phb cnts composite as adsorbate meets the water quality standard for re use either for industrial or agricultural irrigation activities 162 due to the complex nature of cr vi adsorbent interactions mentioned earlier researchers have found ways to capitalize on the different synergies by producing adsorbents that address two or more mechanisms 163 graphene and go rgo based materials have been extensively reported to remove heavy metals from wastewater 17 164 ali et al 46 published a detailed survey of go in its pristine and modified form for the removal of heavy metals and organic pollutants the synergism of cnt with go in the way of nanocomposites at a commercial level is limited because of the formation of stable and concentrated dispersion of cnts and go as starting material especially in the water system beyond 0 01 to 0 1 even in the presence of surfactants which is undesirable at times 165 efforts have been made to increase the water solubility of go and cnt by modification with resol type phenol formaldehyde resins in an alkaline medium with improved compatibility and distribution characteristics 166 an important property of the carbonaceous nanomaterials as adsorbent should be their ability to reuse after the regeneration process these nanomaterials should possess a high adsorption capacity with a good desorption property which considerably reduces the total cost of the adsorbent to reuse the metal adsorbed carbonaceous nanomaterials an efficient methodology is required for efficient extraction removal of the metals so that the desired material can be utilized for further metal adsorption cycles these carbon nanomaterials can be reused after washing with alkali solutions budimirovic et al have reported the removal of various metal ions using functionalized mwcnts and found ph dependent desorption of as v after adsorption about 30 of as v is desorbed at ph 6 5 the sudden desorption increase occurs at ph 6 5 and reaches a value of 78 at ph 10 167 the metal adsorbed carbon nanomaterials should meet the water quality standard for re use either for industrial or agricultural irrigation activities researchers have suggested that instead of chemically oxidized multiwalled cnts plasma oxidized multiwalled cnts may be used as sorbents for various metals compared with chemically oxidized cnts plasma oxidized tubes showed an increased sorption capacity mainly due to the addition of oxygen containing functional groups to the cnt surface the study of the regeneration process showed that the metal ions are easily desorbed from the plasma oxidized cnts 168 the toxicity of carbon nanotubes is a controversial topic nowadays even after various in vitro and in vivo studies the exact defined cause of cnt toxicity is not yet fully understood it has been reported that the accumulation of cnt and subsequently generated reactive oxygen species could be the most probable cause of cnt toxicity however to confirm the toxicity of cnt s a vast study is required taking into consideration the physio chemical parameters like cnts length diameters mass particle concentration defective reactive sites surface functionalization absorption aggregation agglomeration states metallic impurities etc 169 170 2 6 cost benefit analysis carbon based nanomaterials have been extensively explored for their enhanced removal efficiency of heavy metals in water due to their exceptional physiochemical properties despite various advantages offered by the carbon based nanomaterials cnts graphene go rgo for the removal of pollutants heavy metals from wastewater they are still associated with various drawbacks some certain issues and challenges need to be addressed for the successful employment of these carbon based nanomaterials at a large scale for the removal of heavy metals most of the research using these nanomaterials or heavy metal removal is at their preliminary stage and required extensive research for practical application high manufacture and modification cost difficulty in separation after adsorption of pollutants high treatment cost of pollutant heavy metal adsorbed nanomaterials regeneration recycling and toxicity of these nanomaterials are the crucial matters of top consideration 171 primarily the synthesis and operational cost of the nanomaterials need to be minimized and optimized from the economic point of view tremendous efforts for the large scale production of these nanomaterials using green research methodology are required for their application in the treatment of actual industrial wastewater irrespective of the available laboratory level research data the toxicity and biocompatibility of these carbonaceous nanomaterials for the environment and human beings should be abundantly explored from the economic point of view methods to improve metal removal efficiency by overcoming their agglomeration tendency regeneration reuse and recycling of the heavy metal adsorbed carbon nanomaterials is highly mandatory and required extensive research for the development 171 2 7 challenges and prospects the high concentration of heavy metals in particular arsenic and chromium in water bodies due to natural and anthropogenic routes has aroused a great concern worldwide their presence in the environment in more than the recommended values of the world health organization in most of the parts of the world necessitates the need for a very selective economical and efficient system to remove them from water the toxicity of arsenic includes abdominal pain watery diarrhea with blood encephalopathy skin thickening and darkening heart disease and numbness its high concentration in the body is also linked to affect the gut microflora and thereby could lead to metabolism and digestion alarms accompanied with several kinds of cancer and other diseases 172 the intake of a high percentage of chromium ions is also known to cause bronchial carcinomas 173 the poisoning of chromium ions causes dermatitis eczematous skin effects hepatocellular deficiency mucous membrane ulceration nasal septum perforation allergic asthmatic problems gastro enteritis and renal oligo anuric deficiency problem 173 therefore there is a social urge to remove and arsenic and chromium ions from water through adsorption and thereby prevent the main entry route of heavy metals into the physiological system the carbonaceous nanomaterials have been reported with remarkable adsorption capabilities at the laboratory scale however for the actual treatment of wastewater these nanomaterials are still facing many challenges that need to be resolved for practical application to remove pollutants mainly as and cr like heavy metals simple cost effective and extensive scale fabrication methods are required for the development of carbonaceous nanomaterials for a variety of applications the natural recovery and reusability of these materials could make the process cost effective and sustainable however their modifications with magnetic nanoparticles have been performed for their magnetic separation the processing at the industrial level need to be analyzed for commercialization agglomeration of carbonaceous nanomaterials like cnt and go in aqueous media is one of the major hindrances in pollutant removal from wastewater which results in a lack of surface area and reduction in the number of active sites therefore there is an urgent need for the surface modification of these nanomaterials for efficient adsorption selection and affinity for as and cr ions despite the exceptional properties of cnts and other carbon nanostructures the development and applications of carbon materials are mainly limited by their low volume of production low removal efficiency limited selectivity and high cost 174 also carbon nanomaterials cannot be used alone without any supporting medium 175 the toxicity of various carbonaceous nanomaterials needs to be investigated on an urgent basis for human beings living things and the environment cnts have been a growing concern since their discovery in the early 90 s recently many reports have come up regarding health concerns 176 177 besides this the ph of the water sample is an essential parameter for the effective removal of as and cr by functionalized carbon nanostructures for actual wastewater treatment synthesis and surface modification of the carbonaceous materials are required to be scaled up which could be costly in some cases disposal of pollutant adsorbed carbonaceous nanomaterials need attention so that the accumulation of second generation waste materials can be avoided however these limitations can be addressed methodically and the usefulness of carbonaceous nanomaterials can be improved for real life applications the modification of nano carbons with biomaterials and their bio inspired synthesis opens a new avenue in the development of green and economical materials where large scale production can effectively be carried out for the removal of toxic as and cr ions from real industrial waste the combined remediation approach involving redox and adsorption mechanism by carbon nanomaterials modified by redox active metals or organic moieties is the future of new generation materials for converting more toxic metal ions into its less deadly form such as as v turns to as iii and cr vi changes to cr iii followed by adsorption on the porous carbon nanomaterials the functionalization to introduce selectivity in hybrid carbon nanostructures progresses their structural and chemical aspects developing the promising potential for the pollutants and heavy metal removal from the wastewater system 2 8 conclusion the water pollution by heavy metals like as and cr is getting increased day by day and causing grave concern to aquatic and human life due to their inability to self purification bio accumulative effect chemical toxicity and smooth migration and transformation carbonaceous materials show promising potential to remove as and cr ions from wastewater due to their unique structural and chemical properties the nano carbon materials such as cnts swcnts and mwcnts graphene oxide and activated carbon possess incredibly high surface area and porosity which is responsible for faster adsorption rate of as and cr ions from aqueous solution carbon nanomaterials can be synthesized and modified by simple processes to introduce endowed selectivity tunability and performances these materials can penetrate deeper and thus can treat water wastewater which is generally not possible by conventional technologies graphene carbon nanotubes and activated carbon based materials are the most widely developed carbon nanostructures for their application in heavy metals as and cr removal from water bodies nowadays their bio based modifications and chemical free modification techniques are growing to provide a green solution to the water pollution problem the hybrid materials with a coupled mechanistic approach involving redox and adsorption techniques are producing astonishing results they have the potential to take this nanotechnological approach to the next level of commercial growth the ph and nature of functional groups present on carbon nanomaterials are essential parameters for the success of designed functional nanomaterials as a promising candidate for the potential removal of as and cr ions via adsorption mechanism there is an urgent need to address all the challenges for the revolution of carbon nanomaterials from laboratory scale research to the commercial level platform the promising future of carbon nanostructures may provide an ultimate solution to the water pollution problem by effectively removing toxic heavy metals

microplasma diazinone degradation oxides of nitrogen dissolved ozone hplc 1 introduction recently organophosphorus pesticides opps have been widely used to replace more persistent organochlorine pesticides because opps are more soluble in water and decompose rapidly in aquatic systems the use of opp accounts for one third of the total pesticide consumption around the globe several reports have demonstrated that various agricultural products and surface water a major source of drinking water are contaminated with opp due to their extensive use and moderate persistence creating an alarming issue for human health and natural ecosystems 1 3 regardless of the advantages gained by the application of pesticides in modern agriculture they are a threat to the public health environment 4 more specifically diazinone o o diethyl o 6 methyl 2 1 methylethyl 4 pyrimidinyl phosphorothioate is an organophosphorus insecticide it is categorized as moderately harmful class ii by the who over 6 million kilograms of diazinone are used annually in the usa 5 diazinone is a nonvolatile compound in nature hence it remains in soil and water for a long period of time due to its inhibition of acetylcholinesterase it shows toxicity to aquatic organisms acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition destroys the nervous system of simpler organisms and is also toxic in humans to have both fresh and fresh cut foodstuffs free from microbial and chemical contamination implementation of prevention and regulation practices should be maintained properly along with supply chain management outlines 6

disturbing the physiochemical properties of the treated food commodities 17 nonthermal plasma a physical processing method is becoming famous among all nonthermal food processing techniques application of thermal plasma processing techniques has various limitations in the food processing industry due to its higher temperature working range 2000 10 000 k 18 on the other hand the nonthermal plasma procedure has a widespread working choice because of its capability to operate at ambient temperature the applicability of nonthermal plasma techniques included modification of the polymer surface 19 purification of air 20 and decontamination in therapeutic and medicinal areas 21 recently the applicability of this environmentally friendly plasma processing has been widely studied for wastewater treatment 22 23 furthermore it has been implemented for chemical and microbial threat eradication research in the fields of food safety and hygiene 24 various plasma producing

constant 2 3 hplc analysis of diazinone an hplc investigation of treated and nontreated diazinone solution for different concentrations was analyzed with a luna 5u c18 2 100a column 250 mm 4 5 mm 5 μm fitted with a jasco quaternary gradient pump pu 2089 and a jasco uv 2077 4λ intelligent uv vis detector an isocratic method was followed to elute diazinone with a mobile phase containing of can h2o 75 25 fifty microliters of plasma treated and non treated samples were injected for all analysis diazinone was observed at 245 nm a fixed 1 ml min flow rate was retained through the entire separation

model for the degradation of diazinone the degradation potential η of diazinone can be measured by the equation given as follows 1 η x0 x x0 100 where η is the reduction potential of diazinone x is the concentration of diazinone at time t and x 0 is the preliminary concentration of diazinone a pseudo first order kinetics model was found for the reduction of diazinone throughout the microplasma operation the values obtained during plasma degradation were best fitted with the levenberg marquardt algorithm available in matlab 7 5 the math works ma usa a nonlinear least squares regression the mathematical equation for first order reaction kinetics is written below 2 ln x x0 kt where k represents the first order rate constant s 1 and t is the microplasma operation time s the kinetic model fitting was assessed via a regression coefficient r2 the first order rate constant k value was calculated using the equation mentioned above with the diazinone degradation data at various microplasma treatment times 2 8 statistical analysis to analyze the data measured in this study a statistical program named spss ibm spss 22 0 0 0 was used variances were tested with a control measurement the mann whitney u p 0 05 which is a nonparametric test every single analysis was conducted at least of three times unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 current voltage features of the microplasma source part 5 in fig 1a shows the picture of microplasma generator and the schematic diagram of the microplasma electrode is given in our previously published article 27 the applied current is set as a square waveform fig 1b and the amplified voltage waveform from the amplifier is given in fig 1c all inclusive current is a combination of the dislocation current and many current pulses photoionization increment relies on filamentary microdischarges an ionization phenomenon of a plasma jet is influenced by operational settings such as the discharge cavity voltage rate and breadth of the electrode to achieve a stable discharge an optimum level of all the working parameters was set as described in the materials and methods section above 3 2 oes features of the microplasma source the optical emission spectra oes of the microplasma discharge generated in this study are revealed in our previous publication 28 oh radicals and a 2nd positive system of n2 c b appear as main peaks in the near uv area 300 400 nm of the oes spectrum the produced peaks suggest the formation of oh radicals and rns during microplasma discharge produced other two reactive substances hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ozone o3 were also generated underwater in a conical tube by microplasma discharge 26 31 the measured concentration of the oh radical was 1 81 10 5 m dissolved o3 was 0 6 ppm nitrogen oxides were 500 10 6 m and h2o2 was 2 5 10 6 m after 6 4 3 and 8 min of plasma operation respectively the concentrations of dissolved o3 and h2o2 were measured to remain constant during the plasma operation for oh radicals an increasing and decreasing trend was observed throughout the plasma treatment whereas it should remain constant after 6 8 min of microplasma treatment a comprehensive description with experimental values are described in some of our formerly published articles 26 31 it was observed that the dissolved ozone was removed from the treated water within 2 h whereas oxides of nitrogen remained unchanged for 7 days under ambient conditions fig 2 these measurements helped to create an ozone and oxides of a nitrogen free environment to individually elucidate the effect of ozone and the effect of oxide of nitrogen on diazinone degradation in a passive way 3 3 diazinone degradation efficiency and kinetics the diazinone degradation ability of microplasma was studied in the current work samples obtained before starting the microplasma device were considered as 0 s measurements and the rest of the samples were obtained at various time interims after starting the device namely 10 30 60 120 and 300 s almost 99 5 table 1 of diazinone was degraded within 5 min of plasma treatment hence our operation time was restricted to 5 min the removal during plasma operation and the model parameters for diazinone reduction based on first order kinetics are displayed in table 1 fig 3 displays that the reduction kinetics of diazinone follow first order kinetics diazinone reduction may occur by an interaction or reaction between diazinone and the species generated by the microplasma to elucidate the degradation pathways it is important to elucidate the effect of each distinct radicals on diazinone degradation to find the effects of individual radicals or species produced by microplasma on diazinone degradation the treatments were carried out in three different modes namely 1 in the presence of all the species mode 1 2 in the absence of ozone mode 2 and 3 in the absence of ozone and oxides of nitrogen mode 3 the direct microplasma treatment of diazinone under water represents mode 1 to achieve mode 2 and mode 3 environments in plasma discharged water a background study was performed after approximately 2 h of plasma treatment the amount of dissolved ozone in plasma treated water became almost zero fig 2a and the concentration of oxides of nitrogen remained unchanged even after 7 days fig 2b thus mode 2 ozone free environment was achieved by taking the water 9 ml treated for 2 h in ambient conditions and then adding 1 ml diazinone solution 100 ppm mode 3 was achieved by taking the water 9 ml treated for two hours and then adding stoichiometric amounts of no scavenger and 1 ml of diazinone solution the observed degradation was almost similar between mode 1 and mode 2 whereas mode 3 shows very slow degradation table 1 fig 3 indicating that a major degradation occurs due to the presence of oxides of nitrogen the effects of dissolved ozone may place next in the ranking in the absence of both dissolved ozone and oxides of nitrogen 24 diazinone degraded which may occur due to a combined effect of undetermined species and or a lower concentration of produced hydrogen peroxide in the plasma treated water however to ensure any effect of oh radical on diazinone degradation the plasma treatment was carried out in presence and in absence of ethanol and there was no significant difference observed on diazinone removal efficiency hence it can be concluded that oh radical may not play any significant role on diazinone degradation in the present study diazinone is degraded to several compounds with lower molecular weights at different retention times for mode 1 two different fragments are obtained at 2 6 and 4 3 min fig 4 a in the case of mode 2 three different fragments are observed at retention times of 2 6 3 1 and 4 8 min fig 4b as mode 3 does not show significant degradation of diazinone the effect of any particular species is undetermined hence further experiments are avoided with this mode the formation of lower molecular weight fragments generation and existence through the operational period of 5 min are shown in fig 5 a and b most of the fragmented compounds are generated near the beginning of plasma treatment and formation continued until the diazinone degrades completely the only exception is observed for the fragmented compound obtained at 4 8 min which increases for 30 s of plasma operation and then shows a decreasing trend fig 5b 3 4 elucidating the diazinone degradation mechanism an lc ms analysis was done for the fragmented compounds observed in both mode 1 and mode 2 at retention times of 2 6 4 3 and 2 6 3 1 and 4 8 min respectively several molecular fragments are obtained for the two different models of plasma experiments as major and minor components and their fragmented ions along with the corresponding retention times are given in table 2 after analyzing the spectral features and fragmentation patterns the projected configurations and the reaction mechanism for diazinone degradation are displayed in fig 6 additionally some molecular fragments are observed in the ms spectra that shown in table 2 with asterisk mark do not seem they are from the diazinone those fragments may be from the teflon tube or compounds from the environment as the feed gas source used in this study is ambient air further investigation of these fragments was not performed 3 5 discussion microplasma discharged water showed high potential for the degradation of diazinone the diazinone degradation kinetics and mechanism under microplasma discharged water showed a dependence on different radicals for different levels and pathways a microplasma jet was uniformly dispersed underwater through a diffuser the generated hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentrations were very low 4 3 μm causing hardly any chemical reaction with diazinone during the microplasma operation this was confirmed by a separate experiment in which a 4 3 μm hydrogen peroxide standard solution and the same concentration of standard diazinone solution used in the microplasma operation were mixed and allowed to react with each other an hplc analysis showed that diazinone was not degraded with 4 3 μm h2o2 solution plasma treatment in presence and in absence of oh radicle scavenger ethanol does not show any significant changes on diazinone degradation this observation proves that oh radical does not play any role on diazinone degradation therefore in this article we only focus on the roles of dissolved o3 and oxides of nitrogen on diazinone degradation in plasma discharged water the results obtained from mode 1 and mode 2 suggested that among all the produced reactive substances from the plasma the dissolved o3 and oxides of nitrogen were the two major types of active substances that caused the maximum diazinone reduction the reduction mechanism of diazinone by o3 could be projected as either a traditional oxidation or as numerous different chain reactions to generate peroxide and oh radicals that then continually oxidize diazinone a secondary reaction via o3 occurs at high ph values however at a low ph the first reaction that occurs is oxidation at a low ph the dissolved o3 and h2o2 experience a slow reaction rate to generate hydroxyl radicals whereas at a high ph the reaction rates are very fast in this study the reaction occurred in a similar manner as a low ph medium the ph observed for plasma treated water was reduced significantly after 30 s of plasma treatment fig 2 hence the dissolved ozone had a lower contribution to diazinone degradation compared with that of the oxides of nitrogen as shown in fig 3 the oxidation reaction of ozone occurred through a breakdown of double bonds to generate an additional product named ozonide which experienced additional oxidation to form carboxylic acids 32 35 some examples of the post plasma operation reactions by which reactive species can be generated are shown below 1 h2o e oh h e 2 o o2 o3

diazinone cleavage might follow a similar route of oxidative degradation as those through the o3 mechanism o3 h2o2 system fenton s reagent system oxidation with oh radical mechanism reaction mechanism

no2 n2o3 and n2o5 through several reaction pathways that remain present in the plasma state 38 due to a shorter lifetime under 10 6 s free radicles including no2 no and no are unable to travel a significant distance in aqueous solution 39 hence charged or neutral substances such as ozone and oxides of nitrogen with greater lifetimes are capable of contributing to chemical reactions at the gas liquid boundary dissolved no2 no3 n2o4 n2o5 and n2o3 react permanently with h2o to form hno2 and hno3 through the reactions shown below notably nitric oxide no is slightly soluble in water 40 41 i

off the plasma discharge were believed to continue to preserve the concentration of significant chemical substances i e nitrite in plasma discharged water in acidic plasma discharged water nitrous acid and nitrate exist and nitrous acid always converted into nitrate and nitric oxide reaction vi 42 the observed oxides of nitrogen remained constant over several days as nitrous acid was converted into nitric acid hence no decrease of oxides of nitrogen occurred rather they were converted from one form to another form some researchers reported that in an alkaline environment nitrous acid might lose protons through reaction iv thus the breakdown of nitrous acid would be prevented however in our system we found that the amount of oxides of nitrogen remained unchanged for several days fig 2b the amount of nitrate and nitrite in microplasma treated water might vary due to the existence of h2o2 via the reaction route of vii and viii 41 vi 3hno2 h no 3 2no h2o vii 2no 3h2o2 2hno3 2h2o viii hno2 h2o2 onooh h2o therefore it could be stated that in mode 2 degradation might occur due to the presence of charged species instead of that of short lived radicals hence hydrolyzed products predominate in mode 2 compared to the oxidized products obtained in mode 1 43 however to elucidate the mechanism and kinetics of diazinone degradation by microplasma it is imperative to understand the interactions that cause diazinone to degrade and produce lower molecular fragments diazinone has different functional groups in its structure such as pyranium thiophosphate and alkyl ether which offer several sites for chemical reactions and or changes to occur by microplasma generated species on the basis of identified and degraded products obtained from ms as summarized in table 2 the degradation pathways of diazinone under plasma treatment are proposed in fig 6 the oxidation of the p s link to the p s s link to the po link via a free radical mechanism can be explained simply and promotes the generation of diazoxone based on the result obtained by hua et al 1995 hydrolysis product might be boosted too mainly for the reactants that interact to the fizz boundary 44 consequently imp 2 isopropyl 6 methyl pyridine 4 ol and diethyl phosphate were formed through the hydrolysis of diazinone or diazoxone by the cleavage of either a po bond pyrimidine group or an op bond in several works it has been reported that the hydroxylation reaction occurs for diazinone to produce hydroxydiazinone 45 46 hydroxylation occurs at the tertiary 3 and primary 1 carbon atoms of the isopropyl group and results in the production of hydroxydiazinone and 2 hydroxydiazinon respectively the hydroxylation products more likely can undergo a dehydration reaction and convert into an isopropenyl derivative of diazinone 47 48 although this fragmented products were not obtained by lcms spectra in our analysis that represents by in the fig 6 due to some unknown reasons the ms spectra for 302 and or 286 were missed in our study however based on the other reports the dehydration reaction is more likely to occur in our study which shown in the fig 6 afterwards an oxidation and decarboxylation reaction on the isopropenyl derivative of diazinone occurs resulting in the creation of a hydroxyethyl derivative of diazinone that has been observed in the digestion of diazinone in wildlife and plant life 47 last the hydroxyethyl derivative of diazinone is oxidized to diazinone methyl ketone fig 6 from the above discussions based on the data obtained in this study it can be stated that the diazinone degradation mechanism varies due to the variation of the plasma generated radical on the one hand the mode 1 reaction shows two degradation products where the oxidation reaction predominates on the other hand oxides of nitrogen show three degradation products where the hydrolysis product predominates differences in the degradation rate and the contribution on diazinone degradation by two different types of species dissolved ozone and oxides of nitrogen also indicate different routes of degradation the ms spectrum confirms the further degradation of imp into several different fragments among the several fragments the structures of viii different fragments are proposed and shown in fig 6 the fragments are predicted based on their molecular weights and further analyses such as ir and nmr are required to confirm the structures of the fragments proposed here additional fragments shown in the table 2 with asterisk mark represents that the sources of the compounds are not diazinone in this study we performed a qualitative identification of diazinone metabolites with respect to the molecular weight of diazinone fragments by using lc ms the identified metabolites of diazinone are listed in the fig 6 the reactive particles produced during micro plasma could be reacted not only in reactions with the target pesticide but also in reactions with the degradation products and hence further degradation occurs to produce several smaller fragments it may be illustrated that the end points of pesticide reductions are categorized by simpler chemical groups 49 50 as micro plasma offers a number of advanced oxidation process aop for water treatment with a one pot formation of short lived oxidants mineralization of pesticides without any reversible reactions and usage of echo friendly feed gases such as atmospheric air hence post plasma treated molecules were observed to have a series of less toxic fragments than the parent pesticide molecules number of research reports were published on detoxification of pesticides with number of different types of pesticides such as chaitannaya s et al 2016 51 showed the detoxification of dichlorvos malathion and endosulfan using cold plasma zhu et al 52 who used an atmospheric pressure plasma jet using a helium oxygen feed gas also founded comparable result with chaitannaya s et al 2016 several researcher showed that nitenpyram ntp pesticide could effectively be removed from aqueous solutions by low temperature plasma even they were successful to degrade pesticides residues from different surfaces using different types of plasma sources 53 55 variations in plasma operating settings such as frequency duty cycle sample volume chemical nature of the sample viscosity and the electrode gap may play an important part in the degradation kinetics and or mechanisms 56 intense electric fields may offer faster rates of degradation and the diffuser features can vary the reaction rate into the aqueous medium diffuser features such as aperture dimension and shape may differ the mixing ability of the plasma radicals with water a large discharge gap may necessitate a high voltage for the degradation of a standard solution of diazinone the size of the electrode gap regulates the capacity of the inducer gas and affects the electron fall ionization and radical formation nevertheless to achieve optimum settings for quick and effective degradation using this research in a broad way is imperative further research may assist the implementation of microplasma discharge water treatment technology to degrade toxic chemicals from contaminated food surfaces in the food processing industry and or effluent treatment technology 4 conclusions the present study showed the high potential of microplasma discharged water for the degradation of diazinone the reaction kinetics and mechanism of diazinone standard solution by microplasma discharge were also evaluated diazinone degradation showed first order reaction kinetics diazinone underwent oxidation reactions upon interaction with key plasma generated substances to breakdown into lower molecular fragments furthermore successive degradation occurred different radicals present in the plasma discharge water played different roles in degradation among all the radicals generated by the microplasma oxides of nitrogen played a major role in degradation and dissolved ozone placed next in the ranking finding the roles of short lived oh radicals was beyond the scope of this work h2o2 played a minimal role or almost no role in diazinone

13968,in this study we assessed the reduction efficiency kinetics and mechanism of a standard organophosphorus pesticide solution known as diazinone using microplasma atmospheric air was supplied as a carrier gas for the degradation of diazinone the degradation kinetics of diazinone were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc as a function of plasma generated species that participated in the major degradation process a freshly prepared 100 ppm solution of diazinone was treated for 300 s and the treated samples were obtained at various time intervals such as 10 s 30 s 60 s 120 s and 300 s degradation efficiency of the treated diazinone was measured using hplc microplasma generated various species or radicals such as dissolved ozone oxides of nitrogen oh radicals

followed first order reaction kinetics the diazinone degradation mechanism by microplasma was suggested by analyzing the obtained data from liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms keywords microplasma diazinone degradation oxides of nitrogen dissolved ozone hplc 1 introduction recently organophosphorus pesticides opps have been widely used to replace more persistent organochlorine pesticides because opps are more soluble in water and decompose rapidly in aquatic systems the use of opp accounts for one third of the total pesticide consumption around the globe several reports have demonstrated that various agricultural products and surface water a major source of drinking water are contaminated with opp due to their extensive use and moderate persistence creating an alarming issue for human health and natural ecosystems 1 3 regardless of the advantages gained by the application of pesticides in modern agriculture they are a threat to the public health environment 4 more specifically diazinone o o diethyl o 6 methyl 2 1 methylethyl 4 pyrimidinyl phosphorothioate is an organophosphorus insecticide it is categorized as moderately harmful class ii by the who over 6 million kilograms of diazinone are used annually in the usa 5 diazinone is a nonvolatile compound in nature hence it remains in soil and water for a long period of time due to its inhibition of acetylcholinesterase it shows toxicity to aquatic organisms acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition destroys the nervous system of simpler organisms and is also toxic in humans to have both fresh and fresh cut foodstuffs free from microbial and chemical contamination implementation of prevention and regulation practices should be maintained properly along with supply chain management outlines 6

procedures photocatalysis 7 9 electrochemical reduction 10 11 peroxide oxidation 12 ultrasound mechanism 13 ozone mechanism uv photolysis mechanism ozone ultraviolet uv photolysis 14 15 and ultrasonication 16 are widely used a significant number of researchers around the globe are trying to find new methodologies that may effectively eliminate biological and chemical toxins without disturbing the physiochemical properties of the treated food commodities 17 nonthermal plasma a physical processing method is becoming famous among all nonthermal food processing techniques application of thermal plasma processing techniques has various limitations in the food processing industry due to its higher temperature working range 2000 10 000 k 18 on the other hand the nonthermal plasma procedure has a widespread working choice because of its capability to operate at ambient temperature the applicability of nonthermal plasma techniques included modification of the polymer surface 19 purification of air 20 and decontamination in therapeutic and medicinal areas 21 recently the applicability of this environmentally friendly plasma processing has been widely studied for wastewater treatment 22 23 furthermore it has been implemented for chemical and microbial threat eradication research in the fields of food safety and hygiene 24 various plasma producing techniques have been studied to reduce several kinds of chemical and microbial threats 24 abundant active substances were detected that display different stages of reduction for microbial and chemical toxins the formation of reactive substances varies with the use of different types of electrical discharge pulsed high current discharge produces pressure waves and uv light gliding arc discharge

uv light are created from dbd plasma 25 some researcher shows hybrid electric discharge plasma plasma discharged with adsorbent catalyst and or oxidants shows improved water treatment performance compared to plasma discharged alone 23 in the present work we employ the discharge of microplasma under water with some modified features of microplasma system to find its effectiveness on diazinone degradation from the best of author s knowledge application of microplasma on diazinone degradation is the first approach the reaction kinetics and the mechanism of degradation are also evaluated 2 methods and materials 2 1 sample preparation diazinone was purchased from sigma aldrich republic of korea a standard 1000 ppm diazinone solution was prepared by dissolving diazinone in methanol for use in the treatment for every treatment diazinone solution was diluted to 100 ppm using distilled water in all our treatments and analyses 20 ml of 100 ppm diazinone solution was used unless mentioned otherwise for every single treatment 20 ml of new diazinone solution was used after microplasma treatment diazinone solution was injected into an hplc a minimum of three individual treatments by microplasma were performed before the hplc analysis 2 2 description of the microplasma discharged water system the plasma device and the working parameters set for this work were

through a 2 m long silicone pipe into a conical tube containing target component to obtain homogeneous distribution of plasma jet into the water a rod shape diameter 1 mm diffuser was used a cooling system is available adjacent to the electrode inside the part 5 in fig 1a the temperature of the solution was monitored throughout the plasma operation the measured temperature was 22 c that remains constant 2 3 hplc analysis of diazinone an hplc investigation of treated and nontreated diazinone solution for different concentrations was analyzed with a luna 5u c18 2 100a column 250 mm 4 5 mm 5 μm fitted with a jasco quaternary gradient pump pu 2089 and a jasco uv 2077 4λ intelligent uv vis detector an isocratic method was followed to elute diazinone with a mobile phase containing of can h2o 75 25 fifty microliters of plasma treated and non treated samples were injected for all analysis diazinone was observed at 245 nm a fixed 1 ml min flow rate was retained through the entire separation

this study 32 the concentration of cptio used in this study was 550 μm to obtain a nox free environment to scavenge oh radicle hplc grade ethanol 99 5 sigma aldrich was used 2 7 study of the kinetic model for the degradation of diazinone the degradation potential η of diazinone can be measured by the equation given as follows 1 η x0 x x0 100 where η is the reduction potential of diazinone x is the concentration of diazinone at time t and x 0 is the preliminary concentration of diazinone a pseudo first order kinetics model was found for the reduction of diazinone throughout the microplasma operation the values obtained during plasma degradation were best fitted with the levenberg marquardt algorithm available in matlab 7 5 the math works ma usa a nonlinear least squares regression the mathematical equation for first order reaction kinetics is written below 2 ln x x0 kt where k represents the first order rate constant s 1 and t is the microplasma operation time s the kinetic model fitting was assessed via a regression coefficient r2 the first order rate constant k value was calculated using the equation mentioned above with the diazinone degradation data at various microplasma treatment times 2 8 statistical analysis to analyze the data measured in this study a statistical program named spss ibm spss 22 0 0 0 was used variances were tested with a control measurement the mann whitney u p 0 05 which is a nonparametric test every single analysis was conducted at least of three times unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 current voltage features of the microplasma source part 5 in fig 1a shows the picture of microplasma generator and the schematic diagram of the microplasma electrode is given in our previously published article 27 the applied current is set as a square waveform fig 1b and the amplified voltage waveform from the amplifier is given in fig 1c all inclusive current is a combination of the dislocation current and many current pulses photoionization increment relies on filamentary microdischarges an ionization phenomenon of a plasma jet is influenced by operational settings such as the discharge cavity voltage rate and breadth of the electrode to achieve a stable discharge an optimum level of all the working parameters was set as described in the materials and methods section above 3 2 oes features of the microplasma source the optical emission spectra oes of the microplasma discharge generated in this study are revealed in our previous publication 28 oh radicals and a 2nd positive system of n2 c b appear as main peaks in the near uv area 300 400 nm of the oes spectrum the produced peaks suggest the formation of oh radicals and rns during microplasma discharge produced other two reactive substances hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ozone o3 were also generated underwater in a conical tube by microplasma discharge 26 31 the measured concentration of the oh radical was 1 81 10 5 m dissolved o3 was 0 6 ppm nitrogen oxides were 500 10 6 m and h2o2 was 2 5 10 6 m after 6 4 3 and 8 min of plasma operation respectively the concentrations of dissolved o3 and h2o2 were measured to remain constant during the plasma operation for oh radicals an increasing and decreasing trend was observed throughout the plasma treatment whereas it should remain constant after 6 8 min of microplasma treatment a comprehensive description with experimental values are described in some of our formerly published articles 26 31 it was observed that the dissolved ozone was removed from the treated water within 2 h whereas oxides of nitrogen remained unchanged for 7 days under ambient conditions fig 2 these measurements helped to create an ozone and oxides of a nitrogen free environment to individually elucidate the effect of ozone and the effect of oxide of nitrogen on diazinone degradation in a passive way 3 3 diazinone degradation efficiency and kinetics the diazinone degradation ability of microplasma was studied in the current work samples obtained before starting the microplasma device were considered as 0 s measurements and the rest of the samples were obtained at various time interims after starting the device namely 10 30 60 120 and 300 s almost 99 5 table 1 of diazinone was degraded within 5 min of plasma treatment hence our operation time was restricted to 5 min the removal during plasma operation and the model parameters for diazinone reduction based on first order kinetics are displayed in table 1 fig 3 displays that the reduction kinetics of diazinone follow first order kinetics diazinone reduction may occur by an interaction or reaction between diazinone and the species generated by the microplasma to elucidate the degradation pathways it is important to elucidate the effect of each distinct radicals on diazinone degradation to find the effects of individual radicals or species produced by microplasma on diazinone degradation the treatments were carried out in three different modes namely 1 in the presence of all the species mode 1 2 in the absence of ozone mode 2 and 3 in the absence of ozone and oxides of nitrogen mode 3 the direct microplasma treatment of diazinone under water represents mode 1 to achieve mode 2 and mode 3 environments in plasma discharged water a background study was performed after approximately 2 h of plasma treatment the amount of dissolved ozone in plasma treated water became almost zero fig 2a and the concentration of oxides of nitrogen remained unchanged even after 7 days fig 2b thus mode 2 ozone free environment was achieved by taking the water 9 ml treated for 2 h in ambient conditions and then adding 1 ml diazinone solution 100 ppm mode 3 was achieved by taking the water 9 ml treated for two hours and then adding stoichiometric amounts of no scavenger and 1 ml of diazinone solution the observed degradation was almost similar between mode 1 and mode 2 whereas mode 3 shows very slow degradation table 1 fig 3 indicating that a major degradation occurs due to the presence of oxides of nitrogen the effects of dissolved ozone may place next in the ranking in the absence of both dissolved ozone and oxides of nitrogen 24 diazinone degraded which may occur due to a combined effect of undetermined species and or a lower concentration of produced hydrogen peroxide in the plasma treated water however to ensure any effect of oh radical on diazinone degradation the plasma treatment was carried out in presence and in absence of ethanol and there was no significant difference observed on diazinone removal efficiency hence it can be concluded that oh radical may not play any significant role on diazinone degradation in the present study diazinone is degraded to several compounds with lower molecular weights at different retention times for mode 1 two different fragments are obtained at 2 6 and 4 3 min fig 4 a in the case of mode 2 three different fragments are observed at retention times of 2 6 3 1 and 4 8 min fig 4b as mode 3 does not show significant degradation of diazinone the effect of any particular species is undetermined hence further experiments are avoided with this mode the formation of lower molecular weight fragments generation and existence through the operational period of 5 min are shown in fig 5 a and b most of the fragmented compounds are generated near the beginning of plasma treatment and formation continued until the diazinone degrades completely the only exception is observed for the fragmented compound obtained at 4 8 min which increases for 30 s of plasma operation and then shows a decreasing trend fig 5b 3 4 elucidating the diazinone degradation mechanism an lc ms analysis was done for the fragmented compounds observed in both mode 1 and mode 2 at retention times of 2 6 4 3 and 2 6 3 1 and 4 8 min respectively several molecular fragments are obtained for the two different models of plasma experiments as major and minor components and their fragmented ions along with the corresponding retention times are given in table 2 after analyzing the spectral features and fragmentation patterns the projected configurations and the reaction mechanism for diazinone degradation are displayed in fig 6 additionally some molecular fragments are observed in the ms spectra that shown in table 2 with asterisk mark do not seem they are from the diazinone those fragments may be from the teflon tube or compounds from the environment as the feed gas source used in this study is ambient air further investigation of these fragments was not performed 3 5 discussion microplasma discharged water showed high potential for the degradation of diazinone the diazinone degradation kinetics and mechanism under microplasma discharged water showed a dependence on different radicals for different levels and pathways a microplasma jet was uniformly dispersed underwater through a diffuser the generated hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentrations were very low 4 3 μm causing hardly any chemical reaction with diazinone during the microplasma operation this was confirmed by a separate experiment in which a 4 3 μm hydrogen peroxide standard solution and the same concentration of standard diazinone solution used in the microplasma operation were mixed and allowed to react with each other an hplc analysis showed that diazinone was not degraded with 4 3 μm h2o2 solution plasma treatment in presence and in absence of oh radicle scavenger ethanol does not show any significant changes on diazinone degradation this observation proves that oh radical does not play any role on diazinone degradation therefore in this article we only focus on the roles of dissolved o3 and oxides of nitrogen on diazinone degradation in plasma discharged water the results obtained from mode 1 and mode 2 suggested that among all the produced reactive substances from the plasma the dissolved o3 and oxides of nitrogen were the two major types of active substances that caused the maximum diazinone reduction the reduction mechanism of diazinone by o3 could be projected as either a traditional oxidation or as numerous different chain reactions to generate peroxide and oh radicals that then continually oxidize diazinone a secondary reaction via o3 occurs at high ph values however at a low ph the first reaction that occurs is oxidation at a low ph the dissolved o3 and h2o2 experience a slow reaction rate to generate hydroxyl radicals whereas at a high ph the reaction rates are very fast in this study the reaction occurred in a similar manner as a low ph medium the ph observed for plasma treated water was reduced significantly after 30 s of plasma treatment fig 2 hence the dissolved ozone had a lower contribution to diazinone degradation compared with that of the oxides of nitrogen as shown in fig 3 the oxidation reaction of ozone occurred through a breakdown of double bonds to generate an additional product named ozonide which experienced additional oxidation to form carboxylic acids 32 35 some examples of the post plasma operation reactions by which reactive species can be generated are shown below 1 h2o e oh h e 2 o o2 o3 3 h2o e h oh e 4 o3 oh ho2 o2 5 oh oh h2o2 6 h o2 ho2 7 ho 2 h h2o2 8 h2o2 o3 oh o2 ho2 diazinone present in the solution degraded to various fragments by reacting with plasma generated species diazinone cleavage might follow a similar route of oxidative degradation as those through the o3 mechanism o3 h2o2 system fenton s reagent system oxidation with oh radical mechanism reaction mechanism with rns and uv h2o2 systems 36 37 atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen molecules interact with each other by energetic electrons in the discharge medium to produce various types of oxides of nitrogen e g no2 n2o3 and n2o5 through several reaction pathways that remain present in the plasma state 38 due to a shorter lifetime under 10 6 s free radicles including no2 no and no are unable to travel a significant distance in aqueous solution 39 hence charged or neutral substances such as ozone and oxides of nitrogen with greater lifetimes are capable of contributing to chemical reactions at the gas liquid boundary dissolved no2 no3 n2o4 n2o5 and n2o3 react permanently with h2o to form hno2 and hno3 through the reactions shown below notably nitric oxide no is slightly soluble in water 40 41 i 2no2 h2o hno2 hno3 ii n2o4 h2o hno2 hno3 iii n2o3 h2o 2hno2 because of the existence of greater amounts of nitric acid pka 1 4 and nitrous acid pka 2 8 3 2 the solution ph dropped to 2 3 fig 2d iv hno2 h no2 v hno3 h no3 after switching off the plasma generator the amount of reactive substances in the aqueous solution might fluctuate over several days for this reason reactions after switching off the plasma discharge were believed to continue to preserve the concentration of significant chemical substances i e nitrite in plasma discharged water in acidic plasma discharged water nitrous acid and nitrate exist and nitrous acid always converted into nitrate and nitric oxide reaction vi 42 the observed oxides of nitrogen remained constant over several days as nitrous acid was converted into nitric acid hence no decrease of oxides of nitrogen occurred rather they were converted from one form to another form some researchers reported that in an alkaline environment nitrous acid might lose protons through reaction iv thus the breakdown of nitrous acid would be prevented however in our system we found that the amount of oxides of nitrogen remained unchanged for several days fig 2b the amount of nitrate and nitrite in microplasma treated water might vary due to the existence of h2o2 via the reaction route of vii and viii 41 vi 3hno2 h no 3 2no h2o vii 2no 3h2o2 2hno3 2h2o viii hno2 h2o2 onooh h2o therefore it could be stated that in mode 2 degradation might occur due to the presence of charged species instead of that of short lived radicals hence hydrolyzed products predominate in mode 2 compared to the oxidized products obtained in mode 1 43 however to elucidate the mechanism and kinetics of diazinone degradation by microplasma it is imperative to understand the interactions that cause diazinone to degrade and produce lower molecular fragments diazinone has different functional groups in its structure such as pyranium thiophosphate and alkyl ether which offer several sites for chemical reactions and or changes to occur by microplasma generated species on the basis of identified and degraded products obtained from ms as summarized in table 2 the degradation pathways of diazinone under plasma treatment are proposed in fig 6 the oxidation of the p s link to the p s s link to the po link via a free radical mechanism can be explained simply and promotes the generation of diazoxone based on the result obtained by hua et al 1995 hydrolysis product might be boosted too mainly for the reactants that interact to the fizz boundary 44 consequently imp 2 isopropyl 6 methyl pyridine 4 ol and diethyl phosphate were formed through the hydrolysis of diazinone or diazoxone by the cleavage of either a po bond pyrimidine group or an op bond in several works it has been reported that the hydroxylation reaction occurs for diazinone to produce hydroxydiazinone 45 46 hydroxylation occurs at the tertiary 3 and primary 1 carbon atoms of the isopropyl group and results in the production of hydroxydiazinone and 2 hydroxydiazinon respectively the hydroxylation products more likely can undergo a dehydration reaction and convert into an isopropenyl derivative of diazinone 47 48 although this fragmented products were not obtained by lcms spectra in our analysis that represents by in the fig 6 due to some unknown reasons the ms spectra for 302 and or 286 were missed in our study however based on the other reports the dehydration reaction is more likely to occur in our study which shown in the fig 6 afterwards an oxidation and decarboxylation reaction on the isopropenyl derivative of diazinone occurs resulting in the creation of a hydroxyethyl derivative of diazinone that has been observed in the digestion of diazinone in wildlife and plant life 47 last the hydroxyethyl derivative of diazinone is oxidized to diazinone methyl ketone fig 6 from the above discussions based on the data obtained in this study it can be stated that the diazinone degradation mechanism varies due to the variation of the plasma generated radical on the one hand the mode 1 reaction shows two degradation products where the oxidation reaction predominates on the other hand oxides of nitrogen show three degradation products where the hydrolysis product predominates differences in the degradation rate and the contribution on diazinone degradation by two different types of species dissolved ozone and oxides of nitrogen also indicate different routes of degradation the ms spectrum confirms the further degradation of imp into several different fragments among the several fragments the structures of viii different fragments are proposed and shown in fig 6 the fragments are predicted based on their molecular weights and further analyses such as ir and nmr are required to confirm the structures of the fragments proposed here additional fragments shown in the table 2 with asterisk mark represents that the sources of the compounds are not diazinone in this study we performed a qualitative identification of diazinone metabolites with respect to the molecular weight of diazinone fragments by using lc ms the identified metabolites of diazinone are listed in the fig 6 the reactive particles produced during micro plasma could be reacted not only in reactions with the target pesticide but also in reactions with the degradation products and hence further degradation occurs to produce several smaller fragments it may be illustrated that the end points of pesticide reductions are categorized by simpler chemical groups 49 50 as micro plasma offers a number of advanced oxidation process aop for water treatment with a one pot formation of short lived oxidants mineralization of pesticides without any reversible reactions and usage of echo friendly feed gases such as atmospheric air hence post plasma treated molecules were observed to have a series of less toxic fragments than the parent pesticide molecules number of research reports were published on detoxification of pesticides with number of different types of pesticides such as chaitannaya s et al 2016 51 showed the detoxification of dichlorvos malathion and endosulfan using cold plasma zhu et al 52 who used an atmospheric pressure plasma jet using a helium oxygen feed gas also founded comparable result with chaitannaya s et al 2016 several researcher showed that nitenpyram ntp pesticide could effectively be removed from aqueous solutions by low temperature plasma even they were successful to degrade pesticides residues from different surfaces using different types of plasma sources 53 55 variations in plasma operating settings such as frequency duty cycle sample volume chemical nature of the sample viscosity and the electrode gap may play an important part in the degradation kinetics and or mechanisms 56 intense electric fields may offer faster rates of degradation and the diffuser features can vary the reaction rate into the aqueous medium diffuser features such as aperture dimension and shape may differ the mixing ability of the plasma radicals with water a large discharge gap may necessitate a high voltage for the degradation of a standard solution of diazinone the size of the electrode gap regulates the capacity of the inducer gas and affects the electron fall ionization and radical formation nevertheless to achieve optimum settings for quick and effective degradation using this research in a broad way is imperative further research may assist the implementation of microplasma discharge water treatment technology to degrade toxic chemicals from contaminated food surfaces in the food processing industry and or effluent treatment technology 4 conclusions the present study showed the high potential of microplasma discharged water for the degradation of diazinone the reaction kinetics and mechanism of diazinone standard solution by microplasma discharge were also evaluated diazinone degradation showed first order reaction kinetics diazinone underwent oxidation reactions upon interaction with key plasma generated substances to breakdown into lower molecular fragments furthermore successive degradation occurred different radicals present in the plasma discharge water played different roles in degradation among all the radicals generated by the microplasma oxides of nitrogen played a major role in degradation and dissolved ozone placed next in the ranking finding the roles of short lived oh radicals was beyond the scope of this work h2o2 played a minimal role or almost no role in diazinone

13969,the current study was designed to obtain the maximum water efficiency using water conservation strategies and at source effluent treatment leading it reusable in three manufacturing plants p i ii and iii of a leather chemical industry the best available techniques bats for water conservation were applied which resulted in 28 1 and 44 8 reduction in water usage and effluent generation respectively laboratory and pilot scale electrocoagulation ec as well as horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssf cws were applied for the final treatment of effluent in the electrocoagulation method the obtained removal efficiency of cod tds tss and conductivity was 93 58 43 23 55 48 and 35 42 at the laboratory and 92 84 37 97 53 57 and 33 58 at pilot scale respectively for p i and p ii effluent removal efficiency using electrocoagulation was very low all below 35 for p iii effluent because of presence of electrolytes in excess which disrupt the experiment therefore hssf cws were applied as an alternative treatment method for p iii removal efficiency of cod tds tss and conductivity of hssf cws was 95 48 34 10 53 07 and 9 83 at laboratory and 95 43 37 59 51 52 and 8 65 at pilot scale respectively finally the treated wastewater was reused in all manufacturing plants for non process activities it is concluded that curtailing water consumption significantly reduces the effluent generation which after at source treatment through sustainable technologies can be reused to produce near zero liquid discharge zld from leather chemical industry keywords effluent removal efficiency electrocoagulation cod removal zero liquid discharge 1 introduction worldwide leather industry is one of the fastest growing enterprise because of its wide scale application in garments tools trinkets and goods 1 leather products are manufactured from putrescible animal skins which are converted into variety of useful desirable products through different processes including leather tanning dyeing smoothing and finishing etc 2 3 variety of chemicals such as adhesives pigments and syntans etc are synthesized in the industry which are used to manufacture final leather products from raw putrescible animal skins thorough aforementioned processes 4 leather pigments are used to produce aesthetic effects in leather with required colours and shades 5 6 these pigments are obtained by emulsification of titanium dioxide carbon black iron oxide and lead and chromium compounds 7 adhesives are polymer based chemicals used to glue leather pieces together and provide water resistance to make desirable product while syntans are used as synthetic tanning agents as well as to improve the texture and smoothing of the leather products most of the tanning materials are in powder form and these compounds are usually formulated in powder mixing by adding suitable salts and buffering agents to achieve the required functions 8 9 in addition other chemicals like surfactants oils fat liquors acid dyes and are also used in leather making to get aesthetic and desirable effects in final leather product 10 the manufacturing of these leather chemicals in industry costs a huge water consumption and effluent generation 11 the primary problem in leather chemical manufacturing industry is the consumption of freshwater in large quantity posing water crisis for public particularly in areas facing severe water scarcity 8 12 the water is mainly used in process and non process activities non process activities mainly include washings of floor vessels spray drying etc whereas process utilization encompasses the usage of water in adhesives and pigments emulsions and syntans 13 14 secondly the effluent generated from leather chemicals industry is posing a serious environmental issue if discharged untreated in the surface water bodies 15 the effluent comprised of chemical residues including surfactants oil salts acids polymers solvents fat liquor dyes etc from adhesives pigments and syntans production processes 11 14 the untreated discharge of these contaminants makes their way to aquatic bodies bioaccumulate in living tissues and biomagnify through the food chains hence posing a serious concern for natural ecosystem 16 it is reported that the effluents of pigment manufacturing plant when discharged in the water bodies cause various environmental and ecological problems 17 further it is established that the syntans are the condensation of products of formaldehyde with phenols and amino precursors and tend to release formaldehyde in effluent under certain hydrolytic conditions which is carcinogenic 14 18 globally efforts are underway to obtain reduced water consumption as well as effective effluent management using sustainable effluent treatment technologies in chemical industries reduction in water consumption is usually achieved through the use of best available techniques bats in the industries 19 20 it usually includes installation of water flow gauges followed by improved washing methods and reuse of water in a recent study about 46 reduction in water consumption has been obtained at polyethylene terephthalate production by espousing smart management practices and process alterations that has resulted in both increased environmental performance and profitability 13 these methods of reducing water consumption can be applied to leather industries which further leads to a reduction in wastewater generation 21 for effective management industries are looking for sustainable treatment technologies for the compliance of the environmental regulations 22 this is because of the fact that traditional treatment technologies are land intensive as well as require high cost and energy 23 a review of the recent past literatures suggest that electrocoagulation ec is one of the best energy and cost effective option for effluent treatment in industries 24 27 however electrocoagulation has some limitations such as it is usually not effective for the effluent with high concentrations of electrolytes 25 26 to overcome this constructed wetlands cws particularly with horizontal subsurface flow are suitable alternative option successfully employed in different industries 28 29 both of these techniques are reliable cost effective with very low energy demands hence considered as sustainable technologies 30 32 further the removal efficiency of different effluent parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolve and suspended solid tds tss ph and conductivity through the use of both these technologies is upto the level where the wastewater can be reused to attain zero liquid discharge zld in industries 33 36 in pakistan leather chemicals industries are facing serious problems of high water consumption and lack of effective effluent management 1 3 36 most of these industries are located in urban areas already facing water scarcity issues 3 36 secondly traditional effluent treatment technologies are not meeting the criteria for safe disposal of industrial wastewater hence posing a serious threat to the surrounding ecosystem in view of aforementioned problem current study was designed to 1 unveil the use of best available techniques for water conservation to minimize water consumption as well as reduce the effluent generation and 2 to evaluate the application of sustainable treatment technologies such as electrocoagulation ec and horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland hssf cws for the treatment of generated effluent to make it reusable in three different plants of a leather chemicals manufacturing industry of pakistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of industry the study was aimed to obtain the sustainable solutions for the reduction in water consumption and wastewater management and subsequent treatment in three production units p i p ii p iii of adhesives and leather chemicals manufacturing industry these plants are installed adjacent to each other in a leather chemicals manufacturer group of lahore pakistan the effluent of both p i and p ii are combined in a water channel which afterward joins with the effluent of p iii and eventually drained into a nearby nullah the details of each of the production units are given below 2 1 1 production unit 1 p i this unit involves the manufacturing of adhesives super bond and glue and its packaging on monthly basis approximately two tons of water based and oil based polymers are produced in this unit the water in p i is mainly used both in non process i e washing of vessels and floor and process i e in adhesive manufacturing activities the effluent generated at p i is subsequently poured into the effluent of p ii fig 1 2 1 2 production unit 2 p ii this unit involves the manufacturing of leather pigments which are commonly used in the leather industry as a final coloring agent in post tanning processes after dyeing 37 there are four vessels of white red yellow and black colours containing the corresponding pigments further there are 13 different pigment based products that are manufactured and packed in this unit with different dyeing characteristics the non process water in this unit is mainly used for cleaning and washing purposes wheras the process water is added in pigments manufacturing combined effluent of p i and p ii are finally discharged into an open channel before it joins the effluent of p iii fig 1 2 1 3 production unit 3 p iii p iii unit is associated with the powder mixing of syntans synthetic tanning agents and resins these chemicals which are rarely used in pure form are used for spray drying to convert them into powder form and then formulate to get the desired quality usually the activity of finished products of syntans and resins is adjusted in section p iii by the use of salts such as sodium sulfate and sodium chloride sometimes starch and china clays are also added to get some filling properties in leather these products are also buffered with some acidic salts like ammonium chloride ammonium sulfate and organic acids such as citric acid and tartaric acid the formulations of syntans powder are carried out in the compounding section of p iii which consists of pin grinders different types of mixers and blenders along with sifting and pacing equipment in this unit no water is used in process activities the effluent of this unit which is majorly produced by cleaning vessels contains a high concentration of electrolytes because of use of different salts and acid the effluent of p iii is poured into the channel which already contains the combined discharge of p i and p ii and finally discharged into the main drain fig 1 2 2 applications of best available techniques several best available techniques bats were applied for water conservation and reduction in effluent generation of the leather chemicals manufacturing industry 13 38 40 best available techniques include the installation of gauges to measure the actual usage of water in different process and non process activities of different production units followed by improved washing and reuse to minimize the water loss the details of the best available techniques employed in this study are given as below installation of the water flow meters at different points where the water consumption was required to measure at each plant the introduction of best management practices such as floor comprised of improved washing of floor and vessels application of engineering controls including pressure gun for vessel washing reuse of first wash from vessels for the next product manufacturing batch at p ii the final wash was reused for recharging of spray dryer at p iii direct reuse of cooling water ejected from vessel s jacket as a feed water in cooling tower direct reuse of reverse osmosis ro concentrates without any treatment for non process activities after applying all bats reduction in water consumption and effluent generation from each activity along with combined industrial units was calculated in percent as follows c o n s u m p t i o n r e d u c t i o n c o n s u m p t i o n m e a s u

technologies a electrocoagulation ec and b horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssf cws were employed ec was opted for the treatment of effluent coming from p i and p ii units whereas hssf cws were designed for p iii effluent initially ec was also tested for p iii effluent but the presence of a high concentration of electrolytes disrupt the experiment hence unsuccessful the hffs cws are employed as a successful alternative option for p iii both ec and hssf cws were first tested at the laboratory scale and then applied at the pilot scale the detail description of sampling and laboratory and pilot scale setup is given below 2 3 1 sampling methods for wastewater three sampling locations were selected for wastewater collection the location i comprised of combined effluent of p i p ii location ii for the effluent of p iii and location iii for combined effluent of p i ii and p iii discharged into the drain fig 1 sampling was performed in two phases during the first phase a baseline was developed to understand the characteristic of the effluent for this purpose a total of 72 composite samples 24 from each sampling location were collected on a daily basis in amber glass bottles of 500 ml after collection samples were immediately transported to the quality assurance laboratory of the industry for analysis of physicochemical parameters in the second phase the same numbers 72 of composite samples of effluent from the each of the three locations were collected after the implementation of all batss for water conservation as well as after applying wastewater treatment after the maximum activities of all plants the effluent was first collected in a collection tank to equalize the wastewater concentration the collected samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters 2 3 2 analytical work all samples were brought to the quality assurance laboratory and the physicochemical parameters such as ph tds tss cod and electrical conductivity were measured before and after the treatment with two wastewater treatment technologies viz electrocoagulation and horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands the ph tds and electrical conductivity of wastewater were determined by using a multi meter model hanna hi 9811 5 apha method 2005 was used to measure the concentration of tds and cod the effluent flow was measured using water flow meter at the effluent drain originating from the location i and location ii of three production units the removal efficiencies of the pollutants in the wastewater were determined by using the following formula r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y r c o c t c o 100 where co initial concentration and ct final concentration 2 3 3 experimental setup for ec 2 3 3 1 lab scale setup an ec plant made of perspex material with a dimension in meters of 0 2 l 0 1 w 0 27 h was developed on lab scale two aluminum and two iron electrodes with dimensions of 23 cm height 1 cm diameter were used as anode and cathode respectively in the reaction chamber space between anode and cathode was set at 4 cm a direct current dc power supply using the solar cell was applied to operate the cell 35 41 the schematic diagram of the electrocoagulation unit is provided in fig 2 the experiment was performed by adding one liter of wastewater in the lab scale ec unit this unit was given an agitation system with a magnetic stirrer to equalize the effluent during treatment dc supply was given to the system which took 3 amperes initially and reduced to 0 5 amperes after 3 min the whole process was continued for 10 min and an additional 10 min were given for settling of suspended coagulates the treated samples were then subjected to filtration and sent to the laboratory for the analysis of water parameters 2 3 3 2 pilot scale setup after successful lab scale operation a pilot scale ec plant was constructed on the basis of lab scale design criteria table 1 fig 2 the electrocoagulation cell was made up of perspex material having a length width and height of 0 7 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m a total of 10 aluminum and iron electrodes were used pilot scale setup with a distance of 5 3 cm between anodes and cathodes to run the process dc power supply was applied through solar cell effluent from p i and p ii was first collected in an equalization tank of 200 l and subsequently introduced into the pilot scale ec unit a stong agitation was given with a mechanical rotating agitator dc power supply of 14 amperes current was applied initially that reduced to 5 to 3 amperes after 8 10 min the surface of the electrodes was first scrubbed with abrasive paper followed by rinsing with purified water and drying before dipping into the tank the reaction was allowed to continue for 25 min a cloth filtration assembly of 253 cm3 was connected with reaction chamber for the final filtration process the final filtrate was analyzed for quality parameters in a quality assurance laboratory the details of both lab and pilot scale setup of ec are provided in table 1 2 3 4 experimental setup for hssf cw plant 2 3 4 1 lab scale setup for p iii effluent where ec was not successful because of the presence of electrolytes in excess two horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands were designed at lab scale lab scale hssf cws setup made up of high density polyethylene was placed outside the research and development laboratory of the industry where the approach of sunlight was adequate the indignious plant species typha latifolia was grown in the constructed wetland for the effective removal of pollutants the substrate materials used to support and grow the plants were gravel sand lime and clay gravel formed the outer lining of the constructed wetlands from sidewalls and the base followed by a lining of sand and clay used in the center of wetland to provide anchorage and nutrients to the plants a slope of 10 was adjusted to for both cellsto allow the continuous flow of wastewater through the constructed wetlands fig 3 the length width and height of all wetlands were 0 45 m 0 24 m and 0 26 m respectivelywith a total surface area of 0 108 m2 the hydraulic retention time was kept 5 days for the whole unit 32 final filtration was performed to remove the dirt material from the treated wastewater experiments were performed for 2 months 8 weeks in order to evalute the removal efficiency of the system the detail criteria of cws are provided in table 2 the samples were taken every week and analyzed for physiochemical parameters to investigate the treatment efficiency 2 3 4 2 pilot scale setup pilot scale hssf cws model for wastewater treatment of p iii effluent was constructed outside the p iii plant on the basis of successful design and operation of lab scale setup table 2 two of the same size rectangular shaped wetlands made up of high density polyethylene with dimensions of 1 3 m 1 m 0 75 m length width height and surface area 0 98 m2 were constructed the hydrophyte typha latifolia was grown in both wetlands a slope of 10 was set for both units to allow the continuous flow of wastewater the substrate materials used in both wetlands were gravel followed by sand and clay fig 3 42 before the treatment freshwater was passed through the constructed wetland for period of 4 weeks for the natural growth of hydrophytes 43 the wastewater from the drainage pipe of p iii was first collected in a container for one week then was pumped into the first unit of cws this process was performed for 8 weeks until the best results were obtained the hydraulic retention time of wastewater was given for 5 days the details of both lab and pilot scale constructed wetland setup are provided in table 1 the samples were collected from the outlet pipe of the second wetland after filtration for each experiment and the removal efficiency of different parameters was measured in the laboratory 3 results and discussion 3 1 reductions through water conservation strategies in this study the first step was to develop the baseline of effluent characteristics and water consumption of all production units fig 4 illustrates the initial result of the analysis conducted to investigate the pollution load at all sampling locations prior to any treatment the values of cod and tss at location iii were 4925 mg l and 1461 mg l respectively which were fairly higher than corresponding values of 2025 mg l 420 mg l at location i and and 3005 mg l 396 mg l at location ii respectively this was expected because the combined drain of all three units has a greater pollution load compared to location i and ii seperately conversly the values of tds and conductivity varied unevenly between the locations possibly because of dilution factor and distance from the source therefore it was decided to apply at source separate treatment for wastewater at locations i and ii to get the effluent treated easily instead of applying treatment at the end of the channel containing the combined drain from p i ii and iii secondly water flow meters were installed to measure all water consumption areas and effluent flow keeping in view the results of water consumption at all units bats were applied to reduce the usage of water which led to decrease wastewater discharge at the end of each industrial unit table 3 shows the two different categories for water consumption i e process and non process water the consumption of process softened water at p ii was very high 11 m3 month compared to p i 1 m3 month whereas no softened water was used in p iii processes because this unit is used for dry powder mixing and final product is in dry form our primary focus was to cut down the consumption of non process water after application of bats the consumption of water for vessel washing was reduced for p i p ii and p iii plants from 11 5 5 m3 month to 9 3 3 m3 month floor washing was reduced to 6 2 2 m3 month to 3 1 1 m3 month and spray dryer washing which was the only part of p iii reduced from 3 to 1 5 m3 month table 3 before application of bats 2 m3 month of cooling water was drained out from jacket in reaction vessels of p ii this system was modified by the direct reuse of cooling water into the cooling tower as feed water but some loss of water was calculated as 0 5 m3 month of blow down and 0 5 m3 month of evaporation the total consumption of water was reduced from 48 m3 month to 34 5 m3 month which corresponds to 28 1 reduction in overall water usage table 3 in a recent study about 46 reduction in water consumption has been obtained in a chemical industry through application of bats and process alterations that result in both increased environmental performance and profitability 13 further many previous studies measured a reduction in water consumption between 20 50 using best available techniques 11 12 19 21 40 the differences in water consumption reduction is mainly associated with type of industrial sectors as well as efficiency and implementation of bats before application of bats reverse osmosis process of water filtration operates with a recovery of 55 60 while 45 40 concentrate which accounts for 13 m3 month water was directly discharged to the wastewater channels the concentrate was reused in the plants for washing purposes consequently producing 5 m3 month effluent table 3 past literature showed that ro concentrate on the values of 70 80 can be directly reused in various industrial applications 44 effluent reduction from other sources including rejection of cooling water from vessel jacket vessel washing floor and spray dryier washing were from 2 2110 and 3 m3 month to 0 5 15 5 1 5 m3 month at p i p ii and p iii respectively the total effluent was reduced from 49 m3 month to 27 m3 month which accounts for 44 8 of reduction from p i p ii and p iii table 3 past literature suggested a range from 35 to 50 reduction in effluent generation can be obtained through the use of bat 19 21 40 however like water consumption effluent reduction also varied in different inductries as well as efficiency and implementation of bats 3 2 laboratory and pilot scale effluent treatment by electrocoagulation ec after water conservation the already reduced effluent from p i p ii and p iii needed treatment before it is drained into nullah for this purpose electrocoagulation ec setup was established first in the laboratory and then on pilot scale table 4 illustrate the before and after electrocoagulation treatment results of lab scale analysis of samples taken from location i finally the results of treated effluent were compared with the national environmental quality standards neqs and found under permissible range the effluent had the ph within the neqs range and was suitable for ec treatment therefore ph was not neutralized 35 the removal efficiency of other selected parameters obtained through lab scale ec treatment were 93 58 for cod 43 23 for tds 55 48 for tss and 35 42 for conductivity respectively table 4 in an experimental setup the removal efficiency was 76 9 using stainless steel while it was 50 using fe electrodes 45 however we obtained quite higher removal efficiency using the aluminum electrode further electrocoagulation is proven as better over chemical coagulation by achieving 93 1 removal efficiency of cod in textile wastewater through electrocoagulation followed by 40 in the latter case however when chemical and electrocoagulation were applied together 98 cod removal efficiency was achieved 46 our result for cod removal efficiency at laboratory scale electrocoagulation was excellent as it brings the cod values less than the neqs limit therefore we replicate the laboratory scale electrocoagulation experiment with some modifications at pilot scale after the successful application of ec at lab scale a pilot scale ec setup was established for pi and pii effluent table 5 show the results of the physicochemical parameter for the pilot scale ec plant for both lab and pilot scale treatment the removal efficiency of cod was 93 58 and 92 84 respectively with the initial effluent value of 2025 mg l showing no significant differences between lab and pilot scale application of ec for the combined wastewater of p i and p ii the obtained cod value of 145 mg l for combined wastewater of p i and p ii was found within the neqs range previously removal efficiencies of cod at 88 83 and 89 were achieved through electrocoagulation in shipyard wastewater and industrial wastewater respectively 47 48 the removal efficiency of cod in the current study was significantly higher when compared with previous pilot scale studies where ec setup was used with steel and aluminum electrodes achieving cod removal rate of 68 and 58 1 with an initial concentration of 2413 mg l and 2124 mg l respectively 49 in another study on industrial estate wastewater the comparable removal efficiency of 92 was obtained for cod at best experimental conditions 50 similarly the removal efficiencies were 37 97 53 57 and 33 58 for tds tss and conductivity with the final values of 3300 mg l 195 mg l and 252 obtained respectively values of all the parameters for the combined effluent of p i and p ii subjected to pilot scale electrocoagulation were within the neqs limits hence this treated water was reused in the plant one of the important factors in electrocoagulation is the current density which is usually 1 3 amperes 48 in this study we used a solar cell which initially supplied with 5 amperes but it gradually decreases upto 3 amperes and maintains a current density of 2 3 amperes during the experiment at this current density maximum removal efficiencies were obtained in the current study which is in accordance with previous studies 45 48 like laboratory scale experiment for electrocoagulation our pilot scale experiment was also successful as it brings values of cod and other parameters below the neqs limits 3 3 laboratory scale effluent treatment of p iii by ec similar to p i and p ii a lab scale electrocoagulation system was developed for the treatment of effluent of p iii table 6 represent the results for the application of lab scale electrocoagulation for p iii effluent the removal efficiency for cod tds and tss were 35 60 27 77 and 21 96 respectively which was too low than it was required to meet the neqs after treatment all of these parameters showed the values far higher than neqs limits table 6 hence application of lab scale electrocoagulation was proved unsuccessful for the effluent of p iii similar to the results of current findings relatively lower removal efficiencies of cod have been reported in the literature 45 46 it is observed that effluent of p iii contained some acidic salts like ammonium chloride ammonium sulfate and organic acids such as citric acid and tartaric acid therefore p iii effluent has a high concentration of electrolytes which created more ions to react with anode resulting in the creation of electrons and produced high backflow of electric current which interrupted the working of ec setup hence desired results were not achieved for p iii effluent using ec 51 52 because of low removal efficiency for all parameters trough electrocoagulation the horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands hccf cws were used as an alternative sustainable treatment technology for p iii effluent 3 4 laboratory and pilot scale effluent treatment of p iii by hssf cws a lab scale hssf cws setup was established for the treatment of p iii effluent initially freshwater was introduced in the hssf cws for the settlement of substrate materials and growth of plants as a modification of the process described earlier 28 53 after one week the first batch of effluent was discharged in hssf cws and physicochemical parameters were measured after a day which showed relatively lower removal efficiency the fresh effluent was discharged into the hssf cws every week to optimize the removal efficiencies the removal efficiency gradually increases from the first week to the 8th week where maximum removal efficiency was obtained table 7 after treating the wastewater through hssf cws the values and cod and other parameters obtained were below the neqs limits after successful achievement the same experiment was repeated for pilot scale study with necessary modifications in terms of comparison the removal efficiency of cod at lab and pilot scale was recorded as 95 48 and 95 43 in the 8th week which reflects the suitability of hssf cws for the efficient removal of cod table 8 the cod removal efficiencies of the current study were comparable to previous reports for the treatment of wastewater through hssf cws 28 54 57 the value obtained for cod removal of both lab scale and pilot scale was 135 mg l and 137 mg l respectively which falls under the neqs limits set for industrial effluents one of the important factors for obtaining maximum removal efficiency is the selection of plant species used in the constructed wetland cws we use typha latifolia plants which have been proven as best species for cod and pollutants removal from wastewater 58 59 tds removal efficiency obtained at lab scale was 34 10 which was a little higher than 37 59 measured for pilot scale treatment however both tds values obtained after treatment at the lab and pilot scale fall under the neqs permissible range similarly the removal efficiency of tss and electrical conductivity was 53 07 and 9 83 at the lab and 51 52 and 8 65 and pilot scale like cod the obtained values of these parameters after treatment were found within the neqs range the values of parameters obtained through hssf cws were found in accordance with previous reports 33 59 therefore we deduced that the use of constructed wetland for the removal of tds and tss using macrophytes such as typha latifolia is the best option because large root network of plants increases the area for microbial attachment decreases the water velocity as well as helps in settling and filtration of dissolved and suspended particles 60 61 further the overall results for hssf cws showed that the treated effluent can be reused in the p iii plant the removal efficiency of cod at lab and pilot scale for hssf cws are shown in fig 5 in lab scale experiment the values of cod decrease from 1236 mg l in the first week to 135 mg l in the 8th week while in pilot scale the value of cod decreases from 2019 mg l in the first week to 145 mg l the results of cod removal are remarkably different from ec treatment which was previously applied and remained unsuccessful because of lower removal efficiency table 6 results obtained after using both selected treatment technologies i e ec and hssf cws indicate that the treated wastewater can be the best option for reusing as washing purposes in all plants which leads to the minimization of water consumption further use of both the technologies proved the reduction in effluent generation from p i p ii p iii therefore we recommended that this pilot scale treatment setup has the potential to be used at full scale after required modification and systemization such as collection of effluent to equalization before the treatment and installation filtration assembly for the final filtrate 4 conclusions the current study presented the application of water consumption minimization strategies which has a significant impact on the reduction in wastewater generation from three production units of the leather chemicals industry further cost effective solutions were employed for the treatment of wastewater this study provided the sustainable treatment solutions which can be applied at differentproduction units separately this study provided a strong evidence that electrocoagulation ec is the best option for the treatment of effluents with low concentration of electrolytes whereas the horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands hssf cws are the sustainable alternative options for the effluents containing high concentrations of electrolytes in effluent ofleather chemical industry the results of this research clearly indicate the high removal efficiency of physicochemical parameters from wastewater was obtained by using ec and hssf cws technologies after applying the water conservation and treatment technologies not only the water consumption is reduced but the reuse of treated wastewater in all production plants achieved near zero liquid discharge we recommend thatthese experiments should be replicated in other related industries for sustainable development declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest at personal and or organizational level 
13969,the current study was designed to obtain the maximum water efficiency using water conservation strategies and at source effluent treatment leading it reusable in three manufacturing plants p i ii and iii of a leather chemical industry the best available techniques bats for water conservation were applied which resulted in 28 1 and 44 8 reduction in water usage and effluent generation respectively laboratory and pilot scale electrocoagulation ec as well as horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssf cws were applied for the final treatment of effluent in the electrocoagulation method the obtained removal efficiency of cod tds tss and conductivity was 93 58 43 23 55 48 and 35 42 at the laboratory and 92 84 37 97 53 57 and 33 58 at pilot scale respectively for p i and p ii effluent removal efficiency using electrocoagulation was very low all below 35 for p iii effluent because of presence of electrolytes in excess which disrupt the experiment therefore hssf cws were applied as an alternative treatment method for p iii removal efficiency of cod tds tss and conductivity of hssf cws was 95 48 34 10 53 07 and 9 83 at laboratory and 95 43 37 59 51 52 and 8 65 at pilot scale respectively finally the treated wastewater was reused in all manufacturing plants for non process activities it is concluded that curtailing water consumption significantly reduces the effluent generation which after at source treatment through sustainable technologies can be reused to produce near zero liquid discharge zld from leather chemical industry keywords effluent removal efficiency electrocoagulation cod removal zero liquid discharge 1 introduction worldwide leather industry is one of the fastest growing enterprise because of its wide scale application in garments tools trinkets and goods 1 leather products are manufactured from putrescible animal skins which are converted into variety of useful desirable products through different processes including leather tanning dyeing smoothing and finishing etc 2 3 variety of chemicals such as adhesives pigments and syntans etc are synthesized in the industry which are used to manufacture final leather products from raw putrescible animal skins thorough aforementioned processes 4 leather pigments are used to produce aesthetic effects in leather with required colours and shades 5 6 these pigments are obtained by emulsification of titanium dioxide carbon black iron oxide and lead and chromium compounds 7 adhesives are polymer based chemicals used to glue leather pieces together and provide water resistance to make desirable product while syntans are used as synthetic tanning agents as well as to improve the texture and smoothing of the leather products most of the tanning materials are in powder form and these compounds are usually formulated in powder mixing by adding suitable salts and buffering agents to achieve the required functions 8 9 in addition other chemicals like surfactants oils fat liquors acid dyes and are also used in leather making to get aesthetic and desirable effects in final leather product 10 the manufacturing of these leather chemicals in industry costs a huge water consumption and effluent generation 11 the primary problem in leather chemical manufacturing industry is the consumption of freshwater in large quantity posing water crisis for public particularly in areas facing severe water scarcity 8 12 the water is mainly used in process and non process activities non process activities mainly include washings of floor vessels spray drying etc whereas process utilization encompasses the usage of water in adhesives and pigments emulsions and syntans 13 14 secondly the effluent generated from leather chemicals industry is posing a serious environmental issue if discharged untreated in the surface water bodies 15 the effluent comprised of chemical residues including surfactants oil salts acids polymers solvents fat liquor dyes etc from adhesives pigments and syntans production processes 11 14 the untreated discharge of these contaminants makes their way to aquatic bodies bioaccumulate in living tissues and biomagnify through the food chains hence posing a serious concern for natural ecosystem 16 it is reported that the effluents of pigment manufacturing plant when discharged in the water bodies cause various environmental and ecological problems 17 further it is established that the syntans are the condensation of products of formaldehyde with phenols and amino precursors and tend to release formaldehyde in effluent under certain hydrolytic conditions which is carcinogenic 14 18 globally efforts are underway to obtain reduced water consumption as well as effective effluent management using sustainable effluent treatment technologies in chemical industries reduction in water consumption is usually achieved through the use of best available techniques bats in the industries 19 20 it usually includes installation of water flow gauges followed by improved washing methods and reuse of water in a recent study about 46 reduction in water consumption has been obtained at polyethylene terephthalate production by espousing smart management practices and process alterations that has resulted in both increased environmental performance and profitability 13 these methods of reducing water consumption can be applied to leather industries which further leads to a reduction in wastewater generation 21 for effective management industries are looking for sustainable treatment technologies for the compliance of the environmental regulations 22 this is because of the fact that traditional treatment technologies are land intensive as well as require high cost and energy 23 a review of the recent past literatures suggest that electrocoagulation ec is one of the best energy and cost effective option for effluent treatment in industries 24 27 however electrocoagulation has some limitations such as it is usually not effective for the effluent with high concentrations of electrolytes 25 26 to overcome this constructed wetlands cws particularly with horizontal subsurface flow are suitable alternative option successfully employed in different industries 28 29 both of these techniques are reliable cost effective with very low energy demands hence considered as sustainable technologies 30 32 further the removal efficiency of different effluent parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolve and suspended solid tds tss ph and conductivity through the use of both these technologies is upto the level where the wastewater can be reused to attain zero liquid discharge zld in industries 33 36 in pakistan leather chemicals industries are facing serious problems of high water consumption and lack of effective effluent management 1 3 36 most of these industries are located in urban areas already facing water scarcity issues 3 36 secondly traditional effluent treatment technologies are not meeting the criteria for safe disposal of industrial wastewater hence posing a serious threat to the surrounding ecosystem in view of aforementioned problem current study was designed to 1 unveil the use of best available techniques for water conservation to minimize water consumption as well as reduce the effluent generation and 2 to evaluate the application of sustainable treatment technologies such as electrocoagulation ec and horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland hssf cws for the treatment of generated effluent to make it reusable in three different plants of a leather chemicals manufacturing industry of pakistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of industry the study was aimed to obtain the sustainable solutions for the reduction in water consumption and wastewater management and subsequent treatment in three production units p i p ii p iii of adhesives and leather chemicals manufacturing industry these plants are installed adjacent to each other in a leather chemicals manufacturer group of lahore pakistan the effluent of both p i and p ii are combined in a water channel which afterward joins with the effluent of p iii and eventually drained into a nearby nullah the details of each of the production units are given below 2 1 1 production unit 1 p i this unit involves the manufacturing of adhesives super bond and glue and its packaging on monthly basis approximately two tons of water based and oil based polymers are produced in this unit the water in p i is mainly used both in non process i e washing of vessels and floor and process i e in adhesive manufacturing activities the effluent generated at p i is subsequently poured into the effluent of p ii fig 1 2 1 2 production unit 2 p ii this unit involves the manufacturing of leather pigments which are commonly used in the leather industry as a final coloring agent in post tanning processes after dyeing 37 there are four vessels of white red yellow and black colours containing the corresponding pigments further there are 13 different pigment based products that are manufactured and packed in this unit with different dyeing characteristics the non process water in this unit is mainly used for cleaning and washing purposes wheras the process water is added in pigments manufacturing combined effluent of p i and p ii are finally discharged into an open channel before it joins the effluent of p iii fig 1 2 1 3 production unit 3 p iii p iii unit is associated with the powder mixing of syntans synthetic tanning agents and resins these chemicals which are rarely used in pure form are used for spray drying to convert them into powder form and then formulate to get the desired quality usually the activity of finished products of syntans and resins is adjusted in section p iii by the use of salts such as sodium sulfate and sodium chloride sometimes starch and china clays are also added to get some filling properties in leather these products are also buffered with some acidic salts like ammonium chloride ammonium sulfate and organic acids such as citric acid and tartaric acid the formulations of syntans powder are carried out in the compounding section of p iii which consists of pin grinders different types of mixers and blenders along with sifting and pacing equipment in this unit no water is used in process activities the effluent of this unit which is majorly produced by cleaning vessels contains a high concentration of electrolytes because of use of different salts and acid the effluent of p iii is poured into the channel which already contains the combined discharge of p i and p ii and finally discharged into the main drain fig 1 2 2 applications of best available techniques several best available techniques bats were applied for water conservation and reduction in effluent generation of the leather chemicals manufacturing industry 13 38 40 best available techniques include the installation of gauges to measure the actual usage of water in different process and non process activities of different production units followed by improved washing and reuse to minimize the water loss the details of the best available techniques employed in this study are given as below installation of the water flow meters at different points where the water consumption was required to measure at each plant the introduction of best management practices such as floor comprised of improved washing of floor and vessels application of engineering controls including pressure gun for vessel washing reuse of first wash from vessels for the next product manufacturing batch at p ii the final wash was reused for recharging of spray dryer at p iii direct reuse of cooling water ejected from vessel s jacket as a feed water in cooling tower direct reuse of reverse osmosis ro concentrates without any treatment for non process activities after applying all bats reduction in water consumption and effluent generation from each activity along with combined industrial units was calculated in percent as follows c o n s u m p t i o n r e d u c t i o n c o n s u m p t i o n m e a s u

technologies a electrocoagulation ec and b horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssf cws were employed ec was opted for the treatment of effluent coming from p i and p ii units whereas hssf cws were designed for p iii effluent initially ec was also tested for p iii effluent but the presence of a high concentration of electrolytes disrupt the experiment hence unsuccessful the hffs cws are employed as a successful alternative option for p iii both ec and hssf cws were first tested at the laboratory scale and then applied at the pilot scale the detail description of sampling and laboratory and pilot scale setup is given below 2 3 1 sampling methods for wastewater three sampling locations were selected for wastewater collection the location i comprised of combined effluent of p i p ii location ii for the effluent of p iii and location iii for combined effluent of p i ii and p iii discharged into the drain fig 1 sampling was performed in two phases during the first phase a baseline was developed to understand the characteristic of the effluent for this purpose a total of 72 composite samples 24 from each sampling location were collected on a daily basis in amber glass bottles of 500 ml after collection samples were immediately transported to the quality assurance laboratory of the industry for analysis of physicochemical parameters in the second phase the same numbers 72 of composite samples of effluent from the each of the three locations were collected after the implementation of all batss for water conservation as well as after applying wastewater treatment after the maximum activities of all plants the effluent was first collected in a collection tank to equalize the wastewater concentration the collected samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters 2 3 2 analytical work all samples were brought to the quality assurance laboratory and the physicochemical parameters such as ph tds tss cod and electrical conductivity were measured before and after the treatment with two wastewater treatment technologies viz electrocoagulation and horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands the ph tds and electrical conductivity of wastewater were determined by using a multi meter model hanna hi 9811 5 apha method 2005 was used to measure the concentration of tds and cod the effluent flow was measured using water flow meter at the effluent drain originating from the location i and location ii of three production units the removal efficiencies of the pollutants in the wastewater were determined by using the following formula r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y r c o c t c o 100 where co initial concentration and ct final concentration 2 3 3 experimental setup for ec 2 3 3 1 lab scale setup an ec plant made of perspex material with a dimension in meters of 0 2 l 0 1 w 0 27 h was developed on lab scale two aluminum and two iron electrodes with dimensions of 23 cm height 1 cm diameter were used as anode and cathode respectively in the reaction chamber space between anode and cathode was set at 4 cm a direct current dc power supply using the solar cell was applied to operate the cell 35 41 the schematic diagram of the electrocoagulation unit is provided in fig 2 the experiment was performed by adding one liter of wastewater in the lab scale ec unit this unit was given an agitation system with a magnetic stirrer to equalize the effluent during treatment dc supply was given to the system which took 3 amperes initially and reduced to 0 5 amperes after 3 min the whole process was continued for 10 min and an additional 10 min were given for settling of suspended coagulates the treated samples were then subjected to filtration and sent to the laboratory for the analysis of water parameters 2 3 3 2 pilot scale setup after successful lab scale operation a pilot scale ec plant was constructed on the basis of lab scale design criteria table 1 fig 2 the electrocoagulation cell was made up of perspex material having a length width and height of 0 7 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m a total of 10 aluminum and iron electrodes were used pilot scale setup with a distance of 5 3 cm between anodes and cathodes to run the process dc power supply was applied through solar cell effluent from p i and p ii was first collected in an equalization tank of 200 l and subsequently introduced into the pilot scale ec unit a stong agitation was given with a mechanical rotating agitator dc power supply of 14 amperes current was applied initially that reduced to 5 to 3 amperes after 8 10 min the surface of the electrodes was first scrubbed with abrasive paper followed by rinsing with purified water and drying before dipping into the tank the reaction was allowed to continue for 25 min a cloth filtration assembly of 253 cm3 was connected with reaction chamber for the final filtration process the final filtrate was analyzed for quality parameters in a quality assurance laboratory the details of both lab and pilot scale setup of ec are provided in table 1 2 3 4 experimental setup for hssf cw plant 2 3 4 1 lab scale setup for p iii effluent where ec was not successful because of the presence of electrolytes in excess two horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands were designed at lab scale lab scale hssf cws setup made up of high density polyethylene was placed outside the research and development laboratory of the industry where the approach of sunlight was adequate the indignious plant species typha latifolia was grown in the constructed wetland for the effective removal of pollutants the substrate materials used to support and grow the plants were gravel sand lime and clay gravel formed the outer lining of the constructed wetlands from sidewalls and the base followed by a lining of sand and clay used in the center of wetland to provide anchorage and nutrients to the plants a slope of 10 was adjusted to for both cellsto allow the continuous flow of wastewater through the constructed wetlands fig 3 the length width and height of all wetlands were 0 45 m 0 24 m and 0 26 m respectivelywith a total surface area of 0 108 m2 the hydraulic retention time was kept 5 days for the whole unit 32 final filtration was performed to remove the dirt material from the treated wastewater experiments were performed for 2 months 8 weeks in order to evalute the removal efficiency of the system the detail criteria of cws are provided in table 2 the samples were taken every week and analyzed for physiochemical parameters to investigate the treatment efficiency 2 3 4 2 pilot scale setup pilot scale hssf cws model for wastewater treatment of p iii effluent was constructed outside the p iii plant on the basis of successful design and operation of lab scale setup table 2 two of the same size rectangular shaped wetlands made up of high density polyethylene with dimensions of 1 3 m 1 m 0 75 m length width height and surface area 0 98 m2 were constructed the hydrophyte typha latifolia was grown in both wetlands a slope of 10 was set for both units to allow the continuous flow of wastewater the substrate materials used in both wetlands were gravel followed by sand and clay fig 3 42 before the treatment freshwater was passed through the constructed wetland for period of 4 weeks for the natural growth of hydrophytes 43 the wastewater from the drainage pipe of p iii was first collected in a container for one week then was pumped into the first unit of cws this process was performed for 8 weeks until the best results were obtained the hydraulic retention time of wastewater was given for 5 days the details of both lab and pilot scale constructed wetland setup are provided in table 1 the samples were collected from the outlet pipe of the second wetland after filtration for each experiment and the removal efficiency of different parameters was measured in the laboratory 3 results and discussion 3 1 reductions through water conservation strategies in this study the first step was to develop the baseline of effluent characteristics and water consumption of all production units fig 4 illustrates the initial result of the analysis conducted to investigate the pollution load at all sampling locations prior to any treatment the values of cod and tss at location iii were 4925 mg l and 1461 mg l respectively which were fairly higher than corresponding values of 2025 mg l 420 mg l at location i and and 3005 mg l 396 mg l at location ii respectively this was expected because the combined drain of all three units has a greater pollution load compared to location i and ii seperately conversly the values of tds and conductivity varied unevenly between the locations possibly because of dilution factor and distance from the source therefore it was decided to apply at source separate treatment for wastewater at locations i and ii to get the effluent treated easily instead of applying treatment at the end of the channel containing the combined drain from p i ii and iii secondly water flow meters were installed to measure all water consumption areas and effluent flow keeping in view the results of water consumption at all units bats were applied to reduce the usage of water which led to decrease wastewater discharge at the end of each industrial unit table 3 shows the two different categories for water consumption i e process and non process water the consumption of process softened water at p ii was very high 11 m3 month compared to p i 1 m3 month whereas no softened water was used in p iii processes because this unit is used for dry powder mixing and final product is in dry form our primary focus was to cut down the consumption of non process water after application of bats the consumption of water for vessel washing was reduced for p i p ii and p iii plants from 11 5 5 m3 month to 9 3 3 m3 month floor washing was reduced to 6 2 2 m3 month to 3 1 1 m3 month and spray dryer washing which was the only part of p iii reduced from 3 to 1 5 m3 month table 3 before application of bats 2 m3 month of cooling water was drained out from jacket in reaction vessels of p ii this system was modified by the direct reuse of cooling water into the cooling tower as feed water but some loss of water was calculated as 0 5 m3 month of blow down and 0 5 m3 month of evaporation the total consumption of water was reduced from 48 m3 month to 34 5 m3 month which corresponds to 28 1 reduction in overall water usage table 3 in a recent study about 46 reduction in water consumption has been obtained in a chemical industry through application of bats and process alterations that result in both increased environmental performance and profitability 13 further many previous studies measured a reduction in water consumption between 20 50 using best available techniques 11 12 19 21 40 the differences in water consumption reduction is mainly associated with type of industrial sectors as well as efficiency and implementation of bats before application of bats reverse osmosis process of water filtration operates with a recovery of 55 60 while 45 40 concentrate which accounts for 13 m3 month water was directly discharged to the wastewater channels the concentrate was reused in the plants for washing purposes consequently producing 5 m3 month effluent table 3 past literature showed that ro concentrate on the values of 70 80 can be directly reused in various industrial applications 44 effluent reduction from other sources including rejection of cooling water from vessel jacket vessel washing floor and spray dryier washing were from 2 2110 and 3 m3 month to 0 5 15 5 1 5 m3 month at p i p ii and p iii respectively the total effluent was reduced from 49 m3 month to 27 m3 month which accounts for 44 8 of reduction from p i p ii and p iii table 3 past literature suggested a range from 35 to 50 reduction in effluent generation can be obtained through the use of bat 19 21 40 however like water consumption effluent reduction also varied in different inductries as well as efficiency and implementation of bats 3 2 laboratory and pilot scale effluent treatment by electrocoagulation ec after water conservation the already reduced effluent from p i p ii and p iii needed treatment before it is drained into nullah for this purpose electrocoagulation ec setup was established first in the laboratory and then on pilot scale table 4 illustrate the before and after electrocoagulation treatment results of lab scale analysis of samples taken from location i finally the results of treated effluent were compared with the national environmental quality standards neqs and found under permissible range the effluent had the ph within the neqs range and was suitable for ec treatment therefore ph was not neutralized 35 the removal efficiency of other selected parameters obtained through lab scale ec treatment were 93 58 for cod 43 23 for tds 55 48 for tss and 35 42 for conductivity respectively table 4 in an experimental setup the removal efficiency was 76 9 using stainless steel while it was 50 using fe electrodes 45 however we obtained quite higher removal efficiency using the aluminum electrode further electrocoagulation is proven as better over chemical coagulation by achieving 93 1 removal efficiency of cod in textile wastewater through electrocoagulation followed by 40 in the latter case however when chemical and electrocoagulation were applied together 98 cod removal efficiency was achieved 46 our result for cod removal efficiency at laboratory scale electrocoagulation was excellent as it brings the cod values less than the neqs limit therefore we replicate the laboratory scale electrocoagulation experiment with some modifications at pilot scale after the successful application of ec at lab scale a pilot scale ec setup was established for pi and pii effluent table 5 show the results of the physicochemical parameter for the pilot scale ec plant for both lab and pilot scale treatment the removal efficiency of cod was 93 58 and 92 84 respectively with the initial effluent value of 2025 mg l showing no significant differences between lab and pilot scale application of ec for the combined wastewater of p i and p ii the obtained cod value of 145 mg l for combined wastewater of p i and p ii was found within the neqs range previously removal efficiencies of cod at 88 83 and 89 were achieved through electrocoagulation in shipyard wastewater and industrial wastewater respectively 47 48 the removal efficiency of cod in the current study was significantly higher when compared with previous pilot scale studies where ec setup was used with steel and aluminum electrodes achieving cod removal rate of 68 and 58 1 with an initial concentration of 2413 mg l and 2124 mg l respectively 49 in another study on industrial estate wastewater the comparable removal efficiency of 92 was obtained for cod at best experimental conditions 50 similarly the removal efficiencies were 37 97 53 57 and 33 58 for tds tss and conductivity with the final values of 3300 mg l 195 mg l and 252 obtained respectively values of all the parameters for the combined effluent of p i and p ii subjected to pilot scale electrocoagulation were within the neqs limits hence this treated water was reused in the plant one of the important factors in electrocoagulation is the current density which is usually 1 3 amperes 48 in this study we used a solar cell which initially supplied with 5 amperes but it gradually decreases upto 3 amperes and maintains a current density of 2 3 amperes during the experiment at this current density maximum removal efficiencies were obtained in the current study which is in accordance with previous studies 45 48 like laboratory scale experiment for electrocoagulation our pilot scale experiment was also successful as it brings values of cod and other parameters below the neqs limits 3 3 laboratory scale effluent treatment of p iii by ec similar to p i and p ii a lab scale electrocoagulation system was developed for the treatment of effluent of p iii table 6 represent the results for the application of lab scale electrocoagulation for p iii effluent the removal efficiency for cod tds and tss were 35 60 27 77 and 21 96 respectively which was too low than it was required to meet the neqs after treatment all of these parameters showed the values far higher than neqs limits table 6 hence application of lab scale electrocoagulation was proved unsuccessful for the effluent of p iii similar to the results of current findings relatively lower removal efficiencies of cod have been reported in the literature 45 46 it is observed that effluent of p iii contained some acidic salts like ammonium chloride ammonium sulfate and organic acids such as citric acid and tartaric acid therefore p iii effluent has a high concentration of electrolytes which created more ions to react with anode resulting in the creation of electrons and produced high backflow of electric current which interrupted the working of ec setup hence desired results were not achieved for p iii effluent using ec 51 52 because of low removal efficiency for all parameters trough electrocoagulation the horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands hccf cws were used as an alternative sustainable treatment technology for p iii effluent 3 4 laboratory and pilot scale effluent treatment of p iii by hssf cws a lab scale hssf cws setup was established for the treatment of p iii effluent initially freshwater was introduced in the hssf cws for the settlement of substrate materials and growth of plants as a modification of the process described earlier 28 53 after one week the first batch of effluent was discharged in hssf cws and physicochemical parameters were measured after a day which showed relatively lower removal efficiency the fresh effluent was discharged into the hssf cws every week to optimize the removal efficiencies the removal efficiency gradually increases from the first week to the 8th week where maximum removal efficiency was obtained table 7 after treating the wastewater through hssf cws the values and cod and other parameters obtained were below the neqs limits after successful achievement the same experiment was repeated for pilot scale study with necessary modifications in terms of comparison the removal efficiency of cod at lab and pilot scale was recorded as 95 48 and 95 43 in the 8th week which reflects the suitability of hssf cws for the efficient removal of cod table 8 the cod removal efficiencies of the current study were comparable to previous reports for the treatment of wastewater through hssf cws 28 54 57 the value obtained for cod removal of both lab scale and pilot scale was 135 mg l and 137 mg l respectively which falls under the neqs limits set for industrial effluents one of the important factors for obtaining maximum removal efficiency is the selection of plant species used in the constructed wetland cws we use typha latifolia plants which have been proven as best species for cod and pollutants removal from wastewater 58 59 tds removal efficiency obtained at lab scale was 34 10 which was a little higher than 37 59 measured for pilot scale treatment however both tds values obtained after treatment at the lab and pilot scale fall under the neqs permissible range similarly the removal efficiency of tss and electrical conductivity was 53 07 and 9 83 at the lab and 51 52 and 8 65 and pilot scale like cod the obtained values of these parameters after treatment were found within the neqs range the values of parameters obtained through hssf cws were found in accordance with previous reports 33 59 therefore we deduced that the use of constructed wetland for the removal of tds and tss using macrophytes such as typha latifolia is the best option because large root network of plants increases the area for microbial attachment decreases the water velocity as well as helps in settling and filtration of dissolved and suspended particles 60 61 further the overall results for hssf cws showed that the treated effluent can be reused in the p iii plant the removal efficiency of cod at lab and pilot scale for hssf cws are shown in fig 5 in lab scale experiment the values of cod decrease from 1236 mg l in the first week to 135 mg l in the 8th week while in pilot scale the value of cod decreases from 2019 mg l in the first week to 145 mg l the results of cod removal are remarkably different from ec treatment which was previously applied and remained unsuccessful because of lower removal efficiency table 6 results obtained after using both selected treatment technologies i e ec and hssf cws indicate that the treated wastewater can be the best option for reusing as washing purposes in all plants which leads to the minimization of water consumption further use of both the technologies proved the reduction in effluent generation from p i p ii p iii therefore we recommended that this pilot scale treatment setup has the potential to be used at full scale after required modification and systemization such as collection of effluent to equalization before the treatment and installation filtration assembly for the final filtrate 4 conclusions the current study presented the application of water consumption minimization strategies which has a significant impact on the reduction in wastewater generation from three production units of the leather chemicals industry further cost effective solutions were employed for the treatment of wastewater this study provided the sustainable treatment solutions which can be applied at differentproduction units separately this study provided a strong evidence that electrocoagulation ec is the best option for the treatment of effluents with low concentration of electrolytes whereas the horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands hssf cws are the sustainable alternative options for the effluents containing high concentrations of electrolytes in effluent ofleather chemical industry the results of this research clearly indicate the high removal efficiency of physicochemical parameters from wastewater was obtained by using ec and hssf cws technologies after applying the water conservation and treatment technologies not only the water consumption is reduced but the reuse of treated wastewater in all production plants achieved near zero liquid discharge we recommend thatthese experiments should be replicated in other related industries for sustainable development declaration of
