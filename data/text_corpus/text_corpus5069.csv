25345,what is sustainability sustainability is a concept that can be defined in many ways depending upon a society s perception of current material needs and the actual material needs of future generations much of our ability to achieve sustainability entails developing indicators and measurements that will guide us to this goal this paper suggests that we can strengthen the prediction of sustainability indicators by adopting a multiple equilibria approach for a more effective decision making process in various sectors of the economy in ecosystem protection or in political arenas there is an emerging need for further development of predictive mathematical models of system sustainability over economic growth models for sustainable resource measurement and management the objective of this paper is to use computer modeling and differential equations to simulate the multiple equilibria of a 3 variable real world system in our study we tested the theoretical validity of multiple equilibria sustainability modeling through simulated measurements of precipitation and nitrogen runoff into a hypothetical lake as a quantitative tool to model the multiple equilibria techniques can have tremendous predictive power for business leaders political decision makers and environmental scientists and assist in better management of ecological economic and material resources in short term and long term end use scenarios keywords dynamical systems limits to growth predictive models sustainability multiple equilibria 1 introduction why sustainability is important biophysical sustainability is the process of balancing resource stocks and flows within a dynamical system over time sustainability is a universal necessity because in the natural world an ecosystem thrives on the symbiotic interaction of numerous individual organisms and communities of organisms that depend on each other biologically and ecologically thus an ecosystem dynamically strives to be in equilibrium but often finds itself far from equilibrium in real world scenarios but a system s equilibrium can be constrained by its input availability and its output absorbance capabilities according to fath 2015 meeting input output requirements are necessary but not sufficient conditions for sustainability for ecosystems the input constrains are fundamentally energy and matter flows that manifest themselves in terms of solar radiation global carbon cycle rate of nitrogen cycling rate of hydrological cycle etc the ability of the environment to accept the system output is constrained by the rate of decomposition the rate of accumulation of unwanted by products and the synergistic couplings that allow material reuse the adjacent system receiving output must be a lower gradient than the system generating them making it necessary for the continual renewal of the configurations that emerge out of these flow gradients p 14 so internal dynamics in the ecosystem are just as important as external dynamics over time natural systems either remain sustainable if they are stable and resilient or they become unsustainable if they are fragile or fail to adapt to the dynamics of change a fragile ecosystem is likely to be an unstable ecosystem due to limited resources or weak symbiotic integrations in the system if there is an overshoot of population thresholds with persistent nitrogen deficiencies or resource disruptions fragile system populations will begin to die off and affected species drift toward extinction when a system is stable and or resilient it has a capacity to withstand external stress and disturbances and can quickly recover from systemic shock and return to its original state or an approximate state of functionality lambin 2007 suggests an ecosystem s degree of resilience is often a better indicator of its health than its stability a stable system is often un resilient because it has rigidly protected itself against minor disturbances rather than develop mechanisms for flexibly coping with major disturbances in the language of mathematics the resilience can be described as branching points or bifurcations since when a dynamical system is disturbed it can naturally rebound for better or worse as an ecosystem evolves the ecosystem can be acted upon by disturbances knocking it into two different possible states if both states are stable then the system is robust enough to recover from these external stresses if not then the system is said to be unsustainable to explain the bifurcation process at the macro scale lambin 2007 uses the example of the vast network of dams and sea walls constructed by industrialized countries to protect urban environments from inundation but this process has caused natural soil fertilization to be replaced by sizable amounts of chemical fertilizer excessive runoff can pollute waterways or lead to eutrophication or algal blooms in the regional water systems that possibly feed the red tides and lead to oceanic dead zones in addition when flood waters rise to a height where they can overflow the barriers or they can break once these events take place one must address the tremendous economic ecological and social costs the aftermath of hurricanes rita katrina and sandy are stark examples of how resilience tradeoffs can have devastating impacts under normal circumstances strengthened levees and self sustaining barrier islands wetlands and coastal forests would have acted as buffers against the storm surges minimizing environmental damage and human hardship therefore the notion of sustainability is a strategic endeavor and a vast effort to preserve the human condition on a societal level sustainability involves basic life systems maintenance of diversity stability in providing goods and services basic human needs and intangible human needs and support to reach these objectives sustainability managers may rely on spatial factors household local regional national global temporal factors days months years decades identification of critical sectors government industry community or resources natural synthetic energy identification of the characteristics and sensitivities of groups in society citizens consumers cultures the recognition creation and maintenance of required organizational and institutional structures and the degree of risk acceptable in designing sustainable futures garner 2011 in practice sustainability involves these topical considerations but sustainability indicators and sustainability measurements are also necessary to set goals and determine a relevant course of action it is the development of sustainability indicators that establishes a baseline for measurement and provides mechanisms for targeted application of sustainable technologies 2 the limits to growth model early research on sustainability used the predictive power of computer modeling to simulate how dynamical systems would behave and eventually brought attention to the stress on natural resources by growing human populations and the limited carrying capacity of the earth s ecosystems in the late 1950s mit professor jay forrester established the field of systems dynamics by using mathematical modeling to analyze the behavior of complex engineering and social systems forrester s computer program was designed to simulate a web of complex systems with interactive feedback loops and non linear equations harvey and hallett 1977 jin et al 1995 in 1969 italian business executive aurelio peccei published the book the chasm ahead which predicted that civilization will eventually face limitations to population growth pollution materials and energy since these problems were global peccei believed that these problems should be studied on a global scale he decided to form an interdisciplinary team of eminent scientists and international consultants into a futurist think tank called the club of rome humphrey and buttel 1982 professor forrester s systems dynamics modeling methods used extremely complex mathematical equations that seemed an appropriate tool to study the problems envisioned by peccei in 1970 professor dennis meadows and a small team of researchers at massachusetts institute of technology mit joined forrester who was using his modeling methods to support the club of rome s project on the predicament of mankind this collaboration resulted in the report the limits to growth two years later the limits to growth report identified the complex web of technical economic ecological social and political problems that all countries face and aggregated them to a global level the club of rome s research team chose five basic quantities whose levels indicated essential components to the state of our world system population pollution natural resources agricultural capital or output and industrial capital or output they then established levels and rates of flow along with feedback loops to describe interrelationships among key factors and develop a responsive systems model next the model s mathematical behavior was run through a computer to establish its graphical behavior over the time period 1900 2100 a d the computer model produced what was called the world model standard run harvey and hallett 1977 according to meadows et al 1972 the standard world run made no changes in the historical physical economic and social relationships that governed the development of world systems so the run plotted the five basic quantities from the years 1900 to 1970 but the model goes further by using that existing knowledge of current world systems levels to project these operational levels towards the year 2100 the results revealed that if the quantity levels continued to proceed at the current rates food industrial output and population would grow exponentially until the rapidly diminishing natural resource base would force a slowdown in industrial growth while population and pollution will continue to grow for a while after the peak of industrialization eventually population will start to decline due to increasing death rates once food and medical services decrease as shown in fig 1 although the standard run was alarming and perhaps unrealistic exponential growth it did take stock of global resource quantities and suggest that there is an opportunity for humans to adjust our collective behaviors so the club s mit team ran several alternative simulations of the model in fig 2 these more optimistic runs revealed that if there were unlimited natural resources and a 75 reduction in world pollution human population would reach a larger size than the standard run but eventually begin to decrease due to limits to global food supplies as arable land disappears yet even in this optimistic scenario resources will be depleted in the near future ultimately the mit team came to the conclusion that future conditions were dire in any scenario the model could produce unless there was an emphasis on achieving balance or equilibrium among the main components of world growth this condition would be considered a low or no growth economy and often referred to as the steady state economy where flows of resources into production and pollution of the environment are controlled and stabilized see fig 3 the limits to growth report drew both support for its vision and criticism for its gross generalizations but in the wake of 1973 and 1979 energy crises initiated by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec the study s warning on global limits to natural resources was made more apparent to the general public still economic growth models and mass consumerism are embedded in the prevailing paradigms of cost benefit analysis and the discourse of public policy making economic growth models such as the gross domestic product gdp consumer price index cpi and the stock exchange are commonly recognized as measurement tools that gauge the health of a market economy but these economic and political infrastructures often fail to recognize the limited access and supply of natural capital and ecological systems as foundations of economic prosperity even today it is evident that we live on a planet of finite resources and even though the rate is slowing human population growth is still increasing to have sustainable development into the long term future there needs to be dramatic and deliberate change in social policy around the world about the ideology of unlimited growth ideas about the economic structure of growth and consumption the technical dynamics of societal change and the ecological limits of environmental services provide ready made starting points from which to embark upon a new sustainability agenda for many environmentalists halting economic growth was the key to reversing the suicidal trajectory of the standard run toward exponentially increasing resource use all societies need to have a thriving economic system to remain stable and viable in the long term the steady state economy merely suggest that flows of resources into production and of pollution back into the environmental are kept at a steady level of operation costanza et al 1997 still the steady state economy is more metaphorical than actual no economy will ever be completely stable and unchanging but the goal of the steady state is to create and stay within the parameters of an upper limit and a lower limit of resources use and waste production over a given time period an inventory of resource stocks and an assessment of periodic and aperiodic use of these resources is needed to design a steady state economy that will serve current society s immediate needs while planning for the material needs of future generations therefore long term human sustainability will depend on the global realization that there is an interdependence of all natural resources and that regional sustainability policies will lead to a dynamical stability of the whole earth system over time if we seek to establish and sustain a global steady state economy the second decade of the 21st century appears to be a social paradigm shifting towards a greener economy and sustainable systems management much of this emerging awareness stems from decades of systems modeling that suggest uncontrolled growth in any manner is unsustainable the earth is currently a planet with dwindling natural resources threatened ecosystems and an exponentially expanding materials needy human population how we collectively address persistent and growing human demand for natural and synthetic resources economic goods and ecological services and massive pollution generation will determine the long term survivability of our species much of our ability to achieve sustainability entails developing indicators and measurements that will guide us to this goal we can strengthen the prediction of sustainability indicators by adopting a dynamical systems approach for a more effective decision making process in various sectors of the economy or in political areas such as environmental policy systems saysel et al 2002 we consider the sustainability dynamic a property of a system which allows for a precise mathematical definition that draws on the notions of stability and the robustness of multiple equilibria slow or no growth models as sustainability indicators will begin to gauge the metabolism of a green economy and offer predictive formats that recognize system efficiencies or inefficiencies and recommend necessary adjustments and or appropriate technologies for economic maintenance 3 the theory of multiple equilibria according to shackley 2000 in a system with many interacting variables and feedbacks the relative significance of which cannot be assessed a priori many of which may realistically change on the time and space scales of interest and which are heterogeneous in the sense that they include a wide range of natural and social processes computer or simulation modeling sometimes seems the only viable research strategy this assumption was apparent when we contemplated the approach to be taken in developing sustainability indicators for a troubled and shifting economic system there is an emerging need for further development of predictive mathematical models of system sustainability over economic growth models for sustainable resource measurement and management it is likely that such a stabilizing process would require multiple equilibria models of certain sustainability indicators to achieve the proper policy recommendations and technical proficiency our goal is to explore the possible existence of multiple steady states through using computer simulations and assuming a dynamical systems approach this paper confronts the complex interplay of social economic and ecological conditions that perpetuate over accumulation and waste by charting sustainable alternatives through the process of creating multiple equilibria cerny 2010 loosely defines multiple equilibria as the existence of multiple alternative potential future developmental pathways generated by a system further the effects that generate multiple equilibria create the mathematical possibility of new branching points or bifurcations opening the way to potential path modification and reconstruction of the system itself while the concept of multiple equilibria has its roots in macroeconomic theory and political theory cerny 2010 its theoretical basis is grounded on a predictive dynamical systems approach to sustainability masson 1999 morris and shin 2000 on a practical level long term sustainability is a goal that is difficult to achieve without the systemic integration of ecological economic and social equity factors since there is a process of cooperative and competing interconnections in dynamical polycentric configurations the assumption is that a monocentric equilibrium has its drawbacks the hypothesis is that monocentricity may not be a stable system due to uncertain external factors consequently the development of non monocentric duocentric tricentric polycentric models of sustainability are needed for theoretical completeness and practical usefulness fujita and ogawa 1982 three modeling assumptions simplify this conceptual framework first sustainability fundamentals are about establishing and maintaining equilibrium in a system and second the larger the system the greater the complexity and third complex systems can only be managed with a polycentric multiplicity of equilibria the challenge for modelers is to identify the essential factors creating equilibrium in all components of a complex system further there may be different types of equilibria that can model such complex systems multiple equilibria much like magnetism acts like mutual induction to create sustainable systems dynamics see fig 4 this process is similar to synergism where positive utility exceeds negative utility because of the preponderance of positive mutualistic relations in the system fath 2004 4 modeling multiple equilibria as a quantitative tool the goal of modeling the multiple equilibria technique is to provide predictive power for business leaders political decision makers and environmental scientists and assist in better management of ecological economic and material resources in short term and long term sustainability scenarios jiang and shi 1995 in this section we use computer modeling to simulate dynamical systems of a three 3 variable real world system we make explicit the simulation of sustainability by providing a hypothetical example of the cyclical rainfall and nitrogen runoff into a typical lake we used a set of first order non linear differential equations known collectively as lotka and volterras prey predator models to simulate a dynamical system of relationships among three variables maheshwari et al 2014 these types of equations offer a mathematical description of the cooperation and competition dynamics between species or in our application variables in sustainability models bennett and neil 2013 bettge 2009 our simulation illustrates that the application of nitrogens the amount of precipitation and the pollution of a lake can be managed sustainability each factor can be considered a system component with its own internal balance or equilibrium threshold each equilibrium threshold is dependent on its relationship to equilibrium points in the systems evolution equilibrium points can provide a stability analysis through a fixed point in the system any perturbation can lead an equilibrium point from stable to unstable and vice versa depending on the values of the parameters maheshwari et al 2014 simulating the process of multiple equilibria provides a tricentric predictive tool for modeling sustainability all non linear prey predator models share an important feature competition among species whose cooperative behavior can lead to an environment of mutual benefit these are regions of stability are imposed mathematical conditions on the set of parameters when these conditions are not satisfied it can lead to unrealistic or unwanted behavior such as the extinction of a predator with an exponential growth of prey or predators with an unlimited supply of prey one type of attractor the limit cycle allows for a manageable dynamical system but we must also include bifurcations if we require robustness or multiple equilibria nestler et al 2010 hence we require all species to survive competitively and cooperative environment of stability in our prey predator model for sustainability we will base our sustainability model on the work of may and leonard in order to demonstrate these features for any dynamical systems model of sustainability may and leonard 1975 the model has three sustainability indicators which we denote by x y and z we assume that the time rate change in an indicator x is proportional to its size and that any two indicators can interact through a non linear coupling term xy our model consists of three first order non linear differential equations in terms of the sustainability indicators and the two parameters α and β dx dt x 1 x α y β z dy dt y 1 β x y α z dz dt z 1 α x β y z in fig 5 the stocks represent the sustainability indicators as boxes and the right hand side of these set of equations represents the flows as double arrows in may and leonard s analysis there are eight possible fixed point equilibria that represent eight stable states in a three dimensional state space these are 0 0 0 three single solutions of the form 1 0 0 three solutions of the form 1 α 1 β 0 1 αβ and the point 1 1 1 1 α β however we are interested in the dynamical systems whose solutions are limit cycles first the number of parameters can be reduced to two where symmetry of the system has been exploited second their analysis and important here shows that the parameters can be related by the limit cycle condition α β 2 the parameters α and β divide the parameter space into three regions of stability it is important to realize that these are partly the conditions for sustainability because we also require the system to be stable and resilient under the notion of multiple equilibria we suggest all dynamical systems are unsustainable unless the system entails internal stability and resilience components such as adaptive bifurcations while may and leonard s paper does not address the issue of bifurcations or multiple equilibria it does provide a good starting point for such an investigation to include the resilience of the system however the may and leonard s model is not complete in its description of sustainability while it determines equilibrium at fixed points and limit cycles with mathematical precision sustainable systems are often far from equilibrium requiring additional approaches to modeling ecological stability we merely point the inadequates of models only using a set of first order differential equations without considering them as complex ecosystems now that we have described a general model for multiple equilibria we will now define and discuss as an application a hypothetical model for nitrogen runoff into a lake and the environmental effects of cyclical precipitation see fig 6 runoff x is defined as a surface deposition of chemical fertilizer nitrogen from residential agricultural and or industrial land into the lake rain y is defined as the hydrological cycle of surface water evaporation leading to cloud formation and precipitation lake z is defined as a self contained body of surface water that is the variable recipient of runoff and rain as in any dynamic system model we simplify the nitrogen cycle n and hydrological cycle h2o into the single sustainability indicator runoff and rain respectively in our simulations we set the initial values for the amount of nitrogen runoff x in red to 1 0 the amount of rain y in green to 0 8 and the level of nitrogens in lake z in blue to 0 2 all simulations were produced with numerical data generated by the modeling program netlogo wilensky 1999 to obtain stability we set the values of the parameters so that the limit cycle condition is satisfied let α 0 2 and β 1 8 then we observe a stable limit cycle behavior in the sustainability indicators as shown in fig 7 we note that any initial conditions can be given but exhibit limit cycle behavior only produces a sustainable system initially rain h2o occurs followed by a decreasing flow of nitrogen runoff nh4 and no3 and finally an increasing level of nitrogens in the lake since limit cycle behavior is quasi periodic reversing the values of the parameters allows one to shift one sustainability indicator relative to another in fig 8 we set α 1 8 and β 0 2 where we observe the rain to subside sooner accompanied by a longer period of nitrogen runoff we call this situation sustainable since none of the sustainability indicators vanish or become large un measurable quantities in contrast the system can become unstable or unsustainable when the limit cycle condition is violated unsustainable means that some or all of the sustainability indicators either become an equilibrium point or approach large unmeasurable values any sustainability indicator or set of indicators that vanish is undesirable since the system becomes extinct and thus is unsustainable in particular set α 2 and β 1 then fig 9 corresponds to the equilibrium point 1 0 0 where two of the three sustainability indicators vanish with a persistence level of nitrogens in the lake after a peak in the rain occurs it is unrealistic to have vanishing sustainability indicators because one should always expect a certain level of an indicator in the environment in fig 10 reversing the values of the parameters we observe a peak in nitrogen runoff and vanishing rain with a constant level of water in the lake in figs 11 and 12 the only equilibrium point namely 1 1 1 1 α β has special importance since all the sustainability indicators approach the same non zero value of 0 53 for large times yet one might well expect in general that the values of sustainability indicators be distinct but this would not be an equilibrium point as shown by may and leonard 1975 with these parameters our sustainability model is similar to the steady state run of the limits to growth model but each of the parameters in this model approach different values our model only has three sustainability indicators while the limits to growth model have 5 variables whether using real world data or not the two caveats for this model are 1 we cannot accurately identify or predict the origin of point sources of any sustainability indicator or its quantity and 2 we have neglected other possible causal factors in the environment this sustainability model can however suggest general trends of the sustainability indicators jin et al 1995 in the former caveat a real world data assessment may include nitrogen levels in the lake could be attributed to nearby homes and the home buying habits over the course of a year which change from year to year as well as nitrogen runoff from these homes in the later caveat the increasing levels of nitrogen could arise from other factors such as dead plant matter in the lake detritus or nitrification from acid rain also decreasing levels of nitrogen could be due to other factors such as denitrification from microorganisms in the soil and water we remark that random disruptions to the dynamical system can be modeled as a stochastic differential equation our equations with a noise term but this is outside the scope of this paper in spite of its current limitations this model can serve as a general guide to what constitutes a sustainable manageable system in terms of the societal economic and ecological concerns 5 future research as with the limits to growth model our goal is to simulate possible as well as probable realities the club of rome employed statistical data to model future scenarios based on past information and projecting those patterns into standard runs these runs in turn could be used to simulate different trajectories by manipulating the data while some trajectories were more optimistic than the original standard run all future scenarios suggested inevitable resource exhaustion due to population growth beyond carrying capacity and likely population extinction once resources are exhausted only the steady state model left room for long term sustainability growth in a dynamical system is normal and necessary but unlimited growth in a finite system can be disastrous the multiple equilibria sustainability model takes into consideration the statistical limitations in growth models and simulates probable present to future dynamical behavior using polycentric non linear equations we have seen that limit cycles provide states with both competitive and cooperative behaviors the features for any dynamical system in modeling sustainability certain mathematical relationships between the parameters α β 2 provide the conditions for the presence of limit cycles one possible way to extend these types of models is to require the parameters to be functions of time so that the limit cycle condition is met namely α t β t 2 the coherence validity and trustworthiness of this sustainability model are important for its adoption but it must fit into real world scenarios so further study would be needed to test the strength of the model through empirical research using measurable variables such as local rainfall fertilizer volume nitrogen loading speed of nitrogen movement across impervious surfaces nitrate concentration and urban green space distribution to simulate spatial and temporal fertilizer runoff rates into a lake or bay laband 2005 tsihrintzis et al 1996 the sustainability model can be expanded to include more sustainability indicators variables so a comparison of the model s results to real data is feasible and even the predictions of the limits to growth model the collection and manipulation of physical economic societal biological and chemical data can help develop a more reliable sustainability modeling tool in the future to map multiple equilibria moreover our approach can be expanded to a set of stochastic differential equations to include random disruption of the system if proven to be reliable in its predictions sustainability modeling has significant environmental policy and systems management implications at local and regional levels and possibly be aggregated to a global scale

approach for a more effective decision making process in various sectors of the economy or in political areas such as environmental policy systems saysel et al 2002 we consider the sustainability dynamic a property of a system which allows for a precise mathematical definition that draws on the notions of stability and the robustness of multiple equilibria slow or no growth models as sustainability indicators will begin to gauge the metabolism of a green economy and offer predictive formats that recognize system efficiencies or inefficiencies and recommend necessary adjustments and or appropriate technologies for economic maintenance 3 the theory of multiple equilibria according to shackley 2000 in a system with many interacting variables and feedbacks the relative significance of which cannot be assessed a priori many of which may realistically change on the time and space scales of interest and which are heterogeneous in the sense that they include a wide range of natural and social processes computer or simulation modeling sometimes seems the only viable research strategy this assumption was apparent when we contemplated the approach to be taken in developing sustainability indicators for a troubled and shifting economic system there is an emerging need for further development of predictive mathematical models of system sustainability over economic growth models for sustainable resource measurement and management it is likely that such a stabilizing process would require multiple equilibria models of certain sustainability indicators to achieve the proper policy recommendations and technical proficiency our goal is to explore the possible existence of multiple steady states through using computer simulations and assuming a dynamical systems approach this paper confronts the complex interplay of social economic and ecological conditions that perpetuate over accumulation and waste by charting sustainable alternatives through the process of creating multiple equilibria cerny 2010 loosely defines multiple equilibria as the existence of multiple alternative potential future developmental pathways generated by a system further the effects that generate multiple equilibria create the mathematical possibility of new branching points or bifurcations opening the way to potential path modification and reconstruction of the system itself while the concept of multiple equilibria has its roots in macroeconomic theory and political theory cerny 2010 its theoretical basis is grounded on a predictive dynamical systems approach to sustainability masson 1999 morris and shin 2000 on a practical level long term sustainability is a goal that is difficult to achieve without the systemic integration of ecological economic and social equity factors since there is a process of cooperative and competing interconnections in dynamical polycentric configurations the assumption is that a monocentric equilibrium has its drawbacks the hypothesis is that monocentricity may not be a stable system due to uncertain external factors consequently the development of non monocentric duocentric tricentric polycentric models of sustainability are needed for theoretical completeness and practical usefulness fujita and ogawa 1982 three modeling assumptions simplify this conceptual framework first sustainability fundamentals are about establishing and maintaining equilibrium in a system and second the larger the system the greater the complexity and third complex systems can only be managed with a polycentric multiplicity of equilibria the challenge for modelers is to identify the essential factors creating equilibrium in all components of a complex system further there may be different types of equilibria that can model such complex systems multiple equilibria much like magnetism acts like mutual induction to create sustainable systems dynamics see fig 4 this process is similar to synergism where positive utility exceeds negative utility because of the preponderance of positive mutualistic relations in the system fath 2004 4 modeling multiple equilibria as a quantitative tool the goal of modeling the multiple equilibria technique is to provide predictive power for business leaders political decision makers and environmental scientists and assist in better management of ecological economic and material resources in short term and long term sustainability scenarios jiang and shi 1995 in this section we use computer modeling to simulate dynamical systems of a three 3 variable real world system we make explicit the simulation of sustainability by providing a hypothetical example of the cyclical rainfall and nitrogen runoff into a typical lake we used a set of first order non linear differential equations known collectively as lotka and volterras prey predator models to simulate a dynamical system of relationships among three variables maheshwari et al 2014 these types of equations offer a mathematical description of the cooperation and competition dynamics between species or in our application variables in sustainability models bennett and neil 2013 bettge 2009 our simulation illustrates that the application of nitrogens the amount of precipitation and the pollution of a lake can be managed sustainability each factor can be considered a system component with its own internal balance or equilibrium threshold each equilibrium threshold is dependent on its relationship to equilibrium points in the systems evolution equilibrium points can provide a stability analysis through a fixed point in the system any perturbation can lead an equilibrium point from stable to unstable and vice versa depending on the values of the parameters maheshwari et al 2014 simulating the process of multiple equilibria provides a tricentric predictive tool for modeling sustainability all non linear prey predator models share an important feature competition among species whose cooperative behavior can lead to an environment of mutual benefit these are regions of stability are imposed mathematical conditions on the set of parameters when these conditions are not satisfied it can lead to unrealistic or unwanted behavior such as the extinction of a predator with an exponential growth of prey or predators with an unlimited supply of prey one type of attractor the limit cycle allows for a manageable dynamical system but we must also include bifurcations if we require robustness or multiple equilibria nestler et al 2010 hence we require all species to survive competitively and cooperative environment of stability in our prey predator model for sustainability we will base our sustainability model on the work of may and leonard in order to demonstrate these features for any dynamical systems model of sustainability may and leonard 1975 the model has three sustainability indicators which we denote by x y and z we assume that the time rate change in an indicator x is proportional to its size and that any two indicators can interact through a non linear coupling term xy our model consists of three first order non linear differential equations in terms of the sustainability indicators and the two parameters α and β dx dt x 1 x α y β z dy dt y 1 β x y α z dz dt z 1 α x β y z in fig 5 the stocks represent the sustainability indicators as boxes and the right hand side of these set of equations represents the flows as double arrows in may and leonard s analysis there are eight possible fixed point equilibria that represent eight stable states in a three dimensional state space these are 0 0 0 three single solutions of the form 1 0 0 three solutions of the form 1 α 1 β 0 1 αβ and the point 1 1 1 1 α β however we are interested in the dynamical systems whose solutions are limit cycles first the number of parameters can be reduced to two where symmetry of the system has been exploited second their analysis and important here shows that the parameters can be related by the limit cycle condition α β 2 the parameters α and β divide the parameter space into three regions of stability it is important to realize that these are partly the conditions for sustainability because we also require the system to be stable and resilient under the notion of multiple equilibria we suggest all dynamical systems are unsustainable unless the system entails internal stability and resilience components such as adaptive bifurcations while may and leonard s paper does not address the issue of bifurcations or multiple equilibria it does provide a good starting point for such an investigation to include the resilience of the system however the may and leonard s model is not complete in its description of sustainability while it determines equilibrium at fixed points and limit cycles with mathematical precision sustainable systems are often far from equilibrium requiring additional approaches to modeling ecological stability we merely point the inadequates of models only using a set of first order differential equations without considering them as complex ecosystems now that we have described a general model for multiple equilibria we will now define and discuss as an application a hypothetical model for nitrogen runoff into a lake and the environmental effects of cyclical precipitation see fig 6 runoff x is defined as a surface deposition of chemical fertilizer nitrogen from residential agricultural and or industrial land into the lake rain y is defined as the hydrological cycle of surface water evaporation leading to cloud formation and precipitation lake z is defined as a self contained body of surface water that is the variable recipient of runoff and rain as in any dynamic system model we simplify the nitrogen cycle n and hydrological cycle h2o into the single sustainability indicator runoff and rain respectively in our simulations we set the initial values for the amount of nitrogen runoff x in red to 1 0 the amount of rain y in green to 0 8 and the level of nitrogens in lake z in blue to 0 2 all simulations were produced with numerical data generated by the modeling program netlogo wilensky 1999 to obtain stability we set the values of the parameters so that the limit cycle condition is satisfied let α 0 2 and β 1 8 then we observe a stable limit cycle behavior in the sustainability indicators as shown in fig 7 we note that any initial conditions can be given but exhibit limit cycle behavior only produces a sustainable system initially rain h2o occurs followed by a decreasing flow of nitrogen runoff nh4 and no3 and finally an increasing level of nitrogens in the lake since limit cycle behavior is quasi periodic reversing the values of the parameters allows one to shift one sustainability indicator relative to another in fig 8 we set α 1 8 and β 0 2 where we observe the rain to subside sooner accompanied by a longer period of nitrogen runoff we call this situation sustainable since none of the sustainability indicators vanish or become large un measurable quantities in contrast the system can become unstable or unsustainable when the limit cycle condition is violated unsustainable means that some or all of the sustainability indicators either become an equilibrium point or approach large unmeasurable values any sustainability indicator or set of indicators that vanish is undesirable since the system becomes extinct and thus is unsustainable in particular set α 2 and β 1 then fig 9 corresponds to the equilibrium point 1 0 0 where two of the three sustainability indicators vanish with a persistence level of nitrogens in the lake after a peak in the rain occurs it is unrealistic to have vanishing sustainability indicators because one should always expect a certain level of an indicator in the environment in fig 10 reversing the values of the parameters we observe a peak in nitrogen runoff and vanishing rain with a constant level of water in the lake in figs 11 and 12 the only equilibrium point namely 1 1 1 1 α β has special importance since all the sustainability indicators approach the same non zero value of 0 53 for large times yet one might well expect in general that the values of sustainability indicators be distinct but this would not be an equilibrium point as shown by may and leonard 1975 with these parameters our sustainability model is similar to the steady state run of the limits to growth model but each of the parameters in this model approach different values our model only has three sustainability indicators while the limits to growth model have 5 variables whether using real world data or not the two caveats for this model are 1 we cannot accurately identify or predict the origin of point sources of any sustainability indicator or its quantity and 2 we have neglected other possible causal factors in the environment this sustainability model can however suggest general trends of the sustainability indicators jin et al 1995 in the former caveat a real world data assessment may include nitrogen levels in the lake could be attributed to nearby homes and the home buying habits over the course of a year which change from year to year as well as nitrogen runoff from these homes in the later caveat the increasing levels of nitrogen could arise from other factors such as dead plant matter in the lake detritus or nitrification from acid rain also decreasing levels of nitrogen could be due to other factors such as denitrification from microorganisms in the soil and water we remark that random disruptions to the dynamical system can be modeled as a stochastic differential equation our equations with a noise term but this is outside the scope of this paper in spite of its current limitations this model can serve as a general guide to what constitutes a sustainable manageable system in terms of the societal economic and ecological concerns 5 future research as with the limits to growth model our goal is to simulate possible as well as probable realities the club of rome employed statistical data to model future scenarios based on past information and projecting those patterns into standard runs these runs in turn could be used to simulate different trajectories by manipulating the data while some trajectories were more optimistic than the original standard run all future scenarios suggested inevitable resource exhaustion due to population growth beyond carrying capacity and likely population extinction once resources are exhausted only the steady state model left room for long term sustainability growth in a dynamical system is normal and necessary but unlimited growth in a finite system can be disastrous the multiple equilibria sustainability model takes into consideration the statistical limitations in growth models and simulates probable present to future dynamical behavior using polycentric non linear equations we have seen that limit cycles provide states with both competitive and cooperative behaviors the features for any dynamical system in modeling sustainability certain mathematical relationships between the parameters α β 2 provide the conditions for the presence of limit cycles one possible way to extend these types of models is to require the parameters to be functions of time so that the limit cycle condition is met namely α t β t 2 the coherence validity and trustworthiness of this sustainability model are important for its adoption but it must fit into real world scenarios so further study would be needed to test the strength of the model through empirical research using measurable variables such as local rainfall fertilizer volume nitrogen loading speed of nitrogen movement across impervious surfaces nitrate concentration and urban green space distribution to simulate spatial and temporal fertilizer runoff rates into a lake or bay laband 2005 tsihrintzis et al 1996 the sustainability model can be expanded to include more sustainability indicators variables so a comparison of the model s results to real data is feasible and even the predictions of the limits to growth model the collection and manipulation of physical economic societal biological and chemical data can help develop a more reliable sustainability modeling tool in the future to map multiple equilibria moreover our approach can be expanded to a set of stochastic differential equations to include random disruption of the system if proven to be reliable in its predictions sustainability modeling has significant environmental policy and systems management implications at local and regional levels and possibly be aggregated to a global scale 
25346,regulated rivers below dams have traditionally been managed using a minimum instream flow to provide adequate aquatic habitat however dam management in conjunction with changes in climate and land use challenges downstream ecosystem functions that cannot be properly addressed by a simple minimum flow requirement depending upon the river system additional parameters such as water temperature and nutrient loading provide more critical ecological value for organisms than ensuring a constant minimum release a new modelling methodology utilizing a cascading hierarchical approach is proposed and tested on a 614km2 headwater basin in central idaho usa application of the methodology illustrates that below large dams the river discharge becomes independent of the seasonal hydrology and specifying the discharge alone is insufficient for evaluating ecosystem response upstream reservoirs interrupt the watershed continuum and internally modify the thermal chemical and biological properties of water prior to release into a downstream river these water properties depend on the annual hydrologic regime characteristics of the reservoir and the offtake strategies offtake structure depth dam discharge and the water column thermal stratification this study describes the use of climatically driven hydrologic forcing and variable dam operations in a coupled reservoir river system to optimize river ecosystem health by linking physical processes with in situ observations and incorporating multi trophic species requirements such an approach can support real time decision making on existing reservoir river systems and provide a virtual means of evaluating ecosystem impacts prior to disturbance from new dam construction or implementation of restoration activities in a watershed keywords reservoir river ecosystem aem3d mike 11 hydrologic regimes water operations 1 introduction in recent years three major sources of change have impacted ecological communities in river systems first large reservoirs 107 109 m3 cf graf 2005 interrupt the natural pattern of flow and longitudinal connectivity disrupting fish migration temperature and nutrient regimes as well as timing and magnitude of peak and low flows in brief reservoirs act to create new boundary conditions for downstream rivers ward and stanford 1982 nilsson et al 2005 magilligan and nislow 2005 graf 2006 vinson 2001 konrad et al 2011 powers et al 2014 yin et al 2015 second land use changes alter both the precipitation andrich and imberger 2013 and the resultant runoff characteristics molina et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 deng et al 2016 third global warming has been observed to impact both the geographic distribution of precipitation and its variability hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 luce and holden 2009 merz et al 2011 combined these external changes increase the ecological challenges faced by water resource managers concerned with optimizing reservoir and river systems for multiple beneficial uses nilsson et al 2005 poff et al 2010 naiman and dudgeon 2011 gillespie et al 2015 reservoir operations and downstream flow modifications have been considered detrimental to many native ecosystems ward and stanford 1982 poff and zimmerman 2010 and minimum instream flow regulations were imposed on dam operations to counter these negative effects bovee et al 1998 magilligan and nislow 2005 instream flows were traditionally determined by historic channel cross sections and discharge conditions often based on very short observation periods these regulations were implemented irrespective of land clearing global warming reservoir offtake level or ecological system cues alternatively environmental flows aim to achieve the best attainable ecological conditions for individual river systems by utilizing reservoir operational flexibility bunn and arthington 2002 brierley and fryirs 2009 acreman and ferguson 2010 poff and zimmerman 2010 environmental flows go beyond minimum instream flow conditions by accounting for parameters such as discharge variability water temperature nutrient concentrations and substrate stability which are equally important for riverine ecosystems and must be collectively tailored to the needs of the particular river basin under consideration power et al 1996 wootton et al 1996 therefore a new holistic approach is required for reservoir river systems where all the above changes in river properties brought about by land use changes and global warming are viewed as inputs to the reservoir river ecology ecological systems can then be evaluated with respect to the primary reservoir function such as hydropower or bulk water supply but also the water properties discharged to the downstream river for aquatic and riparian productivity yin and yang 2011 yin et al 2015 the reservoir thermal structure determines the internal physical chemical and biological processes that dictate the properties of the outflowing water and determine the boundary conditions for the downstream river s ward 1974 vinson 2001 marti et al 2016 furthermore the thermal chemical and biological processes in the reservoir river system are strongly influenced by the annual hydrologic regime wet vs dry complicating prediction of downstream ecosystem response konrad et al 2011 given the primary function of the reservoir and composition of the downstream ecosystem effective river management depends on understanding the internal reservoir dynamics flexibility of dam operations and potential geomorphic and biochemical interactions it is important to stress that for a reservoir river system where the reservoir discharge is determined by contractual demand for electricity production bulk water or irrigation delivery new hydraulic regimes are imposed on the downstream river that are independent of hydrologic factors once the river discharge regime and water temperature become disconnected from the natural catchment hydrology the sustainability of the original aquatic ecology is drawn into question vinson 2001 in light of these challenges this work investigates how a systems approach to reservoir river modelling can identify the potential ecological impacts of changing the downstream river discharge boundary conditions by optimizing the physical and biogeochemical properties of the discharge water providing water managers with a real time adaptive coupled reservoir catchment river modelling system to improve downstream ecological conditions lett et al 2008 d agostini et al 2015 marti and imberger 2015 garcia garcia et al 2016 the modelling framework forming the foundation of such a rational approach is still in its infancy so benchmark studies combining physical and biological responses are necessary to calibrate regional or classification type ecological models arthington et al 2006 predictive hydro ecological models are the future to optimizing beneficial uses in multi objective water resources with associated complex aquatic ecosystems to optimize management decisions on existing reservoir river systems predictive modelling must be combined with real time observations to assimilate current environmental conditions and update the predictive power of the model krause et al 2015 this study presents a set of cascading hierarchical models for the deadwood river basin central idaho usa a complex system of high elevation rivers and creeks divided by a mid watershed reservoir to identify combined impacts of climate driven hydrologic regimes and water operations on the productivity of multiple trophic levels in the basin many modelling and restoration activities address ecological systems separately such as individual reservoirs or intermediate river reaches however cascaded simulations offer insight from a systems approach on how reservoirs react to different hydrologic forcing and dam operations in turn altering downstream conditions of temperature nutrients and productivity bernhardt et al 2005 deus et al 2013 wen et al 2016 cunha santino et al 2017 weigel et al 2017 the current work expands the scope of the investigation beyond singular species of interest or a specific type of ecosystem to show how aquatic ecosystems are spatially linked and driven by the annual hydrologic conditions in the basin to investigate this the thermal and biochemical properties of a reservoir were investigated via a coupled three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic and ecological model to provide downstream boundary conditions under dry average and wet hydrologic forcing to a one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic river model a nutrient mass balance model and a macroinvertebrate regression model these physical and biochemical conditions were collectively evaluated with respect to the five major native fish species found in the river system to assess hydrologic effects of potential climate change and operational control of a reservoir on higher trophic native aquatic species 2 study site the deadwood river basin 614km2 is a north south oriented intrusive valley located in central idaho usa fig 1 the upper basin consists of multiple headwater streams the upper deadwood river and trail creek are the two largest streams that drain into deadwood reservoir near the center of the watershed the lower deadwood river begins at the reservoir dam and runs 38km to the confluence with the south fork payette river the lower river flows through a semi confined canyon with limited discontinuous floodplains along its extent tranmer et al 2015 the river channel is approximately 30m wide and has an average channel gradient of 1 2 although local channel slope fluctuates between 1 and 8 due to geologic constraints channel substrate is dominated by cobbles interspersed with large boulders and sand transport can be significant during irrigation releases and storm events deadwood reservoir draining an area of 287km2 is a large reservoir 12 600m2 with two primary hypolimnetic offtake gates and a volume of 190 million m3 at full pool elevation 1 625 8m deadwood dam 50m tall is operated for flood control and irrigation storage that activates the dam spillway once full pool elevation is achieved directly below the dam a deep stilling basin provides unique river habitat that is conditioned by the upstream reservoir properties and maintains a resident fish population contractual water releases during the summer irrigation season provide steady flows of 27m3 s 1 to the river from june through september that is greater than the approximately 6m3 s 1 that occurred during the unregulated period post irrigation season dam design restricts outflows to high 1 4m3 s 1 or low 0 06m3 s 1 values as a means of managing downstream river conditions at the beginning and end of the irrigation season the primary offtake gates can incrementally ramp stream discharge up or down to modify the flow conditions in the river 3 materials and methods to assess the potential ecological impacts of climate driven hydrologic regimes on the reservoir and downstream river environments a series of operational scenarios were evaluated that represent the spectrum of hydrologic conditions including expected climate change these scenarios encompassed three hydrologic years representing dry average and wet conditions in the basin that correspond to 40 100 and 150 of historic mean reservoir inflow hydrographs for each representative hydrologic year dry average wet were compared with the corresponding unregulated natural no dam flow regime the unregulated flow regime of the river was calculated from measured tributary inputs upstream of the reservoir and collectively used as an upstream boundary condition to the 1d river hydrodynamic model additionally ecological effects of post irrigation dam releases were evaluated using the high 1 4m3 s 1 and low 0 06m3 s 1 options with a fast ramping rate two day change in flow and a slow ramping rate ten day change in flow 3 1 hierarchical conceptual model the study was designed according to a cascaded numerical model approach together with field data in order to assess how impacts translate through the reservoir river ecosystem fig 2 a coupled 3d hydrodynamic ecological model estuary lake and coastal ocean model computational aquatic ecosystem dynamics model aem3d romero et al 2004 silva et al 2014 was implemented for the deadwood reservoir to simulate reservoir hydrodynamic and ecological response to the three hydrologic dry average wet inflow conditions including the post irrigation releases and ramping rates weigel et al 2017 aem3d has been employed in numerous lakes and reservoirs and a review of the coupled model system has recently been performed by trolle et al 2012 outputs from the reservoir model were used as upstream boundary conditions for a 1d hydrodynamic and temperature model mike 11 advection dispersion ad module developed by the danish hydraulic institute of the lower deadwood river below the reservoir marzadri et al 2014 tranmer et al 2015 the mike 11 model was selected due to success in nearby study locations parkinson 2003 loinaz et al 2013 the effects of dam operations on downstream nutrient uptake were evaluated by means of a mass balance model that used the hydraulic outputs from the mike 11 model and measured nutrient concentrations below the dam a macroinvertebrate regression model developed for similar stream conditions in colorado usa mccutchan and lewis 2002 was adapted for the lower deadwood river modeled values of water depth flow velocity and water temperature were examined in the river for the three hydrologic conditions including the post irrigation releases and ramping rates to determine how well native fish preferences tolerances are met and compared with field fish surveys for species presence absence 3 2 deadwood reservoir model the physical and biogeochemical simulations in this study were conducted using aem3d which couples elcom and caedym routines to simulate the hydrodynamics nutrient cycles and food web dynamics in three dimensions hodges et al 2000 silva et al 2014 elcom is a 3d hydrodynamic model based on the numerical solution of the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations using both the boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations the model uses a semi implicit method for free surface evolution a third order euler lagrangian scheme for convective terms an ultimate quickest scheme for the advection of scalars and a numerical diffusion filter that is appropriate for stratified lakes laval et al 2003 elcom does not require calibration because it is physically based and its parameters can be specified from literature values caedym consists of a series of process based partial differential equations that dynamically simulate concentrations of biogeochemical variables accounting for primary and secondary production nutrient cycling oxygen dynamics and sediment water interactions caedym requires specification of several parameters used to simulation the biogeochemical processes but they are also constrained within ranges found in literature elcom and caedym have been described elsewhere in detail hodges et al 2000 laval et al 2003 romero et al 2004 silva et al 2014 the physical model domain of deadwood reservoir was discretized with a uniform horizontal grid of 100m by 100m and a vertical resolution of 1m the model used a time step of 120s extensive field data meteorological inflow scalar variables and initial conditions were collected during the period october 2007 through march 2009 so this period was chosen for model validation the elcom model activated the appropriate algorithms to include atmospheric exchange inflow dynamics turbulent mixing dynamics coriolis forcing and ice formation dynamics oveisy et al 2012 caedym was configured to simulate nitrogen and phosphorus in both particulate and dissolved organic forms and dissolved inorganic forms to include particulate organic nitrogen pon dissolved organic nitrogen don ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 particulate organic phosphorus pop dissolved organic phosphorus dop orthophosphate po4 dissolved oxygen do particulate organic carbon poc dissolved organic carbon doc as well as the four dominant phytoplankton groups observed in the reservoir during the field data collection period dinoflagellates cyanobacteria cryptophytes and diatoms simulated as chlorophyll a with a constant carbon to chlorophyll a ratio elcom parameters relevant to the hydrodynamic processes were not adjusted and minimal adjustment of caedym parameters was performed using literature values or direct estimates within default literature ranges table 1 a detailed description of the configuration of aem3d used here and its validation against water level water temperature dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a for 2007 2009 is presented in detail in usbr 2016 and weigel et al 2017 model performance over the validation period was assessed using the root mean square error rmse as defined by 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n m i s i 2 where mi is the measured variable si is the simulated variable and n is the number of values for water temperature dissolved oxygen concentration and chlorophyll a concentration profiles in the reservoir near the dam wall dea 010 fig 1 rmse were 1 3 c 1 3mgl 1 and 2 0μgl 1 respectively these provide confidence that aem3d simulations could be used to predict the physical and biochemical variables under a range of climate driven hydrologic regimes and water operations and as upstream boundary conditions to the 1d river model tiedemann 2013 for the three hydrologic years with two post irrigation dam releases 0 06m3 s 1 and 1 4m3 s 1 and fast and slow ramping rates the 12 simulations were driven with the same data used for the validation period however initial water levels and inflow and outflow rates reflected the hydrologic year post irrigation releases and ramping up down rates being examined these simulations were run for a period of 14 months starting on november 1 and the results of these scenarios are described in detail in usbr 2016 the parameter values listed in table 1 were the same for the twelve simulations 3 3 lower deadwood river model mike 11 is a 1d hydrodynamic model that solves the unsteady saint venant shallow water equations with a semi explicit finite difference scheme for this study the hydrodynamic model was used in conjunction with the ad module the lower deadwood river model extends 38km from deadwood reservoir to the confluence with the south fork payette river fig 1 and was supported by high resolution 30 m spacing of cross sections which were extracted from the bathymetry generated by an experimental airborne advanced research lidar survey mckean et al 2009 mckean et al 2014 time series of measured outflows and water temperature from the reservoir and field derived stage discharge rating curves were used as upstream and downstream boundary conditions lateral tributary discharges and water temperatures were obtained from measurements at each main tributary see fig 1 meteorological data air temperature relative humidity and sunlight hours per day were used from a nearby weather station bearskin creek calibration and validation of the 1d model for the lower deadwood river were performed for year 2009 using a time step of 4s and are reported in previous publications for both hydraulic and stream temperature modelling marzadri et al 2014 tranmer et al 2015 the calibration of flow resistance utilized a value of manning s n roughness coefficient which it was set equal to 0 06m1 3 s 1 for the entire model domain the canyon like nature of the lower river required shifting the sunlight timing and amount in order to accurately represent the river temperatures tiedemann 2013 the comparison between measured and predicted water surface elevations at low flows near the two ends of the study site resulted in rmse of 20cm rmse of 1 48m3 s 1 and r2 0 98 between measured and predicted flood wave discharges near the confluence with the south fork payette river were reported the comparison between measured and predicted hourly stream water temperatures resulted in rmses of 0 9 1 9 c with error increasing with distance downstream from the dam usbr 2016 the model was run for three hydrologic inflow conditions with two post irrigation dam releases 0 06m3 s 1 and 1 4m3 s 1 and fast and slow ramping rates meteorological data and tributary temperature data used for the calibration period were utilized for each of the hydrologic years times series of measured outflows and simulated water temperatures at the dam outlet using aem3d and a field derived stage discharge rating curve were used as upstream and downstream boundary conditions lateral tributary discharges were adjusted to account for the hydrologic conditions tiedemann 2013 these simulations were repeated for a theoretical unregulated lower deadwood river where discharge and temperature time series used as aem3d inflow inputs to the reservoir were used as direct inputs to the 1d river model to circumvent the reservoir influence 3 4 nutrient chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen sampling data used to characterize nutrient uptake and primary production in the lower deadwood river were collected during the period from 2008 through 2011 total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn dissolved inorganic nitrogen din dissolved orthophosphate dop and discharge data were obtained at three water quality sampling stations fig 1 located in one of the reservoir primary tributaries upper deadwood river dea 102 directly downstream of the dam dea 101 and immediately upstream of the confluence at the lower end of the river dea 108 the data were collected during 2008 with biweekly sampling commencing in the first week of june and ending the first week in october chlorophyll a data were obtained for the same monitoring stations between 2008 and 2011 during 2008 biweekly sampling commenced the first week in june and concluded the first week in october samples were collected about monthly during 2009 beginning in late june and ending in late september sampling began again in early july in 2010 and concluded in early november finally in 2011 monthly sampling started in july and concluded in october periphyton data were collected monthly from june through october 2010 and july through october 2011 at ten sites fig 1 including four located in the regulated lower deadwood river dea 101 dea 113 dea 112 and dea 108 and six in unregulated reference rivers two sites each on the upper deadwood river dea 102 and dea 114 upper south fork payette river not shown and clear creek dea 115 and dea 116 see fig 1 on each sampling date three transects were selected randomly within an established 100 m long sample site at each transect depending on the amount of periphyton present three or four cobble sized rocks were collected and periphyton was scraped within a 58 1cm2 quadrat all samples for a site were pooled and analyzed within 48h for chlorophyll a and ash free dry mass afdm full depth water column profiles of pressure water temperature and dissolved oxygen were collected at a reservoir station near deadwood dam s deep offtake structures and spillway dea 010 depth 35m fig 1 synoptic data were collected through the ice in february 2008 and then biweekly profiling started the first week in june and concluded the first week in october data from the profiles were supplemented with data from one continuous in situ station adjacent to the profiling station dea 010 fig 1 measuring water temperature and dissolved oxygen at different depths nutrient uptake in the river was calculated by means of a mass balance model for the dissolved constituents din and dop by way of example the average uptake of din by primary production in the lower deadwood river was evaluated by assuming all tributaries behaved similarly as follows 2 c r i v e r q r e s c r e s q t r i b s c t r i b s q r e s q t r i b s where c river is the concentration of din in the river mgl 1 c res is the concentration of din input from the reservoir mgl 1 q res is the volumetric discharge from the reservoir m3 s 1 c tribs is the background concentration of din in the monitored tributaries mgl 1 q tribs is the volumetric discharge from the surrounding tributaries m3 s 1 shown in fig 1 chanson 2004 the mass balance model accounts for reservoir and tributary contributions as well as tributary dilution with differences between measured and predicted din concentrations at the confluence with the south fork payette river providing the minimum biological uptake rate 3 5 macroinvertebrate production model simulated water temperatures in the lower deadwood river for each hydrologic year using the 1d river model were used in a temperature dependent macroinvertebrate growth model to estimate secondary productivity within the river the growth model was developed according to the methods of mccutchan and lewis 2002 using macroinvertebrate data collected from june through october 2010 and july through october 2011 at the same 10 sites as the nutrient sampling fig 1 physical habitat was similar among all sample sites for each site macroinvertebrate production for each taxonomic group was estimated over the intervals between sampling dates the instantaneous exponential form of the increment summation method was used to estimate production of taxa that could be identified to species and followed over time as distinct cohorts whereas the instantaneous growth method was used to estimate production of taxa that could not be identified to species or could not be followed over time as distinct cohorts gillespie and benke 1979 the growth rates of non cohort taxa were estimated with a multiple regression equation developed from growth rates of all species in this study that could be followed as cohorts 3 ln g 4 86 0 23 0 155 0 019 t 0 53 0 36 ln w r 2 0 35 where g is the instantaneous growth rate gday 1 t is the average water temperature c over the time interval and w is the mean individual mass g at the start of an interval and the macroinvertebrate production was estimated as follows 4 p g x b x t where p is the macroinvertebrate production gm 2 day 1 g is the growth rate gday 1 calculated for each taxon using eq 3 b is the mean biomass for the taxon over the interval that was collected in the field g t is the number of days in the interval between sampling dates day it should be pointed out that the sampling in the lower deadwood river occurred at four sites in low gradient riffles near the dam and river mouth with no sampling performed in the middle reaches due to inaccessible terrain fig 1 physical substrate and morphology distribution of pools riffles etc may differ in intermediate reaches thereby limiting the accuracy of results however overall trends in productivity should remain similar macroinvertebrate production was calculated for dry average and wet years under scenarios of unregulated high and low dam releases at the four lower deadwood river sites for each scenario the mean modeled hourly water temperature using the river model t for each interval between sampling dates was used with measured mean individual mass w in eq 3 to estimate growth rates for both cohort and non cohort taxa interval production for each taxon was estimated using eq 4 total macroinvertebrate community production for each sampling interval equaled the sum of production for all taxa using these estimates total annual production gm 2 yr 1 was calculated results were averaged across all four sampling sites dea 101 dea 113 dea 112 and dea 108 see fig 1 to provide a representative estimate of macroinvertebrate production within the river 3 6 fish sampling field surveys for fish presence absence in the upper deadwood river and tributaries above the reservoir and lower deadwood river and tributaries below the reservoir extended over a six year period from 2006 to 2011 surveying methods included a combination of weir traps electroshocking gill netting hook and line bag seines and minnow traps native fish species considered in this study were longnose dace rhinichthys cataractae shorthead sculpin cottus confusus mountain whitefish prosopium williamsoni rainbow redband trout oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri and bull trout salvelinus confluentus data on captured fish included location measured fork and total length and weight recaptures for individual fish were only recorded for bull trout 4 results 4 1 lower deadwood river hydraulics the simulated 1d depth and velocity distributions over the lower deadwood river model domain and the frequency histograms of unregulated and regulated discharges for dry average and wet years are illustrated in fig 3 changes in the flow distributions are evident between unregulated and regulated conditions in the river the flows have not reached bankfull level 61m3 s 1 since dam closure tranmer et al 2015 and given the reduction in peak flows river morphology has stabilized over time allowing the river hydraulics to become predictable from year to year minor deviations occur from these predictable conditions during the winter months owing to ice formation and during wet years once the spillway is activated or tributaries experience local rain on snow events in stream values of water depth and velocity as a function of dam operation are largely independent of season or hydrologic inputs and show a high degree of overlap as discharge increases the bimodal distribution of regulated flows fig 3b characterizes the irrigation season releases 27m3 s 1 and the post irrigation releases 1 4m3 s 1 4 2 deadwood reservoir thermal response the reservoir water level changes by up to 15m during the year due to spring inflows and summer withdrawals with peak reservoir elevations typically occurring in mid june and low reservoir elevations in september fig 4 an exception is during wet years when low water can occur any time in the winter or spring as large dam releases must manage reservoir storage capacity for estimated spring run off thermal stratification commences by early may and is well established by early july over the months from july to early september the surface temperature is relatively constant with the rate of deepening being almost constant at about 2m per month thermal stratification begins to weaken in mid september when the deepening of the thermocline is observed to accelerate owing to convective cooling and by mid november the water column is isothermal dam operations evacuate the cooler water from the reservoir during the summer irrigation months with the thermocline progressively drawn down owing to deep hypolimnetic offtake gates the effects of water levels on water temperature at the time of drawdown can be seen clearly fig 4 during the period from january to july the bottom temperature is around 4 c independent of the rate of inflow however from august to january the large inflow associated with the wet year causes the water column to deepen sufficiently delaying the complete water column overturn from october to december wet hydrologic years result in cooler bottom waters less than 10 c throughout the summer whereas dry years maintain bottom temperatures below 15 c during the same period average year bottom temperatures reach 15 c in mid september the simulated water temperatures at the offtake gates are then directly exported to the downstream river model as upstream boundary conditions 4 3 lower deadwood river thermal response the thermal response and hydrologic regime of the lower deadwood river computed with the 1d river model fig 5 are presented 0 9km dea 101 and 37 9km downstream of the dam near the confluence with the south fork payette river dea 108 to compare the unregulated and regulated scenarios for each hydrologic year with two post irrigation dam releases low 0 06m3 s 1 and high 1 4m3 s 1 under the fast ramping rate thermal properties in the river change between the dam and confluence due to tributary inputs short and long wave radiation ambient air temperature conduction convection and diffusion consequently the site below the dam resembles the reservoir and the near confluence site resembles unregulated conditions under non irrigation dam releases during winter high dam releases export 4 c water to the river that is warmer than the unregulated scenario 0 c affecting minimum temperatures and ice cover for substantial distances downstream 20km the low discharge option provides less warm water from the reservoir and allows tributary inputs to provide natural temperature conditions in the river the low release option allows ice cover to persist throughout the winter while still providing overwintering pools 1m depth and fish passage 0 15m depth in the river auble et al 2009 tranmer et al 2017 the thermal regime of the unregulated scenario steadily increases during the spring until it reaches warm summer temperatures of 12 14 c however spring releases from the reservoir maintain consistently cool temperatures 4 6 c in the river wet hydrologic years prove inflexible for temperature management as lower irrigation demand and larger reservoir volume suppress temperatures throughout the spring summer and fall figs 4c and 5e f winter flows during wet years are affected by large precipitation events that require dam releases to evacuate 4 c water clearing all winter surface ice in contrast dry years can export reservoir water in excess of 18 c providing instream water temperatures greater than the unregulated condition during irrigation releases tributary inputs reduce water temperatures similar to the unregulated condition before it reaches the downstream confluence fig 5a b dry years provide more operational flexibility to the reservoir as alterations to the thermal regime during the post irrigation season can be modulated by adjusting the rate of offtake gate closure on the dam fast versus slow ramping downstream thermal effects can be substantial during dry and average hydrologic years owing to the drawdown of the warm reservoir pool late in the season the 1 2 c difference can persist up to 50days later in the season by simply ramping down the flow slowly over ten versus two days fig 5g 4 4 dissolved oxygen and nutrient response river water temperature can be predicted by monitoring the environmental parameters in the basin and adjusting dam operations accordingly however primary and secondary productivity depend upon stream temperature and additional parameters determined by the upstream reservoir conditions such as thermal structure dissolved oxygen concentrations nutrient cycling and biological activity average water transit time from the dam to the confluence fluctuates between approximately 5h during irrigation releases and 15h throughout the rest of the year the limited time that constituents remain in the river create a frozen flow condition where the response time of organisms in the river is greater than the advective time scale of the water imberger 1977 imberger et al 1983 the river system therefore is fundamentally dependent upon the conditions in the reservoir that are exported downstream the annual hydrologic forcing in the basin will determine reservoir volume thermal structure of the water column and timing of physical mixing events which all affect downstream water quality parameters usbr 2016 the simulated do structure throughout the water column fig 6 in the reservoir near the dam wall dea 010 fig 1 acts as a surrogate for nutrient concentrations in each hydrologic year winter ice cover on the lake reduces atmospheric gas exchange and biological decomposition depletes the do concentration in the lower water column creating a zone of anoxia in the hypolimnion in january february anoxic conditions remineralize nutrients in the sediments increasing the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus exported to the river throughout the winter and early spring usbr 2016 spring turnover in the reservoir mixes the bottom nutrients in the water column thereby reducing concentrations that are exported to the river after mixing primary productivity phytoplankton reduces epilimnetic nutrients through uptake and causes super saturation of do at 7 10m depth during the summer season fig 6 phytoplankton senescence begins in mid summer depleting do in the hypolimnion and increasing nutrient concentrations dam operations in the post irrigation season determine how temperature nutrients and organic carbon are exported to and affect productivity in the downstream river water level exerts a strong control on the extent and timing of the low do region at depth and consequent nutrient export to the river figs 6 and 7 during dry years lower reservoir volume allows the warm pool to be drawn down farther induces earlier physical mixing in the fall increases do concentrations in the hypolimnion and decreases nutrient recycling in the bottom sediments fig 6 this equates to reduced availability of nutrients in the river during the fall winter and spring seasons in wet years the converse is true with greater volume enhanced thermal stratification and later fall mixing longer periods of anoxia in the bed sediments 2 3 weeks longer than the other two hydrologic years extended remineralization of nutrients from the bottom and higher export of nutrients to the river the measured dop and din concentrations in the upper deadwood river above the reservoir dea 102 and in the lower deadwood river dea 101 and dea 108 in relation to the measured do concentration in the reservoir hypolimnion dea 010 are shown in fig 7 these trends illustrate the availability of nutrients in the river during 2008 an average hydrologic year and their direct dependence on upstream reservoir conditions modeled in fig 6 dissolved orthophosphate concentrations upstream of the reservoir show background values for the basin that are similar to those in the downstream river during the summer irrigation season fig 7a later in the summer as do decreases and nutrient remineralization occurs in the reservoir dop concentrations in the river increase above background values until the fall turnover event occurs in the reservoir a similar trend is evident in din concentrations with the reservoir exporting higher than background values throughout the year fig 7b both dop and din tend to have higher concentrations at the site below the dam especially in the autumn following reservoir drawdown total nitrogen and tp concentrations not shown present similar trends to dissolved nutrients but fluctuate by an order of magnitude depending upon season and respective dam operations values of tn and tp range between 0 04 0 44mgl 1 and 0 01 0 107mgl 1 over the course of the year seasonal changes occur in the river depending upon dam operations with summer irrigation flows maintaining average background concentrations for forested watersheds tn 0 159 tp 0 015mgl 1 and post irrigation flows producing much higher average concentrations tn 0 263 tp 0 059mgl 1 allan 1995 smith et al 2003 these reservoir derived nutrients become available for primary production in the river and lead to enhanced algal productivity below the dam that diminishes in the downstream direction using eq 2 the minimum nitrogenous consumption rate over the length of the lower deadwood river can be quantified using a first order reaction rate loss rates account for uptake during primary production and energy production for organisms in the sediments during denitrification for an average year consumption rates for din fluctuate seasonally between 2 3 10 5 and 5 6 10 5 m 1 1 71 and 6 82day 1 which are comparable to those reported for small and large streams in temperate alluvial systems sjodin et al 1997 mulholland et al 2008 conversely dop rates show both consumption and production ranging from 3 0 10 5 to 5 8 10 5 m 1 3 5 and 7 0day 1 with negative values illustrating an increase in dop from tributary inputs wet years are fundamentally different than average and dry years with greater reservoir nutrient export din and dop from the dam that peaks in july august dissolved nutrient consumption rates show similar temporal trends over the course of the growth season reaching a maximum in late july owing to increased biological activity and algal growth particularly periphyton then dropping off substantially by late october as low light conditions and colder ambient temperatures occur 4 5 primary production primary production is a function of hydrologic year water temperature nutrient availability and dam operation low nitrogenous uptake rates indicate the lower river is not a highly productive system chlorophyll a concentrations on the streambed periphyton and in the water column phytoplankton figs 8 and 9 decrease in the downstream direction to background levels which accounts for the spatial trend in nutrient uptake over the course of the river ash free dry mass measures the total amount of all organic material including autotrophs heterotrophs and detritus the site immediately below the reservoir dea101 had the highest afdm followed by the next site downstream dea108 fig 8 measured algal biomass in the river illustrates the level of primary production in the fluvial system is elevated below the dam compared to the control site above the reservoir and farther downstream fig 9 owing primarily to warm water temperature and higher nutrient concentrations at certain times of year morley et al 2008 usbr 2016 additionally the algal community composition changes in the downstream direction as phytoplankton settles out and the river becomes a periphyton dominated ecosystem usbr 2016 4 6 macroinvertebrate production the predictable hydraulic conditions water depth and flow velocity as well as elevated nutrients and primary productivity below the reservoir provide a sufficient base for macroinvertebrate production which depends primarily on instream temperatures macroinvertebrate species composition and diversity is reduced directly below the dam but returns within 1 2km downstream usbr 2016 macroinvertebrate production varies depending upon the combination of hydrologic year and dam operation fig 10 but is within the range of nearby unregulated control sites background levels in the surrounding payette river basin under variable hydrologic conditions the reservoir will alter the thermal and chemical properties of the water that is exported to the downstream river affecting regulated flows during the dry and wet years in all scenarios wet years are detrimental to macroinvertebrate production 14 16 due to cold hypolimnetic water being released fig 4 for dry and average hydrologic years secondary production will depend upon dam operation in the post irrigation season average years show gains in productivity of 2 12 and dry years show substantial increases in productivity 3 49 above the unregulated natural condition fig 10 4 7 fish habitat preferences habitat preferences were examined to see how native fish species table 2 that rely on access to resources at variable trophic levels would respond to ecosystem changes and compared with field surveys of species presence absence comparison of physical habitat preferences table 2 to simulated river conditions for the five major species of fish in the drainage figs 3 and 5 agree throughout most of the year some stream conditions fell outside the tolerable range but largely did not impact fish presence during sampling simulated flow velocities during the irrigation season fig 3a exceed maximal values for shorthead sculpin juvenile bull trout and redband trout sculpin and redband trout are the most numerous species captured in the river and although bull trout were not captured in the main river they were documented via telemetry in the river for rearing and migration usbr 2016 additionally minimum water temperature fell below the lowest reported for longnose dace but dace accounted for 30 of the total number of fish captured n 2651 illustrating their common occurrence in the deadwood system results indicate that physical river habitat is suitable and is utilized for these species regardless of conditions exceeding their documented p 5 discussion the ecosystem downstream of deadwood reservoir is typical of regulated rivers in headwater catchments experiencing reduced variability in peak and low flows limited seasonal temperature fluctuations and modified nutrient concentrations ward 1974 power et al 1996 poff et al 1997 graf 2006 chai et al 2009 powers et al 2014 depending upon the annual hydrologic forcing a surrogate for climatic extremes the upstream reservoir will condition the physical and biogeochemical parameters of the water released to the downstream river over the course of the year therefore ecological productivity depends on a combination of the annual hydrologic conditions in the watershed and the operations strategy of the dam because of this previous prescribed instream flow requirements that focused solely on hydraulics phabsim approach cf wen et al 2016 and did not incorporate biophysical linkages within the native ecosystem proved to be detrimental for example the high post irrigation discharge option in the lower deadwood river provides greater depths velocities and wetted useable area that are similar to the unregulated conditions of the basin usbr 2016 however with the reservoir present the high release option during winter exports 4 c water from the dam destabilizing the ice cover for up to 20km downstream and allowing super cooling 0 c of the water during frigid air temperatures exposed water surface when ambient air temperatures reach 25 c in the deadwood basin facilitates formation of subsurface anchor and frazil ice that is detrimental to resident invertebrate and fish species maciolek and needham 1952 martin et al 2001 brown et al 2011 therefore river hydraulic variables i e flow velocity water depth alone are insufficient for evaluating full ecosystem function other parameters such as water temperature do and nutrients must be monitored and jointly managed to maximize species diversity and production wootton et al 1996 vinson 2001 konrad et al 2011 water temperatures outside of natural conditions because of reservoir operations were hypothesized to explain the lack of trophic production and salmonid populations in the lower deadwood river usfws 2005 but model results do not support that finding through internal processing the reservoir exported dissolved nutrients to the downstream river that were greater than those available under unregulated conditions promoting increased algal production this is in contrast to recent findings in lowland and agricultural basins where reservoirs reduce nutrient export to downstream river systems harrison et al 2009 ounissi and bouchareb 2013 powers et al 2014 indicating that forested headwater reservoirs may provide benefits for downstream ecosystems under certain conditions increased dop and din concentrations facilitated algal growth and metabolic consumption to denitrifying organisms which would otherwise be nutrient limited in this headwater system consequently primary productivity was not limiting as a food base for higher trophic levels below the dam measured chlorophyll a and ash free dry mass of algae were both elevated above nearby control reaches upstream and downstream from the reservoir establishing a sufficient caloric base for macroinvertebrate and fish populations usbr 2016 this suggests that the increase in dissolved nutrients especially during wet years may have compensated for lower stream water temperature during the summer irrigation flows for macroinvertebrates low productivity has been associated with thermal dam effects and vinson 2001 speculates that populations may not be able to recover if thermal restoration is not done within a few years after dam closure yet little difference is apparent in macroinvertebrate production composition or species richness between the regulated deadwood river and surrounding unregulated control sites usbr 2016 in addition predicted mean annual macroinvertebrate production in the lower deadwood river was greater than that reported for the unregulated st vrain creek 7 5 3 3gm 2 yr 1 a forested montane stream in colorado mccutchan and lewis 2002 but depended on the hydrologic conditions and dam operations generally wet hydrologic years reduced macroinvertebrate productivity regardless of dam operations which may in turn increase primary production in the river as grazing pressure is reduced and nutrient export from the reservoir increased alternatively dry years increased macroinvertebrate production 6 7 in the river under the high release option by providing a longer duration of warm productive water with such operational flexibility high and mid elevation reservoirs can buffer rivers during dry years from extreme low water events or cool ambient fall temperatures which may become increasingly important given increased climatic variability modelling results show that the operational flexibility for ramping down the flow after irrigation provides an additional means of adjusting rivers for potential ecosystem improvement traditionally ramping rates have been investigated to primarily avoid fish stranding yet the thermal impacts can be substantial ramping down the flow in the lower deadwood river can be performed incrementally to extend warm instream temperatures into the late fall or quickly to return the river to natural temperatures during dry years the slow ramping option ten day flow reduction which requires only eight more days to complete can affect the downstream thermal regime for up to 50days owing to the drawdown of the warm metalimnion of the upstream reservoir thermal manipulation in the river can provide warmer temperatures later in the season to extend the growth period for species of interest however this may have unintended impacts such as lethal conditions for invertebrates that hatch during freezing ambient temperatures nebeker 1971 therefore ramping rates should be investigated to address concerns of fish stranding dewatering locations of invertebrate oviposition and the impact of late season thermal cues bradford 1997 vinson 2001 halleraker et al 2003 irvine et al 2009 simulated flow velocities water depths temperatures nutrients and food availability all indicate that there is sufficient habitat to support a sustainable population of multi trophic fish species in the lower deadwood river dam operations for deadwood reservoir alter the distributions of water depth and flow velocity in the lower river that are independent of the basin hydrology and are predictable at any time of the year the altered water depth and flow velocity are within the tolerance of most native fish species in the river system except shorthead sculpin juvenile redband trout and bull trout sculpin are common above and below the reservoir so suitable microhabitats are available near the water sediment interface that are not captured in the simulated velocity results lamouroux et al 1995 anderson et al 2006 examples of microhabitats for sculpin and juvenile trout are the coarse substrate along riffles channel margins and the lee of larger substrate such as boulders and large woody debris that experience boundary layer effects and greatly reduced velocities therefore these habitat attributes would be present in any riverine system with complex geomorphic features and would provide habitat for these species even though the 1d hydrodynamic model indicates values outside of the preferred range redband trout are the most abundant of the sampled fish species in the river however rainbow redband trout are annually stocked in the deadwood reservoir idfg 2016 and can pass through the dam into the downstream river potentially increasing the numbers of this species bull trout have a low resident population in the lower deadwood river with all captured fish residing in a large pool below the dam originating from upstream populations dehaan and ardren 2008 usbr 2016 for upper trophic fish species like bull trout the deadwood river is on the edge of their geographic distribution based on stream width elevation gradient etc and robust populations exist only in the surrounding tributaries rieman and mcintyre 1995 rieman et al 2007 for species that rely on these habitats for rearing and migration the success of the environmental flows approach may be limited as drainages affected by discontinuity and fragmentation may not be able to recover robust ecosystem functions rieman and mcintyre 1993 dunham et al 1997 konrad et al 2011 yarnell et al 2015 without a hierarchical model framework to link hydrologic forcing and water operations in the basin to resultant downstream multi trophic ecological responses providing detailed guidance to water resource and ecosystem managers would not be possible while most investigations will not have the available resources to employ a coupled 3d hydrodynamic ecological reservoir model to investigate impacts on the downstream river ecology results illustrate the value of simple reservoir monitoring to inform downstream river modelling ounissi and bouchareb 2013 powers et al 2014 given the strong control of do on nutrient export from the reservoir measuring reservoir profiles of temperature and do can provide insight into the internal structure of the water column and the drivers of biochemical export then in lieu of a full hydrodynamic model relating nutrient export to the temperature and do values especially in the hypolimnion can provide crucial information for managing downstream ecosystems further modelling of the deadwood river basin could be incorporated into the hierarchical framework to improve understanding and decision making by accounting for aspects of disturbance discontinuity and habitat incorporation a 2 dimensional 2d hydraulic model would provide coupled spatial data for water depth and flow velocity that could identify zones of improved life stage habitat however the method of lamouroux et al 1995 could be used in conjunction with the results of the 1d model to provide statistical distributions of flow velocities if necessary a 2d model would additionally increase the spatial understanding of tributary mixing and thermal distribution throughout the river domain future steps to linking ecosystem performance to physical processes would include development of a bioenergetics model for species of interest over the extent of their life stages providing an opportunity to evaluate reduced fish populations owing to discontinuity and fragmentation loss of anadromous passage and juvenile production restoration initiatives could assess ecosystem productivity through increased floodplain connectivity introduction of fish ladder structures and thermal remediation via the introduction of multilevel dam outlets or intermittent spillway operation previous investigations have employed either complex hydrodynamic reservoir river models parkinson 2003 lindim et al 2011 deus et al 2013 marti et al 2016 or a cascading study approach wen et al 2016 cunha santino et al 2017 to determine singular water quality and or biological response parameters however this study examines how the annual hydrologic regime controls the reservoir structure and in turn conditions the many physiochemical parameters that impact the downstream river ecosystem in addition it illustrates that small changes to dam operations can have substantive cascading ecosystem effects at various trophic levels the direct transferability of these model configurations and results is limited given the unique climatic and geomorphic setting yet the methodology of hierarchical models can be leveraged for use in coupled reservoir river systems worldwide this is important as climate change clean energy production and increasing demand for water resources will require new dam construction to support global communities prior to construction a system of cascading models can be implemented that simulates the ecological effects of reservoir management and further habitat disturbance allowing for evaluation of virtual dam designs and operations that reduce ecosystem impacts or improve ecosystem performance 6 conclusions results from deadwood reservoir and river models illustrate that solely monitoring hydraulic properties is insufficient for quantifying the impacts of reservoir operations on riverine ecosystems and a holistic systems approach is required reservoirs create a break in the river continuum causing a reset of environmental constituents in which the degree of resetting depends upon the annual hydrologic conditions reservoir operations size and its location in the watershed in the deadwood basin the hydraulics temperature nutrients and biological productivity under the regulated flow regime are comparable or superior to the unregulated cases for dry and average years wet hydrologic years are detrimental to the downstream ecosystem for all cases under such constraints in the deadwood river system flow releases should focus on promoting productivity and preserving natural temperature cues for organisms rather than minimum instream flows provided that flow properties including refugia and connectivity are within natural seasonal ranges understanding the impacts of hydrologic forcing and reservoir operations on downstream riverine ecosystem and habitat quality requires a set of integrated hierarchical models to link the physical processes with the appropriate biological responses reservoir properties are controlled by climatic forcing and thus an adaptive management strategy for reservoir operations would prove more effective than fixed minimum instream flows in protecting riverine ecosystem functions and fulfilling reservoir objectives this will increase management responsibilities but will provide decision making capacity driven by data and modelling based information that is agreeable to basin stakeholders

25346,regulated rivers below dams have traditionally been managed using a minimum instream flow to provide adequate aquatic habitat however dam management in conjunction with changes in climate and land use challenges downstream ecosystem functions that cannot be properly addressed by a simple minimum flow requirement depending upon the river system additional parameters such as water temperature and nutrient loading provide more critical ecological value for organisms than ensuring a constant minimum release a new modelling methodology utilizing a cascading hierarchical approach is proposed and tested on a 614km2 headwater basin in central idaho usa application of the methodology illustrates that below large dams the river discharge becomes independent of the seasonal hydrology and specifying the discharge alone is insufficient for evaluating ecosystem response upstream reservoirs interrupt the watershed continuum and internally modify the thermal chemical and biological properties of water prior to release into a downstream river these water properties depend on the annual hydrologic regime characteristics of the reservoir and the offtake strategies offtake structure depth dam discharge and the water column thermal stratification this study describes the use of climatically driven hydrologic forcing and variable dam operations in a coupled reservoir river system to optimize river ecosystem health by linking physical processes with in situ observations and incorporating multi trophic species requirements such an approach can support real time decision making on existing reservoir river systems and provide a virtual means of evaluating ecosystem impacts prior to disturbance from new dam construction or implementation of restoration

flows go beyond minimum instream flow conditions by accounting for parameters such as discharge variability water temperature nutrient concentrations and substrate stability which are equally important for riverine ecosystems and must be collectively tailored to the needs of the particular river basin under consideration power et al 1996 wootton et al 1996 therefore a new holistic approach is required for reservoir river systems where all the above changes in river properties brought about by land use changes and global warming are viewed as inputs to the reservoir river ecology ecological systems can then be evaluated with respect to the primary reservoir function such as hydropower or bulk water supply but also the water properties discharged to the downstream river for aquatic and riparian productivity yin and yang 2011 yin et al 2015 the reservoir thermal structure determines the internal physical chemical and biological processes that dictate the properties of the outflowing water and determine the boundary conditions for the downstream river s ward 1974 vinson 2001 marti et al 2016 furthermore the thermal chemical and biological processes in the reservoir river system are strongly influenced by the annual hydrologic regime wet vs dry complicating prediction of downstream ecosystem response konrad et al 2011 given the primary function of the reservoir and composition of the downstream ecosystem effective river management depends on understanding the internal reservoir dynamics flexibility of dam operations and potential geomorphic and biochemical interactions it is important to stress that for a reservoir river system where the reservoir discharge is determined by contractual demand for electricity production bulk water or irrigation delivery new hydraulic regimes are imposed on the downstream river that are independent of hydrologic factors once the river discharge regime and water temperature become disconnected from the natural catchment hydrology the sustainability of the original aquatic ecology is drawn into question vinson 2001 in light of these challenges this work investigates how a systems approach to reservoir river modelling can identify the potential ecological impacts of changing the downstream river discharge boundary conditions by optimizing the physical and biogeochemical properties of the discharge water

temperature nutrients and productivity bernhardt et al 2005 deus et al 2013 wen et al 2016 cunha santino et al 2017 weigel et al 2017 the current work expands the scope of the investigation beyond singular species of interest or a specific type of ecosystem to show how aquatic ecosystems are spatially linked and driven by the annual hydrologic conditions in the basin to investigate this the thermal and biochemical properties of a reservoir were investigated via a coupled three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic and ecological model to provide downstream boundary conditions under dry average and wet hydrologic forcing to a one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic river model a nutrient mass balance model and a macroinvertebrate regression model these physical and biochemical conditions were collectively evaluated with respect to the five major native fish species found in the river system to assess hydrologic effects of potential climate change and operational control of a reservoir on higher trophic native aquatic species 2 study site the deadwood river basin 614km2 is a north south oriented intrusive valley located in central idaho usa fig 1 the upper basin consists of multiple headwater streams the upper deadwood river and trail creek are the two largest streams that drain into deadwood reservoir near the center of the watershed the lower deadwood river begins at the reservoir dam and runs 38km to the confluence with the south fork payette river the lower river flows through a semi confined canyon with limited discontinuous floodplains along its extent tranmer et al 2015 the river channel is approximately 30m wide and has an average channel gradient of 1 2 although local channel slope fluctuates between 1 and 8 due to geologic constraints channel substrate is dominated by cobbles interspersed with large boulders and sand transport can be significant during irrigation releases and storm events deadwood reservoir draining an area of 287km2 is a large reservoir 12 600m2 with two primary hypolimnetic offtake gates and a volume of 190 million m3 at full pool elevation 1 625 8m deadwood dam 50m tall is operated for flood control and irrigation storage that activates the dam spillway once full pool elevation is achieved directly below the dam a deep stilling basin provides unique river habitat that is conditioned by the upstream reservoir properties and maintains a resident fish population contractual water releases during the summer irrigation season provide steady flows of 27m3 s 1 to the river from june through september that is greater than the approximately 6m3 s 1 that occurred during the unregulated period post irrigation season dam design restricts outflows to high 1 4m3 s 1 or low 0 06m3 s 1 values as a means of managing downstream river conditions at the beginning and end of the irrigation season the primary offtake gates can incrementally ramp stream discharge up or down to modify the flow conditions in the river 3 materials and methods to assess the potential ecological impacts of climate driven hydrologic regimes on the reservoir and downstream river environments a series of operational scenarios were evaluated that represent the spectrum of hydrologic conditions including expected climate change these scenarios encompassed three hydrologic years representing dry average and wet conditions in the basin that correspond to 40 100 and 150 of historic mean reservoir inflow hydrographs for each representative hydrologic year dry average wet were compared with the corresponding unregulated natural no dam flow regime the unregulated flow regime of the river was calculated from measured tributary inputs upstream of the reservoir and collectively used as an upstream boundary condition to the 1d river hydrodynamic model additionally ecological effects of post irrigation dam releases were evaluated using the high 1 4m3 s 1 and low 0 06m3 s 1 options with a fast ramping rate two day change in flow and a slow ramping rate ten day change in flow 3 1 hierarchical conceptual model the study was designed according to a cascaded numerical model approach together with field data in order to assess how impacts translate through the reservoir river ecosystem fig 2 a coupled 3d hydrodynamic ecological model estuary lake and coastal ocean model computational aquatic ecosystem dynamics model aem3d romero et al 2004 silva et al 2014 was implemented for the deadwood reservoir to simulate reservoir hydrodynamic and ecological response to the three hydrologic dry average wet inflow conditions including the post irrigation releases and ramping rates weigel et al 2017 aem3d has been employed in numerous lakes and reservoirs and a review of the coupled model system has recently been performed by trolle et al 2012 outputs from the reservoir model were used as upstream boundary conditions for a 1d hydrodynamic and temperature model mike 11 advection dispersion ad module developed by the danish hydraulic institute of the lower deadwood river below the reservoir marzadri et al 2014 tranmer et al 2015 the mike 11 model was selected due to success in nearby study locations parkinson 2003 loinaz et al 2013 the effects of dam operations on downstream nutrient uptake were evaluated by means of a mass balance model that used the hydraulic outputs from the mike 11 model and measured nutrient concentrations below the dam a macroinvertebrate regression model developed for similar stream conditions in colorado usa mccutchan and lewis 2002 was adapted for the lower deadwood river modeled values of water depth flow velocity and water temperature were examined in the river for the three hydrologic conditions including the post irrigation releases and ramping rates to determine how well native fish preferences tolerances are met and compared with field fish surveys for species presence absence 3 2 deadwood reservoir model the physical and biogeochemical simulations in this study were conducted using aem3d which couples elcom and caedym routines to simulate the hydrodynamics nutrient cycles and food web dynamics in three dimensions hodges et al 2000 silva et al 2014 elcom is a 3d hydrodynamic model based on the numerical solution of the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations using both the boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations the model uses a semi implicit method for free surface evolution a third order euler lagrangian scheme for convective terms an ultimate quickest scheme for the advection of scalars and a numerical diffusion filter that is appropriate for stratified lakes laval et al 2003 elcom does not require calibration because it is physically based and its parameters can be specified from literature values caedym consists of a series of process based partial differential equations that dynamically simulate concentrations of biogeochemical variables accounting for primary and secondary production nutrient cycling oxygen dynamics and sediment water interactions caedym requires specification of several parameters used to simulation the biogeochemical processes but they are also constrained within ranges found in literature elcom and caedym have been described elsewhere in detail hodges et al 2000 laval et al 2003 romero et al 2004 silva et al 2014 the physical model domain of deadwood reservoir was discretized with a uniform horizontal grid of 100m by 100m and a vertical resolution of 1m the model used a time step of 120s extensive field data meteorological inflow scalar variables and initial conditions were collected during the period october 2007 through march 2009 so this period was chosen for model validation the elcom model activated the appropriate algorithms to include atmospheric exchange inflow dynamics turbulent mixing dynamics coriolis forcing and ice formation dynamics oveisy et al 2012 caedym was configured to simulate nitrogen and phosphorus in both particulate and dissolved organic forms and dissolved inorganic forms to include particulate organic nitrogen pon dissolved organic nitrogen don ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 particulate organic phosphorus pop dissolved organic phosphorus dop orthophosphate po4 dissolved oxygen do particulate organic carbon poc dissolved organic carbon doc as well as the four dominant phytoplankton groups observed in the reservoir during the field data collection period dinoflagellates cyanobacteria cryptophytes and diatoms simulated as chlorophyll a with a constant carbon to chlorophyll a ratio elcom parameters relevant to the hydrodynamic processes were not adjusted and minimal adjustment of caedym parameters was performed using literature values or direct estimates within default literature ranges table 1 a detailed description of the configuration of aem3d used here and its validation against water level water temperature dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a for 2007 2009 is presented in detail in usbr 2016 and weigel et al 2017 model performance over the validation period was assessed using the root mean square error rmse as defined by 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n m i s i 2 where mi is the measured variable si is the simulated variable and n is the number of values for water temperature dissolved oxygen concentration and chlorophyll a concentration profiles in the reservoir near the dam wall dea 010 fig 1 rmse were 1 3 c 1 3mgl 1 and 2 0μgl 1 respectively these provide confidence that aem3d simulations could be used to predict the physical and biochemical variables under a range of climate driven hydrologic regimes and water operations and as upstream boundary conditions to the 1d river model tiedemann 2013 for the three hydrologic years with two post irrigation dam releases 0 06m3 s 1 and 1 4m3 s 1 and fast and slow ramping rates the 12 simulations were driven with the same data used for the validation period however initial water levels and inflow and outflow rates reflected the hydrologic year post irrigation releases and ramping up down rates being examined these simulations were run for a period of 14 months starting on november 1 and the results of these scenarios are described in detail in usbr 2016 the parameter values listed in table 1 were the same for the twelve simulations 3 3 lower deadwood river model mike 11 is a 1d hydrodynamic model that solves the unsteady saint venant shallow water equations with a semi explicit finite difference scheme for this study the hydrodynamic model was used in conjunction with the ad module the lower deadwood river model extends 38km from deadwood reservoir to the confluence with the south fork payette river fig 1 and was supported by high resolution 30 m spacing of cross sections which were extracted from the bathymetry generated by an experimental airborne advanced research lidar survey mckean et al 2009 mckean et al 2014 time series of measured outflows and water temperature from the reservoir and field derived stage discharge rating curves were used as upstream and downstream boundary conditions lateral tributary discharges and water temperatures were obtained from measurements at each main tributary see fig 1 meteorological data air temperature relative humidity and sunlight hours per day were used from a nearby weather station bearskin creek calibration and validation of the 1d model for the lower deadwood river were performed for year 2009 using a time step of 4s and are reported in previous publications for both hydraulic and stream temperature modelling marzadri et al 2014 tranmer et al 2015 the calibration of flow resistance utilized a value of manning s n roughness coefficient which it was set equal to 0 06m1 3 s 1 for the entire model domain the canyon like nature of the lower river required shifting the sunlight timing and amount in order to accurately represent the river temperatures tiedemann 2013 the comparison between measured and predicted water surface elevations at low flows near the two ends of the study site resulted in rmse of 20cm rmse of 1 48m3 s 1 and r2 0 98 between measured and predicted flood wave discharges near the confluence with the south fork payette river were reported the comparison between measured and predicted hourly stream water temperatures resulted in rmses of 0 9 1 9 c with error increasing with distance downstream from the dam usbr 2016 the model was run for three hydrologic inflow conditions with two post irrigation dam releases 0 06m3 s 1 and 1 4m3 s 1 and fast and slow ramping rates meteorological data and tributary temperature data used for the calibration period were utilized for each of the hydrologic years times series of measured outflows and simulated water temperatures at the dam outlet using aem3d and a field derived stage discharge rating curve were used as upstream and downstream boundary conditions lateral tributary discharges were adjusted to account for the hydrologic conditions tiedemann 2013 these simulations were repeated for a theoretical unregulated lower deadwood river where discharge and temperature time series used as aem3d inflow inputs to the reservoir were used as direct inputs to the 1d river model to circumvent the reservoir influence 3 4 nutrient chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen sampling data used to characterize nutrient uptake and primary production in the lower deadwood river were collected during the period from 2008 through 2011 total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn dissolved inorganic nitrogen din dissolved orthophosphate dop and discharge data were obtained at three water quality sampling stations fig 1 located in one of the reservoir primary tributaries upper deadwood river dea 102 directly downstream of the dam dea 101 and immediately upstream of the confluence at the lower end of the river dea 108 the data were collected during 2008 with biweekly sampling commencing in the first week of june and ending the first week in october chlorophyll a data were obtained for the same monitoring stations between 2008 and 2011 during 2008 biweekly sampling commenced the first week in june and concluded the first week in october samples were collected about monthly during 2009 beginning in late june and ending in late september sampling began again in early july in 2010 and concluded in early november finally in 2011 monthly sampling started in july and concluded in october periphyton data were collected monthly from june through october 2010 and july through october 2011 at ten sites fig 1 including four located in the regulated lower deadwood river dea 101 dea 113 dea 112 and dea 108 and six in unregulated reference rivers two sites each on the upper deadwood river dea 102 and dea 114 upper south fork payette river not shown and clear creek dea 115 and dea 116 see fig 1 on each sampling date three transects were selected randomly within an established 100 m long sample site at each transect depending on the amount of periphyton present three or four cobble sized rocks were collected and periphyton was scraped within a 58 1cm2 quadrat all samples for a site were pooled and analyzed within 48h for chlorophyll a and ash free dry mass afdm full depth water column profiles of pressure water temperature and dissolved oxygen were collected at a reservoir station near deadwood dam s deep offtake structures and spillway dea 010 depth 35m fig 1 synoptic data were collected through the ice in february 2008 and then biweekly profiling started the first week in june and concluded the first week in october data from the profiles were supplemented with data from one continuous in situ station adjacent to the profiling station dea 010 fig 1 measuring water temperature and dissolved oxygen at different depths nutrient uptake in the river was calculated by means of a mass balance model for the dissolved constituents din and dop by way of example the average uptake of din by primary production in the lower deadwood river was evaluated by assuming all tributaries behaved similarly as follows 2 c r i v e r q r e s c r e s q t r i b s c t r i b s q r e s q t r i b s where c river is the concentration of din in the river mgl 1 c res is the concentration of din input from the reservoir mgl 1 q res is the volumetric discharge from the reservoir m3 s 1 c tribs is the background concentration of din in the monitored tributaries mgl 1 q tribs is the volumetric discharge from the surrounding tributaries m3 s 1 shown in fig 1 chanson 2004 the mass balance model accounts for reservoir and tributary contributions as well as tributary dilution with differences between measured and predicted din concentrations at the confluence with the south fork payette river providing the minimum biological uptake rate 3 5 macroinvertebrate production model simulated water temperatures in the lower deadwood river for each hydrologic year using the 1d river model were used in a temperature dependent macroinvertebrate growth model to estimate secondary productivity within the river the growth model was developed according to the methods of mccutchan and lewis 2002 using macroinvertebrate data collected from june through october 2010 and july through october 2011 at the same 10 sites as the nutrient sampling fig 1 physical habitat was similar among all sample sites for each site macroinvertebrate production for each taxonomic group was estimated over the intervals between sampling dates the instantaneous exponential form of the increment summation method was used to estimate production of taxa that could be identified to species and followed over time as distinct cohorts whereas the instantaneous growth method was used to estimate production of taxa that could not be identified to species or could not be followed over time as distinct cohorts gillespie and benke 1979 the growth rates of non cohort taxa were estimated with a multiple regression equation developed from growth rates of all species in this study that could be followed as cohorts 3 ln g 4 86 0 23 0 155 0 019 t 0 53 0 36 ln w r 2 0 35 where g is the instantaneous growth rate gday 1 t is the average water temperature c over the time interval and w is the mean individual mass g at the start of an interval and the macroinvertebrate production was estimated as follows 4 p g x b x t where p is the macroinvertebrate production gm 2 day 1 g is the growth rate gday 1 calculated for each taxon using eq 3 b is the mean biomass for the taxon over the interval that was collected in the field g t is the number of days in the interval between sampling dates day it should be pointed out that the sampling in the lower deadwood river occurred at four sites in low gradient riffles near the dam and river mouth with no sampling performed in the middle reaches due to inaccessible terrain fig 1 physical substrate and morphology distribution of pools riffles etc may differ in intermediate reaches thereby limiting the accuracy of results however overall trends in productivity should remain similar macroinvertebrate production was calculated for dry average and wet years under scenarios of unregulated high and low dam releases at the four lower deadwood river sites for each scenario the mean modeled hourly water temperature using the river model t for each interval between sampling dates was used with measured mean individual mass w in eq 3 to estimate growth rates for both cohort and non cohort taxa interval production for each taxon was estimated using eq 4 total macroinvertebrate community production for each sampling interval equaled the sum of production for all taxa using these estimates total annual production gm 2 yr 1 was calculated results were averaged across all four sampling sites dea 101 dea 113 dea 112 and dea 108 see fig 1 to provide a representative estimate of macroinvertebrate production within the river 3 6 fish sampling field surveys for fish presence absence in the upper deadwood river and tributaries above the reservoir and lower deadwood river and tributaries below the reservoir extended over a six year period from 2006 to 2011 surveying methods included a combination of weir traps electroshocking gill netting hook and line bag seines and minnow traps native fish species considered in this study were longnose dace rhinichthys cataractae shorthead sculpin cottus confusus mountain whitefish prosopium williamsoni rainbow redband trout oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri and bull trout salvelinus confluentus data on captured fish included location measured fork and total length and weight recaptures for individual fish were only recorded for bull trout 4 results 4 1 lower deadwood river hydraulics the simulated 1d depth and velocity distributions over the lower deadwood river model domain and the frequency histograms of unregulated and regulated discharges for dry average and wet years are illustrated in fig 3 changes in the flow distributions are evident between unregulated and regulated conditions in the river the flows have not reached bankfull level 61m3 s 1 since dam closure tranmer et al 2015 and given the reduction in peak flows river morphology has stabilized over time allowing the river hydraulics to become predictable from year to year minor deviations occur from these predictable conditions during the winter months owing to ice formation and during wet years once the spillway is activated or tributaries experience local rain on snow events in stream values of water depth and velocity as a function of dam operation are largely independent of season or hydrologic inputs and show a high degree of overlap as discharge increases the bimodal distribution of regulated flows fig 3b characterizes the irrigation season releases 27m3 s 1 and the post irrigation releases 1 4m3 s 1 4 2 deadwood reservoir thermal response the reservoir water level changes by up to 15m during the year due to spring inflows and summer withdrawals with peak reservoir elevations typically occurring in mid june and low reservoir elevations in september fig 4 an exception is during wet years when low water can occur any time in the winter or spring as large dam releases must manage reservoir storage capacity for estimated spring run off thermal stratification commences by early may and is well established by early july over the months from july to early september the surface temperature is relatively constant with the rate of deepening being almost constant at about 2m per month thermal stratification begins to weaken in mid september when the deepening of the thermocline is observed to accelerate owing to convective cooling and by mid november the water column is isothermal dam operations evacuate the cooler water from the reservoir during the summer irrigation months with the thermocline progressively drawn down owing to deep hypolimnetic offtake gates the effects of water levels on water temperature at the time of drawdown can be seen clearly fig 4 during the period from january to july the bottom temperature is around 4 c independent of the rate of inflow however from august to january the large inflow associated with the wet year causes the water column to deepen sufficiently delaying the complete water column overturn from october to december wet hydrologic years result in cooler bottom waters less than 10 c throughout the summer whereas dry years maintain bottom temperatures below 15 c during the same period average year bottom temperatures reach 15 c in mid september the simulated water temperatures at the offtake gates are then directly exported to the downstream river model as upstream boundary conditions 4 3 lower deadwood river thermal response the thermal response and hydrologic regime of the lower deadwood river computed with the 1d river model fig 5 are presented 0 9km dea 101 and 37 9km downstream of the dam near the confluence with the south fork payette river dea 108 to compare the unregulated and regulated scenarios for each hydrologic year with two post irrigation dam releases low 0 06m3 s 1 and high 1 4m3 s 1 under the fast ramping rate thermal properties in the river change between the dam and confluence due to tributary inputs short and long wave radiation ambient air temperature conduction convection and diffusion consequently the site below the dam resembles the reservoir and the near confluence site resembles unregulated conditions under non irrigation dam releases during winter high dam releases export 4 c water to the river that is warmer than the unregulated scenario 0 c affecting minimum temperatures and ice cover for substantial distances downstream 20km the low discharge option provides less warm water from the reservoir and allows tributary inputs to provide natural temperature conditions in the river the low release option allows ice cover to persist throughout the winter while still providing overwintering pools 1m depth and fish passage 0 15m depth in the river auble et al 2009 tranmer et al 2017 the thermal regime of the unregulated scenario steadily increases during the spring until it reaches warm summer temperatures of 12 14 c however spring releases from the reservoir maintain consistently cool temperatures 4 6 c in the river wet hydrologic years prove inflexible for temperature management as lower irrigation demand and larger reservoir volume suppress temperatures throughout the spring summer and fall figs 4c and 5e f winter flows during wet years are affected by large precipitation events that require dam releases to evacuate 4 c water clearing all winter surface ice in contrast dry years can export reservoir water in excess of 18 c providing instream water temperatures greater than the unregulated condition during irrigation releases tributary inputs reduce water temperatures similar to the unregulated condition before it reaches the downstream confluence fig 5a b dry years provide more operational flexibility to the reservoir as alterations to the thermal regime during the post irrigation season can be modulated by adjusting the rate of offtake gate closure on the dam fast versus slow ramping downstream thermal effects can be substantial during dry and average hydrologic years owing to the drawdown of the warm reservoir pool late in the season the 1 2 c difference can persist up to 50days later in the season by simply ramping down the flow slowly over ten versus two days fig 5g 4 4 dissolved oxygen and nutrient response river water temperature can be predicted by monitoring the environmental parameters in the basin and adjusting dam operations accordingly however primary and secondary productivity depend upon stream temperature and additional parameters determined by the upstream reservoir conditions such as thermal structure dissolved oxygen concentrations nutrient cycling and biological activity average water transit time from the dam to the confluence fluctuates between approximately 5h during irrigation releases and 15h throughout the rest of the year the limited time that constituents remain in the river create a frozen flow condition where the response time of organisms in the river is greater than the advective time scale of the water imberger 1977 imberger et al 1983 the river system therefore is fundamentally dependent upon the conditions in the reservoir that are exported downstream the annual hydrologic forcing in the basin will determine reservoir volume thermal structure of the water column and timing of physical mixing events which all affect downstream water quality parameters usbr 2016 the simulated do structure throughout the water column fig 6 in the reservoir near the dam wall dea 010 fig 1 acts as a surrogate for nutrient concentrations in each hydrologic year winter ice cover on the lake reduces atmospheric gas exchange and biological decomposition depletes the do concentration in the lower water column creating a zone of anoxia in the hypolimnion in january february anoxic conditions remineralize nutrients in the sediments increasing the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus exported to the river throughout the winter and early spring usbr 2016 spring turnover in the reservoir mixes the bottom nutrients in the water column thereby reducing concentrations that are exported to the river after mixing primary productivity phytoplankton reduces epilimnetic nutrients through uptake and causes super saturation of do at 7 10m depth during the summer season fig 6 phytoplankton senescence begins in mid summer depleting do in the hypolimnion and increasing nutrient concentrations dam operations in the post irrigation season determine how temperature nutrients and organic carbon are exported to and affect productivity in the downstream river water level exerts a strong control on the extent and timing of the low do region at depth and consequent nutrient export to the river figs 6 and 7 during dry years lower reservoir volume allows the warm pool to be drawn down farther induces earlier physical mixing in the fall increases do concentrations in the hypolimnion and decreases nutrient recycling in the bottom sediments fig 6 this equates to reduced availability of nutrients in the river during the fall winter and spring seasons in wet years the converse is true with greater volume enhanced thermal stratification and later fall mixing longer periods of anoxia in the bed sediments 2 3 weeks longer than the other two hydrologic years extended remineralization of nutrients from the bottom and higher export of nutrients to the river the measured dop and din concentrations in the upper deadwood river above the reservoir dea 102 and in the lower deadwood river dea 101 and dea 108 in relation to the measured do concentration in the reservoir hypolimnion dea 010 are shown in fig 7 these trends illustrate the availability of nutrients in the river during 2008 an average hydrologic year and their direct dependence on upstream reservoir conditions modeled in fig 6 dissolved orthophosphate concentrations upstream of the reservoir show background values for the basin that are similar to those in the downstream river during the summer irrigation season fig 7a later in the summer as do decreases and nutrient remineralization occurs in the reservoir dop concentrations in the river increase above background values until the fall turnover event occurs in the reservoir a similar trend is evident in din concentrations with the reservoir exporting higher than background values throughout the year fig 7b both dop and din tend to have higher concentrations at the site below the dam especially in the autumn following reservoir drawdown total nitrogen and tp concentrations not shown present similar trends to dissolved nutrients but fluctuate by an order of magnitude depending upon season and respective dam operations values of tn and tp range between 0 04 0 44mgl 1 and 0 01 0 107mgl 1 over the course of the year seasonal changes occur in the river depending upon dam operations with summer irrigation flows maintaining average background concentrations for forested watersheds tn 0 159 tp 0 015mgl 1 and post irrigation flows producing much higher average concentrations tn 0 263 tp 0 059mgl 1 allan 1995 smith et al 2003 these reservoir derived nutrients become available for primary production in the river and lead to enhanced algal productivity below the dam that diminishes in the downstream direction using eq 2 the minimum nitrogenous consumption rate over the length of the lower deadwood river can be quantified using a first order reaction rate loss rates account for uptake during primary production and energy production for organisms in the sediments during denitrification for an average year consumption rates for din fluctuate seasonally between 2 3 10 5 and 5 6 10 5 m 1 1 71 and 6 82day 1 which are comparable to those reported for small and large streams in temperate alluvial systems sjodin et al 1997 mulholland et al 2008 conversely dop rates show both consumption and production ranging from 3 0 10 5 to 5 8 10 5 m 1 3 5 and 7 0day 1 with negative values illustrating an increase in dop from tributary inputs wet years are fundamentally different than average and dry years with greater reservoir nutrient export din and dop from the dam that peaks in july august dissolved nutrient consumption rates show similar temporal trends over the course of the growth season reaching a maximum in late july owing to increased biological activity and algal growth particularly periphyton then dropping off substantially by late october as low light conditions and colder ambient temperatures occur 4 5 primary production primary production is a function of hydrologic year water temperature nutrient availability and dam operation low nitrogenous uptake rates indicate the lower river is not a highly productive system chlorophyll a concentrations on the streambed periphyton and in the water column phytoplankton figs 8 and 9 decrease in the downstream direction to background levels which accounts for the spatial trend in nutrient uptake over the course of the river ash free dry mass measures the total amount of all organic material including autotrophs heterotrophs and detritus the site immediately below the reservoir dea101 had the highest afdm followed by the next site downstream dea108 fig 8 measured algal biomass in the river illustrates the level of primary production in the fluvial system is elevated below the dam compared to the control site above the reservoir and farther downstream fig 9 owing primarily to warm water temperature and higher nutrient concentrations at certain times of year morley et al 2008 usbr 2016 additionally the algal community composition changes in the downstream direction as phytoplankton settles out and the river becomes a periphyton dominated ecosystem usbr 2016 4 6 macroinvertebrate production the predictable hydraulic conditions water depth and flow velocity as well as elevated nutrients and primary productivity below the reservoir provide a sufficient base for macroinvertebrate production which depends primarily on instream temperatures macroinvertebrate species composition and diversity is reduced directly below the dam but returns within 1 2km downstream usbr 2016 macroinvertebrate production varies depending upon the combination of hydrologic year and dam operation fig 10 but is within the range of nearby unregulated control sites background levels in the surrounding payette river basin under variable hydrologic conditions the reservoir will alter the thermal and chemical properties of the water that is exported to the downstream river affecting regulated flows during the dry and wet years in all scenarios wet years are detrimental to macroinvertebrate production 14 16 due to cold hypolimnetic water being released fig 4 for dry and average hydrologic years secondary production will depend upon dam operation in the post irrigation season average years show gains in productivity of 2 12 and dry years show substantial increases in productivity 3 49 above the unregulated natural condition fig 10 4 7 fish habitat preferences habitat preferences were examined to see how native fish species table 2 that rely on access to resources at variable trophic levels would respond to ecosystem changes and compared with field surveys of species presence absence comparison of physical habitat preferences table 2 to simulated river conditions for the five major species of fish in the drainage figs 3 and 5 agree throughout most of the year some stream conditions fell outside the tolerable range but largely did not impact fish presence during sampling simulated flow velocities during the irrigation season fig 3a exceed maximal values for shorthead sculpin juvenile bull trout and redband trout sculpin and redband trout are the most numerous species captured in the river and although bull trout were not captured in the main river they were documented via telemetry in the river for rearing and migration usbr 2016 additionally minimum water temperature fell below the lowest reported for longnose dace but dace accounted for 30 of the total number of fish captured n 2651 illustrating their common occurrence in the deadwood system results indicate that physical river habitat is suitable and is utilized for these species regardless of conditions exceeding their documented p 5 discussion the ecosystem downstream of deadwood reservoir is typical of regulated rivers in headwater catchments experiencing reduced variability in peak and low flows limited seasonal temperature fluctuations and modified nutrient concentrations ward 1974 power et al 1996 poff et al 1997 graf 2006 chai et al 2009 powers et al 2014 depending upon the annual hydrologic forcing a surrogate for climatic extremes the upstream reservoir will condition the physical and biogeochemical parameters of the water released to the downstream river over the course of the year therefore ecological productivity depends on a combination of the annual hydrologic conditions in the watershed and the operations strategy of the dam because of this previous prescribed instream flow requirements that focused solely on hydraulics phabsim approach cf wen et al 2016 and did not incorporate biophysical linkages within the native ecosystem proved to be detrimental for example the high post irrigation discharge option in the lower deadwood river provides greater depths velocities and wetted useable area that are similar to the unregulated conditions of the basin usbr 2016 however with the reservoir present the high release option during winter exports 4 c water from the dam destabilizing the ice cover for up to 20km downstream and allowing super cooling 0 c of the water during frigid air temperatures exposed water surface when ambient air temperatures reach 25 c in the deadwood basin facilitates formation of subsurface anchor and frazil ice that is detrimental to resident invertebrate and fish species maciolek and needham 1952 martin et al 2001 brown et al 2011 therefore river hydraulic variables i e flow velocity water depth alone are insufficient for evaluating full ecosystem function other parameters such as water temperature do and nutrients must be monitored and jointly managed to maximize species diversity and production wootton et al 1996 vinson 2001 konrad et al 2011 water temperatures outside of natural conditions because of reservoir operations were hypothesized to explain the lack of trophic production and salmonid populations in the lower deadwood river usfws 2005 but model results do not support that finding through internal processing the reservoir exported dissolved nutrients to the downstream river that were greater than those available under unregulated conditions promoting increased algal production this is in contrast to recent findings in lowland and agricultural basins where reservoirs reduce nutrient export to downstream river systems harrison et al 2009 ounissi and bouchareb 2013 powers et al 2014 indicating that forested headwater reservoirs may provide benefits for downstream ecosystems under certain conditions increased dop and din concentrations facilitated algal growth and metabolic consumption to denitrifying organisms which would otherwise be nutrient limited in this headwater system consequently primary productivity was not limiting as a food base for higher trophic levels below the dam measured chlorophyll a and ash free dry mass of algae were both elevated above nearby control reaches upstream and downstream from the reservoir establishing a sufficient caloric base for macroinvertebrate and fish populations usbr 2016 this suggests that the increase in dissolved nutrients especially during wet years may have compensated for lower stream water temperature during the summer irrigation flows for macroinvertebrates low productivity has been associated with thermal dam effects and vinson 2001 speculates that populations may not be able to recover if thermal restoration is not done within a few years after dam closure yet little difference is apparent in macroinvertebrate production composition or species richness between the regulated deadwood river and surrounding unregulated control sites usbr 2016 in addition predicted mean annual macroinvertebrate production in the lower deadwood river was greater than that reported for the unregulated st vrain creek 7 5 3 3gm 2 yr 1 a forested montane stream in colorado mccutchan and lewis 2002 but depended on the hydrologic conditions and dam operations generally wet hydrologic years reduced macroinvertebrate productivity regardless of dam operations which may in turn increase primary production in the river as grazing pressure is reduced and nutrient export from the reservoir increased alternatively dry years increased macroinvertebrate production 6 7 in the river under the high release option by providing a longer duration of warm productive water with such operational flexibility high and mid elevation reservoirs can buffer rivers during dry years from extreme low water events or cool ambient fall temperatures which may become increasingly important given increased climatic variability modelling results show that the operational flexibility for ramping down the flow after irrigation provides an additional means of adjusting rivers for potential ecosystem improvement traditionally ramping rates have been investigated to primarily avoid fish stranding yet the thermal impacts can be substantial ramping down the flow in the lower deadwood river can be performed incrementally to extend warm instream temperatures into the late fall or quickly to return the river to natural temperatures during dry years the slow ramping option ten day flow reduction which requires only eight more days to complete can affect the downstream thermal regime for up to 50days owing to the drawdown of the warm metalimnion of the upstream reservoir thermal manipulation in the river can provide warmer temperatures later in the season to extend the growth period for species of interest however this may have unintended impacts such as lethal conditions for invertebrates that hatch during freezing ambient temperatures nebeker 1971 therefore ramping rates should be investigated to address concerns of fish stranding dewatering locations of invertebrate oviposition and the impact of late season thermal cues bradford 1997 vinson 2001 halleraker et al 2003 irvine et al 2009 simulated flow velocities water depths temperatures nutrients and food availability all indicate that there is sufficient habitat to support a sustainable population of multi trophic fish species in the lower deadwood river dam operations for deadwood reservoir alter the distributions of water depth and flow velocity in the lower river that are independent of the basin hydrology and are predictable at any time of the year the altered water depth and flow velocity are within the tolerance of most native fish species in the river system except shorthead sculpin juvenile redband trout and bull trout sculpin are common above and below the reservoir so suitable microhabitats are available near the water sediment interface that are not captured in the simulated velocity results lamouroux et al 1995 anderson et al 2006 examples of microhabitats for sculpin and juvenile trout are the coarse substrate along riffles channel margins and the lee of larger substrate such as boulders and large woody debris that experience boundary layer effects and greatly reduced velocities therefore these habitat attributes would be present in any riverine system with complex geomorphic features and would provide habitat for these species even though the 1d hydrodynamic model indicates values outside of the preferred range redband trout are the most abundant of the sampled fish species in the river however rainbow redband trout are annually stocked in the deadwood reservoir idfg 2016 and can pass through the dam into the downstream river potentially increasing the numbers of this species bull trout have a low resident population in the lower deadwood river with all captured fish residing in a large pool below the dam originating from upstream populations dehaan and ardren 2008 usbr 2016 for upper trophic fish species like bull trout the deadwood river is on the edge of their geographic distribution based on stream width elevation gradient etc and robust populations exist only in the surrounding tributaries rieman and mcintyre 1995 rieman et al 2007 for species that rely on these habitats for rearing and migration the success of the environmental flows approach may be limited as drainages affected by discontinuity and fragmentation may not be able to recover robust ecosystem functions rieman and mcintyre 1993 dunham et al 1997 konrad et al 2011 yarnell et al 2015 without a hierarchical model framework to link hydrologic forcing and water operations in the basin to resultant downstream multi trophic ecological responses providing detailed guidance to water resource and ecosystem managers would not be possible while most investigations will not have the available resources to employ a coupled 3d hydrodynamic ecological reservoir model to investigate impacts on the downstream river ecology results illustrate the value of simple reservoir monitoring to inform downstream river modelling ounissi and bouchareb 2013 powers et al 2014 given the strong control of do on nutrient export from the reservoir measuring reservoir profiles of temperature and do can provide insight into the internal structure of the water column and the drivers of biochemical export then in lieu of a full hydrodynamic model relating nutrient export to the temperature and do values especially in the hypolimnion can provide crucial information for managing downstream ecosystems further modelling of the deadwood river basin could be incorporated into the hierarchical framework to improve understanding and decision making by accounting for aspects of disturbance discontinuity and habitat incorporation a 2 dimensional 2d hydraulic model would provide coupled spatial data for water depth and flow velocity that could identify zones of improved life stage habitat however the method of lamouroux et al 1995 could be used in conjunction with the results of the 1d model to provide statistical distributions of flow velocities if necessary a 2d model would additionally increase the spatial understanding of tributary mixing and thermal distribution throughout the river domain future steps to linking ecosystem performance to physical processes would include development of a bioenergetics model for species of interest over the extent of their life stages providing an opportunity to evaluate reduced fish populations owing to discontinuity and fragmentation loss of anadromous passage and juvenile production restoration initiatives could assess ecosystem productivity through increased floodplain connectivity introduction of fish ladder structures and thermal remediation via the introduction of multilevel dam outlets or intermittent spillway operation previous investigations have employed either complex hydrodynamic reservoir river models parkinson 2003 lindim et al 2011 deus et al 2013 marti et al 2016 or a cascading study approach wen et al 2016 cunha santino et al 2017 to determine singular water quality and or biological response parameters however this study examines how the annual hydrologic regime controls the reservoir structure and in turn conditions the many physiochemical parameters that impact the downstream river ecosystem in addition it illustrates that small changes to dam operations can have substantive cascading ecosystem effects at various trophic levels the direct transferability of these model configurations and results is limited given the unique climatic and geomorphic setting yet the methodology of hierarchical models can be leveraged for use in coupled reservoir river systems worldwide this is important as climate change clean energy production and increasing demand for water resources will require new dam construction to support global communities prior to construction a system of cascading models can be implemented that simulates the ecological effects of reservoir management and further habitat disturbance allowing for evaluation of virtual dam designs and operations that reduce ecosystem impacts or improve ecosystem performance 6 conclusions results from deadwood reservoir and river models illustrate that solely monitoring hydraulic properties is insufficient for quantifying the impacts of reservoir operations on riverine ecosystems and a holistic systems approach is required reservoirs create a break in the river continuum causing a reset of environmental constituents in which the degree of resetting depends upon the annual hydrologic conditions reservoir operations size and its location in the watershed in the deadwood basin the hydraulics temperature nutrients and biological productivity under the regulated flow regime are comparable or superior to the unregulated cases for dry and average years wet hydrologic years are detrimental to the downstream ecosystem for all cases under such constraints in the deadwood river system flow releases should focus on promoting productivity and preserving natural temperature cues for organisms rather than minimum instream flows provided that flow properties including refugia and connectivity are within natural seasonal ranges understanding the impacts of hydrologic forcing and reservoir operations on downstream riverine ecosystem and habitat quality requires a set of integrated hierarchical models to link the physical processes with the appropriate biological responses reservoir properties are controlled by climatic forcing and thus an adaptive management strategy for reservoir operations would prove more effective than fixed minimum instream flows in protecting riverine ecosystem functions and fulfilling reservoir objectives this will increase management responsibilities but will provide decision making capacity driven by data and modelling based information that is agreeable to basin stakeholders

25347,using network analysis for making predictions about food web dynamics is one of the major challenges in systems ecology since there are several notoriously difficult methodological problems with food webs only a comparative perspective can help we study a standard database for trophic flow networks and analyse the correlation between structure and dynamics in strictly hierarchical food webs directed acyclic graphs dags to characterize the structural information about trophic nodes in food webs their positional importance we use 8 topological indices that had been developed for quantifying dags 3 indices related to status s and 5 indices related to the keystone index k for dynamics we use the ks keystoneness index that quantifies the importance of trophic nodes in the food web considering also carbon flows and biomass we statistically compare the structural and dynamical importance of each network node and find that the k indices are much better predictors of ks than the s indices based on these results we suggest that functional studies have to consider both bottom up and top down effects as well as indirect effects that are dampening with distance we suggest that this kind of study can be helpful to better understand the relevance and applicability of network analysis an otherwise popular research methodology with continuously increasing predictive power keywords food web centrality network analysis 1 introduction food web models are helpful to integrate and represent a large amount of ecological data they are potentially applicable in many areas from system based conservation to sustainable fisheries management belgrano 2005 yet being data demanding their applicability critically depends on availability of large ecological datasets e g link et al 2008 while their complexity usually result in their low predictive power e g harvey et al 2003 nevertheless food web models represent tools increasingly used for integrating ecological data and quantifying ecosystem properties villasante et al 2016 tam et al 2017 in ecological network analysis trophic links can be considered as either directed or undirected if links are considered directed and typically also weighted the approach focuses on material flows from producers towards top predators and helps to understand for example the community biomagnification effects of pollution at the basis of the food web e g kelly et al 2007 if links are considered undirected the approach is broader also taking into account counter effects like trophic cascades i e a affecting c by a eating b eating c that spreads in top down direction or exploitative competition i e a affecting b by a and b feeding on c that spreads horizontally in the food web this latter approach allows to address general issues like identifying keystone species paine 1966 mills et al 1993 in food webs e g jordán 2009 even if link direction is considered loops may appear in food webs a eats b eats c eats a these directed loops represent challenges from the viewpoint of biological interpretation of food web data e g the frequency of loops may depend on aggregation level see also fenchel 1988 it may cause complications from the viewpoint of dynamical consequences by having demographic and life history effects e g polis and strong 1996 and methodological difficulties from the viewpoint of network analysis some methods simply cannot be used for networks containing loops e g jordán et al 1999 if there is no directed loop in a food web i e it is a directed acyclic graph dag methods developed for the analysis of hierarchical networks can be applied methods for analysing strictly hierarchical food webs are traditionally rich focusing on stability probability of reliability macarthur 1955 importance of species status harary 1961 reliable networks flow reliability jordán and molnár 1999 critical positions dominator trees allesina and bodini 2004 allesina et al 2006 secondary extinction keystone species quince et al 2005 and trophic height effective trophic level scotti et al 2009 we may note that the attempt to quantify the relative importance of species in ecological communities harary 1961 based on their network position was a pioneering effort not followed by biologists for decades mills et al 1993 and even the qualitative discussion of importance came only years later see paine 1966 it is still an open question how the typical structure of food web hierarchies emerge and how it is related to the functioning of ecological systems and their sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic sources of disturbance after decades of research how network topology structure is exactly related to dynamics functioning for instance is not completely unravelled a large body of work relates biodiversity to ecosystem functioning this latter usually synthetized through the changes in the primary productivity loreau et al 2001 other works synthesize ecosystem functioning thorugh ecosystem wide indicators link et al 2015 however much less is known on the contribution of food web components to the functioning of the ecosystem e g d alelio et al 2016 in particular to its complex dynamics thus although the structure to function problem can be addressed at the level of the whole ecosystem global perspective loreau et al 2001 here we are interested at the local perspective i e the contribution by species and or functional groups to ecosystem functioning thus we study the relationship between the network position and the dynamical behaviour of individual network nodes in a range of high quality network models we use only directed acyclic food webs developed using ecopath with ecosim ewe christensen and walters 2004 and compare the topological properties of their nodes to their dynamics by applying eight hierarchical centrality indices harary 1961 jordán et al 1999 and one index that can be considered as a good proxy for dynamical effects libralato et al 2006a the comparative analysis of sets of food webs is of high importance from a network analysis point of view single networks can be highly sensitive to the methodology of network construction while the differences between methodologically uniform comparable networks may be more informative thus we perform statistical analyses on how structure synthesized by topological indices can predict functioning estimated using a measure of dynamical effects using a set of food web models the statistical correlations performed may take us closer to better understanding the structure to dynamics relationship at the level of individual network nodes see jordán 2009 2 data and methods before performing network analysis we modified the studied trophic networks in two ways first we deleted the non living components e g detritus second we filled the main diagonal of the trophic matrices by zeros i e cannibalistic self loops are not considered both modifications show that we focused less on energy pathways and more on interspecific interactions among living organisms following the approach of for example macarthur 1955 even having done so networks might contain directed cycles but we have selected only the ones without them dags we characterised the importance of nodes in food webs by topological 2 1 and dynamical 2 2 indices while the former consider only who eats whom relations in binary networks the latter consider also biomass and community response values the key question is the statistical relationships 2 3 between these two groups we only focused on directed acyclic food webs so we studied trophic hierarchies a subset of trophic networks 2 1 topological analyses 2 1 1 status index and its components s s δs in a hierarchy it is clear which nodes are at the top and which nodes are at the bottom of the network yet it is a matter of long interest how to quantify the relative positional importance of different nodes the status index is one of the tools for this it was introduced in sociometry for quantifying the prestige of a certain person harary 1959 and it was applied immediately in ecology for quantifying the most important species in a forest community harary 1961 the status of node i si is the sum of its distances to all other j nodes in the network its contrastatus s i is calculated in the same way but after reversing the sign of all links in the graph the net status of this node i δsi is their difference 1 δsi si s i these indices can be calculated by the cosbi graph software valentini and jordán 2010 2 1 2 keystone index and its components k kbu ktd kdir kindir the keystone index k jordán et al 1999 is derived from the status index two modifications of the s index make the k index more adapted to ecology first according to the s index the influence of node i on node j is larger with a larger dij distance in the network as it counts the sum of distance values on the contrary distance makes effects smaller in the calculations according to the k index as units effects are distributed step by step among more and more network nodes second according to the s index the bottom up network neighbourhood weakens the top down network neighbourhood as it is calculated as the effect on inferiors of node i minus the effect by superiors on node i on the contrary k calculates the sum of effects in the two directions i e the richness of the vertical network neighbourhood in the network the keystone index of a species i ki is defined as 2 k i k b u i k t d i k d i r i k i n d i r i c 1 n 1 d c 1 k b c e 1 m 1 f e 1 k t e where n is the number of predators eating species i dc is the number of prey species of its c th predator and kbc is the bottom up keystone index of the c th predator symmetrically m is the number of prey eaten by species i fe is the number of predators of its e th prey and kte is the top down keystone index of the e th prey for node i the first sum in eq 2 i e 1 dc 1 kbc quantifies the bottom up effect kbu i while the second sum i e 1 fe 1 kte quantifies the top down effect ktd i in eq 2 terms including kbc and kte i e kbc dc kte fe refer to indirect effects for node i kindir i while terms not containing kbc and kte i e 1 dc 1 fe refer to direct ones kdir i both kbu i ktd i and kindir i kdir i equals ki so the k index can be separated either into a bottom up and a top down component or into a direct and an indirect component the degree of a node in a network d characterises only the number of its connected neighbour points while the keystone index gives information also on how these neighbours are connected to their neighbours the k index therefore emphasises vertical over horizontal interactions e g trophic cascades as opposed to apparent competition but also characterises positional importance by separating indirect from direct as well as bottom up from top down effects in food webs jordán 2001 its conceptual counterpart is the trophic field of a species and has been applied several times in network analysis e g ortiz and wolff 2002 quince et al 2005 its important feature is the sensitivity to both distance and degree it quantifies positionality at an intermediate scale rather than giving very local or very global information jordán and scheuring 2002 these indices can also be calculated by the cosbi graph software valentini and jordán 2010 according to some recent studies these hierarchical indices are promising for future applications see mcdonald madden et al 2016 and also relatively insensitive to data sampling issues see fedor and vasas 2009 2 2 dynamical analyses the dynamical simulation of food webs needs a number of parameters and it is quite laborious e g okey 2004 complex and realistic dynamical models can be built for particular trophic networks but building a large number of dynamical models for comparative purposes is not feasible also because of difficulties in comparing results for this reason we decided to use the keystoneness index ks libralato et al 2006a the ks index is based on the mixed trophic impact mti analysis of ulanowicz and puccia 1990 that allows quantifying both direct and indirect trophic effects among network nodes additionally ks includes information about biomass values of species this is not present in topological indices thus resulting in a quantitative indicator of the biomass weighted impact of a species on the food web libralato et al 2006a considering the keystone concept as defined in power et al 1996 the ks measures the overall community response due to the disturbance of species i it measures how the change in biomass of species i is affecting the biomass of other species in the ecosystem in particular in libralato et al 2006a it was shown that elements of the mti matrix correlated well with the observed relative changes in biomass obtained by perturbing the group in long term dynamic simulations on the basis of this the ks index is used here as a proxy considering the dynamics of both interactions weights on links and network nodes it contains information on the biomass of functional groups and quantifies the food web effects of perturbing a group calculations can be performed in the ecopath with ecosim ewe modelling framework christensen and walters 2004 2 3 statistical analyses we were interested in quantifying the correlations between the 8 topological index studied three related to s and five related to k and the ks index as a proxy for dynamics given that topological indexes like s and k consider only binary networks i e no weights on links while ks considers a weighted network with prey predator interaction strengths their comparison is not trivial since the s indices were not normally distributed and linear transformation only works for weighted data and in most of the cases the relationships between ks and our target indices were not linear too the assumptions of the pearson product moment correlation were markedly violated thus we used the less powerful non parametric spearman s rank correlation see fig a1 in appendix a spearman s correlation coefficient rho ρ measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two ranked variables when it is 0 there is no correlation between the variables when its value equals 1 or 1 it means the possibly strongest positive or negative relationship respectively between the variables we used the r software for analysis r core team 2017 2 4 the database topological analysis was performed for all available food webs that 1 are described by the ewe methodology christensen and walters 2004 2 have been characterised by the keystoneness value ks libralato et al 2006a for each node and this is given in the literature heymans et al 2014 3 are directed acyclic graphs dags and 4 have at least n 15 nodes of the 400 food webs that are described using ewe condition 1 ks was calculated for 104 networks condition 2 we found that 35 of them are dags condition 3 and 18 of these had at least 15 nodes condition 4 yet the correlation analyses have been performed also for all of the 35 food webs in order to illustrate scale dependence i e how sensitive the results are to changes in n table 1 shows the list of the 18 trophic networks used for this analysis 3 results the general question we had is how to use food web topology to predict ecosystem functioning in particular our key aim was to understand the relationship between certain topological indices that are used for dags and a more functional index that goes beyond topology ks different topological indices correlated differently with the ks measure see for example ks vs kdir and ks vs δs in fig 1 while the correlations between ks and the other topological indices are reported in fig b1 in appendix b none of them correlated negatively with ks an overview is shown in fig 2 k and kdir are the topological indices best correlating to functioning in the studied trophic hierarchies other keystone indices k family have weak predictive power but still better than all status indices s family that show no correlation fig 2 the indirect keystone component kindir also correlates significantly similarly to kdir this suggests that direct and indirect effects are of commensurable importance patten 1991 if pure network position is used as a proxy for functionality we have to consider them both instead of overemphasizing node degree see e g solé and montoya 2001 correlations scale with the size of networks in terms of number of nodes n for small networks the correlation values are more diverse see fig 3 fig c1 in appendix c and fig d1 in appendix d for results on scale dependence these small networks are different also biologically as they represent larger more aggregated trophic functional groups while larger networks are of higher resolution containing species or smaller aggregates fig 3 shows the scale dependent statistical behaviour of networks but small and large networks are different also biologically beyond their size also the nature of the functional groups are different lower resolution groups in smaller networks we observed here scale dependence in larger networks smaller rho values can be significant biologically speaking structure is less predictive for larger trophic groups in the smaller webs and more predictive for smaller groups including species in the larger webs as n increases smaller rho values can be significant fig c1 in appendix c this result is important because it highlights the need for detailed network models for inferring functionality from structure e g d alelio et al 2016 out of 35 networks kdir correlated significantly with ks in 21 food webs in 13 of the rest there is no correlation between ks and any of the topological indices there is a single food web where kdir does not show significant correlation but there is another index that does kbu s and δs in the san miguel bay food web if we consider only the 18 larger networks i e n 14 see fig 3b we can observe that kdir significantly correlates with ks in 15 of them for all correlation coefficients see table e1 in appendix e fig 4 illustrates this by showing large red and small white nodes in the food web of the new caledonia loyalty islands atoll ecosystem bozec et al 2004 where node size corresponds to the ks index and node colour corresponds to kdir ecosystem size i e the number of functional groups used for describing the food web was already identified as an important factor influencing ecosystem indicators e g heymans et al 2014 however results presented here shed light on the possible role of biological resolution implicitly represented in food webs to explain the biodiversity and functioning relationship tilman 2001 loreau et al 2001 and to support the need of multitrophic expression to increase functionality soliveres et al 2016 separating the keystone effects by direction top down and bottom up impacts results in weak correlations for both indices fig 2 see ktd and kbu this means that for the structure to dynamics relationship it is essential to take a chutes and ladders view hunter and price 1992 i e to consider both top down and bottom up effects simultaneously here we focused on the structural and dynamical importance of network nodes the community effect of disturbing a particular node i but there are methods for analysing the effect of a particular node i to another node j these consider direct and indirect effects based on mixed trophic impact analysis mti ulanowicz and puccia 1990 and matrix algebra jordán 2009 trophic hierarchies directed acyclic food webs are well defined relatively simple trophic networks we can conclude that their topology may well predict their dynamics if appropriate indices are used based on fig 2 we can suggest 1 to consider both bottom up and top down processes in parallel 2 to calculate their sum instead of difference k better than s and 3 to consider longer distance effects weaker k better than s 4 discussion following a classical paper pimm 1980 there has been continuous interest in how food web dynamics is related to perturbations of particular network positions studying this link between structure and functioning has relevance to methodological developments ortiz and wolff 2002 jordán et al 2008 conservation and fisheries management ortiz et al 2015 navia et al 2016 a better understanding of keystone species complexes ortiz et al 2017 and to the general understanding of stability rooney et al 2006 using the ks index as a proxy for dynamical behaviour is a first step towards comparative holistic studies on eco dynamics clearly the most important future development would be to build real simulation models for large numbers of comparable food webs since k and ks are not totally independent like any pair of network indices it is another challenge for the future to clarify and improve the optimal statistical approaches to correlative analyses for example when trying to understand structure to dynamics relationships in food webs yet our results show that there is hope for using simple and fast topological approaches to make quite reasonable predictions about the dynamical functioning of ecological networks this kind of computational systems ecology framework can provide a basis for more efficient systems based conservation efforts moreover such framework helps improving our quantitative knowledge on the ecological properties of networks that are often considered useless in environmental assessment tam et al 2017 but might become relevant as surveillance indicators in the future shephard et al 2015 acknowledgments we thank all the authors of the ewe food web models used

in binary networks the latter consider also biomass and community response values the key question is the statistical relationships 2 3 between these two groups we only focused on directed acyclic food webs so we studied trophic hierarchies a subset of trophic networks 2 1 topological analyses 2 1 1 status index and its components s s δs in a hierarchy it is clear which nodes are at the top and which nodes are at the bottom of the network yet it is a matter of long interest how to quantify the relative positional importance of different nodes the status index is one of the tools for this it was introduced in sociometry for quantifying the prestige of a certain person harary 1959 and it was applied immediately in ecology for quantifying the most important species in a forest community harary 1961 the status of node i si is the sum of its distances to all other j nodes in the network its contrastatus s i is calculated in the same way but after reversing the sign of all links in the graph the net status of this node i δsi is their difference 1 δsi si s i these indices can be calculated by the cosbi graph software valentini and jordán 2010 2 1 2 keystone index and its components k kbu ktd kdir kindir the keystone index k jordán et al 1999 is derived from the status index two modifications of the s index make the k index more adapted to ecology first according to the s index the influence of node i on node j is larger with a larger dij distance in the network as it counts the sum of distance values on the contrary distance makes effects smaller in the calculations according to the k index as units effects are distributed step by step among more and more network nodes second according to the s index the bottom up network neighbourhood weakens the top down network neighbourhood as it is calculated as the effect on inferiors of node i minus the effect by superiors on node i on the contrary k calculates the sum of effects in the two directions i e the richness of the vertical network neighbourhood in the network the keystone index of a species i ki is defined as 2 k i k b u i k t d i k d i r i k i n d i r i c 1 n 1 d c 1 k b c e 1 m 1 f e 1 k t e where n is the number of predators eating species i dc is the number of prey species of its c th predator and kbc is the bottom up keystone index of the c th predator symmetrically m is the number of prey eaten by species i fe is the number of predators of its e th prey and kte is the top down keystone index of the e th prey for node i the first sum in eq 2 i e 1 dc 1 kbc quantifies the bottom up effect kbu i while the second sum i e 1 fe 1 kte quantifies the top down effect ktd i in eq 2 terms including kbc and kte i e kbc dc kte fe refer to indirect effects for node i kindir i while terms not containing kbc and kte i e 1 dc 1 fe refer to direct ones kdir i both kbu i ktd i and kindir i kdir i equals ki so the k index can be separated either into a bottom up and a top down component or into a direct and an indirect component the degree of a node in a network d characterises only the number of its connected neighbour points while the keystone index gives information also on how these neighbours are connected to their neighbours the k index therefore emphasises vertical over horizontal interactions e g trophic cascades as opposed to apparent competition but also characterises positional importance by separating indirect from direct as well as bottom up from top down effects in food webs jordán 2001 its conceptual counterpart is the trophic field of a species and has been applied several times in network analysis e g ortiz and wolff 2002 quince et al 2005 its important feature is the sensitivity to both distance and degree it quantifies positionality at an intermediate scale rather than giving very local or very global information jordán and scheuring 2002 these indices can also be calculated by the cosbi graph software valentini and jordán 2010 according to some recent studies these hierarchical indices are promising for future applications see mcdonald madden et al 2016 and also relatively insensitive to data sampling issues see fedor and vasas 2009 2 2 dynamical analyses the dynamical simulation of food webs needs a number of parameters and it is quite laborious e g okey 2004 complex and realistic dynamical models can be built for particular trophic networks but building a large number of dynamical models for comparative purposes is not feasible also because of difficulties in comparing results for this reason we decided to use the keystoneness index ks libralato et al 2006a the ks index is based on the mixed trophic impact mti analysis of ulanowicz and puccia 1990 that allows quantifying both direct and indirect trophic effects among network nodes additionally ks includes information about biomass values of species this is not present in topological indices thus resulting in a quantitative indicator of the biomass weighted impact of a species on the food web libralato et al 2006a considering the keystone concept as defined in power et al 1996 the ks measures the overall community response due to the disturbance of species i it measures how the change in biomass of species i is affecting the biomass of other species in the ecosystem in particular in libralato et al 2006a it was shown that elements of the mti matrix correlated well with the observed relative changes in biomass obtained by perturbing the group in long term dynamic simulations on the basis of this the ks index is used here as a proxy considering the dynamics of both interactions weights on links and network nodes it contains information on the biomass of functional groups and quantifies the food web effects of perturbing a group calculations can be performed in the ecopath with ecosim ewe modelling framework christensen and walters 2004 2 3 statistical analyses we were interested in quantifying the correlations between the 8 topological index studied three related to s and five related to k and the ks index as a proxy for dynamics given that topological indexes like s and k consider only binary networks i e no weights on links while ks considers a weighted network with prey predator interaction strengths their comparison is not trivial since the s indices were not normally distributed and linear transformation only works for weighted data and in most of the cases the relationships between ks and our target indices were not linear too the assumptions of the pearson product moment correlation were markedly violated thus we used the less powerful non parametric spearman s rank correlation see fig a1 in appendix a spearman s correlation coefficient rho ρ measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two ranked variables when it is 0 there is no correlation between the variables when its value equals 1 or 1 it means the possibly strongest positive or negative relationship respectively between the variables we used the r software for analysis r core team 2017 2 4 the database topological analysis was performed for all available food webs that 1 are described by the ewe methodology christensen and walters 2004 2 have been characterised by the keystoneness value ks libralato et al 2006a for each node and this is given in the literature heymans et al 2014 3 are directed acyclic graphs dags and 4 have at least n 15 nodes of the 400 food webs that are described using ewe condition 1 ks was calculated for 104 networks condition 2 we found that 35 of them are dags condition 3 and 18 of these had at least 15 nodes condition 4 yet the correlation analyses have been performed also for all of the 35 food webs in order to illustrate scale dependence i e how sensitive the results are to changes in n table 1 shows the list of the 18 trophic networks used for this analysis 3 results the general question we had is how to use food web topology to predict ecosystem functioning in particular our key aim was to understand the relationship between certain topological indices that are used for dags and a more functional index that goes beyond topology ks different topological indices correlated differently with the ks measure see for example ks vs kdir and ks vs δs in fig 1 while the correlations between ks and the other topological indices are reported in fig b1 in appendix b none of them correlated negatively with ks an overview is shown in fig 2 k and kdir are the topological indices best correlating to functioning in the studied trophic hierarchies other keystone indices k family have weak predictive power but still better than all status indices s family that show no correlation fig 2 the indirect keystone component kindir also correlates significantly similarly to kdir this suggests that direct and indirect effects are of commensurable importance patten 1991 if pure network position is used as a proxy for functionality we have to consider them both instead of overemphasizing node degree see e g solé and montoya 2001 correlations scale with the size of networks in terms of number of nodes n for small networks the correlation values are more diverse see fig 3 fig c1 in appendix c and fig d1 in appendix d for results on scale dependence these small networks are different also biologically as they represent larger more aggregated trophic functional groups while larger networks are of higher resolution containing species or smaller aggregates fig 3 shows the scale dependent statistical behaviour of networks but small and large networks are different also biologically beyond their size also the nature of the functional groups are different lower resolution groups in smaller networks we observed here scale dependence in larger networks smaller rho values can be significant biologically speaking structure is less predictive for larger trophic groups in the smaller webs and more predictive for smaller groups including species in the larger webs as n increases smaller rho values can be significant fig c1 in appendix c this result is important because it highlights the need for detailed network models for inferring functionality from structure e g d alelio et al 2016 out of 35 networks kdir correlated significantly with ks in 21 food webs in 13 of the rest there is no correlation between ks and any of the topological indices there is a single food web where kdir does not show significant correlation but there is another index that does kbu s and δs in the san miguel bay food web if we consider only the 18 larger networks i e n 14 see fig 3b we can observe that kdir significantly correlates with ks in 15 of them for all correlation coefficients see table e1 in appendix e fig 4 illustrates this by showing large red and small white nodes in the food web of the new caledonia loyalty islands atoll ecosystem bozec et al 2004 where node size corresponds to the ks index and node colour corresponds to kdir ecosystem size i e the number of functional groups used for describing the food web was already identified as an important factor influencing ecosystem indicators e g heymans et al 2014 however results presented here shed light on the possible role of biological resolution implicitly represented in food webs to explain the biodiversity and functioning relationship tilman 2001 loreau et al 2001 and to support the need of multitrophic expression to increase functionality soliveres et al 2016 separating the keystone effects by direction top down and bottom up impacts results in weak correlations for both indices fig 2 see ktd and kbu this means that for the structure to dynamics relationship it is essential to take a chutes and ladders view hunter and price 1992 i e to consider both top down and bottom up effects simultaneously here we focused on the structural and dynamical importance of network nodes the community effect of disturbing a particular node i but there are methods for analysing the effect of a particular node i to another node j these consider direct and indirect effects based on mixed trophic impact analysis mti ulanowicz and puccia 1990 and matrix algebra jordán 2009 trophic hierarchies directed acyclic food webs are well defined relatively simple trophic networks we can conclude that their topology may well predict their dynamics if appropriate indices are used based on fig 2 we can suggest 1 to consider both bottom up and top down processes in parallel 2 to calculate their sum instead of difference k better than s and 3 to consider longer distance effects weaker k better than s 4 discussion following a classical paper pimm 1980 there has been continuous interest in how food web dynamics is related to perturbations of particular network positions studying this link between structure and functioning has relevance to methodological developments ortiz and wolff 2002 jordán et al 2008 conservation and fisheries management ortiz et al 2015 navia et al 2016 a better understanding of keystone species complexes ortiz et al 2017 and to the general understanding of stability rooney et al 2006 using the ks index as a proxy for dynamical behaviour is a first step towards comparative holistic studies on eco dynamics clearly the most important future development would be to build real simulation models for large numbers of comparable food webs since k and ks are not totally independent like any pair of network indices it is another challenge for the future to clarify and improve the optimal statistical approaches to correlative analyses for example when trying to understand structure to dynamics relationships in food webs yet our results show that there is hope for using simple and fast topological approaches to make quite reasonable predictions about the dynamical functioning of ecological networks this kind of computational systems ecology framework can provide a basis for more efficient systems based conservation efforts moreover such framework helps improving our quantitative knowledge on the ecological properties of networks that are often considered useless in

25348,the capacity of community ecology for making quantitative predictions is often limited by incomplete empirical information which precludes obtaining reasonable estimates of model parameters this is particularly the case for communities with large species richness s since it is practically impossible to perform the s monoculture experiments to obtain the species carrying capacities plus the s s 1 2 pairwise experiments required to estimate the entire set of interspecific interaction coefficients of the interaction or community matrix however quantitative predictive tools are vital for understanding the fate of ecological communities here we derive an analytical approximation for predicting the relative yield total or equivalently the mean relative yield as a function of the mean intensity of the interspecific competition and the species richness the rationale is that with incomplete information on model parameters it seems more reasonable to attempt to predict macroscopic or mean quantities defined for the whole community of competing species rather than making detailed microscopic predictions like species abundances this method with only a fraction of the model parameters carrying capacities and competition coefficients is able to predict accurately empirical measurements covering a wide variety of taxa algae plants protozoa etc our aim with this approach is to contribute in making community ecology a more quantitative and predictive science we argue that such parsimonious modeling is preferable than more realistic complex theories involving additional parameters which can be very difficult to measure keywords quantitative lotka volterra competition theory biodiversity ecosystem functioning experiments 1 introduction competition plays a key role in structuring ecological communities morin 2011 may 1973 the classical theoretical framework for competition is the lotka volterra competition theory lvct lotka 1925 volterra 1926 the lotka volterra equations of competition describe the population dynamics of s species competing for some common resource in a community as 1 1 y i d y i d t r i 1 j 1 s α y i j j k i i 1 s where yi is the yield of species i either its population density biomass density biovol etc ri is its maximum per capita growth rate ki is the carrying capacity of species i the asymptotic value the yield reaches when the species is isolated from the other competing species and α ij is the coefficient of competition of species j over species i the intraspecific competition coefficients of a species with itself α ii are customarily taken equal to 1 the lvct can be thought as the first order or linear approximation in a taylor series expansion of the per capita growth rates of species about the equilibrium points of a more complex and general theory of competition volterra 1926 volterra 1931 for large values of s the focus of lotka volterra competition theory has been almost exclusively on community stability and species coexistence not on making quantitative predictions to be tested against experimental data like relative species abundance in equilibrium hubbel 2002 a main difficulty for quantitative analysis of the equilibrium state is how to obtain the set of parameters ki α ij of eq 1 which are relevant at equilibrium a straightforward procedure is to perform a the ssingle species or monoculture experiments and from each of them to estimate ki as the asymptotic biomass density of species i and b the s s 1 2 pairwise experiments and for each of them from the pair of the biculture yields bi and bj infer α ij and α ji see below among several practical limitations of this approach the principal one is that it is feasible provided s is not too large since the number of required experiments grows as s 2 thus for large values of s only a fraction of these experiments is commonly carried out and consequently we have an incomplete knowledge of model parameters here we test the lotka volterra competition theory as a quantitatively predictive tool for equilibrium with an incomplete knowledge of the s 2 model parameters as it usually happens in real life therefore we do not attempt of making detailed microscopic predictions for each species in a community like the species yields yi that require the full set of model parameters rather our goal is to predict aggregate or average productivity metrics thus we focus on global or macroscopic quantities for the whole community of competing species in order to have a robust description independent of how the yield is measured in different communities population density biomass density biovol etc and capable of making comparisons among widely different taxa these macroscopic quantities are built from relative yields yi yi ki i e the species yield in mixture normalized by its yield in monoculture the first macroscopic quantity we consider is the sum of the s relative yields or relative yield total ryt 2 r y t i 1 s y i this index allows comparing community productivity on a relative basis agricultural science is an example of an area where it is widely used to determine productivity in crop mixtures de wit 1970 aryt 1 denotes species complementarity leading thus to increased total resource use loreau and hector 2001 this in turn implies that the yield performance will be better in polyculture than in monoculture a phenomenon termed as overyielding vandermeer 1989 there is a large ecological literature on the subject vandermeer 1989 donald 1963 trenbath 1974 tilman 1999 experiments with plants have shown that overyielding varied greatly depending on the functional characteristics of the species involved huston 2000 fridley 2003 and the biotic and abiotic environment fridley 2003 fridley 2001 however many experimental studies found a significant increase of community biomass with increasing biodiversity as reviewed in schmid et al 2002 moreover there is consensus that at least some minimum number of species is essential for ecosystem functioning and that a larger number of species is probably required for maintaining the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments loreau et al 2001 the ryt divided by s is equal to the mean relative yield mry another measure of community productivity which can be used to assess the impact of biodiversity loss on the ability of ecosystems to provide ecological services another macroscopic quantity is the mean intensity of inter specific competition a to mathematically define it we rewrite the equilibrium solutions of 1 in terms of relative yields yi as 3 j 1 s a y i j j 1 i 1 s where aij α ijkj ki notice that the diagonal terms of the interaction matrix a corresponding to intra specific competition remain equal to 1 since aii α iiki ki α ii 1 thus a is defined as the mean over the off diagonal elements of a 4 a a i j we derive an analytical approximate expression for the ryt as a function of the mean competition intensity a and the species richness s we show that this formula with and incomplete knowledge of lotka volterra competition parameters reproduces quite accurately the empirical ryt and mry obtained from experiments across diverse taxa hence this approach becomes particularly useful to predict aggregate average productivity metrics for ecological communities involving many coexisting species in which at best only a fraction of these model parameters can be experimentally obtained we end by discussing possible applications of this framework that should be regarded as a step in a parsimonious modelling strategy aiming at making community ecology quantitative and predictive science in terms of quantities that can be measured experimentally 2 methods and materials solving eq 3 for a competition matrix which has all its off diagonal terms equal to a and the diagonal ones equal to 1 1 1 that is a kind of mean field approximation in the space of interaction parameters for the competition matrix i e all the off diagonal interspecific interaction coefficients replaced by their mean value a we obtain 5 y 1 1 s 1 a an estimation of a can be obtained either from the statistical sampling of pairwise experiments or from knowing the intensity of resource overlap among different species in a community competing for this these resource s macarthur and levins 1967 therefore we obtain an approximate expression for the relative yield total produced by the simplified competition matrix as a function of a and s 6 r y t a s s 1 s 1 a to test the approximated formula 6 for the ryt we searched for experiments that for a given community of s species besides measuring the yields of i these s species in competition yi one treatment also measured the yields of ii species in isolation or monocultures ki in all or at least some of the s treatments and of iii species in bicultures bi in all or at least some of the s s 1 2 treatments i ii serve to compute the relative yields yi and from them using 2 the ryt from i iii we compute the bi bi ki and inverting 3 for s 2 we can extract the competition coefficients for the pair of species i jas 7 a i j 1 b i b j a j i 1 b j b i and then by taken their mean obtain a there are lots of published experimental studies that measured all these quantities for s 2 but the number decreases quickly as s grows in fact for s 8 we couldn t find an experiment in which the totality of the s s 1 2 treatments was carried out but only a percentage fe of the them see table 1 the proposed method aims at providing ryt precisely for cases in which fe 100 and thus we have incomplete information on model parameters therefore we took the mean a i j over the subset of pairwise experiments that were carried out see next section the lotka volterra competition theory has also been criticized because predictions in general assume that the community is at equilibrium a theoretical ideal rarely achieved in natural communities wiens 1984 and because interspecific interactions different from competition like facilitation or cooperation are quite frequent in nature and spoil the applicability of the theory bruno et al 2003 therefore two additional requirement on the experiments were that the species biomasses vs time seemed to stabilize at an equilibrium state and we preferably take into account the last measurement of the temporal series the dominant interspecific interaction was competition i e we discarded those experiments in which facilitation or positive interactions between species dominated over competition we found in the literature a total of 77 experiments verifying the above requirements some of these experiments were completed in laboratory and others in the field under natural conditions see table 1 and s1 for a comprehensive list of experiments used and their references 52 included s 2 species 2 2 all these pairwise experiments verify the stability condition for the coexistence of both species in equilibrium i e aij 1 see online supplementary table s1 which also include the corresponding references see table s1 and 25 with s 2 ranging from s 3 to s 32 kastendiek 1982 hooper and dukes 2004 picasso et al 2008 huisman et al 1999 neill 1974 kroh and stephenson 1980 aarssen 1988 vandermeer 1969 roxburgh and wilson 2000 wilson and keddy 1986 hector et al 2010 marquard et al 2009 see table 1 box 1 we end this section with three comments remarks about the method we are proposing first our goal in designing the present framework is given a stable or quasi stable community for which only a fraction of the model parameters are known to explain ex post the productivity by using the mean interaction parameter estimated from the available monoculture and biculture experiments second under the condition that only a fraction of the interaction matrix a is known the equilibrium state is undefined and we don t have to worry about issues like the stability or feasibility of this equilibrium state 3 3 in such cases in which the entire set of model parameters is known and the equilibrium state is well defined it can happen that the estimated interaction matrix a leads to an equilibrium state in which not all the species coexist that is the solution to eq 3 eq 5 is a fixed point of the system but this fixed point can be unstable or unfeasible i e involving negative species yields in the latter case eq 3 does not hold for the full set of species however we still have the freedom to modify the parameters within their confidence intervals in such a way to attempt to transform the unstable equilibrium into a stable one this solution was shown to work for grassland experiments fort et al 2017 halty et al 2017 this method does not rely on microscopic information like the detailed equilibrium state but on the ryt which is an aggregate quantity in fact we have shown that the ryt plays the role of a global mode for the lotka volterra competition equations whose dynamics is approximately described by the one dimensional logistic equation and that this approximation becomes exact in the limit of s tending to fort 2015 therefore in spite possible strange attractors or cycles affecting the species relative yields the relative yield total will converge to a fixed point for large values of the species richness third strictly speaking our framework cannot be used to predict the productivity of a combination of species ex ante this is because it would not be possible to predict if this particular species combination was stable and feasible based only on the mean interaction parameter for doing this we need the entire interaction matrix a to compute the equilibrium state through eq 5 however this framework can be used to provide an estimate of what would be the productivity of an artificially designed community in the case that it is stable and feasible or it can also be used to predict the impact on a given community of species loss affecting both s and a 3 results and discussion when knowledge of model parameters was incomplete the recipe we use for estimating the experimental average interspecific competition coefficienta to feed eq 6 and the experimental ryt which has demonstrated to work quite well is as follows let m be the subset of the s monoculture experiments and b the subset of the s s 1 2 biculture or pairwise experiments that were carried out first the average relative yields in biculture b m b is computed from the measured yields of subsets m b second using eq 7 a m b can be approximated as 8 a m b 1 b m b b m b inserting a m b into eq 6 we get the corresponding theoretical relative yield total to compare vs the experimental ryt m the subscript m is to emphasize that this quantity is estimated from the subset of available monoculture experiments eq 8 was also used in those experiments in which only mean yields for mono and bicultures were available and we approximated b m b by b b k m see table 1 there are at least three different ways to estimate ryt m the first and straightforward procedure is by summing the available empirical relative yields yi m a second one is by approximating ryt m s y k m e g note i in table 1 a third estimation that only requires knowing the total yield of the s species polyculture iyi is ryt m iyi k m e g note j in table 1 box 2 illustrates this calculation of a and how to estimate ryt m from table 1 and table s1 which includes results for s 2 species we see that eq 6 predicts the observed ryt with a relative error ε te of 1 or less 10 or less for 35 76 of the experiments this accuracy is remarkable since the experimental se for such quantities are in general greater than ε te in the interval 2 43 mean 21 4 4 the standard experimental error for the ryt when experimenters do not provide it was calculated through the propagation of error variance formula from the errors of ki and yi therefore our formula allows predicting the ryt simply from the knowledge of the mean empirical competition strength for 12 out of the 25 experiments listed in table 1 the knowledge of model parameters was incomplete i e fe 100 notice that as s increases the fraction fe of the s s 1 2 experiments required to estimate the experimental quantities also decreases a possible source explaining some of theε te errors is that our approach requires the coexistence of species in pairwise experiments in order to compute the corresponding competition coefficients by eq 7 obviously this procedure doesn t work if one of the species completely displaces the other some of the experimental data used in table 1 include pairwise experiments in which the yield of one of the species was very small i e the experiment was at the border between biculture and monoculture an example is ref vandermeer 1969 this could explain why it yields the largest ε te 49 6 as shown in table 1 in order to improve accuracy an alternative would be to discard those experiments and use an incomplete competition matrix and eq 8 fig 1 shows he ryt measured in these 77 experiments as well as their theoretical predictions by eq 6 as a function of both s and a it is known that the mean field approximation becomes exact in the artificial limit s μ pathria 1996 thus one expects that eq 6 becomes better the larger the number of interacting species s however we observe that eq 6 reproduces with great accuracy also the experimental ryt for s 2 this good agreement for s 2 can be understood because the quantities used for computing a and the ryt are the same bi see appendix a 3 1 the dependency of the yield with the species richness and the mean intensity of competition notice that the ryt increases with s a phenomenon which has been observed in many empirical studies and interpreted as niche partitioning cardinale et al 2012 that is different species can use resources in a complementary way and therefore more diverse communities will lead to a higher ryt however it was noticed that in spite of widespread claims about the role of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning relationships researchers have rarely provided any direct quantitative evidence that niche partitioning is responsible for higher productivity in mixtures rather many claims about niche partitioning come from qualitative interpretations of species natural histories or differences in functional traits cardinale et al 2011 the ryt 1 for the great majority of the experiments considered here especially for those with s 2 interacting species 24 out of 25 as shown in table 1 is a clear quantitative evidence of such species complementarity de wit 1970 loreau and hector 2001 for fixed mean competition parameter a eq 6 becomes a non linear saturating relationship between diversity and yield non linear saturating relationships have also been obtained in models by simulation or in other more complex models loreau 1998 schnitzer et al 2011 downing et al 2012 a novelty here is that we provide the specific functional dependency for ryt with s an hyperbolic function in fact it is worth remarking that the shape of the relationship between productivity and species diversity measured in nature is highly variable in many cases productivity shows a saturating relationship with diversity nevertheless in other cases the relationship is hump shaped where productivity peaks at intermediate diversity chase and leibold 2002 as expected notice that for fixed s the ryt and mry fig 2 both decrease with a a decrease of the total biomass with the intensity of the competition was also found by simulations of a more complex model downing et al 2012 3 2 the accuracy of the ryt approximate formula with incomplete knowledge of model parameters errors of the theoretical ryt respect to its experimental value can occur at three different levels firstly we have the error inherent to the lotka volterra competition equations which are a simplified description of the real dynamics let us call this error a level 0 error secondly even with complete knowledge of model parameters we have a level 1 error introduced by the mean field approximation consisting in replacing the set of interspecific competition coefficients by their average a thirdly when the percentage of required experiments for obtaining all the model parameters fe is less than 100 the averages to obtain the empirical a are performed over a reduced sample of available measurements introducing a sampling or level 2 error all the entries in table 1 include level 0 level 1 errors the last 12 entries include also level 2 errors fe 100 by simple inspection we observe that the relative error between theory and experiment ε te for the cases with fe 100 and fe 100 are not dramatically different hence this seems to indicate that level 2 errors are at most of the same order than level 1 errors however this is not necessarily the case since the experiments in these two sets besides differing in fe also differ in the species richness the ones in the second set involve a much larger s a more proper way to quantify the three levels of errors independently of the species richness is as follows given an experiment for which all the model parameters are known a first obtain the level 0 error by integrating the lotka volterra competition equations that result with the whole competition matrix and computing the relative yield total as the sum of the s relative yields yi for equilibrium b second to obtain level 0 level 1 errors compute the interspecific competition coefficient a that result from averaging over the entire competition matrix and calculate the corresponding relative yield total produced when inserting this a into eq 6 c third to obtain the sum of the three levels of errors take different choices for the subset m b of model parameters 5 5 of course choosing different subsets m b with fe clearly less than 100 is only possible provided the species richness s must be sufficiently large and for each one compute the average of the interspecific competition coefficients a m b and the corresponding relative yield total produced when inserting this a m binto eq 6 by comparing the resulting ε te in a and b we can get and estimate of the level 1 error whilst comparing the set of ε te obtained in b and c one for each choice of m b we can get and estimate of the level 2 error to perform this analysis we used the largest community for which we know all the s 2 parameters and thus the whole competition matrix namely the plant experiment with seven coexisting species of ref roxburgh and wilson 2000 the level 0 error that result from a is ε te 3 2 the level 0 level 1 error that results from b is the one that appears in table 1 ε te 2 5 finally we considered for c the 35 possible subsets involving three out of the seven species the number of ways of picking three species from seven species is 7 3 7 3 7 5 35 this corresponds to knowing in each case six out of the total of 42 interspecific competition coefficients i e an fe 100 7 14 3 we found that a m bvaries over these 35 subsets from 0 65 to 1 00 inserting these 35 values of a m binto eq 6 the relative errors for the theoretical ryts varied from 0 5 to 19 5 with a mean of 7 3 in summary the calculations for this particular experiment indicate that level 1 errors are negligible compared to

25348,the capacity of community ecology for making quantitative predictions is often limited by incomplete empirical information which precludes obtaining reasonable estimates of model parameters this is particularly the case for communities with large species richness s since it is practically impossible to perform the s monoculture experiments to obtain the species carrying capacities plus the s s 1 2 pairwise experiments required to estimate the entire set of interspecific interaction coefficients of the interaction or community matrix however quantitative predictive tools are vital for understanding the fate of ecological communities here we derive an analytical approximation for predicting the relative yield total or equivalently the mean relative yield as a function of the mean intensity of the interspecific competition and the species richness the rationale is that with incomplete information on model parameters it seems more reasonable to attempt to predict macroscopic or mean quantities defined for the whole community of competing species rather than making detailed microscopic predictions like species abundances this method with only a fraction of the model parameters carrying capacities and competition coefficients is able to predict accurately empirical measurements covering a wide variety of taxa algae plants protozoa etc our aim with this approach is to contribute in making community ecology a more quantitative and predictive science we argue that such parsimonious modeling is preferable than more realistic complex theories involving additional parameters which can be very difficult to measure keywords quantitative lotka volterra competition theory biodiversity ecosystem functioning experiments 1 introduction competition plays a key role in structuring ecological communities morin 2011 may 1973 the classical theoretical framework for competition is the lotka volterra competition theory lvct lotka 1925 volterra 1926 the lotka volterra equations of competition describe the population dynamics of s species competing for some common resource in a community as 1 1 y i d y i d t r i 1 j 1 s α y i j j k i i 1 s where yi is the yield of species i either its population density biomass density biovol etc ri is its maximum per capita growth rate ki is the carrying capacity of species i the asymptotic value the yield reaches when the species is isolated from the other competing species and α ij is the coefficient of competition of species j over species i the intraspecific competition coefficients of a species with itself α ii are customarily taken equal to 1 the lvct can be thought as the first order or linear approximation in a taylor series expansion of the per capita growth rates of species about the equilibrium points of a more complex and general theory of competition volterra 1926 volterra 1931 for large values of s the focus of lotka volterra competition theory has been almost exclusively on community stability and species coexistence not on making quantitative predictions to be tested against experimental data like relative species abundance in equilibrium hubbel 2002 a main difficulty for quantitative analysis of the equilibrium state is how to obtain the set of parameters ki α ij of eq 1 which are relevant at equilibrium a straightforward procedure is to perform a the ssingle species or monoculture experiments and from each of them to estimate ki as the asymptotic biomass density of species i and b the s s 1 2 pairwise experiments and for each of them from the pair of the biculture yields bi and bj infer α ij and α ji see below among several practical limitations of this approach the principal one is that it is feasible provided s is not too large since the number of required experiments grows as s 2 thus for large values of s only a fraction of these experiments is commonly carried out and consequently we have an incomplete knowledge of model parameters here we test the lotka volterra competition theory as a quantitatively predictive tool for equilibrium with an incomplete knowledge of the s 2 model parameters as it usually happens in real life therefore we do not attempt of making detailed microscopic predictions for each species in a community like the species yields yi that require the full set of model parameters rather our goal is to predict aggregate or average productivity metrics thus we focus on global or macroscopic quantities for the whole community of competing species in order to have a robust description independent of how the yield is measured in different communities population density biomass density biovol etc and capable of making comparisons among widely different taxa these macroscopic quantities are built from relative yields yi yi ki i e the species yield in mixture normalized by its yield in monoculture the first macroscopic quantity we consider is the sum of the s relative yields or relative yield total ryt 2 r y t i 1 s y i this index allows comparing community productivity on a relative basis agricultural science is an example of an area where it is widely used to determine productivity in crop mixtures de wit 1970 aryt 1 denotes species complementarity leading thus to increased total resource use loreau and hector 2001 this in turn implies that the yield performance will be better in polyculture than in monoculture a phenomenon termed as overyielding vandermeer 1989 there is a large ecological literature on the subject vandermeer 1989 donald 1963 trenbath 1974 tilman 1999 experiments with plants have shown that overyielding varied greatly depending on the functional characteristics of the species involved huston 2000 fridley 2003 and the biotic and abiotic environment fridley 2003 fridley 2001 however many experimental studies found a significant increase of community biomass with increasing biodiversity as reviewed in schmid et al 2002 moreover there is consensus that at least some minimum number of species is essential for ecosystem functioning and that a larger number of species is probably required for maintaining the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments loreau et al 2001 the ryt divided by s is equal to the mean relative yield mry another measure of community productivity which can be used to assess the impact of biodiversity loss on the ability of ecosystems to provide ecological services another macroscopic quantity is the mean intensity of inter specific competition a to mathematically define it we rewrite the equilibrium solutions of 1 in terms of relative yields yi as 3 j 1 s a y i j j 1 i 1 s where aij α ijkj ki notice that the diagonal terms of the interaction matrix a corresponding to intra specific competition remain equal to 1 since aii α iiki ki α ii 1 thus a is defined as the mean over the off diagonal elements of a 4 a a i j we derive an analytical approximate expression for the ryt as a function of the mean competition intensity a and the species richness s we show that this formula with and incomplete knowledge of lotka volterra competition parameters reproduces quite accurately the empirical ryt and mry obtained from experiments across diverse taxa hence this approach becomes particularly useful to predict aggregate average productivity metrics for ecological communities involving many coexisting species in which at best only a fraction of these model parameters can be experimentally obtained we end by discussing possible applications of this framework that should be regarded as a step in a parsimonious modelling strategy aiming at making community ecology quantitative and predictive science in terms of quantities that can be measured experimentally 2 methods and materials solving eq 3 for a competition matrix which has all its off diagonal terms equal to a and the diagonal ones equal to 1 1 1 that is a kind of mean field approximation in the space of interaction parameters for the competition matrix i e all the off diagonal interspecific interaction coefficients replaced by their mean value a we obtain 5 y 1 1 s 1 a an estimation of a can be obtained either from the statistical sampling of pairwise experiments or from knowing the intensity of resource overlap among different species in a community competing for this these resource s macarthur and levins 1967 therefore we obtain an approximate expression for the relative yield total produced by the simplified competition matrix as a function of a and s 6 r y t a s s 1 s 1 a to test the approximated formula 6 for the ryt we searched for experiments that for a given community of s species besides measuring the yields of i these s species in competition yi one treatment also measured the yields of ii species in isolation or monocultures ki in all or at least some of the s treatments and of iii species in bicultures bi in all or at least some of the s s 1 2 treatments i ii serve to compute the relative yields yi and from them using 2 the ryt from i iii we compute the bi bi ki and inverting 3 for s 2 we can extract the competition coefficients for the pair of species i jas 7 a i j 1 b i b j a j i 1 b j b i and then by taken their mean obtain a there are lots of published experimental studies that measured all these quantities for s 2 but the number decreases quickly as s grows in fact for s 8 we couldn t find an experiment in which the totality of the s s 1 2 treatments was carried out but only a percentage fe of the them see table 1 the proposed method aims at providing ryt precisely for cases in which fe 100 and thus we have incomplete information on model parameters therefore we took the mean a i j over the subset of pairwise experiments that were carried out see next section the lotka volterra competition theory has also been criticized because predictions in general assume that the community is at equilibrium a theoretical ideal rarely achieved in natural communities wiens 1984 and because interspecific interactions different from competition like facilitation or cooperation are quite frequent in nature and spoil the applicability of the theory bruno et al 2003 therefore two additional requirement on the experiments were that the species biomasses vs time seemed to stabilize at an equilibrium state and we preferably take into account the last measurement of the temporal series the dominant interspecific interaction was competition i e we discarded those experiments in which facilitation or positive interactions between species dominated over competition we found in the literature a total of 77 experiments verifying the above requirements some of these experiments were completed in laboratory and others in the field under natural conditions see table 1 and s1 for a comprehensive list of experiments used and their references 52 included s 2 species 2 2 all these pairwise experiments verify the stability condition for the coexistence of both species in equilibrium i e aij 1 see online supplementary table s1 which also include the corresponding references see table s1 and 25 with s 2 ranging from s 3 to s 32 kastendiek 1982 hooper and dukes 2004 picasso et al 2008 huisman et al 1999 neill 1974 kroh and stephenson 1980 aarssen 1988 vandermeer 1969 roxburgh and wilson 2000 wilson and keddy 1986 hector et al 2010 marquard et al 2009 see table 1 box 1 we end this section with three comments remarks about the method we are proposing first our goal in designing the present framework is given a stable or quasi stable community for which only a fraction of the model parameters are known to explain ex post the productivity by using the mean interaction parameter estimated from the available monoculture and biculture experiments second under the condition that only a fraction of the interaction matrix a is known the equilibrium state is undefined and we don t have to worry about issues like the stability or feasibility of this equilibrium state 3 3 in such cases in which the entire set of model parameters is known and the equilibrium state is well defined it can happen that the estimated interaction matrix a leads to an equilibrium state in which not all the species coexist that is the solution to eq 3 eq 5 is a fixed point of the system but this fixed point can be unstable or unfeasible i e involving negative species yields in the latter case eq 3 does not hold for the full set of species however we still have the freedom to modify the parameters within their confidence intervals in such a way to attempt to transform the unstable equilibrium into a stable one this solution was shown to work for grassland experiments fort et al 2017 halty et al 2017 this method does not rely on microscopic information like the detailed equilibrium state but on the ryt which is an aggregate quantity in fact we have shown that the ryt plays the role of a global mode for the lotka volterra competition equations whose dynamics is approximately described by the one dimensional logistic equation and that this approximation becomes exact in the limit of s tending to fort 2015 therefore in spite possible strange attractors or cycles affecting the species relative yields the relative yield total will converge to a fixed point for large values of the species richness third strictly speaking our framework cannot be used to predict the productivity of a combination of species ex ante this is because it would not be possible to predict if this particular species combination was stable and feasible based only on the mean interaction parameter for doing this we need the entire interaction matrix a to compute the equilibrium state through eq 5 however this framework can be used to provide an estimate of what would be the productivity of an artificially designed community in the case that it is stable and feasible or it can also be used to predict the impact on a given community of species loss affecting both s and a 3 results and discussion when knowledge of model parameters was incomplete the recipe we use for estimating the experimental average interspecific competition coefficienta to feed eq 6 and the experimental ryt which has demonstrated to work quite well is as follows let m be the subset of the s monoculture experiments and b the subset of the s s 1 2 biculture or pairwise experiments that were carried out first the average relative yields in biculture b m b is computed from the measured yields of subsets m b second using eq 7 a m b can be approximated as 8 a m b 1 b m b b m b inserting a m b into eq 6 we get the corresponding theoretical relative yield total to compare vs the experimental ryt m the subscript m is to emphasize that this quantity is estimated from the subset of available monoculture experiments eq 8 was also used in those experiments in which only mean yields for mono and bicultures were available and we approximated b m b by b b k m see table 1 there are at least three different ways to estimate ryt m the first and straightforward procedure is by summing the available empirical relative yields yi m a second one is by approximating ryt m s y k m e g note i in table 1 a third estimation that only requires knowing the total yield of the s species polyculture iyi is ryt m iyi k m e g note j in table 1 box 2 illustrates this calculation of a and how to estimate ryt m from table 1 and table s1 which includes results for s 2 species we see that eq 6 predicts the observed ryt with a relative error ε te of 1 or less 10 or less for 35 76 of the experiments this accuracy is remarkable since the experimental se for such quantities are in general greater than ε te in the interval 2 43 mean 21 4 4 the standard experimental error for the ryt when experimenters do not provide it was calculated through the propagation of error variance formula from the errors of ki and yi therefore our formula allows predicting the ryt simply from the knowledge of the mean empirical competition strength for 12 out of the 25 experiments listed in table 1 the knowledge of model parameters was incomplete i e fe 100 notice that as s increases the fraction fe of the s s 1 2 experiments required to estimate the experimental quantities also decreases a possible source explaining some of theε te errors is that our approach requires the coexistence of species in pairwise experiments in order to compute the corresponding competition coefficients by eq 7 obviously this procedure doesn t work if one of the species completely displaces the other some of the experimental data used in table 1 include pairwise experiments in which the yield of one of the species was very small i e the experiment was at the border between biculture and monoculture an example is ref vandermeer 1969 this could explain why it yields the largest ε te 49 6 as shown in table 1 in order to improve accuracy an alternative would be to discard those experiments and use an incomplete competition matrix and eq 8 fig 1 shows he ryt measured in these 77 experiments as well as their theoretical predictions by eq 6 as a function of both s and a it is known that the mean field approximation becomes exact in the artificial limit s μ pathria 1996 thus one expects that eq 6 becomes better the larger the number of interacting species s however we observe that eq 6 reproduces with great accuracy also the experimental ryt for s 2 this good agreement for s 2 can be understood because the quantities used for computing a and the ryt are the same bi see appendix a 3 1 the dependency of the yield with the species richness and the mean intensity of competition notice that the ryt increases with s a phenomenon which has been observed in many empirical studies and interpreted as niche partitioning cardinale et al 2012 that is different species can use resources in a complementary way and therefore more diverse communities will lead to a higher ryt however it was noticed that in spite of widespread claims about the role of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning relationships researchers have rarely provided any direct quantitative evidence that niche partitioning is responsible for higher productivity in mixtures rather many claims about niche partitioning come from qualitative interpretations of species natural histories or differences in functional traits cardinale et al 2011 the ryt 1 for the great majority of the experiments considered here especially for those with s 2 interacting species 24 out of 25 as shown in table 1 is a clear quantitative evidence of such species complementarity de wit 1970 loreau and hector 2001 for fixed mean competition parameter a eq 6 becomes a non linear saturating relationship between diversity and yield non linear saturating relationships have also been obtained in models by simulation or in other more complex models loreau 1998 schnitzer et al 2011 downing et al 2012 a novelty here is that we provide the specific functional dependency for ryt with s an hyperbolic function in fact it is worth remarking that the shape of the relationship between productivity and species diversity measured in nature is highly variable in many cases productivity shows a saturating relationship with diversity nevertheless in other cases the relationship is hump shaped where productivity peaks at intermediate diversity chase and leibold 2002 as expected notice that for fixed s the ryt and mry fig 2 both decrease with a a decrease of the total biomass with the intensity of the competition was also found by simulations of a more complex model downing et al 2012 3 2 the accuracy of the ryt approximate formula with incomplete knowledge of model parameters errors of the theoretical ryt respect to its experimental value can occur at three different levels firstly we have the error inherent to the lotka volterra competition equations which are a simplified description of the real dynamics let us call this error a level 0 error secondly even with complete knowledge of model parameters we have a level 1 error introduced by the mean field approximation consisting in replacing the set of interspecific competition coefficients by their average a thirdly when the percentage of required experiments for obtaining all the model parameters fe is less than 100 the averages to obtain the empirical a are performed over a reduced sample of available measurements introducing a sampling or level 2 error all the entries in table 1 include level 0 level 1 errors the last 12 entries include also level 2 errors fe 100 by simple inspection we observe that the relative error between theory and experiment ε te for the cases with fe 100 and fe 100 are not dramatically different hence this seems to indicate that level 2 errors are at most of the same order than level 1 errors however this is not necessarily the case since the experiments in these two sets besides differing in fe also differ in the species richness the ones in the second set involve a much larger s a more proper way to quantify the three levels of errors independently of the species richness is as follows given an experiment for which all the model parameters are known a first obtain the level 0 error by integrating the lotka volterra competition equations that result with the whole competition matrix and computing the relative yield total as the sum of the s relative yields yi for equilibrium b second to obtain level 0 level 1 errors compute the interspecific competition coefficient a that result from averaging over the entire competition matrix and calculate the corresponding relative yield total produced when inserting this a into eq 6 c third to obtain the sum of the three levels of errors take different choices for the subset m b of model parameters 5 5 of course choosing different subsets m b with fe clearly less than 100 is only possible provided the species richness s must be sufficiently large and for each one compute the average of the interspecific competition coefficients a m b and the corresponding relative yield total produced when inserting this a m binto eq 6 by comparing the resulting ε te in a and b we can get and estimate of the level 1 error whilst comparing the set of ε te obtained in b and c one for each choice of m b we can get and estimate of the level 2 error to perform this analysis we used the largest community for which we know all the s 2 parameters and thus the whole competition matrix namely the plant experiment with seven coexisting species of ref roxburgh and wilson 2000 the level 0 error that result from a is ε te 3 2 the level 0 level 1 error that results from b is the one that appears in table 1 ε te 2 5 finally we considered for c the 35 possible subsets involving three out of the seven species the number of ways of picking three species from seven species is 7 3 7 3 7 5 35 this corresponds to knowing in each case six out of the total of 42 interspecific competition coefficients i e an fe 100 7 14 3 we found that a m bvaries over these 35 subsets from 0 65 to 1 00 inserting these 35 values of a m binto eq 6 the relative errors for the theoretical ryts varied from 0 5 to 19 5 with a mean of 7 3 in summary the calculations for this particular experiment indicate that level 1 errors are negligible compared to level 0 errors and level 2 errors on average are of the order of level 0 errors this would confirm the general picture emerging from table 1 that the estimation of aggregate quantities ryt and mry with an incomplete knowledge of model parameters produces values that in general are not very different from the ones obtained when using all the model parameters and directly computing the loka volterra relative yields at equilibrium 4 conclusion the observed complexity of interspecific interactions often leads to distrust of highly simplified mathematical equations like the lotka volterra

25349,mathematical modeling is an important tool to study planktonic ecosystem dynamics and various mechanisms involved in its interaction with hydrological regime the difficulty arises when describing plankton dynamics under wide range of estuarine environmental conditions due to inadequate knowledge to interpret the mechanism to which the environmental nature of a given situation force the model condition towards the observation and the extent to which the details of the model implementations do we present a model of the phytoplankton dynamics and nitrogen cycling in the estuarine environment of sundarbans we have tested the sensitivity of each model parameter in turn by running the model to a steady state within a certain range of value satisfying the trend of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution in this way it is possible to determine which parameters had the most influence on which variables and the possible mechanism underlying the ecological processes in estuarine environment the model exhibits stable behavior for the state variables over the tidal cycle and follows the trend of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution along the river channel this exercise will obviously set a background to have some knowledge of the tuning of the ecological model to the parameter values keywords phytoplankton nutrient estuary ecosystem model sundarbans 1 introduction estuarine waters are one of the fluvial dynamic ecological system which undergo through a continuous changes due to the physical processes of coastal water e g diffusion stratification and as well as due to the inherent biological processes e g nutrient uptake physiological changes growth rate which are instrumental in producing spatial variation of planktonic distribution bonachela et al 2011 hence models of planktonic processes have gaining much interest of researchers in order to understand the functions of different part of estuarine ecosystem such works are needed to assess the health of the marine life and environment conditions of the estuaries in changing climate scenario and to locate the potential marine economic zones several researchers have attempted to explain the growth of phytoplankton in different environmental conditions oceanic plankton distribution is related to the physical features like eddies and fronts biktashev and brindley 2004 abraham 1998 flier and davis 1993 mcgillicuddy and robinson 1997 martin and richards 2001 oschlies and garcon 1988 changes in temperature and nutrient availability induced by seasonal changes such as variation in thermocline depth and strength are considered to be responsible to the rapid and massive phytoplankton bloom in rivers lakes and oceans the effect on inflows on phytoplankton population is an interesting problem to study how the magnitude and the timings of inflows influence the physical features and nutrient availability by altering hydrology that affect phytoplankton growth and productivity moreover seasonal forcing also acts as the controlling factor on phytoplankton population that lives in natural systems in a periodically varying environment and population interactions since phytoplankton have the capacity to acclimate to changes in environmental conditions by altering their chemical composition in response to environmental variability physical aspects of nutrient uptake and the change in plankton dynamics in physical limitations in response to limited nutrient condition have been the focus of intense study in changing hydrological regime temperature availability of light in addition to nutrients regulates the phytoplankton photo physiology steele 1978 bainbridge 1957 venrick 1990 mukhopadhyay and bhattacharya 2006 jang and allen 2015 bonachela et al 2011 to date a large

the remarkable pioneer attempts to describe the influence of ambient nutrient concentration external and internal on nitrogen uptake rate by algal cells caperon 1967 dugdale 1967 droop 1973 burmaster 1979 a number of models tended to concentrate on interaction among nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton and the flows of materials among these components of ecosystem effects of light limitation temperature zooplankton grazing role of bacteria protozoans and dissolved organic matter and toxic elements on planktonic system are extensively explored pace et al 1984 fasham 1985 moloney et al 1986 williams and druffel 1988 but these models have not put much light on the variability of plankton dynamics in seasonal cycle in the ambient of explicit physical processes as addressed by evans and parslow 1985 using a simple model of plankton and nutrient dynamics in a seasonally varying mixed layer here the role of physical mixing on seasonal recurrence of spring bloom formation is well explained a simple model of planktonic ecosystem was developed by fasham et al 1990 hence called fdm model to describe the ecosystem of sargasso sea near bermuda in which temporal changes in the thermocline depth plays a major role in ecosystem later haney and jackson 1996 modified this model with changes in algal growth rate formulations to combine the effects light and nutrient limitation sundarbans estuarine system 21 25 22 5 n and 88 25 89 5 e situated in the eastern coastal state of west bengal is india s largest monsoonal macro tidal delta front estuarine system it comprises the southernmost part of the indian portion of the ganga brahmaputra delta bordering the bay of bengal this estuary has gained considerable impetus as an interesting study area on phytoplankton dynamics twice daily mixing of the estuarine waters by the tidal phenomenon chatterjee et al 2013 causes changes in water level salinity and nutrient and such wide range of environmental conditions which have an important impact on the characteristics of phytoplankton distribution in rivers of sundarbans river discharge stratification of water column grazing pressure by zooplankton nutrients and light availability are the main controlling factors in growth of phytoplankton a number of comprehensive studies have conducted to diagnose the current state of ecosystem in hoogly matla estuarine system for exploring the possible impact of future changes in environmental factors on the ecosystem the impact of mangroves on nutrients and plankton dynamics temperature dependent growth rate of phytoplankton in saline environment and implication of body sizes plankton for total system dynamics in optimization of exergy are critically analyzed roy et al 2016 mandal et al 2012 ray et al 2001 joyita et al 2015 on these developments we have taken a simple but realistic phytoplankton nutrient distribution model fasham et al 1990 haney and jackson 1996 as a tool to determine the controlling forcing parameters of plankton and nutrient dynamics in rivers of sundarbans estuary the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 gives a brief overview on physical and environmental conditions of the study area section 3 provides the description of the base model along with the parameters and significance parameter sensitivity analysis and stability test are included in this section section 4 analyzes the behavior of plankton and nutrient dynamics with the help of sensitivity analysis stability conditions and model output section 5 deals with the salient features and significance of the work in the concluding part 2 study area the principal estuaries of the sundarbans estuarine system ses india are the saptamukhi thakuran matla bidya gomdi gosaba gona harinbhanga and raimangal all these north south flowing estuaries are lying east of the hoogly river a wide range of tidal variations in different environmental and estuarine conditions of these estuaries are reported by chatterjee et al 2013 according to this report and an extensive hydrological survey of the southern stretch of the river saptamukhi during 1961 1963 jha et al 1999 have noted that saptamukhi east gulley seg the stronger branch of saptamukhi carries a major portion of the inflow from the bay tide induced daily mixing of the estuarine waters cause changes in hydrological and physico chemical characteristics of the estuary which makes the eastern part of river saptamukhi an ideal estuary to study the dynamic interaction of estuarine hydrology with the ecosystem of the estuary in this paper we have chosen the river jagaddal an easterly branch of the seg flowing parallel to the seg straight to the bay of bengal as our study area to model the phytoplankton and nutrient distribution along the river jagaddal goutam et al 2015 discussed about the nature of nonlinearity role of bottom drag coefficient mixing characteristics variation of water level tidal current and estuarine current along the river jagaddal based on the observations in equinoctial spring phase 18 21 march of 2011 on the three stations on this river indrapur dhanchi and ramganga and numerical simulation of hydrological parameters water level tidal current estuarine current bottom drag coefficient gradient richardson number etc since an initial overview on tidal hydrodynamics of flow regime is available in this river so it is a straight approach to undertake a comprehensive study on variation of ecological parameters phytoplankton nutrients etc in the influence of tidal action on this river a number of studies have conducted in different seasons to understand the variation of physico chemical parameters salinity nutrients phytoplankton in the eastern part of river saptamukhi as well as on the principal estuaries of sundarbans chaudhuri et al 2012 mitra et al 2014 mitra et al 2009 raha et al 2012 to model the variation of phytoplankton and nutrient concentration along the river jaggaddal we have considered these available references to get an idea about the nature of phytoplankton and nutrient variation on this river in monsoon and identify the controlling parameters to understand the interaction of hydrological and ecological processes 3 methodology 3 1 model structure and equations to model the phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics along the estuarine channel of river jagaddal fig 1 coupling of physics and biology is essential for simulation of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution evans and parslow 1985 explored a 1d vertical model in which the plankton were affected by shoaling and deepening of the mixed layer where the effect of shallowing or deepening of mixed layer on the volumetric concentration of a state variable in mixed layer remains unchanged in this study we have taken this model to induce the hydrodynamics of estuarine river in a simplified form in phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics for a mixed layer of depth m the rate of change of mixed layer depth is 1 h t d m d t now the mixing process rate is fast compared to the growth rate of the organisms robinson et al 1979 following these features we make the basic assumption that in the shallow estuarine channel of jagaddal river the vertical water column can be considered biologically homogeneous with mixing rate m the rate of change of mixed layer provides the physically driven rate to change the concentration of phytoplankton and nutrient in the water column by the term 1a m h t m this set of equations eqs 1 and 1a allow nutrients to be injected into the mixed layer during entrainment deepening while the phytoplankton concentration becomes diffused throughout the mixed layer m during stratification the phytoplankton concentration below the new mixed layer m is lost we have taken a simple 2 state variable model following the compartmental ecosystem model developed by fasham et al 1990 the state variables are with their mathematical symbols and units in parentheses haney and jackson 1996 i phytoplankton concentration p μm n and ii nitrate nitrogen nn μm n during monsoon the phytoplankton growth rate in sundarbans estuary is nitrogen limited and nitrate is usually considered to be added to the euphotic zone by phytoplankton nutrient uptake growth hence we have used it as model currency in form of nitrate concentration nn chaudhuri et al 2012 dugdale and goering 1967 and the state variables are modeled in terms of their nitrogen content the equation for phytoplankton is described by haney and jackson 1996 2 d p d t 1 γ 1 σ p g 1 μ 1 p m h t m p where σ is the average daily phytoplankton specific growth rate g1 represents the rate of phytoplankton loss to grazing μ1 is the phytoplankton specific mortality rate γ1 is the fraction of phytoplankton growth excreted as don m is a mixing velocity m and h t has been defined above the nitrate equation is described as haney and jackson 1996 3 d n n d t σ n p m h t m n 0 n n where n0 is the subsurface nitrate concentration which is assumed to be constant σn is the phytoplankton specific growth rate for nitrate uptake and other parameters have been defined above the parameters in model equations together with their unit are listed in table 1 3 2 choice of parameters and numerical methods we model the flow in the river jagaddal fig 1 as being one dimensional using a single spatial parameter x m we have segmented the distance approximately 21km down the estuary to the mouth indrapur from its head ramganga concentrations of state variables i e phytoplankton and nitrate nitrogen are only allowed to vary along the length of the river they are treated as homogeneous across the river cross section dobbins 1964 model calibration is done by adjusting selected model parameter values derived from studies on the sundarbans estuary or from other coastal marine water body with similar estuarine conditions the model equations are integrated using a fourth order runge kutta algorithm implemented by c programming language the model is simulated for 2h 6h and 12h the observational data described in section 2 of the state variables along the river jagaddal are used for the validation of the model run fig 4 the sensitivity analysis is performed using matlab 3 3 parameter sensitivity analysis the values for biological parameters cannot strictly be regarded as constants in an attempt to match the modeled distribution of phytoplankton and nitrate to the observations obtained in river jagaddal we have chosen parameter values from the references with similar environmental and hydrological conditions to investigate sensitivity of the model response to the model parameters and interactions among the parameters a variance based sensitivity analysis method developed by sobol 1993 has been used in this method within a probabilistic framework the variance of the output of the model is decomposed into fractions which can be attributed to the input parameters to understand the method further let y f x is a function where x is a vector of d uncertain model inputs x1 x2 x3 xd and y is a chosen univariate model output to know the contribution to the output variance of the main effect xi a direct variance based measure of sensitivity si called the first order sensitivity index or main effect index sobol 1993 is stated as follows 4 s i v i v a r y therefore the first order sensitivity index si measures the effect of varying xi alone but averaged over variations over other input parameters higher order interactions sij and sijk and so on can be formed by dividing other terms in the variance decomposition by var y 5 i 1 d s i i j d s i j s 12 d 1 to measure the contribution to the output variance of xi including all variance caused by its interactions of any order with any other input variables an another index called total effect index or total order index homma and saltelli 1996 is stated as follows 6 s t i e x i v a r x i y x i v a r y 1 v a r x i e x i y x i v a r y set of all variables except xi is indicated by x i due to the interaction effect of xi and xj σ i 1 d s t i 1 the sum of sti will only be equal to 1 when the model is purely additive the variance based sensitivity analysis method of sobol 1993 is carried out on phytoplankton and nutrient equation eqs 2 and 3 respectively to determine the first order sensitivity index s i and total effect index s ti the first order sensitivity index s i indicates the main effect output variance of input parameter xi that could be reduced if it could be fixed to a specific value eq 4 the s ti indicates the sum that includes first order index s i second order index eq 5 third order index and so on it is generally acceptable to determine only s i and s ti fox et al 2010 to know whether each parameter interacts as a pair or more with the other parameters s ti s i is used to estimate interaction effect index of second order and or higher order higher order effects finally this variance based method is used to compare the contribution of parameters based on the sensitivity analysis results 3 4 stability of the model stability analysis of a subsystem of an ecological model constructed by a number of differential equations provides useful information about the significance or contribution of each model component to the stability of the whole system in this study we have used a straightforward approach to perform the stability analysis of model equations eqs 2 and 3 performing routh hurwitz stability test let a dynamical system of n variables x1 x2 x3 xn is described by n linear differential equations d x i d t f i x 1 x n c 1 c n where c 1 c n are parameters then an equilibrium point is a vector x such that all of the derivatives are 0 the system is stable if for all such x the system will return to x after a small perturbation of the components of x the characteristic polynomial λ i a can be represented as λ n a 1 λ n 1 a n 1 λ a n where the coefficients a i are real constants i 1 2 n the system is stable if and only if all the real parts of the characteristic polynomial i e the eigenvalues are negative the straightforward approach of testing the stability of system is to find the eigenvalues routh hurwitz theorem provides an alternative way to find the necessary and sufficient conditions that the real parts of the roots of a polynomial are negative the n hurwitz matrices can be defined using the coefficients a i of the characteristic polynomial h 1 a 1 h 2 a 1 1 a 3 a 2 a n d h n a 1 1 0 0 0 a 3 a 2 a 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 a n where a j 0 if j n all of the roots of the polynomial are negative or have negative real part iff the determinants of all hurwitz matrices are positive det h j 0 j 1 2 n 4 results the model is run to study the spatial variation of phytoplankton abundance and nutrient nitrate distribution in monsoon along the river jagaddal up to ramganga away from indrapur i e form the mouth of bay of bengal in this section first we will discuss the result of sensitivity analysis described in section 3 3 and significance of the major contributing parameters second the conditions for the stability of the system will be discussed finally the nature of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution obtained from model run is explained 4 1 discussions on sensitivity analysis local and global sensitivity analyses were carried out on phytoplankton and nutrient model eqs 2 and 3 respectively based on the input parameters shown in table 2 both analyses were studied for each model equation at 105s simulation time local sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine normalized sensitivity coefficients by varying input parameters at prescribed percentage while global sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the fraction of model output variance that is first order index si and total effect index sti for each parameter based on uncertainty in input value range input parameters were varied 5 zheng and bennett 2002 for eqs 2 and 3 and the results of total effect index main effect index and interaction index for model parameters in phytoplankton and nutrient equations eqs 2 and 3 are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively quantitative contribution for each parameter to model output variance for model eqs 2 and 3 is given by first order index si and total effect index sti in fig 2 among the model parameters of phytoplankton eq 2 parameter μ1 appeared to have the most sensitivity in positive relations and this was followed by parameters γ1 σ p m and g1 in decreasing order in negative relations parameters m and g1 are in decreasing order of importance table 3 in case of fig 3 among the parameters of nutrient eq 4 parameter n0 appeared to have the most sensitivity in positive relations and this was followed by parameters m σn nn m and p in decreasing order table 4 the total effect sensitivity index in fig 2 shows that the sti has a consistent trend as the si in case of μ1 m and g1 that is the ranking of parameters by si values agreed well with those from sti values table 3 this clearly indicates that phytoplankton specific mortality rate μ1 and phytoplankton loss to zooplankton grazing g1 play a dominant role in interaction of ecological processes with estuarine hydrodynamics through mixing in case fig 3 sti shows that the has a consistent trend as the si in case of σn nn m and p table 4 to identify the contribution of parameters and the interaction with the other parameters sti si is used to estimate the interaction effect index of second order and or higher order effects the highest interaction effect was showed by stp s p followed by parameters γ1 m g1 σ and μ1 in decreasing order table 3 in fig 2 in fig 3 the highest interaction effect was showed by s σn s σn followed by parameters m n0 m p and nn in decreasing order table 4 4 2 discussions on the stability of the system in this study we have used the system of linear differential equations with two state variables phytoplankton concentration p and nitrate nitrogen nn phytoplankton and nitrate distribution are modeled using eqs 2 and 3 respectively the characteristic equation of the system 2 and 3 may be represented as λ i a 0 w i t h 7 a 1 γ 1 σ μ 1 m h t m 0 σ n m h t m or 8 λ 2 λ μ 1 1 γ 1 σ 2 m h t m m h t m 2 μ 1 m h t m σ 1 γ 1 m h t m 0 when n 2 the routh hurwitz criteria described in section 3 4 simplify to det h 1 a 1 0 and det h 2 det a 1 1 0 a 2 a 1 a 2 0 or a 1 0 and a 2 0 the routh array of coefficients of eq 8 becomes λ 2 1 m h t m 2 μ 1 m h t m σ 1 γ 1 m h t m λ 1 μ 1 1 γ 1 σ 2 m h t m 0 λ 0 m h t m 2 μ 1 m h t m σ 1 γ 1 m h t m 0 for the stability of the system the all the elements of the first column must be greater than zero according to the values used for model parameters listed in table 2 this condition satisfies hence the system is in stable condition if the system is in stable condition then two conditions arise 9 μ 1 1 γ 1 σ 2 m h t m 0 and 10 m h t m 2 μ 1 m h t m σ 1 γ 1 m h t m 0 eq 9 yields 11 μ 1 1 γ 1 σ 2 m h t m eq 10 yields 12 m h t m 0 and m h t m μ 1 σ 1 γ 1 0 o r 13 σ m h t m 1 γ 1 μ 1 1 γ 1 eqs 11 and 13 provides the conditions for the two important parameters phytoplankton specific mortality rate and phytoplankton average daily specific growth rate respectively eq 12 clearly indicates that the rate of change of mixed layer together with mixing rate m provides eqs 1 and 1a the physically driven rate to change the concentration of phytoplankton and nutrient in the water column plays the major role as the physical forcing mechanism to maintain the stable condition of phytoplankton and nutrient in estuarine environment eqs 1 and 1a 4 3 features of phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics obtained from model run the observed trend phytoplankton distribution in river jagaddal shows an increasing trend from the first observation station of ramganga a sharp peak of phytoplankton concentration is observed around ramganga between ramganga and dhanchi there is a decreasing trend of phytoplankton concentration another sharp peak of phytoplankton concentration in the river is observed around the densely forest covered area of dhanchi as we cross dhanchi and move towards indrapur three is a sharp decreasing trend of phytoplankton concentration fig 4 nutrient distribution here nitrate shows a wide range of interesting variation along river jagaddal initially in ramganga concentration of nutrient in the river is increasing then there is a sudden drop in nutrient concentration level between ramganga and dhanchi nutrient concentration shows an increasing trend again near dhanchi there is another drop in nutrient concentration over a specific region on jagaddal after this point there is a sharp rise in nutrient concentration around dhanchi and decreasing trend in nutrient concentration towards indrapur fig 4 our goal is to know how much the formulation of model scenario is close to interpreat observed spatial variations of state variables now it is quite interesting to investigate significance of the model parameters tables 1 and 2 in context of this estuarine river in monsoon the phytoplankton average daily specific growth rate σn has maximum of 2 3day 1 actually matches the maximum value of phytoplankton specific mortality rate μ1 of 0 054day 1 the growth rate and mortality rate of phytoplankton are within the range as reported by haney and jackson 1996 but the growth rate is low to the value 2 62day 1 mortality rate is much higher to the value 0 021day 1 as prescribed by ray et al 2001 and mandal et al 2012 respectively during monsoon low growth rate of phytoplankton observed due to much lower penetration of light turbidity light in rivers of sundarban that affects the growth rate in this shallow river changing the subsurface nitrate condition n0 shows no such significance variation n0 1 2 μm is the optimal level which tends to match the surface nitrate concentration as observed in field data in case of g1 i e phytoplankton loss to zooplankton grazing we have to depend on the reference data from similar environmental conditions in sundarbans and other tropical estuaries and found that the value 0 021μm nday 1 has justified our model conditions mandal et al 2012 haney and jackson 1996 similar approach has been taken to check the growth corrected for algal leakage using 1 γ1 where the value of γ1 is set as 0 05 haney and jackson 1996 now the nutrient plankton reaction to the diffusion process in shallow estuaries evolves in small scale interactions which need special care to reconstruct or to understand the sensitivity of the organisms and organic particle to such processes in case of rivers in sundarban the residual circulation plays a key role in maintaining mixing characteristics in the mixed layer goutam et al 2015 in this scenario the model has not yet modified up to that level so that it can interpret the role of eddy diffusivity in such stochastic processes hence we do not observe much variation in eddy diffusivity rate is set to 0 2m haney and jackson 1996 to satisfy our model conditions phytoplankton and nutrient in the model run with variation of time along the river shows an overall stable behavior figs 5 and 6 distribution of nutrient and phytoplankton concentration on river jagaddal can be explained as the interaction of estuarine hydrological processes and dynamics of ecological system of sundarbans estuary as expected nutrient rich water regime around ramganga and dhanchi shows dense population of phytoplankton the enriched source of nutrient in ramganga is the additional contribution of river channel bar chara and kal chara which are connected to the fresh water of hoogly river through the western channels fig 1 as we depart from ramganga there is a confluence of another river channel coming to the river jagaddal this junction is characterized by turbulence and mixing phenomenon as well as variable salinity regime goutam et al 2015 which is the reason behind the sudden drop of nutrient level this drop is increasing with time as observed in model run 4 since there is no significant change in phytoplankton concentration in this location we can expect a continuous supply of phytoplankton by the river flow in this location fig 5 the river regime between ramganga and dhanchi gathers much interest for the ambiguous nature of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution as we discussed earlier though the river water is enough enriched with nutrient there is a sharp decline in phytoplankton population to understand this ubiquity we have to consider the hydrological processes underlying the flow regime if we consider the depth profile of river jagaddal then we could find that river in this region is quite shallow goutam et al 2015 tidal current in this region is very strong river jagaddal is connected to the much saline water of river thakuran in the east through dhanchi canal near dhanchi forest this canal and adjacent shallow tidal creeks draw enough water volume at this location which is dispersed by the strong nonlinear tidal phenomena tidal asymmetry and bottom drag coefficient as a result this region shows low tidal water range and strong mixing in water column goutam et al 2015 all of these contribute to the resulted phytoplankton volume decrease with a mismatch to the increasing trend of nutrient concentration figs 5 and 6 as we proceed to the river regime adjacent to the densely covered mangrove forest of dhanchi we found the river water is very nutrient rich in model run we have observed coincidence of phytoplankton and nutrient concentration peaks in this region figs 5 and 6 this region is characterized by very high density of phytoplankton concentration the adjacent riverside of forest area is covered with salt marsh which acts as the water reservoirs friedrichs et al 1988 chatterjee et al 2013 the stability of water column in this region is another contributor to the higher growth rate of phytoplankton in this region the riverine area around the forest covered region of dhanchi thus serve as potential fishing zone and treasurer of ecological resources the strong influence of tidal hydrodynamics on the river regime in this area shows that importance of the tidal water inflow through river run off in preservation of the ecological health of this fishing zone after crossing dhanchi as we move towards indrapur there is a sharp decline in nutrient and phytoplankton concentration the station indrapur as we discussed earlier is only on 8 km distance from bay of bengal and for this reason the estuarine waters in this experience direct influence of bay small scale eddies continuous mixing of riverine fresh water with saline tidal inflow and turbulence in water column are the regular characteristics of the flow regime in this area as a result nutrient concentration in the estuarine water is not enough to provide a favorable condition for the rapid growth of phytoplankton the distribution of nutrient concentration is not uniform along the river channel it is expected due to the variable contribution of ecology of a mangrove estuarine river condition e g presence of mangrove forest the role of physical processes e g effect of channel confluence mixing etc of estuarine hydrodynamics are prominent in the variation of spatial distribution of state variables in this river here we have discussed the possible mechanism that plays behind the observed model run to match the general trend of nutrient and phytoplankton distribution to the observed field data 5 conclusion this study is an initial attempt to model the phytoplankton variation distribution growth rate mortality rate in the wide range of estuarine condition nutrient distribution mixing level etc this exercise will obviously set a background to have some knowledge of the tuning of the ecological model to the parameter values the procedure used in this paper is to test the sensitivity of each model parameter in turn by running the model to a steady state within a certain range of value satisfying the trend of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution along the river jagaddal in this way it is possible to determine which parameters had the most influence on which variables and the possible mechanism underlying the ecological processes in estuarine environment the model simulations were run until a steady state is achieved the state variables phytoplankton and nutrient concentration maintain the stable behavior during tidal cycle this result clearly indicates that the conservation principles of state this conclusion will further indulge the researchers to develop a full fledge hydrodynamic model containing physical features of estuarine circulation as a forcing mechanism to the biological processes inherent in the population dynamics

25349,mathematical modeling is an important tool to study planktonic ecosystem dynamics and various mechanisms involved in its interaction with hydrological regime the difficulty arises when describing plankton dynamics under wide range of estuarine environmental conditions due to inadequate knowledge to interpret the mechanism to which the environmental nature of a given situation force the model condition towards the observation and the extent to which the details of the model implementations do we present a model of the phytoplankton dynamics and nitrogen cycling in the estuarine environment of sundarbans we have tested the sensitivity of each model parameter in turn by running the model to a steady state within a certain range of value satisfying the trend of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution in this way it is possible to determine which parameters had the most influence on which variables and the possible mechanism underlying the ecological processes in estuarine environment the model exhibits stable behavior for the state variables over the tidal cycle and follows the trend of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution along the river channel this exercise will obviously set a background to have some knowledge of the tuning of the ecological model to the parameter values keywords phytoplankton nutrient estuary ecosystem model sundarbans 1 introduction estuarine waters are one of the fluvial dynamic ecological system which undergo through a continuous changes due to the physical processes of coastal water e g diffusion stratification and as well as due to the inherent biological processes e g nutrient uptake physiological changes growth rate which are instrumental in producing spatial variation of planktonic distribution bonachela et al 2011 hence models of planktonic processes have gaining much interest of researchers in order to understand the functions of different part of estuarine ecosystem such works are needed to assess the health of the marine life and environment conditions of the estuaries in changing climate scenario and to locate the potential marine economic zones several researchers have attempted to explain the growth of phytoplankton in different environmental conditions oceanic plankton distribution is related to the physical features like eddies and fronts biktashev and brindley 2004 abraham 1998 flier and davis 1993 mcgillicuddy and robinson 1997 martin and richards 2001 oschlies and garcon 1988 changes in temperature and nutrient availability induced by seasonal changes such as variation in thermocline depth and strength are considered to be responsible to the rapid and massive phytoplankton bloom in rivers lakes and oceans the effect on inflows on phytoplankton population is an interesting problem to study how the magnitude and the timings of inflows influence the physical features and nutrient availability by altering hydrology that affect phytoplankton growth and productivity moreover seasonal forcing also acts as the controlling factor on phytoplankton population that lives in natural systems in a periodically varying environment and population interactions since phytoplankton have the capacity to acclimate to changes in environmental conditions by altering their chemical composition in response to environmental variability physical aspects of nutrient uptake and the change in plankton dynamics in physical limitations in response to limited nutrient condition have been the focus of intense study in changing hydrological regime temperature availability of light in addition to nutrients regulates the phytoplankton photo physiology steele 1978 bainbridge 1957 venrick 1990 mukhopadhyay and bhattacharya 2006 jang and allen 2015 bonachela et al 2011 to date a large number of model formulations have made to express the nutrient and plankton dynamics in a wide variety of marine environment i e ocean lake estuary etc among them michaelis menten kinetics was one of the remarkable pioneer attempts to describe the influence of ambient nutrient concentration external and internal on nitrogen uptake rate by algal cells caperon 1967 dugdale 1967 droop 1973 burmaster 1979 a number of models tended to concentrate on interaction among nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton and the flows of materials among these components of ecosystem effects of light limitation temperature zooplankton grazing role of bacteria protozoans and dissolved organic matter and toxic elements on planktonic system are extensively explored pace et al 1984 fasham 1985 moloney et al 1986 williams and druffel 1988 but these models have not put much light on the variability of plankton dynamics in seasonal cycle in the ambient of explicit physical processes as addressed by evans and parslow 1985 using a simple model of plankton and nutrient dynamics in a seasonally varying mixed layer here the role of physical mixing on seasonal recurrence of spring bloom formation is well explained a simple model of planktonic ecosystem was developed by fasham et al 1990 hence called fdm model to describe the ecosystem of sargasso sea near bermuda in which temporal changes in the thermocline depth plays a major role in ecosystem later haney and jackson 1996 modified this model with changes in algal growth rate formulations to combine the effects light and nutrient limitation sundarbans estuarine system 21 25 22 5 n and 88 25 89 5 e situated in the eastern coastal state of west bengal is india s largest monsoonal macro tidal delta front estuarine system it comprises the southernmost part of the indian portion of the ganga brahmaputra delta bordering the bay of bengal this estuary has gained considerable impetus as an interesting study area on phytoplankton dynamics twice daily mixing of the estuarine waters by the tidal phenomenon chatterjee et al 2013 causes changes in water level salinity and nutrient and such wide range of environmental conditions which have an important impact on the characteristics of phytoplankton distribution in rivers of sundarbans river discharge stratification of water column grazing pressure by zooplankton nutrients and light availability are the main controlling factors in growth of phytoplankton a number of comprehensive studies have conducted to diagnose the current state of ecosystem in hoogly matla estuarine system for exploring the possible impact of future changes in environmental factors on the ecosystem the impact of mangroves on nutrients and plankton dynamics temperature dependent growth rate of phytoplankton in saline environment and implication of body sizes plankton for total system dynamics in optimization of exergy are critically analyzed roy et al 2016 mandal et al 2012 ray et al 2001 joyita et al 2015 on these developments we have taken a simple but realistic phytoplankton nutrient distribution model fasham et al 1990 haney and jackson 1996 as a tool to determine the controlling

significance of the work in the concluding part 2 study area the principal estuaries of the sundarbans estuarine system ses india are the saptamukhi thakuran matla bidya gomdi gosaba gona harinbhanga and raimangal all these north south flowing estuaries are lying east of the hoogly river a wide range of tidal variations in different environmental and estuarine conditions of these estuaries are reported by chatterjee et al 2013 according to this report and an extensive hydrological survey of the southern stretch of the river saptamukhi during 1961 1963 jha et al 1999 have noted that saptamukhi east gulley seg the stronger branch of saptamukhi carries a major portion of the inflow from the bay tide induced daily mixing of the estuarine waters cause changes in hydrological and physico chemical characteristics of the estuary which makes the eastern part of river saptamukhi an ideal estuary to study the dynamic interaction of estuarine hydrology with the ecosystem of the estuary in this paper we have chosen the river jagaddal an easterly branch of the seg flowing parallel to the seg straight to the bay of bengal as our study area to model the phytoplankton and nutrient distribution along the river jagaddal goutam et al 2015 discussed about the nature of nonlinearity role of bottom drag coefficient mixing characteristics variation of water level tidal

numerical simulation of hydrological parameters water level tidal current estuarine current bottom drag coefficient gradient richardson number etc since an initial overview on tidal hydrodynamics of flow regime is available in this river so it is a straight approach to undertake a comprehensive study on variation of ecological parameters phytoplankton nutrients etc in the influence of tidal action on this river a number of studies have conducted in different seasons to understand the variation of physico chemical parameters salinity nutrients phytoplankton in the eastern part of river saptamukhi as well as on the principal estuaries of sundarbans chaudhuri et al 2012 mitra et al 2014 mitra et al 2009 raha et al 2012 to model the variation of phytoplankton and nutrient concentration along the river jaggaddal we have considered these available references to get an idea about the nature of phytoplankton and nutrient variation on this river in monsoon and identify the controlling parameters to understand the interaction of hydrological and ecological processes 3 methodology 3 1 model structure and equations to model the phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics along the estuarine channel of river jagaddal fig 1 coupling of physics and biology is essential for simulation of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution evans and parslow 1985 explored a 1d vertical model in which the plankton were affected by shoaling and deepening of the mixed layer where the effect of shallowing or deepening of mixed layer on the volumetric concentration of a state variable in mixed layer remains unchanged in this study we have taken this model to induce the hydrodynamics of estuarine river in a simplified form in phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics for a mixed layer of depth m the rate of change of mixed layer depth is 1 h t d m d t now the mixing process rate is fast compared to the growth rate of the organisms robinson et al 1979 following these features we make the basic assumption that in the shallow estuarine channel of jagaddal river the vertical water column can be considered biologically homogeneous with mixing rate m the rate of change of mixed layer provides the physically driven rate to change the concentration of phytoplankton and nutrient in the water column by the term 1a m h t m this set of equations eqs 1 and 1a allow nutrients to be injected into the mixed layer during entrainment deepening while the phytoplankton concentration becomes diffused throughout the mixed layer m during stratification the phytoplankton concentration below the new mixed layer m is lost we have taken a simple 2 state variable model following the compartmental ecosystem model developed by fasham et al 1990 the state variables are with their mathematical symbols and units in parentheses haney and jackson 1996 i phytoplankton concentration p μm n and ii nitrate nitrogen nn μm n during monsoon the phytoplankton growth rate in sundarbans estuary is nitrogen limited and nitrate is usually considered to be added to the euphotic zone by phytoplankton nutrient uptake growth hence we have used it as model currency in form of nitrate concentration nn chaudhuri et al 2012 dugdale and goering 1967 and the state variables are modeled in terms of their nitrogen content the equation for phytoplankton is described by haney and jackson 1996 2 d p d t 1 γ 1 σ p g 1 μ 1 p m h t m p where σ is the average daily phytoplankton specific growth rate g1 represents the rate of phytoplankton loss to grazing μ1 is the phytoplankton specific mortality rate γ1 is the fraction of phytoplankton growth excreted as don m is a mixing velocity m and h t has been defined above the nitrate equation is described as haney and jackson 1996 3 d n n d t σ n p m h t m n 0 n n where n0 is the subsurface nitrate concentration which is assumed to be constant σn is the phytoplankton specific growth rate for nitrate uptake and other parameters have been defined above the parameters in model equations together with their unit are listed in table 1 3 2 choice of parameters and numerical methods we model the flow in the river jagaddal fig 1 as being one dimensional using a single spatial parameter x m we have segmented the distance approximately 21km down the estuary to the mouth indrapur from its head ramganga concentrations of state variables i e phytoplankton and nitrate nitrogen are only allowed to vary along the length of the river they are treated as homogeneous across the river cross section dobbins 1964 model calibration is done by adjusting selected model parameter values derived from studies on the sundarbans estuary or from other coastal marine water body with similar estuarine conditions the model equations are integrated using a fourth order runge kutta algorithm implemented by c programming language the model is simulated for 2h 6h and 12h the observational data described in section 2 of the state variables along the river jagaddal are used for the validation of the model run fig 4 the sensitivity analysis is performed using matlab 3 3 parameter sensitivity analysis the values for biological parameters cannot strictly be regarded as constants in an attempt to match the modeled distribution of phytoplankton and nitrate to the observations obtained in river jagaddal we have chosen parameter values from the references with similar environmental and hydrological conditions to investigate sensitivity of the model response to the model parameters and interactions among the parameters a variance based sensitivity analysis method developed by sobol 1993 has been used in this method within a probabilistic framework the variance of the output of the model is decomposed into fractions which can be attributed to the input parameters to understand the method further let y f x is a function where x is a vector of d uncertain model inputs x1 x2 x3 xd and y is a chosen univariate model output to know the contribution to the output variance of the main effect xi a direct variance based measure of sensitivity si called the first order sensitivity index or main effect index sobol 1993 is stated as follows 4 s i v i v a r y therefore the first order sensitivity index si measures the effect of varying xi alone but averaged over variations over other input parameters higher order interactions sij and sijk and so on can be formed by dividing other terms in the variance decomposition by var y 5 i 1 d s i i j d s i j s 12 d 1 to measure the contribution to the output variance of xi including all variance caused by its interactions of any order with any other input variables an another index called total effect index or total order index homma and saltelli 1996 is stated as follows 6 s t i e x i v a r x i y x i v a r y 1 v a r x i e x i y x i v a r y set of all variables except xi is indicated by x i due to the interaction effect of xi and xj σ i 1 d s t i 1 the sum of sti will only be equal to 1 when the model is purely additive the variance based sensitivity analysis method of sobol 1993 is carried out on phytoplankton and nutrient equation eqs 2 and 3 respectively to determine the first order sensitivity index s i and total effect index s ti the first order sensitivity index s i indicates the main effect output variance of input parameter xi that could be reduced if it could be fixed to a specific value eq 4 the s ti indicates the sum that includes first order index s i second order index eq 5 third order index and so on it is generally acceptable to determine only s i and s ti fox et al 2010 to know whether each parameter interacts as a pair or more with the other parameters s ti s i is used to estimate interaction effect index of second order and or higher order higher order effects finally this variance based method is used to compare the contribution of parameters based on the sensitivity analysis results 3 4 stability of the model stability analysis of a subsystem of an ecological model constructed by a number of differential equations provides useful information about the significance or contribution of each model component to the stability of the whole system in this study we have used a straightforward approach to perform the stability analysis of model equations eqs 2 and 3 performing routh hurwitz stability test let a dynamical system of n variables x1 x2 x3 xn is described by n linear differential equations d x i d t f i x 1 x n c 1 c n where c 1 c n are parameters then an equilibrium point is a vector x such that all of the derivatives are 0 the system is stable if for all such x the system will return to x after a small perturbation of the components of x the characteristic polynomial λ i a can be represented as λ n a 1 λ n 1 a n 1 λ a n where the coefficients a i are real constants i 1 2 n the system is stable if and only if all the real parts of the characteristic polynomial i e the eigenvalues are negative the straightforward approach of testing the stability of system is to find the eigenvalues routh hurwitz theorem provides an alternative way to find the necessary and sufficient conditions that the real parts of the roots of a polynomial are negative the n hurwitz matrices can be defined using the coefficients a i of the characteristic polynomial h 1 a 1 h 2 a 1 1 a 3 a 2 a n d h n a 1 1 0 0 0 a 3 a 2 a 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 a n where a j 0 if j n all of the roots of the polynomial are negative or have negative real part iff the determinants of all hurwitz matrices are positive det h j 0 j 1 2 n 4 results the model is run to study the spatial variation of phytoplankton abundance and nutrient nitrate distribution in monsoon along the river jagaddal up to ramganga away from indrapur i e form the mouth of bay of bengal in this section first we will discuss the result of sensitivity analysis described in section 3 3 and significance of the major contributing parameters second the conditions for the stability of the system will be discussed finally the nature of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution obtained from model run is explained 4 1 discussions on sensitivity analysis local and global sensitivity analyses were carried out on phytoplankton and nutrient model eqs 2 and 3 respectively based on the input parameters shown in table 2 both analyses were studied for each model equation at 105s simulation time local sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine normalized sensitivity coefficients by varying input parameters at prescribed percentage while global sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the fraction of model output variance that is first order index si and total effect index sti for each parameter based on uncertainty in input value range input parameters were varied 5 zheng and bennett 2002 for eqs 2 and 3 and the results of total effect index main effect index and interaction index for model parameters in phytoplankton and nutrient equations eqs 2 and 3 are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively quantitative contribution for each parameter to model output variance for model eqs 2 and 3 is given by first order index si and total effect index sti in fig 2 among the model parameters of phytoplankton eq 2 parameter μ1 appeared to have the most sensitivity in positive relations and this was followed by parameters γ1 σ p m and g1 in decreasing order in negative relations parameters m and g1 are in decreasing order of importance table 3 in case of fig 3 among the parameters of nutrient eq 4 parameter n0 appeared to have the most sensitivity in positive relations and this was followed by parameters m σn nn m and p in decreasing order table 4 the total effect sensitivity index in fig 2 shows that the sti has a consistent trend as the si in case of μ1 m and g1 that is the ranking of parameters by si values agreed well with those from sti values table 3 this clearly indicates that phytoplankton specific mortality rate μ1 and phytoplankton loss to zooplankton grazing g1 play a dominant role in interaction of ecological processes with estuarine hydrodynamics through mixing in case fig 3 sti shows that the has a consistent trend as the si in case of σn nn m and p table 4 to identify the contribution of parameters and the interaction with the other parameters sti si is used to estimate the interaction effect index of second order and or higher order effects the highest interaction effect was showed by stp s p followed by parameters γ1 m g1 σ and μ1 in decreasing order table 3 in fig 2 in fig 3 the highest interaction effect was showed by s σn s σn followed by parameters m n0 m p and nn in decreasing order table 4 4 2 discussions on the stability of the system in this study we have used the system of linear differential equations with two state variables phytoplankton concentration p and nitrate nitrogen nn phytoplankton and nitrate distribution are modeled using eqs 2 and 3 respectively the characteristic equation of the system 2 and 3 may be represented as λ i a 0 w i t h 7 a 1 γ 1 σ μ 1 m h t m 0 σ n m h t m or 8 λ 2 λ μ 1 1 γ 1 σ 2 m h t m m h t m 2 μ 1 m h t m σ 1 γ 1 m h t m 0 when n 2 the routh hurwitz criteria described in section 3 4 simplify to det h 1 a 1 0 and det h 2 det a 1 1 0 a 2 a 1 a 2 0 or a 1 0 and a 2 0 the routh array of coefficients of eq 8 becomes λ 2 1 m h t m 2 μ 1 m h t m σ 1 γ 1 m h t m λ 1 μ 1 1 γ 1 σ 2 m h t m 0 λ 0 m h t m 2 μ 1 m h t m σ 1 γ 1 m h t m 0 for the stability of the system the all the elements of the first column must be greater than zero according to the values used for model parameters listed in table 2 this condition satisfies hence the system is in stable condition if the system is in stable condition then two conditions arise 9 μ 1 1 γ 1 σ 2 m h t m 0 and 10 m h t m 2 μ 1 m h t m σ 1 γ 1 m h t m 0 eq 9 yields 11 μ 1 1 γ 1 σ 2 m h t m eq 10 yields 12 m h t m 0 and m h t m μ 1 σ 1 γ 1 0 o r 13 σ m h t m 1 γ 1 μ 1 1 γ 1 eqs 11 and 13 provides the conditions for the two important parameters phytoplankton specific mortality rate and phytoplankton average daily specific growth rate respectively eq 12 clearly indicates that the rate of change of mixed layer together with mixing rate m provides eqs 1 and 1a the physically driven rate to change the concentration of phytoplankton and nutrient in the water column plays the major role as the physical forcing mechanism to maintain the stable condition of phytoplankton and nutrient in estuarine environment eqs 1 and 1a 4 3 features of phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics obtained from model run the observed trend phytoplankton distribution in river jagaddal shows an increasing trend from the first observation station of ramganga a sharp peak of phytoplankton concentration is observed around ramganga between ramganga and dhanchi there is a decreasing trend of phytoplankton concentration another sharp peak of phytoplankton concentration in the river is observed around the densely forest covered area of dhanchi as we cross dhanchi and move towards indrapur three is a sharp decreasing trend of phytoplankton concentration fig 4 nutrient distribution here nitrate shows a wide range of interesting variation along river jagaddal initially in ramganga concentration of nutrient in the river is increasing then there is a sudden drop in nutrient concentration level between ramganga and dhanchi nutrient concentration shows an increasing trend again near dhanchi there is another drop in nutrient concentration over a specific region on jagaddal after this point there is a sharp rise in nutrient concentration around dhanchi and decreasing trend in nutrient concentration towards indrapur fig 4 our goal is to know how much the formulation of model scenario is close to interpreat observed spatial variations of state variables now it is quite interesting to investigate significance of the model parameters tables 1 and 2 in context of this estuarine river in monsoon the phytoplankton average daily specific growth rate σn has maximum of 2 3day 1 actually matches the maximum value of phytoplankton specific mortality rate μ1 of 0 054day 1 the growth rate and mortality rate of phytoplankton are within the range as reported by haney and jackson 1996 but the growth rate is low to the value 2 62day 1 mortality rate is much higher to the value 0 021day 1 as prescribed by ray et al 2001 and mandal et al 2012 respectively during monsoon low growth rate of phytoplankton observed due to much lower penetration of light turbidity light in rivers of sundarban that affects the growth rate in this shallow river changing the subsurface nitrate condition n0 shows no such significance variation n0 1 2 μm is the optimal level which tends to match the surface nitrate concentration as observed in field data in case of g1 i e phytoplankton loss to zooplankton grazing we have to depend on the reference data from similar environmental conditions in sundarbans and other tropical estuaries and found that the value 0 021μm nday 1 has justified our model conditions mandal et al 2012 haney and jackson 1996 similar approach has been taken to check the growth corrected for algal leakage using 1 γ1 where the value of γ1 is set as 0 05 haney and jackson 1996 now the nutrient plankton reaction to the diffusion process in shallow estuaries evolves in small scale interactions which need special care to reconstruct or to understand the sensitivity of the organisms and organic particle to such processes in case of rivers in sundarban the residual circulation plays a key role in maintaining mixing characteristics in the mixed layer goutam et al 2015 in this scenario the model has not yet modified up to that level so that it can interpret the role of eddy diffusivity in such stochastic processes hence we do not observe much variation in eddy diffusivity rate is set to 0 2m haney and jackson 1996 to satisfy our model conditions phytoplankton and nutrient in the model run with variation of time along the river shows an overall stable behavior figs 5 and 6 distribution of nutrient and phytoplankton concentration on river jagaddal can be explained as the interaction of estuarine hydrological processes and dynamics of ecological system of sundarbans estuary as expected nutrient rich water regime around ramganga and dhanchi shows dense population of phytoplankton the enriched source of nutrient in ramganga is the additional contribution of river channel bar chara and kal chara which are connected to the fresh water of hoogly river through the western channels fig 1 as we depart from ramganga there is a confluence of another river channel coming to the river jagaddal this junction is characterized by turbulence and mixing phenomenon as well as variable salinity regime goutam et al 2015 which is the reason behind the sudden drop of nutrient level this drop is increasing with time as observed in model run 4 since there is no significant change in phytoplankton concentration in this location we can expect a continuous supply of phytoplankton by the river flow in this location fig 5 the river regime between ramganga and dhanchi gathers much interest for the ambiguous nature of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution as we discussed earlier though the river water is enough enriched with nutrient there is a sharp decline in phytoplankton population to understand this ubiquity we have to consider the hydrological processes underlying the flow regime if we consider the depth profile of river jagaddal then we could find that river in this region is quite shallow goutam et al 2015 tidal current in this region is very strong river jagaddal is connected to the much saline water of river thakuran in the east through dhanchi canal near dhanchi forest this canal and adjacent shallow tidal creeks draw enough water volume at this location which is dispersed by the strong nonlinear tidal phenomena tidal asymmetry and bottom drag coefficient as a result this region shows low tidal water range and strong mixing in water column goutam et al 2015 all of these contribute to the resulted phytoplankton volume decrease with a mismatch to the increasing trend of nutrient concentration figs 5 and 6 as we proceed to the river regime adjacent to the densely covered mangrove forest of dhanchi we found the river water is very nutrient rich in model run we have observed coincidence of phytoplankton and nutrient concentration peaks in this region figs 5 and 6 this region is characterized by very high density of phytoplankton concentration the adjacent riverside of forest area is covered with salt marsh which acts as the water reservoirs friedrichs et al 1988 chatterjee et al 2013 the stability of water column in this region is another contributor to the higher growth rate of phytoplankton in this region the riverine area around the forest covered region of dhanchi thus serve as potential fishing zone and treasurer of ecological resources the strong influence of tidal hydrodynamics on the river regime in this area shows that importance of the tidal water inflow through river run off in preservation of the ecological health of this fishing zone after crossing dhanchi as we move towards indrapur there is a sharp decline in nutrient and phytoplankton concentration the station indrapur as we discussed earlier is only on 8 km distance from bay of bengal and for this reason the estuarine waters in this experience direct influence of bay small scale eddies continuous mixing of riverine fresh water with saline tidal inflow and turbulence in water column are the regular characteristics of the flow regime in this area as a result nutrient concentration in the estuarine water is not enough to provide a favorable condition for the rapid growth of phytoplankton the distribution of nutrient concentration is not uniform along the river channel it is expected due to the variable contribution of ecology of a mangrove estuarine river condition e g presence of mangrove forest the role of physical processes e g effect of channel confluence mixing etc of estuarine hydrodynamics are prominent in the variation of spatial distribution of state variables in this river here we have discussed the possible mechanism that plays behind the observed model run to match the general trend of nutrient and phytoplankton distribution to the observed field data 5 conclusion this study is an initial attempt to model the phytoplankton variation distribution growth rate mortality rate in the wide range of estuarine condition nutrient distribution mixing level etc this exercise will obviously set a background to have some knowledge of the tuning of the ecological model to the parameter values the procedure used in this paper is to test the sensitivity of each model parameter in turn by running the model to a steady state within a certain range of value satisfying the trend of phytoplankton and nutrient distribution along the river jagaddal in this way it is possible to determine which parameters had the most influence on which variables and the possible mechanism underlying the ecological processes in estuarine environment the model simulations were run until a steady state is achieved the state variables phytoplankton and nutrient concentration maintain the stable behavior during tidal cycle this result clearly indicates that the conservation principles of state this conclusion will further indulge the researchers to develop a full fledge hydrodynamic model containing physical features of estuarine circulation as a forcing mechanism to the biological processes inherent in the population dynamics
