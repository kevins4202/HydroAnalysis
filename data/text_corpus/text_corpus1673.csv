generally accustomed to water shortages the apalachicola chattahoochee flint river basin has experienced episodic water stress over the past three decades due to population growth climate variability land use change and agricultural intensification while precipitation in the region is relatively high declines in streamflow suggest a growing need to develop water management options focused on reducing water consumption many efforts have focused on reducing water use by irrigation the primary water consumer in the region however the effectiveness of irrigation reduction at restoring streamflow is uncertain new hydrological insights of the region we used the soil and water assessment tool to simulate the effects of a range of irrigation reduction scenarios on streamflow during a 16 year period that included extreme drought and extremely wet conditions simulated irrigation reduction had a consistently positive effect on streamflow in the absence of irrigation annual streamflow increased 7 or 6 million m3 year compared to normal irrigation proportional changes in streamflow were much greater during low flow periods additional flow during extremely low flow periods is

1000 mm year however projections of increasing water demands increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns will stress regional water resources emanuel and rogers 2012 golladay et al 2016 the region is expected to experience rapid land use changes with 12 17 million ha of new urban development by 2060 wear and greis 2013 at the same time the regional climate is projected to be hotter with temperature increases likely exceeding 1 5 c by 2100 ipcc 2013 resulting in a greater evaporative loss even with abundant average annual precipitation the southeastern us often suffers from water scarcity due to periodic la ni√±a cycles which bring warm and dry conditions diminishing aquifer and soil water recharge during the dormant season mearns et al 2003 singh et al 2016 episodic water scarcity in the region has already caused substantial and ongoing regional conflicts over water allocation particularly in the apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf river basin ruhl 2005 where water withdrawals in the upper basin have been blamed for negative impacts on downstream ecology and nearshore marine fisheries industry the flint portion of the basin is an interesting example because it has both extensive exurban development upper basin and intensive irrigated agriculture lower basin total water withdrawal in the flint river basin of georgia is projected to increase further from 3 9 million m3 day in 2020 to 4 3 million m3 day in 2050 lower flint ochlockonee watershed council 2017 upper flint watershed council 2017 globally agricultural irrigation is the largest freshwater user accounting for 70 of water withdrawals fischer et al 2007 woznicki et al 2015 in the flint river basin irrigation greatly increases crop yields and quality and combined with other agriculture related trade sectors accounts for 6 billion or 34 of the regional economy couch and mcdowell 2006 agricultural water consumption increased beginning in the 1970 s with the adoption of center pivot irrigation couch et al 1996 irrigated area increased from 53 000 ha in 1976 to 106 000 ha in 1977 pollard et al 1978 by 1980 irrigated farmland had increased to more than 183 000 ha and presently is reported to exceed 263 000 ha georgia epd 2009 wetted acreage database total water withdrawal in the lower flint river basin is dominated by agricultural irrigation which comprises as much as 90 of water withdrawals during the april september growing season these competing interests i e urban agricultural fisheries and ecological suggest a growing need to develop water use and land management options focused on improving the balance between precipitation and water yield with extensive water use throughout the flint river basin stream flows have declined particularly during extended droughts emanuel and rogers 2012 rugel et al 2012 since 2000 minimum flows observed in the lower flint river and its tributaries were substantially lower than those observed during historical droughts golladay and hicks 2015 brantley et al 2018 extensive areas of losing or dry reaches have been observed regionally during the past 20 years gordon et al 2012 rugel et al 2012 for example spring creek a tributary to the lower flint river basin was formerly perennial but has become intermittent since 1980 rugel et al 2012 even during winter post irrigation median daily flow seldom equaled or exceeded the pre irrigation median flow value golladay et al 2016 reduced summer stream flow has negative implications for ecological communities in the river such as freshwater mussels golladay et al 2004 native crayfishes sargent et al 2011 and fishes van den avyle and evans 1990 freeman et al 2013 golladay et al 2016 concerns about streamflow have increased interest in technologies that can improve agricultural water conservation while acknowledging that economic pressures and increasing human populations necessitate the continued use of irrigation for sustaining and improving crop yields thus maximizing irrigation system efficiency or the ratio of crop yield to water applied is imperative for example application efficiency or the ratio of water used by the crop to total water applied has improved from 75 to 85 in center pivot irrigation systems by using low pressure drop nozzles that reduce evaporative water loss during application mark masters personal communication 2017 and this technology has been widely adopted in the region other agriculture water conservation practices are being developed or employed in the region with varying degrees of effectiveness for example switching from standard application where water is applied evenly across an entire field to variable rate irrigation where water is applied in proportion to crop needs had a water saving of up to 15 vellidis et al 2016 and changing from the traditional checkbook method to smart irrigation scheduling in combination with conservation tillage can result in water saving of 12 76 in normal or wet years and 40 in dry years vellidis et al 2016 for ichawaynochaway creek a major tributary of the lower flint it has been estimated that a 20 reduction in irrigation below 2006 levels during drought years would meet the in stream flow criteria monthly 1 day minima and annual low flow duration virtually all the time couch and mcdowell 2006 however a more recent assessment of the broader effects of irrigation efficiency programs on streamflow is lacking our goal was to determine the effectiveness of irrigation water savings at restoring streamflow we hypothesized that reduced agricultural irrigation from groundwater would result in increases in streamflow and the impact of irrigation reduction on streamflow will be greatest during low flow periods when irrigation demand is often highest and overall water availability is low a hydrologic model was calibrated for the ichawaynochaway creek watershed to simulate streamflow responses across a range of reductions in agricultural water use from 0 to 100 of what is typically applied to crops based on calculated crop water demands to accurately simulate the wide range of irrigation adjustment we used the soil and water assessment tool swat which has the ability to represent watersheds with a wide range of land use and weather input data neitsch et al 2009 2 methods 2 1 study area the ichawaynochaway creek watershed is a huc 8 watershed located in the gulf coastal plain of southwestern georgia usa covering an area of approximately 2940 km2 fig 1 ichawaynochaway creek originates near weston ga usa 31 98 84 64 and flows in a generally southerly direction until it reaches the flint river below newton ga 31 17 84 47 for more than half of its length ichawaynochaway creek flows through the fall line hills physiographic district of the upper coastal plain region in its southern reaches the creek flows across the dougherty plain physiographic district and interacts with the upper floridan aquifer the u s geological survey stream gages within the watershed have up to 75 years of flow records covering a period in which significant land use change has occurred pierce et al 1984 fanning et al 2001 see golladay and battle 2002 and golladay et al 2004 for a more detailed description the climate in the study area is classified as humid subtropical peel et al 2007 with hot and humid summers temperatures ranging from 18 35 c and mild winters with temperatures ranging between 2 13 c mean annual temperature 19 c mean annual precipitation is 1300 mm and is distributed fairly evenly across the year http www ncdc noaa gov 30 year average 1987 2016 climatic conditions varied substantially over the modeled period from 2000 to 2016 including three multi year droughts 1999 2001 2006 2008 and 2010 2013 fig 2 droughts spanned both growing and dormant seasons and because they were multi year sometimes extended through the dormant season nov apr when most groundwater recharge occurs monthly rainfall averages about 110 mm range 10 350 mm but during extended droughts monthly totals were often well below this average periods of above average rainfall also were common during the study period with monthly totals of 250 mm occurring during months spanning both dormant and growing seasons land use in the ichawaynochaway creek watershed is dominated by agriculture 50 with remaining acreage in forestland 35 wetlands 14 and urban area 1 fig 1 based on data obtained from national land cover database 2011 homer et al 2015 streams in many areas are buffered by forests houhoulis and michener 2000 and have minimal urban impacts good water quality and relatively intact biotic communities golladay et al 2004 row crop farming of mainly cotton peanuts and corn is irrigated by center pivot systems using groundwater sources from the upper floridan aquifer as well as surface water sources from ichawaynochaway creek its tributaries and multi function ponds hook et al 2005 groundwater is the largest source for irrigation for the study region fanning et al 2001 for the flint river basin over the year of 2001 groundwater withdrawal was 470 million m3 surface water withdrawal was 100 million m3 and multi function ponds also provided 34 million m3 of water hook et al 2005 besides runoff multi function ponds also collect baseflow and seepage and are often filled from nearby groundwater wells during periods without rain and runoff hook et al 2005 because of the dominance of groundwater as the irrigation source and the interconnectivity of irrigation sources groundwater was used for the entire ichawaynochaway creek watershed as irrigation source for this study 2 2 swat model description all analyses were performed using swat a continuous time semi distributed process based watershed model developed by the usda agricultural research service douglas mankin et al 2010 neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2012 swat has been applied at scales from small watersheds to large river basins and is designed for simulating the effects of land use and land management practices on the surface and groundwater neitsch et al 2009 in this study we used swat to simulate the impacts of agriculture water savings on streamflow 2 2 1 model inputs and set up input data for swat included topography soil classification land use including crop type weather and management i e irrigation amount and schedule the watershed boundary was delineated using arcgis 10 3 with the arcswat 2012 10 19 extension winchell et al 2007 digital elevation models at the resolution of 1 3 arc second were used as topographic input data obtained from u s geological survey national elevation dataset https lta cr usgs gov ned based on topography the watershed was then divided into 25 subbasins size ranging from 10 to 190 km2 the state soil geographic database statsgo soil survey staff 2017 for georgia was used as soil input data the texture of soil in the watershed ranges from loam to sand with 95 of soil having 50 sand the dominant soil hydrologic group is b covering 70 of the area the national land cover database 2011 was used as land use input data homer et al 2015 where possible land use types were further refined to better reflect actual land cover types parameters for mixed forest frst were adjusted to better represent forest in the region table 1 evergreen forest frse was split into two forest types longleaf pine pinus palustris mill and loblolly pine pinus taeda l with loblolly pine occupying 80 of frse to represent forest composition in the region martin et al 2012 parameters associated with longleaf pine loblolly pine and mixed forest were obtained from field measurements conducted at the jones center at ichauway www jonesctr org located within the study area table 1 similarly the agriculture agrl land use classification was split into corn cotton and peanut with cotton and peanut each occupying 40 of agriculture land and corn occupying the remaining 20 hook et al 2005 although these values change from year to year these proportions reflect long term trends in land use typical in the region each subbasin was further divided into hydrological response units hru as each hru was a unique combination of soil land use and topography class daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation data for the model were obtained from four weather stations maintained by the georgia automated environmental monitoring network www georgiaweather net seven stream gages operated by the u s geological survey within the watershed https waterdata usgs gov nwis fig 1 supplied additional precipitation data weather data were applied to subbasins automatically by arcswat based on proximity potential evapotranspiration was calculated by swat using penman monteith method 2 2 2 model calibration and validation two u s geological survey streamflow gages in the ichawaynochaway watershed were used for calibration and validation ichawaynochaway creek at milford 02353500 and ichawaynochaway creek below newton 02355350 https waterdata usgs gov nwis the milford stream gage henceforth the upper gage drains an area of approximately 1600 km2 in the fall line hills physiographic region of the upper coastal plain the below newton stream gage henceforth the lower gage drains nearly the entire watershed including a large area of the dougherty plain physiographic region fig 1 based on data availability climate data from 1990 to 2016 were used for model calculation with a model spin up period from 1990 to 2000 to minimize the influence of initial states arnold et al 2013 stream data from 2009 to 2016 were used for model calibration because there were more climate data available for this period and the land cover input data more closely resembled current land use model validation utilized stream data from 2001 to 2008 both calibration and validation periods represented a number of extremes across the longer record including the extreme drought periods of june to november 2007 and june 2011 to july 2012 palmer drought severity index 4 and the extreme wet periods of july to august 2005 january 2010 august to september 2013 and april 2014 palmer drought severity index 4 fig 2 to calibrate against streamflow relevant input parameters governing surface runoff and baseflow were selected based on initial model performance and suggestions from previous research arnold et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 parameters that govern surface runoff include soil conservation service runoff curve number cn2 available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc soil evaporation compensation factor esco plant uptake compensation factor epco surface runoff lag coefficient surlag and manning s n value for overland flow ov n parameters that govern baseflow include baseflow alpha factor alpha bf threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn groundwater re evaporation coefficient gw revap groundwater delay time gw delay threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer for revap or percolation to the deep aquifer to occur revapmn and deep aquifer percolation fraction rcharg dp based on global and local sensitivity analyses performed by swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup six parameters that met sensitivity criteria arnold et al 2012 were identified alpha bf cn2 esco gwqmn gw revap and sol awc table 2 the initial ranges of these parameters were assigned based on sensitivity analyses and knowledge of the study area the model was first calibrated for the upper gage then calibrated for the lower gage including adjusted parameters for the upper watershed table 2 model calibration was performed with sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm using swat cup arnold et al 2012 with swat cup latin hypercube sampling was used to generate 1000 parameter combinations within the selected minimum and maximum value range of each parameter swat cup then ran 1000 simulations each with a unique parameter combination after each simulation model simulated monthly streamflow was compared with measured streamflow based on these simulations the post processing option in swat cup suggested new parameter ranges for these parameters the new parameter ranges were then retested using global and local sensitivity analyses this process was repeated until no further improvement was observed arnold et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 the simulation results were evaluated based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr and r2 moriasi et al 2007 model evaluation was based on guidelines from moriasi et al 2007 model performance ratings in the range of good and very good moriasi et al 2007 were accepted for further analysis the best parameter combination was applied to model validation 2 2 3 agriculture irrigation scenarios we used the calibrated swat model to project the potential effects of irrigation reduction on streamflow shallow aquifer was used as irrigation water source irr sc 3 for crops located in each corresponding subbasin the swat model defines shallow aquifer as an aquifer which contributes return flow to streams within the watershed vs deep aquifer as an aquifer which doesn t contribute return flow to streams within the watershed arnold et al 1993 because of the high connectivity between streams and groundwater in the region rugel et al 2012 shallow aquifer as irrigation source was chosen for this model to compare water savings scenarios a baseline scenario was established full irrigation withdrawal was calculated based on climate and crop type as calculated by the model auto irrigation operation 100 irrigation no water conservation measures in place modeled monthly irrigation values in the full irrigation scenario were comparable to values reported in hook et al 2005 irrigation withdrawals in each hru were then adjusted using the manual irrigation operation from 90 of full irrigation to 0 of irrigation no irrigation in 10 increments in total 11 scenarios covering the full range 0 100 of possible irrigation reduction were tested in this study to quantify the impact of irrigation on streamflow model simulated streamflow volume was reported and later converted into water yield depth by dividing streamflow by watershed area to better compare with precipitation and evapotranspiration values to determine the effects of irrigation reduction on monthly streamflow we used a frequency pairing analysis method where we constructed flow duration curves for each simulation from 0 to 100 irrigation reduction this method ranks flow periods e g months in ascending order and relies on direct comparisons of flow during relatively similar hydrologic conditions e g flow at 5th 25th or 50th percentile to assess change alila et al 2009 to quantify the effects of irrigation reduction during specific flow conditions we focused on absolute and relative changes in flow during three flow conditions median flow 50th percentile which provides an estimate of central tendency and relates well to other metrics such as mean annual streamflow and yield the 25th percentile which represents a recognized state of low flow where hydrologic drought conditions start to occur and the 5th percentile which represents a state of extremely low flow where water supplies are threatened and ecosystem function may be severely impaired 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation for the calibration period 2009 2016 model performance for the upper gage was very good regarding nse 0 83 and rsr 0 41 and was very good in the bias between model estimation and observation for mean monthly streamflow pbias 14 4 for the lower gage the nse 0 86 rsr 0 38 and pbias 1 9 were all in the range of very good performance moriasi et al 2007 during the validation period 2001 2008 the model generated good results with nse 0 69 for the upper gage and nse 0 77 for the lower gage pbias was relatively small with satisfactory performance for the upper stream gage pbias 20 4 and good performance for the lower gage pbias 9 0 the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were also good for the upper rsr 0 56 and lower gages rsr 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 table 3 the model performed well during medium and high flow periods at both gages differences between model simulation and observed average monthly flow were primarily due to under prediction of streamflow during low flow periods especially at the upper gage fig 3 this was likely the reason the model performed slightly better at the lower gage the magnitude of differences between observed and simulated streamflow was small and monthly flow in both the simulated and actual stream never reached zero the 95 prediction uncertainty range covered 65 of data for the upper gage and 59 of data in the lower gage fig 3 3 2 annual water budget over the entire watershed simulated full irrigation based on climate and crop type as calculated by the model was 38 2 3 4 mm yr or 113 6 million m3 yr eliminating irrigation reduced evapotranspiration by 14 0 1 8 mm yr and surface runoff by 3 7 0 5 mm yr while it increased aquifer recharge by 26 6 2 8 mm yr annual water yield responded positively to reductions in irrigation withdrawals over the whole range of possible water use reduction scenarios simulated irrigation reduction measures increased annual streamflow on average 1 for each 10 reduction in irrigation increases in annual yield of the watershed ranged from 12 2 48 7 mm year 20 7 2 5 mm yr and were generally higher in years with more precipitation fig 4 however the proportional change in yield was higher in years with less precipitation and ranged from 4 to 16 increase fig 4 for the upper gage full irrigation 0 irrigation reduction resulted in mean annual streamflow of 14 4 m3 s or 454 million m3 yr which translates to a mean water yield value of 235 mm yr when no irrigation was applied mean streamflow was 15 6 m3 s which translates to 19 mm year greater annual yield or a 7 increase 3 3 monthly streamflow effects simulated reductions in irrigation increased monthly streamflow over a wide range of hydrological conditions at both the upper and the lower gages fig 5 irrigation reduction has decreased the probability of extreme low flow 5th percentile at the upper gage a mean monthly flow of 1 m3 s 5 5 exceedance probability occurred during 11 months under the normal irrigation scenario but that number decreased to 9 months 4 5 exceedance probability under the no irrigation scenario fig 5 at the lower gage 100 irrigation reduction raised 5th percentile flow from 1 4 m3 s to 2 5 m3 s fig 5 simulated irrigation reduction had a consistently positive effect on streamflow during median low and extremely low flow months figs 5 and 6 in terms of absolute flow median streamflow 50th percentile increased more with irrigation reduction than low 25th percentile or extremely low flows however proportional responses change in flow were greatest during extremely low flows fig 6 the simulated change in median monthly flow between no irrigation and normal irrigation 100 or maximum was 1 73 m3 s 16 for the upper gage and 0 95 m3 s for the lower gage fig 6 monthly mean streamflow changes of extremely low flow were 0 33 27 and 0 31 m3 s respectively fig 6 for the driest months even small reductions in irrigation e g 10 20 resulted in modest increases in streamflow and a threshold of about 20 30 irrigation reduction was necessary to achieve a 10 increase in streamflow at both stream gages figs 6 and 7 the upper gage appeared more sensitive to irrigation reduction than the lower gage across a wider range of flow conditions fig 7 greater responses to irrigation reduction occurred in the drier months at both gages with the greatest flow increase of 70 78 at the 11th driest month of the lower gage in response to 70 100 irrigation reduction fig 7 4 discussion our simulations showed that reducing agricultural water use increased streamflow our modeling period covered a wide range of potential natural variability with july 2012 representing the lowest flow since 1940 results suggested that under these extremely low flow conditions small irrigation reductions would trigger small but potentially ecologically important increases in streamflow this was evident at the upstream gage where a 10 reduction in irrigation resulted in a 7 increase in streamflow at the downstream gage under extremely low flow conditions streamflow was 35 higher with no irrigation than with normal irrigation this finding of higher sensitivity during extremely low flow conditions is consistent with several previous studies regarding land use impact on streamflow when 16 of the land in the xinjiang river basin in china was changed from forest to grassland annual basin discharge increased 1 7 with the largest change of 4 4 observed during the driest period guo et al 2008 in the chemoga watershed in ethiopia when annual rainfall decreased at a rate of 0 3 mm year and area of cropland and eucalypt plantations increased annual streamflow decreased at 1 7 mm year the impact was most pronounced during the dry season with significant declines in monthly and daily extreme low flow while no trend was observed during the wet season bewket and sterk 2005 these results all demonstrated that water balance during extremely dry periods is exceptionally sensitive to even small changes in water use whether from natural et oishi et al 2010 or human consumption decreased streamflows due to irrigation during periods when flows are already extremely low due to drought have substantial effects on aquatic fauna such as fishes mussels and crayfishes golladay et al 2004 sargent et al 2011 freeman et al 2013 although the flow of ichawaynochaway creek didn t reach zero during the model period or the historical record many un gaged tributary streams ceased to flow during extreme dry periods and only isolated pools remained golladay et al 2004 rugel et al 2012 indicating an increasing trend towards stream intermittency in the region gordon et al 2012 a previous drought survey of mussels in the lower flint river basin showed that flow cessation caused a decline in abundance of both federally listed and common mussel species golladay et al 2004 in the upper flint river basin landscape scale models showed fish species richness declined in response to drought and recovered afterward freeman et al 2013 even small quantities of additional flow may prove vitally important in maintaining in stream habitat quality especially during dry periods under our irrigation reduction scenarios the upper basin was more responsive than the lower basin fig 7 differences in sensitivities of the upper and lower gages may be due to differences in the land cover and or the influence of groundwater the upper watershed had a greater proportion of irrigated land with 85 000 ha of agriculture or 52 of total area while the lower basin had 48 000 ha or 41 of the total area fig 1 additionally because the lower watershed is located in the dougherty plain groundwater inputs may buffer the streamflow response to changes in surface water budgets as reflected in the model s calibrated parameters for example the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn was larger in the upper watershed than the lower watershed table 2 and shallower gwqmn in the lower watershed allowed it to have a larger impact of groundwater on the stream also the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf was larger in the upper watershed than the lower watershed table 2 representing a faster groundwater flow response to changes in recharge in the upper watershed arnold et al 2013 karst systems have been known to pose unique challenges for surface and groundwater modeling amin et al 2017 previous research has shown swat to be effective in modeling streamflow in karst systems on a monthly step though less successful on finer time steps spruill et al 2000 our model performed reasonably well considering the challenge posed by the subsurface heterogeneity and groundwater preferential flow paths characteristic of karst systems which likely alter infiltration and surface runoff and consequently evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and streamflow hartmann et al 2015 malard et al 2016 the modeling challenges posed by groundwater inputs were most apparent by under prediction of streamflow during low flow periods fig 3 very low flows were relatively difficult to predict accurately especially during extreme dry periods periods of very low flow also provide challenges for usgs field personnel making measurements of stream discharge thus uncertainty in stage discharge relations may also indirectly affect model predictions the magnitude of differences between observed and simulated discharge were small and the majority of data points were within the 95 prediction uncertainty range fig 3 finally another unique feature of our study area that posed challenges for hydrologic modeling is the abundance of geographically isolated wetlands or giws in the dougherty plain martin et al 2012 giws have been shown to increase landscape hydrologic capacitance by storing excess run off during floods and slowly releasing water afterwards hey and philippi 1995 mitsch and gosselink 2000 mclaughlin et al 2014 there are 21 000 ha 19 of wetlands in the lower basin fig 1 most of which are giws giws have been shown to increase baseflow contribution to streamflow via groundwater recharge during low flow periods especially where soils have high hydraulic conductivity winter and labaugh 2003 evenson et al 2015 lee et al 2018 however the swat model represents isolated wetlands as either de spatialized and aggregated when using the wetland or pond representation or wetland boundaries and drainage areas are not accurately depicted when using the pothole representation douglas mankin et al 2010 evenson et al 2015 in our model we didn t incorporate wetland modules due to a lack of robust corroborating data on giw function but we recognize that some of the error in low flow prediction might have come from this simplification of the model our future modeling efforts will refine or develop wetland modules to evaluate isolated wetland conservation and restoration on watershed water yields overall our model indicates that irrigation reduction is an effective way to increase streamflow for management purposes our model simulations are useful for evaluating the potential effectiveness of water conservation strategies and may help water managers and policymakers assess the relative value of various water conservation strategies for example if a goal were to increase flow by 0 2 m3 s at the downstream gage during extremely low flow periods an irrigation reduction of 70 from traditional application rates would be required under simulated conditions in the upper watershed a threshold of about 30 40 irrigation reduction triggered a 15 increase in both the upper and lower gages during extreme low flow fig 6 when additional streamflow would provide substantial ecological benefits rugel et al 2012 irrigation scenarios with a higher percent of water saving may not be realistic without drastic social economical changes however the relatively modest reductions in agricultural water use that triggered these hydrologic responses are already within the technical capabilities of existing irrigation technologies a study conducted within the ichawaynochaway creek watershed showed lower pressure sprinkler retrofits combined with end gun controls reduced water use up to 22 5 variable rate irrigation and remote soil moisture monitoring resulted in water saving of up to an additional 15 stripling irrigation research park 2018 an advanced irrigation scheduling tool using in field assessment has been demonstrated to save 1000 m3 ha 25 7 of water in the mediterranean region saab et al 2019 conservation tillage can reduce water demand up to 15 by using a cover crop and leaving plant residue in the field stripling irrigation research park 2018 these practices if widely implemented have the potential to achieve the level of irrigation reduction that could simultaneously maintain or increase crop yield while help restore critical flow to vulnerable aquatic ecosystems vellidis et al

episodic water scarcity in the region has already caused substantial and ongoing regional conflicts over water allocation particularly in the apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf river basin ruhl 2005 where water withdrawals in the upper basin have been blamed for negative impacts on downstream ecology and nearshore marine fisheries industry the flint portion of the basin is an interesting example

golladay et al 2004 native crayfishes sargent et al 2011 and fishes van den avyle and evans 1990 freeman et al 2013 golladay et al 2016 concerns about streamflow have increased interest in technologies that can improve agricultural water conservation while acknowledging that economic pressures and increasing human populations necessitate the continued use of irrigation for sustaining and improving crop yields thus maximizing irrigation system efficiency or the ratio of crop yield to water applied is imperative for example application efficiency or the ratio of water used by the crop to total water applied has improved from 75 to 85 in center pivot irrigation systems by using low pressure drop nozzles that reduce evaporative water loss during application mark masters personal communication 2017 and this technology has been widely adopted in the region other agriculture water conservation practices are being developed or employed in the region with varying degrees of effectiveness for example switching from standard application where water is applied evenly across an entire field to variable rate irrigation where water is applied in proportion to crop needs had a water saving of up to 15 vellidis et al 2016 and changing from the traditional checkbook method to smart irrigation scheduling in combination with conservation tillage can result in water saving of 12 76 in normal or wet years and 40 in dry years vellidis et al 2016 for ichawaynochaway creek a major tributary of the lower flint it has been estimated that a 20 reduction in irrigation below 2006 levels during drought years would meet the in stream flow criteria monthly 1 day minima and annual low flow duration virtually all the time couch and mcdowell 2006 however a more recent assessment of the broader effects of irrigation efficiency programs on streamflow is lacking our goal was to determine the effectiveness of irrigation water savings at restoring streamflow we hypothesized that reduced agricultural irrigation from groundwater would result in increases in streamflow and the impact of irrigation reduction on streamflow will be greatest during low flow periods when irrigation demand is often highest and overall water availability is low a hydrologic model was calibrated for the ichawaynochaway creek watershed to simulate streamflow responses across a range of reductions in agricultural water use from 0 to 100 of what is typically applied to crops based on calculated crop water demands to accurately simulate the wide range of irrigation adjustment we used the soil and water assessment tool swat which has the ability to represent watersheds with a wide range of land use and weather input data neitsch et al 2009 2 methods 2 1 study area the ichawaynochaway creek watershed is a huc 8 watershed located in the gulf coastal plain of southwestern georgia usa covering an area of approximately 2940 km2 fig 1 ichawaynochaway creek originates near weston ga usa 31 98

systems using groundwater sources from the upper floridan aquifer as well as surface water sources from ichawaynochaway creek its tributaries and multi function ponds hook et al 2005 groundwater is the largest source for irrigation for the study region fanning et al 2001 for the flint river basin over the year of 2001 groundwater withdrawal was 470 million m3 surface water withdrawal was 100 million m3 and multi function ponds also provided 34 million m3 of water hook et al 2005 besides runoff multi function ponds also collect baseflow and seepage and are often filled from nearby groundwater wells during periods without rain and runoff hook et al 2005 because of the dominance of groundwater as the irrigation source and the interconnectivity of irrigation sources groundwater was used for the entire ichawaynochaway creek watershed as irrigation source for this study 2 2 swat model description all analyses were performed using swat a continuous time semi distributed process based watershed model developed by the usda agricultural research service douglas mankin et al 2010 neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2012 swat has been applied at scales from small watersheds to large river basins and is designed for simulating the effects of land use and land management practices on the surface and groundwater neitsch et al 2009 in this study we used swat to simulate the impacts of agriculture water savings on streamflow 2 2 1 model inputs and set up input data for swat included topography soil classification land use including crop type weather and management i e irrigation

used as topographic input data obtained from u s geological survey national elevation dataset https lta cr usgs gov ned based on topography the watershed was then divided into 25 subbasins size ranging from 10 to 190 km2 the state soil geographic database statsgo soil survey staff 2017 for georgia was used as soil input data the texture of soil in the watershed ranges from loam to sand with 95 of soil having 50 sand the dominant soil hydrologic group is b covering 70 of the area the national land cover database 2011 was used as land use input data homer et al 2015 where possible land use

into two forest types longleaf pine pinus palustris mill and loblolly pine pinus taeda l with loblolly pine occupying 80 of frse to represent forest composition in the region martin et al 2012 parameters associated with longleaf pine loblolly pine and mixed forest were obtained from field measurements conducted at the jones center at ichauway www jonesctr org located within the study area

monteith method 2 2 2 model calibration and validation two u s geological survey streamflow gages in the ichawaynochaway watershed were used for calibration and validation ichawaynochaway creek at milford 02353500 and ichawaynochaway creek below newton 02355350 https waterdata usgs gov nwis the milford stream gage henceforth the upper gage drains an area of approximately 1600 km2 in the fall line hills physiographic region of the upper coastal plain the below newton stream gage henceforth the lower gage drains nearly the entire watershed including a large area of the dougherty plain physiographic region fig 1 based on data availability climate data from 1990 to 2016 were used for model calculation with a model spin up period from 1990 to 2000 to minimize the influence of initial states arnold et al 2013 stream data from 2009 to 2016 were used for model calibration because there were more climate data available for this period and the land cover input data more closely resembled current land use model validation utilized stream data from 2001 to 2008 both calibration and validation periods represented a number of extremes across the longer record including the extreme drought periods of june to november 2007 and june 2011 to july 2012 palmer drought severity index 4 and the extreme wet periods of july to august 2005 january 2010 august to september 2013 and april 2014 palmer drought severity index 4 fig 2 to calibrate against streamflow relevant input parameters governing surface runoff and baseflow were selected based on initial model performance and

gwqmn gw revap and sol awc table 2 the initial ranges of these parameters were assigned based on sensitivity analyses and knowledge of the study area the model was first calibrated for the upper gage then calibrated for the lower gage including adjusted parameters for the upper watershed table 2 model calibration was performed with sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm using swat cup arnold et al 2012 with swat cup latin hypercube sampling was used to generate 1000 parameter combinations within the selected minimum and maximum value range of each parameter swat cup then ran 1000 simulations each with a unique parameter combination after each simulation model simulated monthly streamflow was compared with measured streamflow based on these simulations the post processing option in swat cup suggested new parameter ranges for these parameters the new parameter ranges were then retested using global and local sensitivity analyses this process was repeated until no further improvement was observed arnold et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 the simulation results were evaluated based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr and r2 moriasi et al 2007 model evaluation was based on guidelines from moriasi et al 2007 model performance ratings in the range of good and very good moriasi et al 2007 were accepted for further analysis the best parameter combination was applied to model validation 2 2 3 agriculture irrigation scenarios we used the calibrated swat model to project the potential effects of irrigation reduction on streamflow shallow aquifer was used as irrigation water source irr sc 3 for crops located in each corresponding subbasin the swat model defines shallow aquifer as an aquifer which contributes return flow to streams within the watershed vs deep aquifer as an aquifer which doesn t contribute return flow to streams within the watershed arnold et al 1993 because of the high connectivity between streams and groundwater in the region rugel et al 2012 shallow aquifer as irrigation source was chosen for this model to compare water savings scenarios a baseline scenario was established full irrigation withdrawal was calculated based on climate and crop type as calculated by the model auto irrigation operation 100 irrigation no water conservation measures in place modeled monthly irrigation values in the full irrigation scenario were comparable to values reported in hook et al 2005 irrigation withdrawals in each hru were then adjusted using the manual irrigation operation from 90 of full irrigation to 0 of irrigation no irrigation in 10 increments in total 11 scenarios covering the full range 0 100 of possible irrigation reduction were tested in this study to quantify the impact of irrigation on streamflow model simulated streamflow volume was reported and later converted into water yield depth by dividing streamflow by watershed area to better compare with precipitation and evapotranspiration values to determine the effects of irrigation reduction on monthly streamflow we used a frequency pairing analysis method where we constructed flow duration curves for each simulation from 0 to 100 irrigation reduction this method ranks flow periods e g months in ascending order and relies on direct comparisons of flow during relatively similar hydrologic conditions e g flow at 5th 25th or 50th percentile to assess change alila et al 2009 to quantify the effects of irrigation reduction during specific flow conditions we focused on absolute and relative changes in flow during three flow conditions median flow 50th percentile which provides an estimate of central tendency and relates well to other metrics such as mean annual streamflow and yield the 25th percentile which represents a recognized state of low flow where hydrologic drought conditions start to occur and the 5th percentile which represents a state of extremely low flow where water supplies are threatened and ecosystem function may be severely impaired 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation for the calibration period 2009 2016 model performance for the upper gage was very good regarding nse 0 83 and rsr 0 41 and was very good in the bias between model estimation and observation for mean monthly streamflow pbias 14 4 for the lower gage the nse 0 86 rsr 0 38 and pbias 1 9 were all in the range of very good performance moriasi et al 2007 during the validation period 2001 2008 the model generated good results with nse 0 69 for the upper gage and nse 0 77 for the lower gage pbias was relatively small with satisfactory performance for the upper stream gage pbias 20 4 and good performance for the lower gage pbias 9 0 the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were also good for the upper rsr 0 56 and lower gages rsr 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 table 3 the model performed well during medium and high flow periods at both gages differences between model simulation and observed average monthly flow were primarily due to under prediction of streamflow during low flow periods especially at the upper gage fig 3 this was likely the reason the model performed slightly better at the lower gage the magnitude of differences between observed and simulated streamflow was small and monthly flow in both the simulated and actual stream never reached zero the 95 prediction uncertainty range covered 65 of data for the upper gage and 59 of data in the lower gage fig 3 3 2 annual water budget over the entire watershed simulated full irrigation based on climate and crop type as calculated by the model was 38 2 3 4 mm yr or 113 6 million m3 yr eliminating irrigation reduced evapotranspiration by 14 0 1 8 mm yr and surface runoff by 3 7 0 5 mm yr while it increased aquifer recharge by 26 6 2 8 mm yr annual water yield responded positively to reductions in irrigation withdrawals over the whole range of possible water use reduction scenarios simulated irrigation reduction measures increased annual streamflow on average 1 for each 10 reduction in irrigation increases in annual yield of the watershed ranged from 12 2 48 7 mm year 20 7 2 5 mm yr and were generally higher in years with more precipitation fig 4 however the proportional change in yield was higher in years with less precipitation and ranged from 4 to 16 increase fig 4 for the upper gage full irrigation 0 irrigation reduction resulted in mean annual streamflow of 14 4 m3 s or 454 million m3 yr which translates to a mean water yield value of 235 mm yr when no irrigation was applied mean streamflow was 15 6 m3 s which translates to 19 mm year greater annual yield or a 7 increase 3 3 monthly streamflow effects simulated reductions in irrigation increased monthly streamflow over a wide range of hydrological conditions at both the upper and the lower gages fig 5 irrigation reduction has decreased the probability of extreme low flow 5th percentile at the upper gage a mean monthly flow of 1 m3 s 5 5 exceedance probability occurred during 11 months under the normal irrigation scenario but that number decreased to 9 months 4 5 exceedance probability under the no irrigation scenario fig 5 at the lower gage 100 irrigation reduction raised 5th percentile flow from 1 4 m3 s to 2 5 m3 s fig 5 simulated irrigation reduction had a consistently positive effect on streamflow during median low and extremely low flow months figs 5 and 6 in terms of absolute flow median streamflow 50th percentile increased more with irrigation reduction than low 25th percentile or extremely low flows however proportional responses change in flow were greatest during extremely low flows fig 6 the simulated change in median monthly flow between no irrigation and normal irrigation 100 or maximum was 1 73 m3 s 16 for the upper gage and 0 95 m3 s for the lower gage fig 6 monthly mean streamflow changes of extremely low flow were 0 33 27 and 0 31 m3 s respectively fig 6 for the driest months even small reductions in irrigation e g 10 20 resulted in modest increases in streamflow and a threshold of about 20 30 irrigation reduction was necessary to achieve a 10 increase in streamflow at both stream gages figs 6 and 7 the upper gage appeared more sensitive to irrigation reduction than the lower gage across a wider range of flow conditions fig 7 greater responses to irrigation reduction occurred in the drier months at both gages with the greatest flow increase of 70 78 at the 11th driest month of the lower gage in response to 70 100 irrigation reduction fig 7 4 discussion our simulations showed that reducing agricultural water use increased streamflow our modeling period covered a wide range of potential natural variability with july 2012 representing the lowest flow since 1940 results suggested that under these extremely low flow conditions small irrigation reductions would trigger small but potentially ecologically important increases in streamflow this was evident at the upstream gage where a 10 reduction in irrigation resulted in a 7 increase in streamflow at the downstream gage under extremely low flow conditions streamflow was 35 higher with no irrigation than with normal irrigation this finding of higher sensitivity during extremely low flow conditions is consistent with several previous studies regarding land use impact on streamflow when 16 of the land in the xinjiang river basin in china was changed from forest to grassland annual basin discharge increased 1 7 with the largest change of 4 4 observed during the driest period guo et al 2008 in the chemoga watershed in ethiopia when annual rainfall decreased at a rate of 0 3 mm year and area of cropland and eucalypt plantations increased annual streamflow decreased at 1 7 mm year the impact was most pronounced during the dry season with significant declines in monthly and daily extreme low flow while no trend was observed during the wet season bewket and sterk 2005 these results all demonstrated that water balance during extremely dry periods is exceptionally sensitive to even small changes in water use whether from natural et oishi et al 2010 or human consumption decreased streamflows due to irrigation during periods when flows are already extremely low due to drought have substantial effects on aquatic fauna such as fishes mussels and crayfishes golladay et al 2004 sargent et al 2011 freeman et al 2013 although the flow of ichawaynochaway creek didn t reach zero during the model period or the historical record many un gaged tributary streams ceased to flow during extreme dry periods and only isolated pools remained golladay et al 2004 rugel et al 2012 indicating an increasing trend towards stream intermittency in the region gordon et al 2012 a previous drought survey of mussels in the lower flint river basin showed that flow cessation caused a decline in abundance of both federally listed and common mussel species golladay et al 2004 in the upper flint river basin landscape scale models showed fish species richness declined in response to drought and recovered afterward freeman et al 2013 even small quantities of additional flow may prove vitally important in maintaining in stream habitat quality especially during dry periods under our irrigation reduction scenarios the upper basin was more responsive than the lower basin fig 7 differences in sensitivities of the upper and lower gages may be due to differences in the land cover and or the influence of groundwater the upper watershed had a greater proportion of irrigated land with 85 000 ha of agriculture or 52 of total area while the lower basin had 48 000 ha or 41 of the total area fig 1 additionally because the lower watershed is located in the dougherty plain groundwater inputs may buffer the streamflow response to changes in surface water budgets as reflected in the model s calibrated parameters for example the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn was larger in the upper watershed than the lower watershed table 2 and shallower gwqmn in the lower watershed allowed it to have a larger impact of groundwater on the stream also the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf was larger in the upper watershed than the lower watershed table 2 representing a faster groundwater flow response to changes in recharge in the upper watershed arnold et al 2013 karst systems have been known to pose unique challenges for surface and groundwater modeling amin et al 2017 previous research has shown swat to be effective in modeling streamflow in karst systems on a monthly step though less successful on finer time steps spruill et al 2000 our model performed reasonably well considering the challenge posed by the subsurface heterogeneity and groundwater preferential flow paths characteristic of karst systems which likely alter infiltration and surface runoff and consequently evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and streamflow hartmann et al 2015 malard et al 2016 the modeling challenges posed by groundwater inputs were most apparent by under prediction of streamflow during low flow periods fig 3 very low flows were relatively difficult to predict accurately especially during extreme dry periods periods of very low flow also provide challenges for usgs field personnel making measurements of stream discharge thus uncertainty in stage discharge relations may also indirectly affect model predictions the magnitude of differences between observed and simulated discharge were small and the majority of data points were within the 95 prediction uncertainty range fig 3 finally another unique feature of our study area that posed challenges for hydrologic modeling is the abundance of geographically isolated wetlands or giws in the dougherty plain martin et al 2012 giws have been shown to increase landscape hydrologic capacitance by storing excess run off during floods and slowly releasing water afterwards hey and philippi 1995 mitsch and gosselink 2000 mclaughlin et al 2014 there are 21 000 ha 19 of wetlands in the lower basin fig 1 most of which are giws giws have been shown to increase baseflow contribution to streamflow via groundwater recharge during low flow periods especially where soils have high hydraulic conductivity winter and labaugh 2003 evenson et al 2015 lee et al 2018 however the swat model represents isolated wetlands as either de spatialized and aggregated when using the wetland or pond representation or wetland boundaries and drainage areas are not accurately depicted when using the pothole representation douglas mankin et al 2010 evenson et al 2015 in our model we didn t incorporate wetland modules due to a lack of robust corroborating data on giw function but we recognize that some of the error in low flow prediction might have come from this simplification of the model our future modeling efforts will refine or develop wetland modules to evaluate isolated wetland conservation and restoration on watershed water yields overall our model indicates that irrigation reduction is an effective way to increase streamflow for management purposes our model simulations are useful for evaluating the potential effectiveness of water conservation strategies and may help water managers and policymakers assess the relative value of various water conservation strategies for example if a goal were to increase flow by 0 2 m3 s at the downstream gage during extremely low flow periods an irrigation reduction of 70 from traditional application rates would be required under simulated conditions in the upper watershed a threshold of about 30 40 irrigation reduction triggered a 15 increase in both the upper and lower gages during extreme low flow fig 6 when additional streamflow would provide substantial ecological benefits rugel et al 2012 irrigation scenarios with a higher percent of water saving may not be realistic without drastic social economical changes however the relatively modest reductions in agricultural water use that triggered these hydrologic responses are already within the technical capabilities of existing irrigation technologies a study conducted within the ichawaynochaway creek watershed showed lower pressure sprinkler retrofits combined with end gun controls reduced water use up to 22 5 variable rate irrigation and remote soil moisture monitoring resulted in water saving of up to an additional 15 stripling irrigation research park 2018 an advanced irrigation scheduling tool using in field assessment has been demonstrated to save 1000 m3 ha 25 7 of water in the mediterranean region saab et al 2019 conservation tillage can reduce water demand up to 15 by using a cover crop and leaving plant residue in the field stripling irrigation research park 2018 these practices if widely implemented have the potential to achieve the level of irrigation reduction that could simultaneously maintain or increase crop yield while help restore critical flow to vulnerable aquatic ecosystems vellidis et al

of gauged basins for calibration the objectives of this study are two fold 1 we aim to develop a framework for parsimonious hydrological models to simulate impact of land cover changes using an existing disaggregation technique tran et al 2018 and 2 we want to apply this framework for two case studies in belgium based on available lulc scenarios towards 2050 to see the impact of urbanisation on extreme river flows note that the end point of a typical disaggregation technique as also proposed by tran et al 2018 is a conceptual hydrological model with a finer resolution compared to the starting point whereas here we want to update a conceptual hydrological model at a certain resolution here lumped with new information obtained by means of the selected disaggregation technique for the first objective we aim to combine the flexibility of spatially distributed modelling with the speed and computational efficiency of lumped hydrological models starting from a well calibrated lumped conceptual hydrological model and based on a top down disaggregation approach tran et al 2018 a spatially distributed model is created step 1 section 3 2 2 in this model we apply the lulc scenarios to obtain adjusted maps of model parameters step 2 section 3 2 3 the top down approach of tran et al 2018 avoids the need of a large number of neighboring catchments when applying typical regionalization methods now instead of running the computationally expensive spatially distributed model the first step is inversed by re aggregating the parameter maps to corresponding lumped values step 3 section 3 2 4 post processing tools as detailed in section 3 3 further allow to quantify impacts on river peak flow and low flow extremes the approach is demonstrated and tested for two case studies in belgium based on historical data 2 case studies and data catchments considered for this study are the grote nete catchment upstream of geel zammel and the zuunbeek catchment upstream of sint pieters leeuw these are located in the northern flanders and brussels region of belgium fig 1 the grote nete catchment with an area of 385 km2 is situated in the north eastern part of belgium the region has predominant arenic soil coverage with some loamic fractions found in the valleys the zuunbeek catchment covers an area of 65 km2 and is located in the center of belgium the soil type is dominated by a siltic soil covering over 95 of the basin further some loamic and arenic fractions are also found in the valleys more information on the case studies can be found in de niel and willems 2019 past 1988 and 2000 and current 2010 lulc maps are available from poelmans 2010 and https ruimtemodel vlaanderen all lulc maps are considered at the same spatial resolution of 100 m 100 m to avoid that additional uncertainties are introduced by resampling the five future lulc scenarios published in 2011 are based on different projections of future developments in various sectors such as energy mobility and environment these developments differ whether they are driven from a regional rather than from an international perspective and or carried by governmental rather than by private initiatives based on recent changes in the local policy ruimte vlaanderen 2017 the rc and se scenarios appear more likely than the ge and tm scenarios hence the ge and tm scenarios will further not be considered fig 2 summarizes the lulc changes in both catchments between 1988 2000 2010 and 2050 projected the spatial variation of the lulc for the year 2000 is shown in fig 1 the grote nete catchment has a significant forested area and is more urbanised compared with the zuunbeek catchment the zuunbeek catchment on the contrary is characterized through a larger portion of cropland for both catchments the most important trend in lulc changes is the increase of urban and built up area 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological modelling for the grote nete catchment the lumped conceptual hydrological model nam dhi 2009 is calibrated and validated for the periods 2005 2009 and 2010 2014 respectively and is considered the reference period the framework is then applied to obtain lumped hydrological model parameter values for the scenario period 1997 2001 a similar set up is done for the zuunbeek catchment with 1996 2000 and 2001 2005 as calibration and validation periods for the reference model and 1987 1991 as scenario period this is summarized in table 1 all hydrological and meteorological data are available online www waterinfo be the hydrological models are run with a daily timestep the precipitation input is taken for each catchment from a representative rain gauge and the potential evapotranspiration input is calculated via the penman bultot formula bultot et al 1983 3 2 incorporating lulc changes in lumped hydrological models 3 2 1 general fig 3 gives an outline of the proposed model based framework for efficient impact calculations of land cover changes on hydrology it starts with a well calibrated lumped conceptual hydrological model this study uses nam dhi 2009 but note that the methodology can be applied on other lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models in the same context note that previous research has already validated other lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models and that the impact results obtained through these various models were consistent tavakoli et al 2014 vansteenkiste et al 2014a 2014b the moscem ua algorithm vrugt et al 2003 is used to perform model calibrations with nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and nse of the logarithm of the flows nselog as objective functions 3 2 2 step 1 from the calibrated model selected lumped conceptual model parameters Œ∏ are disaggregated using the method of tran et al 2018 every grid cell k gets assigned a

catchment average of these grid cell characteristic and f a dimensionless catchment specific and resolution independent parameter to be calibrated regulating the sensitivity of the model parameter Œ∏ to the physically based grid cell characteristic œÅ the cell characteristics used for the disaggregation of the lumped model parameters are listed in table 2 similar to the ones suggested by tran et al 2018 the manning coefficient n root zone depth d total available water taw and potential runoff coefficient c are obtained as a function of lulc soil texture and slope from look up tables available for belgium liu and de smedt 2004 tran et al 2018 the slope s can be easily calculated from the digital terrain model data note that in eq 1 the cell characteristics œÅ are only used to give a relative spatial variation to the parameter values and thus not used to obtain absolute parameter values 3 2 3 step 2 when changing lulc from a reference situation to a specific scenario the relationship between physically based cell properties and hydrological model parameters built in step 1 in fig 3 is used to update the parameter values at each individual cell according to the changed lulc and as such a new map of distributed parameter values is obtained 3 2 4 step 3 rather than running the computationally expensive distributed hydrological model the new parameter values are re aggregated in order to obtain updated lumped parameter values step 3 in fig 3 the re aggregation is essentially the overall areal average of the updated spatially variable parameter values note that this is the inverse application of eq 1 the validity of this averaging process has been previously discussed by tran et al 2018 3 2 5 testing this framework is tested based on historical conditions with known lulc and streamflow for both reference and scenario periods see table 1 for the reference period a reference model mref is obtained through the abovementioned calibration procedure a scenario model msce is obtained through application of the proposed framework for each of the selected periods calibration and validation windows in the reference period and the scenario period the performance of both models is checked 3 2 6 impact of future lulc changes the framework can further be used after testing to investigate the impact of future land cover changes by forcing this framework with future scenarios the rc se and bau scenarios in this study these future lulc scenarios are used in combination with the reference meteorological data in order to quantify the hydrological impact for projected lulc changes only the consideration of climate change projections in combination with the lulc changes is beyond the scope of this study 3 3 extreme river flows and impact calculations extreme river flows are analyzed by means of empirical extreme value distributions for peak flow extremes and flow duration curves for low flow extremes peak flow extremes are extracted from the daily runoff time series using a peak over threshold method willems 2009 these peak flows are then sorted from more extreme to less extreme values and empirical return periods are assigned when comparing the results for the scenario model with these of the reference model the peak flow impact is calculated per return period t as the relative difference of the peak flow extremes in the scenario and reference periods 2 Œ¥ p e a k t p f t s c e n a r i o p f t r e f e r e n c e p f t r e f e r e n c e low flow extremes are quantified using flow duration curves and discharges at specific exceedance probabilities e g q80 q90 and q99 similar to eq 2 low flow impacts are calculated as the relative difference of these discharge values in the scenario and reference periods 3 Œ¥ l o w œÅ q p s c e n a r i o q p r e f e r e n c e q p r e f e r e n c e 4 results and discussion 4 1 testing of the framework using historical data the proposed framework results in parameter adjustments for the lumped conceptual model depending on the lulc changes as shown in table 3 both study catchments have a lower percentage of urban and built up area in the scenario period 2000 and 1988 for grote nete and zuunbeek respectively compared with the reference period 2010 and 2000 for grote nete and zuunbeek respectively see also fig 2 and table 1 this leads to a decrease of the overland flow runoff coefficient cqof an increase of the lower zone storage lmax and an increase of the recession constants for quick flow ckif and ck1 2 table 4 shows the overall performance in terms of nse and nselog of the reference and scenario models mref and msce with both models applied to the reference and scenario periods firstly it can be seen that all models show a good performance according to the performance criteria set out by moriasi et al 2007 secondly the change in model parameters mref vs msce has a minor influence on model performance the nse values slightly increases when model parameters are adjusted to account for changed lulc performance of reference vs scenario model for each of the three considered periods for example for the grote nete catchment when the original model mref is used in the scenario period the nse value is equal to 0 60 when the model parameters are adjusted to account for the changed lulc msce the nse increases to 0 65 as such it is shown that model performance can be slightly improved without the need for an additional calibration but rather by applying the proposed framework and taking the correct lulc maps into account the difference in performance between the reference and scenario periods can at least partially be attributed to different climatic conditions because the analysis of this influence is beyond the scope of the present study table 4 should be read horizontally for each individual period we are interested in the performance difference between the models mref and msce the model improvement is more pronounced for the grote nete case compared to the zuunbeek case as always model performance is catchment specific and thus also model improvement through application of the proposed framework however the difference in model improvements can also be traced back to the changes in model parameters the changes in model parameters table 3 are more pronounced for the grote nete case compared with the zuunbeek case this can be explained by the differences in lulc changes fig 2 which are more pronounced for the grote nete case the added value of the proposed framework becomes clear when investigating peak flow behavior fig 4 shows that for both catchments the scenario model outperforms the reference model in the scenario period the same yields for the reference period and reference model as with the results from table 4 differences in performance are more pronounced for the grote nete case compared with the zuunbeek case 4 2 impact of projected lulc changes on extreme river flows towards 2050 fig 5 shows the changes in river flow extremes for the three future lulc scenarios it is shown that on average peak flow extremes in the grote nete catchment would increase by 2 5 or 14 for the rc se and bau scenarios respectively for the se and rc scenarios these changes do not vary with the return period for the bau scenario the extremely high peak flow extremes undergo higher changes compared with the less extreme peak flow extremes low flow extremes in turn are projected to decrease on average with 1 2 and 5 for the rc se and bau scenarios respectively similar to the peakflow extremes for the bau scenario the more extreme low flow extremes decrease more compared with the less extreme low flow extremes for the zuunbeek catchment an increase of 8 for the peak flow extremes is projected by the bau scenario the rc scenario shows a status quo regarding low flow extremes the bau scenario projects a decrease of 33 and the rc scenario a decrease of 4 interestingly the se scenario projects opposite changes a decrease of peak flow extremes 2 and an increase of low flow extremes 10 this is caused by a projected decrease in urban and built up area for the zuunbeek catchment in the strong europe scenario fig 6 further relates the projected changes in extreme river flows to the fraction of urban and built up land for the specific scenarios regarding changes in river peak flows and changes in built up and urban area a similar behavior is found for both catchments with a clear positive correlation r2 0 96 on average an increase of 10 in urban and built up area corresponds with an increase in river peak flow extremes of 3 these results correspond to the results found by tavakoli et al 2014 who investigated the impact of urban development on extreme flows in the grote nete catchment absolute numbers differ as they used more extreme urban development scenarios however on average they predicted a 3 5 increase in peak flows for an increase of 10 in urban area which is comparable to our results note that they used a distributed hydrological model a data based attribution study in the same area concluded that based on data from 29 catchments over the past four decades a 1 increase in settlement area has caused changes in river peak flows in the range of 2 5 de niel and willems 2019 regarding projected changes in low flow extremes the correlation with changes in urban and built up area is inversed fig 7 for the grote nete catchment tavakoli et al 2014 concluded that low flow extremes would remain more or less the same as in the current condition this is in line with our results where the projected changes in low flow extremes range between 5 for the zuunbeek catchment however projected changes are much higher this is in line with observations fig 8 a stable behavior of yearly minima is found for the 1980s and 1990s however around 2000 higher yearly minima are found and later in the 2010s this decreases again also it must be noted that the catchment area of the zuunbeek is a lot smaller compared to the grote nete as such small absolute changes will result in large relative changes for the low flows in the zuunbeek 5 conclusions with this study we proposed a framework to incorporate land use land cover lulc changes in lumped conceptual hydrological models it builds on a previously developed disaggregation approach tran et al 2018 where the spatial variation in hydrological model parameters are linked to the variation in particular catchment characteristics the proposed framework was tested based on historical conditions for two catchments in belgium and a good match was found between observations and model predictions with the framework several urban development scenarios were investigated it was found that on average 10 increase in urban area causes about 3 increase in river peak flow extremes regardless of the scenario and or catchment considered for low flow extremes both catchments show decreased low flow extremes under increased urbanization but the order of magnitude of the impact results differs for the two catchments this study focused on urban development only for future land use land cover scenarios however in order to have a complete picture on the changes by means of a full attribution study one should also consider climate change scenarios and future changes in river management climate change simulations related to hydrology are nowadays typically done through ensemble modelling hydrological models with low computational costs are thus preferred in this context the proposed framework can be considered beneficial for use in model based attribution studies declaration of competing interest the authors confirm they have no conflict of

interestingly the se scenario projects opposite changes a decrease of peak flow extremes 2 and an increase of low flow extremes 10 this is caused by a projected decrease in urban and built up area for the zuunbeek catchment in the strong europe scenario fig 6 further relates the projected changes in extreme river flows to the fraction of urban and built up land for the specific scenarios regarding changes in river peak flows and changes in built up and urban area a similar behavior is found for both catchments with a clear positive correlation r2 0 96 on average an increase of 10 in urban and built up area corresponds with an increase in river peak flow extremes of 3 these results correspond to the results found by tavakoli et al 2014 who investigated the impact of urban development on extreme flows in the grote nete catchment absolute numbers differ as they used more extreme urban development scenarios however on average they predicted a 3 5 increase in peak flows for an increase of 10 in urban area which is comparable to our results note that they used a distributed hydrological model a data based attribution study in the same area concluded that based on data from 29 catchments over the past four decades a 1 increase in settlement area has caused changes in river peak flows in the range of 2 5 de niel and willems 2019 regarding projected changes in low flow extremes the correlation with changes in urban and built up area is inversed fig 7 for the grote nete catchment tavakoli et al 2014 concluded that low flow extremes would remain more or less the same as in the current condition this is in line with our results where the projected changes in low flow extremes range between 5 for the zuunbeek catchment however projected changes are much higher this is in line with observations fig 8 a stable behavior of yearly minima is found for the 1980s and 1990s however around 2000 higher yearly minima are found and later in the 2010s this decreases again also it must be noted that the catchment area of the zuunbeek is a lot smaller compared to the grote nete as such small absolute changes will result in large relative changes for the low flows in the zuunbeek 5 conclusions with this study we proposed a framework to incorporate land use land cover lulc changes in lumped conceptual hydrological models it builds on a previously developed disaggregation approach tran et al 2018 where the spatial variation in hydrological model parameters are linked to the variation in particular catchment characteristics the proposed framework was tested based on historical conditions for two catchments in belgium and a good match was found between observations and model predictions with the framework several urban development scenarios were investigated it was found that on average 10 increase in urban area causes about 3 increase in river peak flow extremes regardless of the scenario and or catchment considered for low flow extremes both catchments show decreased low flow extremes under increased urbanization but the order of magnitude of the impact results differs for the two catchments this study focused on urban development only for future land use land cover scenarios however in order to have a complete picture on the changes by means of a full attribution study one should also consider climate change scenarios and future changes in river management climate change simulations related to hydrology are nowadays typically done through ensemble modelling hydrological models with low computational costs are thus preferred in this context the proposed framework can be considered beneficial for use in model based attribution studies declaration of competing interest the authors confirm they have no conflict of

8367,study region western tennessee u s a study focus recharge to aquifers that underlie loess and other fine grained surficial deposits in western tennessee as well as other areas is commonly impeded resulting in sensitivity in regard to sustainability of groundwater resources this study investigates the role of preferential pathways of recharge to the regional memphis aquifer in an area mantled by loess and fine grained paleosols new hydrological insights data gathered through a vadose zone chloride mass balance analysis and a year of monitoring physical hydrologic water chemistry and environmental and applied tracer data within an upland watershed in western tennessee indicate that recharge to the memphis aquifer is dominated by lateral recharge of infiltrated stream water sources rather than vertical infiltration through loess covered uplands the results from this research challenge prevailing models of recharge to the memphis aquifer and aquifers mantled by loess or other fine grained soils in other regions that envision vertical recharge through fine grained soils to be the dominant recharge mechanism keywords groundwater loess aquifer vertical infiltration lateral recharge 1 introduction surficial deposits of loess and reworked fine grained sediment have potential to inhibit recharge to underlying aquifer systems limiting sustainability of regional groundwater resources prill 1977 huang et al 2017 gerginov et al 2018 slow infiltration rates through loess and other fine grained soils hinder downward movement of water through unsaturated zone profiles weinthal et al 2005 deng et al 2015 kalhoro et al 2018 in part due to differences in vegetative cover dafny and ≈°im√∫nek 2016 land use gates et al 2011 and soil water use by vegetation zhang et al 2018 several studies have emphasized the importance of diffuse infiltration and percolation through loess and other fine grained soils as the dominant recharge process deng et al 2015 dafny and ≈°im√∫nek 2016 huang et al 2017 however some studies suggest other recharge processes such as preferential flow through the unsaturated zone or infiltration through stream valley sediments may be important lin and wei 2006 gates et al 2011 2014 the present study investigates recharge processes through a loess mantled landscape in western tennessee using hydrologic tracers in precipitation soil and groundwater along with water balance to assess mechanisms and magnitudes of recharge the results emphasize the varying roles of multiple recharge processes and pathways beneath regions with complex surficial stratigraphy topography and land use history the memphis aquifer is a major source of water for municipal and industrial supplies in the northern mississippi embayment me of the central u s brahana and broshears 2001 previous research suggests that much of the recharge to the unconsolidated sand of the memphis aquifer in western tennessee occurs within the exposure belt of the aquifer parks and carmichael 1990 brahana and broshears 2001 however field based assessment of recharge rates and mechanisms are lacking recent mapping studies indicate that recharge to the aquifer could be impeded by quaternary loess and underlying paleosols on upland surfaces in the exposure belt of the memphis aquifer in western tennessee larsen and brock 2014 despite the aquifer s regional importance little is known regarding recharge processes in the unconfined region similar aquifers in unconsolidated sand with overlying loess or other fine grained soils exist throughout the north american midwest and gulf coast regions gates et al 2014 nolan et al 2007 as well as other parts of the world dawes et al 2012 dafny and ≈°im√∫nek 2016 and may have similar processes affecting recharge rates and pathways this present study focuses on evaluating recharge processes in a small watershed in the unconfined region of the memphis aquifer in western tennessee the main objectives are to ascertain rates and pathways of groundwater recharge using meteorological and hydrologic measurements geochemistry and both environmental and applied tracer data these data are used to constrain soil moisture conditions hydrologic balance in the upland watershed and chemical signatures of soil and surface waters as well as groundwater recharge pathways are addressed using an applied tracer bromide br and tritium 3h and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 residence times 1 1 previous work western tennessee is mantled by 0 15 m of middle to upper pleistocene loess overlying 0 30 m of pliocene and pleistocene fluvial terrace deposits and as much as 1000 m of cretaceous and paleogene sand silt clay and coal representing coastal plain and marine deposits moore and brown 1969 russell and parks 1975 the loess includes as many as four distinct units separated by paleosols rodbell et al 1997 grimley et al 2009 pigati et al 2014 the underlying fluvial terrace deposits are comprised primarily of sand and gravel van arsdale et al 2008 but also commonly have paleosol development within fine grained sediments in the upper meter larsen and brock 2014 the fluvial terrace deposits disconformably overlie cretaceous and paleogene sediments comprising alternating sand rich aquifer and silt and clay rich confining units that dip gently to the northwest at 1 moore and brown 1969 brahana and broshears 2001 late pleistocene and holocene alluvium comprised of sand and gravel overlain by sandy silt partially fill modern stream valleys carmichael et al 2018 grimley et al 2009 the memphis aquifer consists of the eocene memphis sand which varies from coarse to fine grained unconsolidated sand with interbedded silt and clay moore and brown 1969 parks and carmichael 1990 lumsden et al 2009 larsen and brock 2014 the memphis aquifer is regionally confined by clay and silt strata in the upper claiborne confining unit in westernmost tennessee but is unconfined to the east of the confined region due to the shallow northwestern dip of me strata and erosional removal of upper claiborne strata russell and parks 1975 parks and carmichael 1990 these conditions result in a 50 km wide belt of unconfined memphis sand to the east of the confined region where the sand is exposed mainly in upland stream valleys but overlain by 3 5 m of pliocene fluvial terrace deposits and pleistocene loess beneath the upland surfaces larsen and brock 2014 the upper few meters of the memphis sand commonly have paleosol development with extensive accumulated clay larsen and brock 2014 parks and carmichael 1990 suggested that groundwater recharge results from infiltration of precipitation in the outcrop region of the memphis sand but little is known regarding the details of the process current information indicates that recharge rates of the memphis aquifer vary spatially across the region bailey 1993 brahana and broshears 2001 and in some places include leakage mechanisms through the overlying upper claiborne confining unit parks 1990 bradley 1991 brahana and broshears 2001 larsen et al 2003 2013 gentry et al 2006 groundwater elevation in the memphis aquifer within the unconfined region in haywood county tennessee well ha h 007 varied between 0 3 and 1 0 m per year between 2003 and 2012 united states geological survey 2015 less than annual variations typically between 2 3 m within the confined memphis aquifer in shelby county during the same time period kingsbury 2018 these data suggest recharge of the memphis aquifer in both unconfined and confined regions with more recharge in shelby county where the pumping stress is focused kingsbury 2018 water balance is commonly used to estimate recharge in humid temperate regions scanlon et al 2002 the soil water

loess and other fine grained surface soils allison and hughes 1983 macfarlane et al 2000 russo et al 2003 nolan et al 2007 gates et al 2011 huang et al 2017 this method requires measurement of the precipitation per unit watershed area the average chloride concentrations of precipitation and dry deposition and the average chloride concentration throughout the vadose zone or the uppermost saturated zone allison and hughes 1978 sharma and hughes 1985 limitations to the cmb method include non steady state chloride mass flux difficulty quantifying runoff sourced chloride and preferential

sf6 busenberg and plummer 2000 with known atmospheric source and residence time histories as well as applied tracers such as dyes and conservative ions such as br an advantage of tracers is that they can track recharge from variation sources and of different residence times cook and b√∂hlke 2000 1 2 site description the pinecrest study area is in the rural uplands of western tennessee fig 1 approximately 80 km east of memphis with almost 25 percent of western tennessee acting as a recharge zone to the memphis aquifer parks and carmichael 1990 the pinecrest research site was chosen because of its central location in the exposure belt of the aquifer the land use at the site is predominantly deciduous forest with cultivated grass fields on the upland surfaces the memphis area receives an average annual rainfall of 137 cm national weather service 2019 although surrounded by agriculture land use the pinecrest site has not been farmed for approximately 40 years and no use of chlorinated pesticides is known the surface soils in the area include a variety of silt loam alfisols and inceptisols on upland surfaces and silty sand inceptisols and entisols along the valley margins and valley floor flowers 1964 the underlying geologic units on the uplands include 1 3 meters of loess 1 2 meters of pliocene fluvial terrace deposits with paleosol development and the memphis sand with paleosol development in the upper 1 3 meters larsen and brock 2014 quaternary alluvium locally fills upland valleys and transitions down gradient into alluvial fan deposits that extend into the floodplain of perennial streams fig 1 pinewood creek pwc is a small stream that flows through the study area it is ephemeral in the upper reaches near the instrumented hillslope fig 1 and intermittent in the lower reach near dpw fig 1 the shoulder of the upland hillslope lies at approximately 162 m above sea level asl whereas the pwc watershed terminus is about 120 m asl in elevation where it discharges to the wolf river fig 1 sets of lysimeters and soil tensiometers lt clusters installed at 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m were placed at four locations along a hillslope shoulder slope ss back slope bs back slope gully floor gf and valley floor vf fig 1 three wells were installed in the watershed for monitoring groundwater level beneath the upland surface ss 2 in ss2 valley floor vfw and down gradient valley floor dpw locations table 1 each well was instrumented with a solinst pressure transducer a fourth monitoring well at the shoulder slope location ss 4 in ss4 is screened along its entire length but was not utilized in the study a davis wireless vantage vue weather station installed at the hill top recorded temperature atmospheric pressure wind speed and direction and precipitation a parshall flume with a pressure transducer was installed in pwc adjacent to the instrumented hillslope fig 1 to calculate stream discharge in the ephemeral reach e g kilpatrick and schneider 1983 the transducers and weather station were synchronized and recorded measurements at 15 minute intervals 2 methods initial investigation of recharge on the upland surfaces involved drilling a vadose zone borehole by hollow stem auger in a grass field at the weather station in fig 1 to a total depth of 44 m at which point drilling was terminated in a dense white clay core obtained from the borehole was used to determine site stratigraphy and measure vadose zone water content and chloride concentrations for application of vadose zone cmb method to estimate vertical recharge allison and hughes 1978 1983 sharma and hughes 1985 deng et al 2015 huang et al 2017 to evaluate recharge processes in the watershed water balance parameter measurements eq 1 were conducted in the study area from march 2014 to february 2015 soil moisture groundwater level and groundwater geochemistry were monitored for a year three monitoring wells a production well pool well table 1 swimming pool water and the stream water at the site were sampled for geochemistry in august 2014 along with 3h and sf6 in two of the monitoring wells tritium and sf6 are useful tracers for determining subsurface residence time of waters as much as 60 years old e g wilson and mackay 1993 cook and b√∂hlke 2000 a nabr applied tracer study was also completed along the hill slope to assess the short term recharge rate and pathway of groundwater movement 2 1 field methods the vadose zone borehole was drilled dry with a 10 cm inner diameter hollow stem auger assembly the individual drilling tubes were 152 cm long and fitted with two 76 cm long polycarbonate sleeves to eliminate moisture loss from the sampled sediment sample handling and analysis are described in larsen and waldron 2020 accompanying methodx paper water balance and hydrochemical data collection were made on a bi weekly schedule from march 2014 to february 2015 bursi 2015 bi weekly field tasks included measuring water volume in lysimeters and pressure in tensiometers downloading data from the weather station and inspecting the flume to ensure proper function and flow through the device monthly tasks include measuring groundwater levels sampling lysimeter and stream water for geochemical analyses and downloading transducer data the flume transducer data were compensated with the barometric pressure data from the weather station for each discharge event a baseline was defined based on the transducer pressure prior to the event this baseline was then applied throughout the discharge event any measured pressure that surpassed this baseline was evidence of discharge data gaps occurred from july 3 17 2014 precipitation events during this time were compared to similar events based on precipitation quantity and intensity discharge was then estimated for that period based on a linear stream response to similar events the tensiometers were checked to ensure they had not run dry which produces a false zero measurement if the tensiometer still had water during a site visit the measurement was recorded in centibars cb and then refilled with deionized water tensiometer gauges were removed in late november 2014 to avoid freezing lysimeter water was purged into 2 l amber bottles with a transfer cap using a vacuum hand pump tubing and bottles were triple rinsed with deionized water after every use monthly static groundwater level measurements were made using a solinst water level meter measured groundwater elevations and barometric pressure from the weather station were used to correct transducer data obtained from wells abrupt rise or fall in the pressure transducer data resulted from inconsistent pressure transducer position in the well and error with the barometric compensation field geochemical measurements include ph temperature dissolved oxygen and specific conductance raw and filtered acidified water samples were obtained at the sampling sites if sufficient water existed after the field parameters were taken filtered and acidified samples were obtained after passing through a 0 45 Œºm microcellulose filter and preserved with concentrated nitric acid hno3 to achieve a 1 nitric acid solution all water samples were stored on ice in a cooler and returned to the water lab at the university of memphis for analysis of alkalinity and major dissolved cations and anions in august 2014 the monitoring wells and pwc at locations near the dpw were sampled for field geochemical measurements and laboratory analysis grab samples of surface swimming pool and subsurface water were obtained and analyzed using the same procedures as described above for the lysimeter waters except that total alkalinity was performed in the field instead of the lab water from the pool well was obtained from a spigot adjacent to the well water from the dpw was obtained by bailing three borehole volumes from the well water samples from the deep wells ss2 and vfw were obtained by low flow pumping from depth using a submersible turbine pump and monitored using a ysi 6600 multi parameter probe to assess stabilization of the field geochemical measurements once the field geochemical measurements stabilized final field geochemical measurements were recorded and samples were taken and stored in the same manner as those from grab samples field geochemical measurements were also collected from the dpw and pool well and samples returned to the lab for analysis duplicate samples field blanks and equipment blanks were obtained to assess the quality and reproducibility of chemical data groundwater samples for 3h and sf6 from the ss2 and vfw wells were collected in one liter air tight amber bottles the sample bottles were primed with continuous flow for five minutes and then filled and sealed with electrical tape over the cap to prevent air from entering the sample samples for 3h and sf6 were analyzed at the university of utah dissolved and noble gas laboratory a tracer injection was performed to assess rate and pathway of infiltration from the hillslope lt cluster bs fig 1 to the water table on november 11 2014 sixty liters of 500 ppm nabr solution were injected through a 3 m neutron probe borehole at the bs hillslope location which was determined by soil moisture studies to be the most effective location for recharge see section 3 2 samples were periodically taken following injection from the dpw ss 4 in and vfw locations and at surface water locations from the stream just north of dpw and another slightly to the south of vfw fig 1 the wells were sampled using dedicated bailers and string for each well surface water was sampled by taking grab samples from water sources bromide was initially sampled twice a week then once a week from november 26 to december 22 2014 and then bi weekly from january 5 to february 25 2015 after february 25 2015 monthly sampling continued until july 2015 three or more slug tests were performed on the dpw and ss2 wells water levels were measured using a solinst m10 levelogger transducer with a 1 second measurement interval and manual measurements with electric water level tape five to 10 gallons of water were used to displace the static water level depending on the well bore volume the data were analyzed using the bouwer and rice method bouwer and rice 1976 2 2 laboratory methods grain size analysis was performed on samples from neutron probe and monitoring well boreholes using a modified soil analysis method gee and bauder 1986 the grain size data were used to estimate hydraulic conductivity using the method of shepherd 1989 within a day of collection raw samples were filtered and analyzed in duplicate for total alkalinity using a hach digital titration system within a day of sample acquisition major and minor anions f cl no2 br no3 po4 3 and so4 2 were analyzed from lab filtered subsamples using a dionex dx 120 ion chromatography ic unit the br tracer samples were filtered and run on the ic in a similar manner six major and minor cations na ca2 k mg2 mn2 and fe2 were analyzed from the filtered acidified samples using a varian fs220 flame atomic absorption aa unit the precision of f cl so4 2 and all cations is 10 or less using an internal lab standard the accuracy of the anion analyses had a larger range within 0 1 27 of published values for the dionex seven anion standard the average charge balance error for all samples was 3 1 with a range of 41 7 39 6 the large departures from zero can be attributed to many variables most rain samples contained insect residue and a few contained bird feces the installation of a screen over the gauge and barb deterrents helped the issue but never eliminated it though the precipitation samples were filtered the dissolved constituents from these contaminants were not eliminated the stream waters also contained decaying organic matter such as leaf litter or insects tritium activity was determined using the helium in growth method clarke et al 1976 bayer et al 1989 the practical detection limit for the helium in growth method is 0 05 tu solomon and cook 2000 under typical conditions the laboratory error for tritium analysis ranges from approximately 10 at 1 tu to 70 at the detection limit schlosser et al 1988 sulfur hexafluoride was analyzed by gc ecd techniques to a precision of 1 3 at concentrations in excess of 1 0 fg l to a maximum reporting level of 3 0 pg l wanninkhof and ledwell 1991 law et al 1994 this precision and detection limit permit groundwater dating applications from about 1970 to the present busenberg and plummer 2000 the precision of groundwater age calculated from sf6 data depends on the analytical errors generally 5 error in the estimated recharge temperature 2 c 1 3 years age difference and error due to residence time in the unsaturated zone as much as 8 12 years for unsaturated zone thickness of 30 m busenberg and plummer

model emm 2 3 data analysis a water balance estimate for the upper part of the pwc watershed was calculated from march 1 2014 to february 28 2015 using eq 1 data from the pinecrest weather station and nearby weather stations and discharge data from the flume weather station data were not available from 10 15 15 10 29 15 and 12 23 14 1 7 15 data from these time periods were obtained from two different sources daily averages for precipitation and temperature were recorded from a national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2015 land based weather station at ames plantation approximately 8 4 km northeast of pinecrest humidity wind speed and barometric pressure were obtained from a personal weather station in rossville tennessee approximately 26 km west of pinecrest daily et data were calculated from the pinecrest weather station data except for solar radiation solar radiation data were averaged from measurements at two nearby weather stations winborn mississippi 48 km south and chickasaw state park tennessee 53 km northeast wu 2015 these data were combined with the pinecrest weather station data and applied to the penman monteith equation allen et al 2005 zotarelli et al 2009 to calculate daily et the saturated zone cmb recharge was calculated using eq 2 with the mean chloride concentration of precipitation saturated zone water and runoff at the flume location as well as the measured precipitation and discharge in the upper pwc watershed from the 2014 15 data the vadose zone cmb recharge estimate was calculated using eq 2 with mean chloride concentration in sediments from the vadose zone borehole and estimates of mean annual precipitation and chloride concentration in precipitation loss of chloride from discharge in runoff is not incorporated into the calculation because the vadose zone borehole was drilled on a flat ridgeline where runoff is considered negligible hence precipitation is the sole source of chloride to the system a national atmospheric deposition program nadp station tn14 50 km north of pinecrest has recorded chloride wet fall concentrations since 1984 yielding a mean precipitation weighted annual chloride concentration

iron oxide cemented pebbles pliocene fluvial terrace deposits and 30 6 m of fine to medium grained and fine to very coarse grained sand eocene memphis sand with thin intervals 20 cm of clayey sand followed by 0 4 m of white clay fig 2 the basal contact of the loess is gradational over 0 4 m with the sand and gravel deposits paleosol development is evident in the sand and gravel similar to that observed in surface exposures by brock 2012 the sand in the underlying memphis sand is composed almost entirely of quartz with conspicuous mica being present in several intervals fig 2 similar to petrographic and mineralogical observations lumsden et al 2009 larsen and brock 2014 water content shows a gradual decrease with depth from 16 75 at 2 30 m to 3 13 at 10 0 m fig 3 the relatively higher moisture contents at depths of 12 6 13 1 m 20 1 20 7 m and 30 5 31 0 m correspond to the top of fine grained intervals fig 2 chloride concentration generally increases with depth with prominent high concentrations at 17 0 m 26 5 m and 27 9 m depth peak chloride concentrations do not correspond to variations in water content or to stratigraphic changes 3 2 physical hydrology daily discharge data show flow in pinewood creek only during prolonged or intense rainfall events fig 4 biweekly lysimeter volumes at the 1 5 m depth are greatest during the wet periods of the year but lower during the summer and fall except for the ss location fig 5 a the biweekly tensiometer pressure shows less consistent relationship to seasonal precipitation fig 5b although soil tension increases during the summer and fall at the bs and vf locations average daily groundwater elevation for the ss2 and vfw wells varies by 0 25 and 0 15 m respectively during the year with the highest levels observed during fall and early winter months fig 6 groundwater elevation at the dpw well is highest during the spring early summer and winter when flow is observed in the lower reach of pinewood creek but falls to the level of the ss well during the late summer and fall 3 3 geochemical data precipitation samples obtained during the year vary greatly in ph specific conductance alkalinity and solute composition table 2 appendix a assuming that samples obtained during spring and summer show the greatest impact of insects birds and evaporation the precipitation samples from the late fall and winter months likely provide the best representation of the precipitation composition the ph of precipitation obtained from november 2014 through february 2015 range from 4 61 to 5 64 with ph from spring through early fall 2014 ranging from 3 90 to 6 61 specific conductance from november 2014 to february 2015 ranged from 9 07 13 3 Œºs whereas values from spring 2014 to early fall 2014 range from 4 55 1480 Œºs the lowest specific conductance was observed on may 23 after a week of light rain on may 12 through 19 and the highest specific conductance was observed on july 18 two days after an intense rainfall event samples taken from surface water sources for chemical analysis were obtained when flow was observed in the creeks water was flowing in pwc during only two monitoring events during the 20 14 2015 observation year other samples were taken at east creek and pwc joint locations and the swimming pool during the deep well sampling event in august 2014 fig 1 east creek and pwc joint are similar in their major ion composition fig 7 one of the samples obtained at the upstream pwc sampling location 2 25 15 is similar to but more sodium rich than the east creek and pwc joint samples in contrast the upstream pwc from 3 28 14 is more sulfate and chloride rich but otherwise similar to the 2015 upstream pwc sample in regard to the major ion composition the upstream pwc sample from 3 28 14 however was warmer slightly more acidic and had nearly the highest specific conductance 94 Œºs than all surface water samples suggesting that it may have derived from a mixed water source due to the large number of soil water samples taken from the lysimeters for geochemical analysis appendix tables a1 and a2 a representative sample from each meteorological season is plotted in fig 8 to illustrate the variability of soil moisture composition during the year samples from only the 1 5 m depth are shown to reflect water compositions below the influence of root action by plants all of the soil waters are sodium sulfate bicarbonate waters chloride concentrations in soil water are enriched relative to rain water by a factor of 2 4 in contrast sodium sulfate and alkalinity are enriched in soil water relative to rain water by a factor of approximately 10 200 indicating a soil based source for these ions the soil water samples are enriched in sodium and sulfate in comparison to surface water samples suggesting that soil water is not commonly a significant component of surface runoff in the creeks seasonal variations in soil water composition are most prominent in the gfl and bsl samples with sulfate rich water dominant during the spring and bicarbonate rich water dominant during the summer the fall and winter soil water compositions trend back toward sulfate rich compositions suggesting a yearly cycle in soil water composition fig 8 groundwater chemistry data from the august 2014 sampling event are tabulated in table 3 and appendix table a2 and displayed on fig 9 vfw ss2 and the pool well show similar mixed cation hco3 chemical signatures whereas dpw shows a slight increase in so4 2 and decrease in cl relative to the other groundwater samples the dpw water is very similar in composition to surface water samples from east creek and pwc joint although no3 and ca2 are higher in the creek waters 3 4 tracer study 3 4 1 applied tracer during the tracer injection event on november 19 2014 initial samples were taken from all locations that would be periodically sampled for presence of the br tracer fig 1 to ensure no significant br existed previously at these locations bromide tracer was not found at concentrations above background until april 22 2015 in a single sample at the vfw table 4 3 4 2 environmental tracers tritium results for the ss2 and vfw were 5 53 tritium units tu and 2 56 tu respectively sulfur hexafluoride results were 0 64 parts per trillion per volume pptv for ss2 and 2 31 pptv for vfw lumped parameter modeling of the data show the best fit with a piston flow model pfm fig 10 3 5 water balance precipitation et and discharge data were averaged over the watershed area 1 189 105 m2 to determine the water balance for the year total precipitation was 1433 mm and total et 920 mm the measured discharge was 505 mm for the year applying these data to water balance eq 1 and assuming no change in capillary rise or soil moisture the recharge is 7 5 mm for the observation year assuming 5 error the water balance ranges from water balance excess to deficit indicating the sensitivity of the recharge estimate to errors in the comparatively larger magnitudes of precipitation and et under most conditions with increased discharge or et relative to a decrease in precipitation the water balance yields a deficit 3 6 chloride mass balance the vadose zone cmb was used to estimate multi year recharge at an upland hill top location the mean vadose zone chloride concentration evaluated from 1 5 m base of the root zone to 34 0 m fig 3 is 14 21 mg l with a standard deviation of 8 58 mg l using the mean regional precipitation rate of 137 cm yr the estimated recharge rate was 16 4 mm yr with a one standard deviation range of 10 2 41 3 mm yr given that the water table was not reached during drilling and that low permeability layers might limit redirect vertical flow through the vadose zone the rate obtained must be considered as potential recharge rushton 1988 de vries and simmers 2002 and not as actual recharge the saturated zone cmb was used to estimate recharge from the 2014 15 observations at the pinecrest site chloride analytical data are compromised in some cases by insect and bird residue thus only data with calculated electrical balance of less than 20 are used to calculate the mean concentration in precipitation this results in mean chloride concentration in rainfall of 0 36 mg l and discharge of 1 0 mg l using the measured precipitation and discharge data with the selected chloride concentrations for precipitation and runoff and the chloride concentrations in the ss2 and pool wells appendix table a2 recharge varies from 4 8 6 2 mm yr propagation of 5 errors in measured precipitation discharge and chemical analysis yield a wide variety of values ranging from water balance excess to deficit 3 7 hydraulic conductivity the arithmetic mean of 8 slug tests at the ss2 and dpw locations yields a hydraulic conductivity for the memphis aquifer of 3 7 m d appendix b the arithmetic mean of hydraulic conductivity for the memphis aquifer from grain size analysis of 5 boring samples bs gf and dpw and 12 push core samples vfw and ss2 is 4 0 m d appendix b 4 discussion 4 1 physical hydrology the measured climatological data for the 2014 2015 observation period indicate conditions similar to regional values with the exception of higher calculated et the annual precipitation for the site was 143 2 cm 5 higher than the regional mean of 137 cm yr the maximum temperature for the year was 28 c the minimum was 8 c and the mean was 14 6 c the normal yearly average from a nearby weather station is 14 7 c noaa 2015 the total et was 920 mm yr somewhat higher than regional estimates of 710 800 mm yr sanford and selnick 2012 recent estimates of et in urban watersheds in jackson tennessee 82 km north of pinecrest range from 703 mm yr simco 2018 to 834 mm yr smith 2019 discharge in pwc at the flume location is ephemeral with flow only occurring during or after major precipitation events fig 4 during periods of the year in which long duration one or more days weather front precipitation events are common the stream flows more often likely fed by overland flow due to limited infiltration into saturated soil an additional limitation to infiltration may occur during fall and winter when leaf litter covers the majority of the forest floor during the drier months discharge response to precipitation is more muted or non existent along the downstream reaches of pwc slightly upstream and downstream of the confluence with east creek fig 1 flow is more continuous except during the late summer and early fall as indicated by the decrease in water level at the dpw during this time seasonal seepage occurs along the lower reaches of pwc at the interface of sand and clay beds in the memphis sand and likely contributes to more continuous flow in the lower reaches of pwc soil water data provided by the lysimeters and tensiometers show strong seasonal trends in moisture content but are also influenced by soil texture lysimeter data show seasonal soil water storage in silt rich soils such as those at the ss and vfw locations with lysimeters yielding more water during the wetter months and lesser volumes in the drier months fig 5 the water volumes at the bs location are generally lower in all seasons compared to other locations reflecting percolation through sandy surface soils the tensiometer data show similar variations to those of the lysimeter volumes but have more dependence on soil type because the bs location continually yielded little water in lysimeters and shows high soil tension infiltration is interpreted to occur at a higher rate along the hillslope locations where sandier textures exist the gf location shows low lysimeter volumes similar to the bs location but the tensiometer data show low soil tension the tensiometer data for the gf location appear to be compromised by instrument malfunction the climatological and surface hydrology data at the pinecrest site indicate that the observation year had weather conditions typical for the region higher precipitation and lower et during the early winter through late spring create excess soil moisture available for drainage through soil flowers 1964 to recharge groundwater storage retention of soil moisture in silt rich soils observed on the upland surface ss location and alluvium in the valley floor vf location retard infiltration through the soil zone resulting in overland flow and surface runoff during long duration precipitation events infiltration is more rapid in sandy soils locations bs and gf and where memphis sand and sandy alluvium crop out at the surface location dpw 4 2 vertical recharge and recharge pathways the vertical recharge rate below the soil zone in the upper part of the pwc watershed were determined using water balance the cmb methods and environmental tracers the vadose zone cmb method provides a long term estimate for recharge of 16 4 mm yr if one assumed runoff impacts water balance data from 2014 to 2015 suggests that approximately 35 of the precipitation becomes runoff if 35 of precipitation and associated chloride are removed from the total precipitation in the vadose zone cmb calculation the long term recharge rate is 11 mm yr this recharge rate is of similar magnitude to the range of recharge rates of 4 8 6 2 mm yr obtained for the 2014 2015 saturate zone cmb recharge rate as well as the 7 7 mm yr rate obtained from water balance in theory and in practice the unsaturated and saturated zone cmb methods do not typically provide similar values for recharge johnston 1987a b scanlon et al 2002 the saturated zone cmb method applies to larger spatial domains in part due to lateral flow of groundwater wood and sanford 1995 ideally the chloride concentration from the vadose zone chloride profile should have little variation with depth wood 1999 however notable spikes in chloride concentration are observed at 17 27 and 28 m depth the central united states is known to have experienced protracted periodic drought during the 1850 60 s 1910s 1930s and 1950 60 s burnette and stahle 2013 which may have affected the short term chloride concentration resulting in lower recharge rates the pathway of recharge to the memphis aquifer in the upland valley was evaluated assuming rapid vertical migration of the column of br solution during the applied tracer test at location bs and assessing the travel time to vfw specific discharge was calculated using the mean gradient from ss2 to vfw and the range of hydraulic conductivity of 3 7 4 0 m d resulting in 0 66 to 0 72 m d applying an effective porosity of 0 3 gentry et al 2006 and 160 m between the bs and vfw locations results in arrival times of 67 72 days with no longitudinal dispersion the actual arrival time was at least 155 days suggesting some vertical impedance during infiltration or lower hydraulic conductivity the results were further complicated by pumping from the pool well in april 2015 which may have hastened the migration of the br plume past the screened interval of the vfw although the br tracer results do not provide recharge rate information they do confirm that a vertical recharge pathway exists from the sandy soils along the hillslopes to the water table of the memphis aquifer alkalinity and nitrate concentrations at the bs location were consistently elevated above those observed at other locations providing an additional tracer for vertical infiltration at the bs location a septic system and leach field are located underneath the hillslope at less than a meter depth approximately 30 m uphill from the bs location runoff from septic leach fields characteristically has high nitrate and alkalinity concentrations seiler 1999 resulting in elevated nitrate and alkalinity in soils located down gradient of the leach field along the hillslope a binary mixing model was applied to assess the percent of nitrate rich water infiltrated at the bs location that reaches the water table vfw is down gradient from the bs location and consistently has the lowest observed level for the water table in the study area the dpw and pool well are used as potential end member water compositions representing normal groundwater nitrate levels ss2 is not viable as its nitrate concentration is greater than that of vfw suggesting some of the infiltrating leachate waters percolated to the ss2 well the results of the mixing model indicate 1 9 of total recharge is occurring by vertical infiltration at the bs location likely following the pathway identified with the br tracer and reaching the vfw the remaining percentage 91 99 of recharge must come from another source either lateral flow other hillslopes adjacent to vfw or unknown sources 4 3 lateral recharge groundwater elevtion water chemistry and environmental tracer data provide evidence for significant lateral recharge to the memphis aquifer at the pinecrest site the upland monitoring wells ss2 and vfw show rise and fall in groundwater elevation opposite those of seasonal wetness and dryness suggesting lag in response or additional water sources in contrast the groundwater elevation in the dpw was highly influenced by seasonal precipitation and stream flow with higher sustained water levels during wetter times of the year for the majority of the year dpw maintained the highest groundwater elevation of the three wells during the dryer months it dropped to levels similar to those observed in ss2 however water levels never dropped below those observed in the vfw these observations indicate a persistent lateral gradient from dpw to vfw and from dpw toward the wolf river where surface flow discharges from the watershed fig 11 lateral groundwater flow under unconfined conditions was calculated using darcy s law and the range of hydraulic conductivity of 3 7 4 0 m d groundwater levels were averaged during the months that water levels at dpw were substantially higher than vfw march august 2014 and december 2014 february 2015 average specific discharge for these periods was 1 4 1 5 m d for dpw to vfw and 0 66 to 0 72 m d for ss2 to vfw the estimated travel time for water to move from dpw to vfw is 110 119 days and from ss2 to vfw is 112 121 days these travel time estimates are consistent with a rise in vfw groundwater level approximately 3 4 months after peak groundwater level in dpw however the data do not explain why ss2 shows similar trend to vfw sources outside the monitored area could be contributing lateral recharge to ss2 such as another surface water source or adjacent watershed the time frame and monitored area of the present study are insufficient to assess the recharge source for the ss2 well the chemistry of the groundwater is distinctly different than that of precipitation and soil water but similar to that of surface water precipitation is dilute and acidic as is typical for the southeastern part of north america lajtha and jones 2013 with mixed cation hco3 so4 composition in contrast soil water from the lysimeters is ph neutral moderate specific conductance 100 to 1400 Œºs and na hco3 so4 composition the seasonal shift in soil water composition is likely related to an increased proportion of sulfate in winter and spring precipitation followed by a proportional increase in bicarbonate during evaporation and soil water deficit during summer and fall the groundwater is slightly acidic low specific conductance 30 140 Œºs and mixed cation hco3 composition although groundwater was sampled only once during the year substantial changes in groundwater chemistry are unlikely over the period of a year absent strong gradients in groundwater chemistry or hydraulic head surface water chemistry had similar ph and specific conductance to groundwater but ranged from mixed cation hco3 to mixed cation hco3 so4 composition the strong similarity of surface water composition to groundwater suggests that infiltrated stream water is a significant component of the groundwater whereas infiltrated soil water from the upland soils does not contribute substantially to groundwater surface water is mainly immediate runoff from precipitation events that has not interacted extensively with soil minerals surface water from late winter or early spring may have more interaction with soils as indicated by the sulfate rich composition of pwc water from 3 28 14 likely due to protracted soil water saturation and runoff chemical reaction of acidic dilute precipitation with soil minerals should result in ph neutral water of mixed composition rather than the observed na so4 composition of soil water suggesting reaction with a sodium and sulfate bearing soil phase the most likely source for concentration of these elements in the soil is deposition of aerosols and particulates from atmospheric plumes emanating from a coal fired power plant and oil refinery in memphis 75 km west of pinecrest that have been operational since the 1940s and 1950s sulfate either as adsorbed so2 on particulate matter or in mineral form in fine ash is a well established reactive by product of coal combustion smith and gruber 1966 kang et al 2011 and atmospheric concentrations are correlated with fossil fuel energy use lajtha and jones 2013 sodium is preferentially released relative to other alkaline earth and alkaline metals during the combustion of coal li et al 2015 and may also be a significant mineral component of ash smith and gruber 1966 given the oxidizing conditions in groundwater sulfate reduction is not viable as a removal process furthermore a mechanism does not exist to exchange the sodium in the soil water for the mixed cation composition observed in groundwater thus the soil water is unlikely to be a significant source of recharge water for groundwater this conclusion is also consistent with the slow vertical recharge rates through the upland soils based on the vadose zone chloride profile and nitrate mixing model calculations modeling of the sf6 and 3h tracer concentrations suggests lateral groundwater flow of modern water by piston flow rather than percolation through a thick vadose zone fig 10 shows that the data for vfw and ss2 fit a pfm which is consistent with short recharge pathways and minimal dispersion vertical infiltration through the thick vadose zone would result in substantial hydrodynamic dispersion during percolation and lack of coherent behavior of sf6 a gas and 3h a component of the water molecule during equilibration with soil gases solomon and cook 1995 studies of infiltrated environmental tracers through thick vadose zones commonly show binary mixing relationships with shallow groundwater of other sources santoni et al 2016 consistent with observed water chemistry and hydrologic calculations above the yearly recharge of surface water to groundwater in exposed memphis sand near dpw drives lateral groundwater flow which allows 3h and sf6 to migrate seasonally with minimal lateral mixing consistent with piston flow behavior 4 4 significance for recharge processes the results of the present study indicate a strong lithological control on recharge rates and pathways to the underlying unconfined memphis aquifer vadose and saturated zone cmb and water balance estimates for recharge rates through the upland surfaces and alluvial valleys at pinecrest are less than 16 mm yr yearly variation in groundwater elevation at vfw and ss2 are 100 200 mm yr which assuming a 30 porosity of the memphis sand requires a recharge of at least 70 140 mm yr water chemistry and tracer data provide strong evidence that the main source of recharge is infiltrated surface water given that precipitation vegetation and land use in the areas of exposed memphis sand and the upland areas are not grossly different the main difference in the recharge rate is argued to be due to lithology and the presence of preferential recharge pathways through transmissive sediments the loess fluvial terrace deposits and upper 2 3 m memphis sand each have varying degrees of soil development mainly in the form of accumulated clays in the b horizons larsen and brock 2014 accumulated clay and soil formation are minimal in the exposed memphis sand and sandy surface soils formed therein given that loess and underlying paleosols mantle most landscape surfaces throughout western tennessee and other states in the mississippi embayment recharge is likely to be focused where fluvial incision has removed the loess and paleosols exposing underlying sandy formations primarily along modern alluvial valleys similar lithological control on recharge is observed in other regions mantled by loess or other fine grained deposits studies of recharge through loess in northern china show similar behavior to that of the western tennessee area but differences as well several studies have noted anomalously high tritium or agricultural chemicals and low chloride in groundwater underlying loess regions and have argued for focused recharge in deep gullies or alluvial valleys lin and wei 2006 gates et al 2011 however other studies have shown groundwater underlying loess regions being dominated by pre modern water with slow infiltration through the loess being the dominant recharge mechanism e g huang et al 2017 a critical aspect of rapid recharge in thick loess regions such as that in china may be the availability of focused recharge pathways in topographic depressions and deep gullies gates et al 2011 similar observations have been made in regions mantled by glacial till where recharge is focused in the alluvial valleys incised through the till gates et al 2014 studies is coastal plain deposits of western australia show similar sensitivity to the permeability of surface soils johnston 1987a b dawes et al 2012 recharge rates in western tennessee vary in relation to the proportion of loess and fine grained surface soils suggesting that recharge has greater sensitivity to land use and climate changes early research in the memphis aquifer of western tennessee considered diffuse percolation through the loess to be the dominant source of recharge parks and carmichael 1990 modeling of groundwater flow in the memphis area by brahana and broshears 2001 showed that 42 of the hydrologic budget of the memphis aquifer is recharge in the outcrop belt with almost all other water coming from vertical leakage through a shallow aquifer primarily in alluvial valleys numerically derived recharge rates in modeling studies within the region range from 3 to 36 mm yr arthur and taylor 1998 brahana and broshears 2001 mckee and clark 2003 however these values are determined by model fit and not measured the present study shows that less than 16 mm yr of recharge is likely in loess covered regions which is less than that typically observed in eastern north america median of 43 59 mm yr using similar methods nolan et al 2007 studies in western tennessee where incision has largely removed loess and paleosol bearing deposits from alluvial valleys yield recharge rates based on water balance of about 300 900 mm yr simco 2018 smith 2019 with only minor recharge attributed to the loess mantled upland surfaces similarly recharge rates based on q60 and q65 percent duration flow relationships to estimate mean annual base flow in areas within the region with sand aquifers and little or no loess cover range from 127 to 229 mm yr stricker 1983 bailey 1993 geologic mapping of two quadrangles in the memphis sand outcrop belt indicated that less than 7 of the mapped area is underlain by sandy soils with about 20 of the mapped area as alluvium brock 2012 these results indicate that recharge to the memphis aquifer is highly focused in as little as 7 of the outcrop belt although leakage contributions through sandy alluvium may occur over a somewhat greater area land use changes can both increase and decrease potential for recharge depending on the type of surface modification that is made future development in the loess covered regions of western tennessee needs to closely consider how land surface changes may affect recharge to the regional aquifers to ensure sustainability of groundwater resources 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate that recharge is largely controlled by lithology of surface soils and outcrop of the underlying memphis sand with recharge focused along modern alluvial valleys and other areas where the memphis sand is exposed using the vadose zone and saturated zone cmb methods and water balance yields annual recharge rates from 4 2 16 mm yr indicating that recharge through loess and underlying paleosols on upland surfaces is not sufficient to account for the observed annual water table fluctuations of 100 200 mm yr rather hydrochemistry environmental tracer concentrations and groundwater flow indicate that recharge is dominated by stream seepage in sandy stream beds on subcropping memphis sand and lateral recharge beneath upland surfaces with as little as 7 exposure of the memphis sand in the unconfined region of the aquifer and another 13 of the area as alluvial valleys recharge to the memphis aquifer is limited to preferential paths of recharge in the landscape as such the sustainability of the aquifer which is currently providing as much as 210 million gallons per day maupin et al 2014 for memphis tennessee and surrounding areas may be highly sensitive to alteration of land use that affects the access to preferential pathways of recharge evidence for groundwater recharge through preferential pathways is known from other regions with loess or other fine grained soils at the land surface indicating this phenomenon may be of broader importance than currently appreciated in regard to the

8367,study region western tennessee u s a study focus recharge to aquifers that underlie loess and other fine grained surficial deposits in western tennessee as well as other areas is commonly impeded resulting in sensitivity in regard to sustainability of groundwater resources this study investigates the role of preferential pathways of recharge to the regional memphis aquifer in an area mantled by loess and fine grained paleosols new hydrological insights data gathered through a vadose zone chloride mass balance analysis and a year of monitoring physical hydrologic water chemistry and environmental and applied tracer data within an upland watershed in western tennessee indicate that recharge to the memphis aquifer is dominated by lateral recharge of infiltrated stream water sources rather than vertical infiltration through loess covered uplands the results from this research challenge prevailing models of recharge to the memphis aquifer and aquifers mantled by loess or other fine grained soils in other regions that envision vertical recharge through fine grained soils to be the dominant recharge mechanism keywords groundwater loess aquifer vertical infiltration lateral

central u s brahana and broshears 2001 previous research suggests that much of the recharge to the unconsolidated sand of the memphis aquifer in western tennessee occurs within the exposure belt of the aquifer parks and carmichael 1990 brahana and broshears 2001 however field based assessment of recharge rates and mechanisms are lacking recent mapping studies indicate that recharge to the aquifer could be impeded by quaternary loess and underlying paleosols on upland surfaces in the exposure belt of the memphis aquifer in western tennessee larsen and brock 2014 despite the aquifer s regional importance little is known regarding recharge processes in the unconfined region similar aquifers in unconsolidated sand with overlying loess or other fine grained soils exist throughout the north american midwest and gulf coast regions gates et al 2014 nolan et al 2007 as well as other parts of the world dawes et al 2012 dafny and ≈°im√∫nek 2016 and may have similar processes affecting recharge rates and pathways this present study focuses on evaluating recharge processes in a small watershed in the unconfined region of the memphis aquifer in western tennessee the main objectives are to ascertain rates and pathways of groundwater recharge using meteorological and hydrologic measurements geochemistry and both environmental and applied tracer data these data are used to constrain soil moisture conditions hydrologic balance in the upland watershed and chemical signatures of soil and surface waters as well as groundwater recharge pathways are addressed using an applied tracer bromide br and tritium 3h and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 residence times 1 1 previous work western tennessee is mantled by 0 15 m of middle to upper pleistocene loess overlying 0 30 m of pliocene and pleistocene fluvial terrace deposits and as much as 1000 m of cretaceous and paleogene sand silt clay and coal representing coastal plain and marine deposits moore and brown 1969 russell and parks 1975 the loess includes as many as four distinct units separated by paleosols rodbell et al 1997 grimley et al 2009 pigati et al 2014 the underlying fluvial terrace deposits are comprised primarily of sand and gravel van arsdale et al 2008 but also commonly have paleosol development within fine grained sediments in the upper meter larsen and brock 2014 the fluvial terrace deposits disconformably overlie cretaceous and paleogene sediments comprising alternating sand rich aquifer and silt and clay rich confining units that dip gently to the northwest at 1 moore and brown 1969 brahana and broshears 2001 late pleistocene and holocene alluvium comprised of sand and gravel overlain by sandy silt partially fill modern stream valleys carmichael et al 2018 grimley et al 2009 the memphis aquifer consists of the eocene memphis sand which varies from coarse to fine grained unconsolidated sand with interbedded silt and clay moore and brown 1969 parks and carmichael 1990 lumsden et al 2009 larsen and brock 2014 the memphis aquifer is regionally confined by clay and silt strata in the upper claiborne confining unit in westernmost tennessee but is unconfined to the east of the confined region due to the shallow northwestern dip of me strata and erosional removal of upper claiborne strata russell and parks 1975 parks and carmichael 1990 these conditions result in a 50 km wide belt of unconfined memphis sand to the east of the confined region where the sand is exposed mainly in upland stream valleys but overlain by 3 5 m of pliocene fluvial terrace deposits and pleistocene loess beneath the upland surfaces larsen and brock 2014 the upper few meters of the memphis sand commonly have paleosol development with extensive accumulated clay larsen and brock 2014 parks and carmichael 1990 suggested that groundwater recharge results from infiltration of precipitation in the outcrop region of the memphis sand but little is known regarding the details of the process current information indicates that recharge rates of the memphis aquifer vary spatially across the region bailey 1993 brahana and broshears 2001 and in some places include leakage mechanisms through the overlying upper claiborne confining unit parks 1990 bradley 1991 brahana and broshears 2001 larsen et al 2003 2013 gentry et al 2006 groundwater elevation in the memphis aquifer within the unconfined region in haywood county tennessee well ha h 007 varied between 0 3 and 1 0 m per year between 2003 and 2012 united states geological survey 2015 less than annual variations typically between 2 3 m within the confined memphis aquifer in shelby county during the same time period kingsbury 2018 these data suggest recharge of the memphis aquifer in both unconfined and confined regions with more recharge in shelby county where the pumping stress is focused kingsbury 2018 water balance is commonly used to estimate recharge in humid temperate regions scanlon et al 2002 the soil water

loess and other fine grained surface soils allison and hughes 1983 macfarlane et al 2000 russo et al 2003 nolan et al 2007 gates et al 2011 huang et al 2017 this method requires measurement of the precipitation per unit watershed area the average chloride concentrations of precipitation and dry deposition and the average chloride concentration throughout the vadose zone or the uppermost saturated zone allison and hughes 1978 sharma and hughes 1985 limitations to the cmb method include non steady state chloride mass flux difficulty quantifying runoff sourced chloride and preferential recharge through macropores wood 1999 because runoff may be significant in small 10 km2 upland watersheds in humid regions the cmb equation was modified to include the quantity of chloride in

sf6 busenberg and plummer 2000 with known atmospheric source and residence time histories as well as applied tracers such as dyes and conservative ions such as br an advantage of tracers is that they can track recharge from variation sources and of different residence times cook and b√∂hlke 2000 1 2 site description the pinecrest study area is in the rural uplands of western tennessee fig 1 approximately 80 km east of memphis with almost 25 percent of western tennessee acting as a recharge zone to the memphis aquifer parks and carmichael 1990 the pinecrest research site was chosen because of its central location in the exposure belt of the aquifer the land use at the site is predominantly deciduous forest with cultivated grass fields on the upland surfaces the memphis area receives an average annual rainfall of 137 cm national weather service 2019 although surrounded by agriculture land use the pinecrest site has not been farmed for approximately 40 years and no use of chlorinated pesticides is known the surface soils in the area include a variety of silt loam alfisols and inceptisols on upland surfaces and silty sand inceptisols and entisols along the valley margins and valley floor flowers 1964 the underlying geologic units on the uplands include 1 3 meters of loess 1 2 meters of pliocene fluvial terrace deposits with paleosol development and the memphis sand with paleosol development in the upper 1 3 meters larsen and brock 2014 quaternary alluvium locally fills upland valleys and transitions down gradient into alluvial fan deposits that extend into the floodplain of perennial streams fig 1 pinewood creek pwc is a small stream that flows through the study area it is ephemeral in the upper reaches near the instrumented hillslope fig 1 and intermittent in the lower reach near dpw fig 1 the shoulder of the upland hillslope lies at approximately 162 m above sea level asl whereas the pwc watershed terminus is about 120 m asl in elevation where it discharges to the wolf river fig 1 sets of lysimeters and soil tensiometers lt clusters installed at 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m were placed at four locations along a hillslope shoulder slope ss back slope bs back slope gully floor gf and valley floor vf fig 1 three wells were installed in the watershed for monitoring groundwater level beneath the upland surface ss 2 in ss2 valley floor vfw and down gradient valley floor dpw locations table 1 each well was instrumented with a solinst pressure transducer a fourth monitoring well at the shoulder slope location ss 4 in ss4 is screened along its entire length but was not utilized in the study a davis wireless vantage vue weather station installed at the hill top recorded temperature atmospheric pressure wind speed and direction and precipitation a parshall flume with a pressure transducer was installed in pwc adjacent to the instrumented hillslope fig 1 to calculate stream discharge in the ephemeral reach e g kilpatrick and schneider 1983 the transducers and weather station were synchronized and recorded measurements at 15 minute intervals 2 methods initial investigation of recharge on the upland surfaces involved drilling a vadose zone borehole by hollow stem auger in a grass field at the weather station in fig 1 to a total depth of 44 m at which point drilling was terminated in a dense white clay core obtained from the borehole was used to determine site stratigraphy and measure vadose zone water content and chloride concentrations for application of vadose zone cmb method to estimate vertical recharge allison and hughes 1978 1983 sharma and hughes 1985 deng et al 2015 huang et al 2017 to evaluate recharge processes in the watershed water balance parameter measurements eq 1 were conducted in the study area from march 2014 to february 2015 soil moisture groundwater level and groundwater geochemistry were monitored for a year three monitoring wells a production well pool well table 1 swimming pool water and the stream water at the site were sampled for geochemistry in august 2014 along with 3h and sf6 in two of the monitoring wells tritium and sf6 are useful tracers for determining subsurface residence time of waters as much as 60 years old e g wilson and mackay 1993 cook and b√∂hlke 2000 a nabr applied tracer study was also completed along the hill slope to assess the short term recharge rate and pathway of groundwater movement 2 1 field methods the vadose zone borehole was drilled dry with a 10 cm inner diameter hollow stem auger assembly the individual drilling tubes were 152 cm long and fitted with two 76 cm long polycarbonate sleeves to eliminate moisture loss from the sampled sediment sample handling and analysis are described in larsen and waldron 2020 accompanying methodx paper water balance and hydrochemical data collection were made on a bi weekly schedule from march 2014 to february 2015 bursi 2015 bi weekly field tasks included measuring water volume in lysimeters and pressure in tensiometers downloading data from the weather station and inspecting the flume to ensure proper function and flow through the device monthly tasks include measuring groundwater levels sampling lysimeter and stream water for geochemical analyses and downloading transducer data the flume transducer data were compensated with the barometric pressure data from the weather station for each discharge event a baseline was defined based on the transducer pressure prior to the event this baseline was then applied throughout the discharge event any measured pressure that surpassed this baseline was evidence of discharge data gaps occurred from july 3 17 2014 precipitation events during this time were compared to similar events based on precipitation quantity and intensity discharge was then estimated for that period based on a linear stream response to similar events the tensiometers were checked to ensure they had not run dry which produces a false zero measurement if the tensiometer still had water during a site visit the measurement was recorded in centibars cb and then refilled with deionized water tensiometer gauges were removed in late november 2014 to avoid freezing lysimeter water was purged into 2 l amber bottles with a transfer cap using a vacuum hand pump tubing and bottles were triple rinsed with deionized water after every use monthly static groundwater level measurements were made using a solinst water level meter measured groundwater elevations and barometric pressure from the weather station were used to correct transducer data obtained from wells abrupt rise or fall in the pressure transducer data resulted from inconsistent pressure transducer position in the well and error with the barometric compensation field geochemical measurements include ph temperature dissolved oxygen and specific conductance raw and filtered acidified water samples were obtained at the sampling sites if sufficient water existed after the field parameters were taken filtered and acidified samples were obtained after passing through a 0 45 Œºm microcellulose filter and preserved with concentrated nitric acid hno3 to achieve a 1 nitric acid solution all water samples were stored on ice in a cooler and returned to the water lab at the university of memphis for analysis of alkalinity and major dissolved cations and anions in august 2014 the monitoring wells and pwc at locations near the dpw were sampled for field geochemical measurements and laboratory analysis grab samples of surface swimming pool and subsurface water were obtained and analyzed using the same procedures as described above for the lysimeter waters except that total alkalinity was performed in the field instead of the lab water from the pool well was obtained from a spigot adjacent to the well water from the dpw was obtained by bailing three borehole volumes from the well water samples from the deep wells ss2 and vfw were obtained by low flow pumping from depth using a submersible turbine pump and monitored using a ysi 6600 multi parameter probe to assess stabilization of the field geochemical measurements once the field geochemical measurements stabilized final field geochemical measurements were recorded and samples were taken and stored in the same manner as those from grab samples field geochemical measurements were also collected from the dpw and pool well and samples returned to the lab for analysis duplicate samples field blanks and equipment blanks were obtained to assess the quality and reproducibility of chemical data groundwater samples for 3h and sf6 from the ss2 and vfw wells were collected in one liter air tight amber bottles the sample bottles were primed with continuous flow for five minutes and then filled and sealed with electrical tape over the cap to prevent air from entering the sample samples for 3h and sf6 were analyzed at the university of utah dissolved and noble gas laboratory a tracer injection was performed to assess rate and pathway of infiltration from the hillslope lt cluster bs fig 1 to the water table on november 11 2014 sixty liters of 500 ppm nabr solution were injected through a 3 m neutron probe borehole at the bs hillslope location which was determined by soil moisture studies to be the most effective location for recharge see section 3 2 samples were periodically taken following injection from the dpw ss 4 in and vfw locations and at surface water locations from the stream just north of dpw and another slightly to the south of vfw fig 1 the wells were sampled using dedicated bailers and string for each well surface water was sampled by taking grab samples from water sources bromide was initially sampled twice a week then once a week from november 26 to december 22 2014 and then bi weekly from january 5 to february 25 2015 after february 25 2015 monthly sampling continued until july 2015 three or more slug tests were performed on the dpw and ss2 wells water levels were measured using a solinst m10 levelogger transducer with a 1 second measurement interval and manual measurements with electric water level tape five to 10 gallons of water were used to displace the static water level depending on the well bore volume the data were analyzed using the bouwer and rice method bouwer and rice 1976 2 2 laboratory methods grain size analysis was performed on samples from neutron probe and monitoring well boreholes using a modified soil analysis method gee and bauder 1986 the grain size data were used to estimate hydraulic conductivity using the method of shepherd 1989 within a day of collection raw samples were filtered and analyzed in duplicate for total alkalinity using a hach digital titration system within a day of sample acquisition major and minor anions f cl no2 br no3 po4 3 and so4 2 were analyzed from lab filtered subsamples using a dionex dx 120 ion chromatography ic unit the br tracer samples were filtered and run on the ic in a similar manner six major and minor cations na ca2 k mg2 mn2 and fe2 were analyzed from the filtered acidified samples using a varian fs220 flame atomic absorption aa unit the precision of f cl so4 2 and all cations is 10 or less using an internal lab standard the accuracy of the anion analyses had a larger range within 0 1 27 of published values for the dionex seven anion standard the average charge balance error for all samples was 3 1 with a range of 41 7 39 6 the large departures from zero can be attributed to many variables most rain samples contained insect residue and a few contained bird feces the installation of a screen over the gauge and barb deterrents helped the issue but never eliminated it though the precipitation samples were filtered the dissolved constituents from these contaminants were not eliminated the stream waters also contained decaying organic matter such as leaf litter or insects tritium activity was determined using the helium in growth method clarke et al 1976 bayer et al 1989 the practical detection limit for the helium in growth method is 0 05 tu solomon and cook 2000 under typical conditions the laboratory error for tritium analysis ranges from approximately 10 at 1 tu to 70 at the detection limit schlosser et al 1988 sulfur hexafluoride was analyzed by gc ecd techniques to a precision of 1 3 at concentrations in excess of 1 0 fg l to a maximum reporting level of 3 0 pg l wanninkhof and ledwell 1991 law et al 1994 this precision and detection limit permit groundwater dating applications from about 1970 to the present busenberg and plummer 2000 the precision of groundwater age calculated from sf6 data depends on the analytical errors generally 5 error in the estimated recharge temperature 2 c 1 3 years age difference and error due to residence time in the unsaturated zone as much as 8 12 years for unsaturated zone thickness of 30 m busenberg and plummer 2000 the tritium and sf6 data were modeled using usgs tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 to examine the primary flow regime piston flow model pfm exponential piston flow model epm and exponential mixing model emm 2 3 data analysis a water balance estimate for the upper part of the pwc watershed was calculated from march 1 2014 to february 28 2015 using eq 1 data from the pinecrest weather station and nearby weather stations and discharge data from the flume weather station data were not available from 10 15 15 10 29 15 and 12 23 14 1 7 15 data from these time periods were obtained from two different sources daily averages for precipitation and temperature were recorded from a national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2015 land based weather station at ames plantation approximately 8 4 km northeast of pinecrest humidity wind speed and barometric pressure were obtained from a personal weather station in rossville tennessee approximately 26 km west of pinecrest daily et data were calculated from the pinecrest weather station data except for solar radiation solar radiation data were averaged from measurements at two nearby weather stations winborn mississippi 48 km south and chickasaw state park tennessee 53 km northeast wu 2015 these data were combined with the pinecrest weather station data and applied to the penman monteith equation allen et al 2005 zotarelli et al 2009 to calculate daily et the saturated zone cmb recharge was calculated using eq 2 with the mean chloride concentration of precipitation saturated zone water and runoff at the flume location as well as the measured precipitation and discharge in the upper pwc watershed from the 2014 15 data the vadose zone cmb recharge estimate was calculated using eq 2 with mean chloride concentration in sediments from the vadose zone borehole and estimates of mean annual precipitation and chloride concentration in precipitation loss of chloride from discharge in runoff is not incorporated into the calculation because the vadose zone borehole was drilled on a flat ridgeline where runoff is considered negligible hence precipitation is the sole source of chloride to the system a national atmospheric deposition program nadp station tn14 50 km north of pinecrest has recorded chloride wet fall concentrations since 1984 yielding a mean precipitation weighted annual chloride concentration

borings at locations bs gf and dpw and push core samples from vfw and ss2 appendix b the hydraulic conductivity was calculated using the sheppard method fetter 2001 applied to 5 boring samples and 12

iron oxide cemented pebbles pliocene fluvial terrace deposits and 30 6 m of fine to medium grained and fine to very coarse grained sand eocene memphis sand with thin intervals 20 cm of clayey sand followed by 0 4 m of white clay fig 2 the basal contact of the loess is gradational over 0 4 m with the sand and gravel deposits paleosol development is evident in the sand and gravel similar to that observed in surface exposures by brock 2012 the sand in the underlying memphis sand is composed almost entirely of quartz with conspicuous mica being present in several intervals fig 2 similar to petrographic and mineralogical observations lumsden et al 2009 larsen and brock 2014 water content shows a gradual decrease with depth from 16 75 at 2 30 m to 3 13 at 10 0 m fig 3 the relatively higher moisture contents at depths of 12 6 13 1 m 20 1 20 7 m and 30 5 31 0 m correspond to the top of fine grained intervals fig 2 chloride concentration generally increases with depth with prominent high concentrations at 17 0 m 26 5 m and 27 9 m depth peak chloride concentrations do not correspond to variations in water content or to stratigraphic changes 3 2 physical hydrology daily discharge data show flow in pinewood creek only during prolonged or intense rainfall events fig 4 biweekly lysimeter volumes at the 1 5 m depth are greatest during the wet periods of the year but lower during the summer and fall except for the ss location fig 5 a the biweekly tensiometer pressure shows less consistent relationship to seasonal precipitation fig 5b although soil tension increases during the summer and fall at the bs and vf locations average daily groundwater elevation for the ss2 and vfw wells varies by 0 25 and 0 15 m respectively during the year with the highest levels observed during fall and early winter months fig 6 groundwater elevation at the dpw well is highest during the spring early summer and winter when flow is observed in the lower reach of pinewood creek but falls to the level of the ss well during the late summer and fall 3 3 geochemical data precipitation samples obtained during the year vary greatly in ph specific conductance alkalinity and solute composition table 2 appendix a assuming that samples obtained during spring and summer show the greatest impact of insects birds and evaporation the precipitation samples from the late fall and winter months likely provide the best representation of the precipitation composition the ph of precipitation obtained from november 2014 through february 2015 range from 4 61 to 5 64 with ph from spring through early fall 2014 ranging from 3 90 to 6 61 specific conductance from november 2014 to february 2015 ranged from 9 07 13 3 Œºs whereas values from spring 2014 to early fall 2014 range from 4 55 1480 Œºs the lowest specific conductance was observed on may 23 after a week of light rain on may 12 through 19 and the highest specific conductance was observed on july 18 two days after an intense rainfall event samples taken from surface water sources for chemical analysis were obtained when flow was observed in the creeks water was flowing in pwc during only two monitoring events during the 20 14 2015 observation year other samples were taken at east creek and pwc joint locations and the swimming pool during the deep well sampling event in august 2014 fig 1 east creek and pwc joint are similar in their major ion composition fig 7 one of the samples obtained at the upstream pwc sampling location 2 25 15 is similar to but more sodium rich than the east creek and pwc joint samples in contrast the upstream pwc from 3 28 14 is more sulfate and chloride rich but otherwise similar to the 2015 upstream pwc sample in regard to the major ion composition the upstream pwc sample from 3 28 14 however was warmer slightly more acidic and had nearly the highest specific conductance 94 Œºs than all surface water samples suggesting that it may have derived from a mixed water source due to the large number of soil water samples taken from the lysimeters for geochemical analysis appendix tables a1 and a2 a representative sample from each meteorological season is plotted in fig 8 to illustrate the variability of soil moisture composition during the year samples from only the 1 5 m depth are shown to reflect water compositions below the influence of root action by plants all of the soil waters are sodium sulfate bicarbonate waters chloride concentrations in soil water are enriched relative to rain water by a factor of 2 4 in contrast sodium sulfate and alkalinity are enriched in soil water relative to rain water by a factor of approximately 10 200 indicating a soil based source for these ions the soil water samples are enriched in sodium and sulfate in comparison to surface water samples suggesting that soil water is not commonly a significant component of surface runoff in the creeks seasonal variations in soil water composition are most prominent in the gfl and bsl samples with sulfate rich water dominant during the spring and bicarbonate rich water dominant during the summer the fall and winter soil water compositions trend back toward sulfate rich compositions suggesting a yearly cycle in soil water composition fig 8 groundwater chemistry data from the august 2014 sampling event are tabulated in table 3 and appendix table a2 and displayed on fig 9 vfw ss2 and the pool well show similar mixed cation hco3 chemical signatures whereas dpw shows a slight increase in so4 2 and decrease in cl relative to the other groundwater samples the dpw water is very similar in composition to surface water samples from east creek and pwc joint although no3 and ca2 are higher in the creek waters 3 4 tracer study 3 4 1 applied tracer during the tracer injection event on november 19 2014 initial samples were taken from all locations that would be periodically sampled for presence of the br tracer fig 1 to ensure no significant br existed previously at these locations bromide tracer was not found at concentrations above background until april 22 2015 in a single sample at the vfw table 4 3 4 2 environmental tracers tritium results for the ss2 and vfw were 5 53 tritium units tu and 2 56 tu respectively sulfur hexafluoride results were 0 64 parts per trillion per volume pptv for ss2 and 2 31 pptv for vfw lumped parameter modeling of the data show the best fit with a piston flow model pfm fig 10 3 5 water balance precipitation et and discharge data were averaged over the watershed area 1 189 105 m2 to determine the water balance for the year total precipitation was 1433 mm and total et 920 mm the measured discharge was 505 mm for the year applying these data to water balance eq 1 and assuming no change in capillary rise or soil moisture the recharge is 7 5 mm for the observation year assuming 5 error the water balance ranges from water balance excess to deficit indicating the sensitivity of the recharge estimate to errors in the comparatively larger magnitudes of precipitation and et under most conditions with increased discharge or et relative to a decrease in precipitation the water balance yields a deficit 3 6 chloride mass balance the vadose zone cmb was used to estimate multi year recharge at an upland hill top location the mean vadose zone chloride concentration evaluated from 1 5 m base of the root zone to 34 0 m fig 3 is 14 21 mg l with a standard deviation of 8 58 mg l using the mean regional precipitation rate of 137 cm yr the estimated recharge rate was 16 4 mm yr with a one standard deviation range of 10 2 41 3 mm yr given that the water table was not reached during drilling and that low permeability layers might limit redirect vertical flow through the vadose zone the rate obtained must be considered as potential recharge rushton 1988 de vries and simmers 2002 and not as actual recharge the saturated zone cmb was used to estimate recharge from the 2014 15 observations at the pinecrest site chloride analytical data are compromised in some cases by insect and bird residue thus only data with calculated electrical balance of less than 20 are used to calculate the mean concentration in precipitation this results in mean chloride concentration in rainfall of 0 36 mg l and discharge of 1 0 mg l using the measured precipitation and discharge data with the selected chloride concentrations for precipitation and runoff and the chloride concentrations in the ss2 and pool wells appendix table a2 recharge varies from 4 8 6 2 mm yr propagation of 5 errors in measured precipitation discharge and chemical analysis yield a wide variety of values ranging from water balance excess to deficit 3 7 hydraulic conductivity the arithmetic mean of 8 slug tests at the ss2 and dpw locations yields a hydraulic conductivity for the memphis aquifer of 3 7 m d appendix b the arithmetic mean of hydraulic conductivity for the memphis aquifer from grain size analysis of 5 boring samples bs gf and dpw and 12 push core samples vfw and ss2 is 4 0 m d appendix b 4 discussion 4 1 physical hydrology the measured climatological data for the 2014 2015 observation period indicate conditions similar to regional values with the exception of higher calculated et the annual precipitation for the site was 143 2 cm 5 higher than the regional mean of 137 cm yr the maximum temperature for the year was 28 c the minimum was 8 c and the mean was 14 6 c the normal yearly average from a nearby weather station is 14 7 c noaa 2015 the total et was 920 mm yr somewhat higher than regional estimates of 710 800 mm yr sanford and selnick 2012 recent estimates of et in urban watersheds in jackson tennessee 82 km north of pinecrest range from 703 mm yr simco 2018 to 834 mm yr smith 2019 discharge in pwc at the flume location is ephemeral with flow only occurring during or after major precipitation events fig 4 during periods of the year in which long duration one or more days weather front precipitation events are common the stream flows more often likely fed by overland flow due to limited infiltration into saturated soil an additional limitation to infiltration may occur during fall and winter when leaf litter covers the majority of the forest floor during the drier months discharge response to precipitation is more muted or non existent along the downstream reaches of pwc slightly upstream and downstream of the confluence with east creek fig 1 flow is more continuous except during the late summer and early fall as indicated by the decrease in water level at the dpw during this time seasonal seepage occurs along the lower reaches of pwc at the interface of sand and clay beds in the memphis sand and likely contributes to more continuous flow in the lower reaches of pwc soil water data provided by the lysimeters and tensiometers show strong seasonal trends in moisture content but are also influenced by soil texture lysimeter data show seasonal soil water storage in silt rich soils such as those at the ss and vfw locations with lysimeters yielding more water during the wetter months and lesser volumes in the drier months fig 5 the water volumes at the bs location are generally lower in all seasons compared to other locations reflecting percolation through sandy surface soils the tensiometer data show similar variations to those of the lysimeter volumes but have more dependence on soil type because the bs location continually yielded little water in lysimeters and shows high soil tension infiltration is interpreted to occur at a higher rate along the hillslope locations where sandier textures exist the gf location shows low lysimeter volumes similar to the bs location but the tensiometer data show low soil tension the tensiometer data for the gf location appear to be compromised by instrument malfunction the climatological and surface hydrology data at the pinecrest site indicate that the observation year had weather conditions typical for the region higher precipitation and lower et during the early winter through late spring create excess soil moisture available for drainage through soil flowers 1964 to recharge groundwater storage retention of soil moisture in silt rich soils observed on the upland surface ss location and alluvium in the valley floor vf location retard infiltration through the soil zone resulting in overland flow and surface runoff during long duration precipitation events infiltration is more rapid in sandy soils locations bs and gf and where memphis sand and sandy alluvium crop out

cmb methods and environmental tracers the vadose zone cmb method provides a long term estimate for recharge of 16 4 mm yr if one assumed runoff impacts water balance data from 2014 to 2015 suggests that approximately 35 of the precipitation becomes runoff if 35 of precipitation and associated chloride are removed from the total precipitation in the vadose zone cmb calculation the long term recharge rate is 11 mm yr this recharge rate is of similar magnitude to the range of recharge rates of 4 8 6 2 mm yr obtained for the 2014 2015 saturate zone cmb recharge rate as well as the 7 7 mm yr rate obtained from water balance in theory and in practice the unsaturated and saturated zone cmb methods do not typically provide similar values for recharge johnston 1987a b scanlon et al 2002 the saturated zone cmb method applies to larger spatial domains in part due to lateral flow of groundwater wood and sanford 1995 ideally the chloride concentration from the vadose zone chloride profile should have little variation with depth wood 1999 however notable spikes in chloride concentration are observed at 17 27 and 28 m depth the central united states is known to have experienced protracted periodic drought during the 1850 60 s 1910s 1930s and 1950 60 s burnette and stahle 2013 which may have affected the short term chloride concentration resulting in lower recharge rates the pathway of recharge to the memphis aquifer in the upland valley was evaluated assuming rapid vertical migration of the column of br solution during the applied tracer test at location bs and assessing the travel time to vfw specific discharge was calculated using the mean gradient from ss2 to vfw and the range of hydraulic conductivity of 3 7 4 0 m d resulting in 0 66 to 0 72 m d applying an effective porosity of 0 3 gentry et al 2006 and 160 m between the bs and vfw locations results in arrival times of 67 72 days with no longitudinal dispersion the actual arrival time was at least 155 days suggesting some vertical impedance during infiltration or lower hydraulic conductivity the results were further complicated by pumping from the pool well in april 2015 which may have hastened the migration of the br plume past the screened interval of the vfw although the br tracer results do not provide recharge rate information they do confirm that a vertical recharge pathway exists from the sandy soils along the hillslopes to the water table of the memphis aquifer alkalinity and nitrate concentrations at the bs location were consistently elevated above those observed at other locations providing an additional tracer for vertical infiltration at the bs location a septic system and leach field are located underneath the hillslope at less than a meter depth approximately 30 m uphill from the bs location runoff from septic leach fields characteristically has high nitrate and alkalinity concentrations seiler 1999 resulting in elevated nitrate and alkalinity in soils located down gradient of the leach field along the hillslope a binary mixing model was applied to assess the percent of nitrate rich water infiltrated at the bs location that reaches the water table vfw is down gradient from the bs location and consistently has the lowest observed level for the water table in the study area the dpw and pool well are used as potential end member water compositions representing normal groundwater nitrate levels ss2 is not viable as its nitrate concentration is greater than that of vfw suggesting some of the infiltrating leachate waters percolated to the ss2 well the results of the mixing model indicate 1 9 of total recharge is occurring by vertical infiltration at the bs location likely following the pathway identified with the br tracer and reaching the vfw the remaining percentage 91 99 of recharge must come from another source either lateral flow other hillslopes adjacent to vfw or unknown sources 4 3 lateral recharge groundwater elevtion water chemistry and environmental tracer data provide evidence for significant lateral recharge to the memphis aquifer at the pinecrest site the upland monitoring wells ss2 and vfw show rise and fall in groundwater elevation opposite those of seasonal wetness and dryness suggesting lag in response or additional water sources in contrast the groundwater elevation in the dpw was highly influenced by seasonal precipitation and stream flow with higher sustained water levels during wetter times of the year for the majority of the year dpw maintained the highest groundwater elevation of the three wells during the dryer months it dropped to levels similar to those observed in ss2 however water levels never dropped below those observed in the vfw these observations indicate a persistent lateral gradient from dpw to vfw and from dpw toward the wolf river where surface flow discharges from the watershed fig 11 lateral groundwater flow under unconfined conditions was calculated using darcy s law and the range of hydraulic conductivity of 3 7 4 0 m d groundwater levels were averaged during the months that water levels at dpw were substantially higher than vfw march august 2014 and december 2014 february 2015 average specific discharge for these periods was 1 4 1 5 m d for dpw to vfw and 0 66 to 0 72 m d for ss2 to vfw the estimated travel time for water to move from dpw to vfw is 110 119 days and from ss2 to vfw is 112 121 days these travel time estimates are consistent with a rise in vfw groundwater level approximately 3 4 months after peak groundwater level in dpw however the data do not explain why ss2 shows similar trend to vfw sources outside the monitored area could be contributing lateral recharge to ss2 such as another surface water source or adjacent watershed the time frame and monitored area of the present study are insufficient to assess the recharge source for the ss2 well the chemistry of the groundwater is distinctly different than that of precipitation and soil water but similar to that of surface water precipitation is dilute and acidic as is typical for the southeastern part of north america lajtha and jones 2013 with mixed cation hco3 so4 composition in contrast soil water from the lysimeters is ph neutral moderate specific conductance 100 to 1400 Œºs and na hco3 so4 composition the seasonal shift in soil water composition is likely related to an increased proportion of sulfate in winter and spring precipitation followed by a proportional increase in bicarbonate during evaporation and soil water deficit during summer and fall the groundwater is slightly acidic low specific conductance 30 140 Œºs and mixed cation hco3 composition although groundwater was sampled only once during the year substantial changes in groundwater chemistry are unlikely over the period of a year absent strong gradients in groundwater chemistry or hydraulic head surface water chemistry had similar ph and specific conductance to groundwater but ranged from mixed cation hco3 to mixed cation hco3 so4 composition the strong similarity of surface water composition to groundwater suggests that infiltrated stream water is a significant component of the groundwater whereas infiltrated soil water from the upland soils does not contribute substantially to groundwater surface water is mainly immediate runoff from precipitation events that has not interacted extensively with soil minerals surface water from late winter or early spring may have more interaction with soils as indicated by the sulfate rich composition of pwc water from 3 28 14 likely due to protracted soil water saturation and runoff chemical reaction of acidic dilute precipitation with soil minerals should result in ph neutral water of mixed composition rather than the observed na so4 composition of soil water suggesting reaction with a sodium and sulfate bearing soil phase the most likely source for concentration of these elements in the soil is deposition of aerosols and particulates from atmospheric plumes emanating from a coal fired power plant and oil refinery in memphis 75 km west of pinecrest that have been operational since the 1940s and 1950s sulfate either as adsorbed so2 on particulate matter or in mineral form in fine ash is a well established reactive by product of coal combustion smith and gruber 1966 kang et al 2011 and atmospheric concentrations are correlated with fossil fuel energy use lajtha and jones 2013 sodium is preferentially released relative to other alkaline earth and alkaline metals during the combustion of coal li et al 2015 and may also be a significant mineral component of ash smith and gruber 1966 given the oxidizing conditions in groundwater sulfate reduction is not viable as a removal process furthermore a mechanism does not exist to exchange the sodium in the soil water for the mixed cation composition observed in groundwater thus the soil water is unlikely to be a significant source of recharge water for groundwater this conclusion is also consistent with the slow vertical recharge rates through the upland soils based on the vadose zone chloride profile and nitrate mixing model calculations modeling of the sf6 and 3h tracer concentrations suggests lateral groundwater flow of modern water by piston flow rather than percolation through a thick vadose zone fig 10 shows that the data for vfw and ss2 fit a pfm which is consistent with short recharge pathways and minimal dispersion vertical infiltration through the thick vadose zone would result in substantial hydrodynamic dispersion during percolation and lack of coherent behavior of sf6 a gas and 3h a component of the water molecule during equilibration with soil gases solomon and cook 1995 studies of infiltrated environmental tracers through thick vadose zones commonly show binary mixing relationships with shallow groundwater of other sources santoni et al 2016 consistent with observed water chemistry and hydrologic calculations above the yearly recharge of surface water to groundwater in exposed memphis sand near dpw drives lateral groundwater flow which allows 3h and sf6 to migrate seasonally with minimal lateral mixing consistent with piston flow behavior 4 4 significance for recharge processes the results of the present study indicate a strong lithological control on recharge rates and pathways to the underlying unconfined memphis aquifer vadose and saturated zone cmb and water balance estimates for recharge rates through the upland surfaces and alluvial valleys at pinecrest are less than 16 mm yr yearly variation in groundwater elevation at vfw and ss2 are 100 200 mm yr which assuming a 30 porosity of the memphis sand requires a recharge of at least 70 140 mm yr water chemistry and tracer data provide strong evidence that the main source of recharge is infiltrated surface water given that precipitation vegetation and land use in the areas of exposed memphis sand and the upland areas are not grossly different the main difference in the recharge rate is argued to be due to lithology and the presence of preferential recharge pathways through transmissive sediments the loess fluvial terrace deposits and upper 2 3 m memphis sand each have varying degrees of soil development mainly in the form of accumulated clays in the b horizons larsen and brock 2014 accumulated clay and soil formation are minimal in the exposed memphis sand and sandy surface soils formed therein given that loess and underlying paleosols mantle most landscape surfaces throughout western tennessee and other states in the mississippi embayment recharge is likely to be focused where fluvial incision has removed the loess and paleosols exposing underlying sandy formations primarily along modern alluvial valleys similar lithological control on recharge is observed in other regions mantled by loess or other fine grained deposits studies of recharge through loess in northern china show similar behavior to that of the western tennessee area but differences as well several studies have noted anomalously high tritium or agricultural chemicals and low chloride in groundwater underlying loess regions and have argued for focused recharge in deep gullies or alluvial valleys lin and wei 2006 gates et al 2011 however other studies have shown groundwater underlying loess regions being dominated by pre modern water with slow infiltration through the loess being the dominant recharge mechanism e g huang et al 2017 a critical aspect of rapid recharge in thick loess regions such as that in china may be the availability of focused recharge pathways in topographic depressions and deep gullies gates et al 2011 similar observations have been made in regions mantled by glacial till where recharge is focused in the alluvial valleys incised through the till gates et al 2014 studies is coastal plain deposits of western australia show similar sensitivity to the permeability of surface soils johnston 1987a b dawes et al 2012 recharge rates in western tennessee vary in relation to the proportion of loess and fine grained surface soils suggesting that recharge has greater sensitivity to land use and climate changes early research in the memphis aquifer of western tennessee considered diffuse percolation through the loess to be the dominant source of recharge parks and carmichael 1990 modeling of groundwater flow in the memphis area by brahana and broshears 2001 showed that 42 of the hydrologic budget of the memphis aquifer is recharge in the outcrop belt with almost all other water coming from vertical leakage through a shallow aquifer primarily in alluvial valleys numerically derived recharge rates in modeling studies within the region range from 3 to 36 mm yr arthur and taylor 1998 brahana and broshears 2001 mckee and clark 2003 however these values are determined by model fit and not measured the present study shows that less than 16 mm yr of recharge is likely in loess covered regions which is less than that typically observed in eastern north america median of 43 59 mm yr using similar methods nolan et al 2007 studies in western tennessee where incision has largely removed loess and paleosol bearing deposits from alluvial valleys yield recharge rates based on water balance of about 300 900 mm yr simco 2018 smith 2019 with only minor recharge attributed to the loess mantled upland surfaces similarly recharge rates based on q60 and q65 percent duration flow relationships to estimate mean annual base flow in areas within the region with sand aquifers and little or no loess cover range from 127 to 229 mm yr stricker 1983 bailey 1993 geologic mapping of two quadrangles in the memphis sand outcrop belt indicated that less than 7 of the mapped area is underlain by sandy soils with about 20 of the mapped area as alluvium brock 2012 these results indicate that recharge to the memphis aquifer is highly focused in as little as 7 of the outcrop belt although leakage contributions through sandy alluvium may occur over a somewhat greater area land use changes can both increase and decrease potential for recharge depending on the type of surface modification that is made future development in the loess covered regions of western tennessee needs to closely consider how land surface changes may affect recharge to the regional aquifers to ensure sustainability of groundwater resources 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate that recharge is largely controlled by lithology of surface soils and outcrop of the underlying memphis sand with recharge focused along modern alluvial valleys and other areas where the memphis sand is exposed using the vadose zone and saturated zone cmb methods and water balance yields annual recharge rates from 4 2 16 mm yr indicating that recharge through loess and underlying paleosols on upland surfaces is not sufficient to account for the observed annual water table fluctuations of 100 200 mm yr rather hydrochemistry environmental tracer concentrations and groundwater flow indicate that recharge is dominated by stream seepage in sandy stream beds on subcropping memphis sand and lateral recharge beneath upland surfaces with as little as 7 exposure of the memphis sand in the unconfined region of the aquifer and another 13 of the area as alluvial valleys recharge to the memphis aquifer is limited to preferential paths of recharge in the landscape as such the sustainability of the aquifer which is currently providing as much as 210 million gallons per day maupin et al 2014 for memphis tennessee and surrounding areas may be highly sensitive to alteration of land use that affects the access to preferential pathways of recharge evidence for groundwater recharge through preferential pathways is known from other regions with loess or other fine grained soils at the land surface indicating this phenomenon may be of broader importance than currently appreciated in regard to the

subjected to dilute acid leaching experiments installed piezometers and equipped them with pressure transducers analyzed tidal signals in high frequency groundwater hydrographs carried out pumping tests and finally took 49 groundwater samples new insights our results indicated a diverse groundwater system on the one hand groundwater was found at shallow depths in the saprolite of the togo structural unit tsu which in unweathered state is composed of phyllites schists and quartzites this system was shallow and predominantly unconfined as revealed by tidal analysis in addition transmissivities of tsu saprolite all in the order of 6e 5 m2 s reduced with depth which indicated either the lack of a stratiform fractured layer or the presence of such layer beyond drilled depths on the other hand groundwater was found in fractures of the gneisses of the dahomeyan structural unit dsu this system was potentially deeper but dsu transmissivities were significantly lower than those of tsu saprolite hydrochemically groundwater was mainly characterized by infiltration of waste water evidenced by elevated ion concentrations including nitrate due to the thinly weathered

basement aquifers wright 1992 stores large quantities of extractable groundwater for human consumption foster 1984 wright 1992 lachassagne et al 2011 lapworth et al 2013 macdonald et al 2012 generally speaking basement aquifers are thought to be composed of from top to bottom e g wyns et al 2004 dewandel et al 2006 courtois et al 2010 lachassagne et al 2011 belle et al 2018 alle et al 2018 1 an unconsolidated alterite or saprolite generally rich in clay which comes from the advanced weathering of the parent rock e g belle et al 2018 this layer can be subdivided into two units alloterites which are subject to rock volume reduction due to leaching of chemical constituents of the rock and underlying isalterites in which the parent rock structure is preserved with little or no volume change in plutonic rock the base of the isalterite very often shows a laminated layer of some 15 30 m which represents the highly weathered parent rock with a coarse sand size clast texture and a millimeter scale dense horizontal lamination cross cutting the biggest minerals vassolo et al 2019 dewandel et al 2006 saprolites are not very permeable with an average hydraulic conductivity 10 6 m s

aquifers in ssa are usually in the range of 1 2 3 5e 5 m2 s which yields sufficient water for small scale use but do not allow large scale groundwater development edet and okereke 2005 found

of our study is to characterize the shallow hydrogeological system in the weathered basement rock dominated dodowa area in terms of aquifer types water quantity and quality in order to underpin the preparation of a groundwater management plan 2 the dodowa study area dodowa is located in the shai osudoku district in the south eastern part of the greater accra region ghana fig 1 close to the akwapim togo mountain range the district receives a mean annual rainfall of about 900 mm per year and with an average temperature of 27 c kortatsi and j√∏rgensen 2001 the climate can be considered tropical kabo bah et al 2016 the region experiences two rain seasons occurring between may and july and between september and october kortatsi and j√∏rgensen 2001 vegetation in the area is mainly forest on the hills and grassland with mango trees interspersed with small agricultural plots in the lower parts topographically the northwestern part of dodowa is hilly with elevations of 125 150 m a

intrusive as well as hills forming outliers of the tsu attoh et al 1997 in the study area both the tsu and dsu have undergone intense weathering which resulted in an unconsolidated top layer or regolith with groundwater tables within 5 m below the land surface with a population of about 15 000 in dodowa most inhabitants are engaged in agriculture households use water from a variety of

resistivity sections 3 2 borehole drilling drill core sampling and piezometer installation at 8 locations throughout the dodowa area 6 inch diameter boreholes with depths ranging from 15 to 60 m were drilled using a man diesel speed star drilling rig fitted with 300 psi compressor in rotation with direct circulation whereby rock destruction was achieved by using air or water when required drilling was carried out by a drag bit in roto percussion mode with a down the hole hammer every meter drill cuttings were collected and the lithology was visually observed described and recorded drill cuttings were taken to the ihe delft analytical laboratory delft the netherlands for further analysis see below the general lay out of each borehole is depicted in fig 2 in two boreholes bh2 and bh10 at 5 m depth 2 inch pipes were fitted to the sides of the 4 inch diameter pvc in order to obtain groundwater table observations at shallow depth the constructed boreholes were developed by both air lift and surging until the discharging water was clear finally each borehole was covered by a concrete slab a locked cage and a locked lid in order to prevent people from starting to abstract groundwater from the piezometer and or to prevent contamination of groundwater from above fig 3 3 3 reconnaissance survey of exposed rocks and well inventory a number of reconnaissance walks were carried out to make an inventory of existing large diameter 1 2 m dug wells and to identify exposed geological formations in the dodowa area in addition of 30 dug wells selected based on accessibility while making sure the selected wells were evenly spread over the area elevations relative to mean sea level were determined using a topcon dt 20b digital theodolite 3 4 groundwater level observations a number of newly installed piezometers were equipped with pressure transducers mini diver di501 schlumberger to record pressure at 20 min intervals the barometric pressure was measured in a well attended place inside a compound within the center of dodowa using a barometric diver mini diver di500 schlumberger in order to correct pressures recorded in the well for atmospheric pressure in addition for the 30 leveled large diameter dug wells with a measuring tape groundwater levels were recorded every 2 weeks from early 2016 to mid 2017 3 5 groundwater tidal analysis the groundwater response to earth and atmospheric tides can be used to detect confinement and if confined calculate the barometric efficiency be acworth et al 2016 mcmillan et al 2019 we refer to this as tidal analysis from here onward and note that this is not associated with ocean tides the presence of an earth tide m2 at a frequency of 1 93227 cycles per day cpd amplitude that is significantly stronger than the background noise indicates confined conditions whereby the magnitude is proportional to the degree of confinement rahi and halihan 2013 under unconfined conditions the m2 amplitude is absent but the presence of an atmospheric tide s2 at a frequency of 2 cpd amplitude indicates a delay in atmospheric pressure transfer through the vadose zone caused by a delay in response to barometric forces acting on the pore pressure in the subsurface and the measured water level in the piezometer rasmussen and crawford 1997 this time lag indicates a lower pneumatic permeability of the vadose zone compared to an instantaneous response semi confined conditions and therefore also decreased vulnerability to groundwater contamination from the surface hussein et al 2013 the presence of both m2 and s2 amplitudes indicates confined conditions and justifies the calculation of be as well as specific storage and compressibility acworth et al 2015 2016 rau et al 2018 in this study recorded groundwater levels and atmospheric pressure were used to determine the degree of confinement and be using a new combination of the approaches explained in the works of rahi and hallihan 2013 and acworth et al 2015 2016 2017 we quantified amplitudes and phases of m2 and s2 for atmospheric depicted as superscript at and groundwater depicted as superscript gw pressure measured and earth tide

this method are more accurate compared to time domain approaches turnadge et al 2019 3 6 pumping tests in the newly installed piezometers described above pumping tests and a series of slug tests were carried out to determine transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer pumping tests involved continuously pumping discharging a borehole at a constant rate until the water level dropped to the depth of the pump around 3 m above the bottom of the borehole the duration of the tests varied between 30 360 min after pumping water levels were recorded until recovery to the initial water level these recovery tests took 55 180 min bh8 consists of 4 separate boreholes at various depths 15 25 35 and 50 m fig 3 during the pumping test in one bh8 hole groundwater levels in other bh8 holes were observed in this way hydraulic conditions and the connectivity between the various screens at bh8 could be determined slug tests were carried out for 2 inch diameter piezometers and for piezometers in low permeability layers thereto one or more bails of known volume were taken out of the piezometer and groundwater level recovery was determined using a measuring tape data from all tests were analyzed using the software package mlu hemker 1999 which is based on a 3d analytical solution for transient well flow in layered aquifer systems whereby transmissivities and resistance values of the hydraulic system are determined via curve fitting resistance in this case is defined by the quotient of the saturated thickness and vertical hydraulic conductivity usually of an aquitard when expressing the saturated thickness in m and the hydraulic conductivity in m s then the resistance is expressed in s unlike other aquifer test analysis software supporting a wide variety of different solution types for one and sometimes two aquifers e g theis hantush neuman boulton papadopulos moench bouwer rice mlu is based on a single analytical solution technique for well flow that handles

storage and skin effect for each pumping well and observation well and partial penetration hemker 1999 carlson and randall 2012 3 7 groundwater sampling 49 fresh groundwater samples were collected in clean 250 ml polyethylene bottles immediately after sampling ec temperature and ph were measured with handheld meters greisinger gmh3431and gmh3530 including a ge100bnc ph electrode then samples were stored in a cool box or refrigerator and alkalinity was determined by titrating with 0 2 m sulphuric acid using a portable titration set in a temporary laboratory in the center of dodowa within 24 h after sample taking with a hach dr 900 colorimeter nitrate was determined using the cadmium reduction method 8039 sulphate using the sulfaver method 8051 phosphate using the ascorbic acid method 8048 silica using the silicomolybdate method 8185 and ammonium using the salicylate method 10 031 samples for cations k mg ca mg fe and mn and anions cl and so4 were filtered through a 0 45 Œºm cellulose acetate filter into 25 ml scintillation vials cation samples were further preserved by adding two drops of concentrated nitric acid total organic carbon toc samples were prepared by adding 2 drops of concentrated sulphuric acid then the samples were frozen after collection all samples were shipped to the ihe delft analytical laboratory to determine cations using an icp ms thermoscientific xseries 2 anions by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1000 and toc using a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc l series with the results of the analyses speciation calculations were carried out using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 but only for those samples with a charge balance error within 15 samples with ion balance errors in excess of 15 were discarded 3 8 reactive metal ions in order to obtain an indication of the geo available or extractable metal ions and to assist in identifying the hydrochemical signature of groundwater in the aquifers in unpolluted condition we employed the dilute nitric acid method iso 17586 2016 thereto after drying and sieving 0 2 g of sieved 2 mm drill cuttings was mixed with 2 ml of 0 43 m nitric acid and then mixed for 24 h mixing was carried out in centrifuge tubes standing up straight using an orbital shaker at 150 rpm after mixing 10 ml of demineralized water was added and samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4500 rpm supernatants were measured on an icp ms as described above 4 results 4 1 geology of the area we found that the boundary of tsu and dsu was exposed and could be easily mapped in the central built up area of dodowa fig 4 where both quartzite belonging to tsu and gneiss belonging to dsu were exposed in addition we observed a layer of conglomerates including the presence of angular breccia type fragments in the vicinity of old ghanata high school to the highest parts of dodowa in the so called zongo area also located in the central built up area ert results showed that apparent resistivities ranged from more than 500 to less than 1 œâm fig 5 for the tsu composed of phyllites schists and quartzites including its weathering products we attributed 10 o m to clay 10 200 ohm m to sandy clay with quartzite rock fragments and 250 o m up to several 1000 o m to quartzite furthermore the conglomerate had an apparent resistivity 200 o m up to 600 o m fig 5 line 3a and for the gneisses of the dsu resistivity values 200 o m up to several 1000 o m were attributed to parent gneiss while values 200 o m were attributed to saprolite above the gneiss generally speaking the thickness of the saprolite of the tsu ranged from 0 m at bh7 to more than 50 m towards the hilly northwest of dodowa fig 4 the presence of the tsu saprolite was confirmed by the drillings and was mainly composed of lateritic clays and sandy clay since thickness geology and resistivity values of tsu saprolite ranged considerably we inferred that the parent tsu must have been diverse as well and likely composed of softer and more weatherable phyllites and schists intercalated with less weatherable quartzitic layers at bh8 and bh1 we drilled up to such less weatherable parent quartzite in contrast to the tsu the thickness of the dsu saprolite was less than 10 m bh9 bh10 and bh11 drilling b2 was mainly in a thick layer of conglomerate 15 m which appeared to be the extension of similar material found exposed at the surface between ghanata high school and the zongo area as described above 4 2 groundwater presence groundwater levels and fluctuations within the tsu saprolite and the conglomerates groundwater tables were 1 5 m below the surface in dsu area at some locations e g bh6 bh10 groundwater was found in the dsu saprolite while at other locations bh9 bh11 the saprolite was dry this shallow groundwater however was perched as the borehole became unsaturated when drilling continued occasionally and only in dsu gneiss a sudden drop of the drilling bit could initiate the first appearance of water in the borehole which indicated the presence of permeable water filled fractures in the dsu gneisses for those boreholes bh6 bh9 bh10 and bh11 we observed 1 3 of those drilling bit drops per borehole indicating the presence of 1 3 water bearing fractures per 50 m of dsu for the entire area tsu dsu and conglomerates we constructed a combined groundwater piezometric level map fig 7 the horizontal groundwater head gradient in the study area was from nw to se in all hydrographs fig 8 groundwater levels gradually dropped to their lowest levels around march may and then increased from march may to june to reach the approximate same level as during the start up of the level measurements in october recorded year round water level fluctuations in any year maximum minus minimum groundwater level in any monitored piezometer were between 1 2 m at bh1 superimposed on the abovementioned seasonal pattern modest 10 20 cm almost instantaneous level increases and decreases can be seen which we interpreted as groundwater level changes possibly due to abstraction in the vicinity of the piezometer the characteristic groundwater level decline after a recharge event representing the emptying of a type linear reservoir was absent of all hydrographs at bh8 those characteristic almost instantaneous increases and recession due to direct recharge and emptying of the groundwater aquifer were clearly present furthermore we observed that the head at bh8 50 m was 1 2 m higher than the head at bh8 15 m which indicated the presence of a vertical upward gradient throughout the year in bh11 there is a clear presence of earth tide effects see next paragraph while in bh9 located close to bh11 this earth tide effect was already completely absent finally in the groundwater hydrographs of bh2 bh8 50 m and bh6 there are brief lows in the groundwater head this is due to temporary abstractions conducted to clean the piezometers towards the west part of the area groundwater heads were very shallow and at one location we observed a spring fig 7 with a discharge in the order of 20 30 l s visually determined during fieldwork in october after a rain season when spring discharge was likely high the discharged spring water joins the dodowa river immediately south of dodowa and continues to flow towards the south from the groundwater level pattern we concluded that the spring is likely fed by the fractured quartzites towards the nw of the spring 4 3 groundwater tidal analysis the groundwater level amplitude spectra limited to the frequency range of interest range between 1 6 and 2 4 cpd for barometric pressure the earth tide record and all boreholes same vertical scale for comparison are summarized in fig 9 the amplitudes for the earth tide component m2 1 93227 cpd and the combined earth atmospheric tide component s2 2 cpd were quantified and highlighted in the plots red and green colored dots respectively fig 9a demonstrates the presence of atmospheric tides at 2 cpd with 1 5 cm head equivalent whereas fig 9b shows the presence of both m2 and s2 as miniscule gravity fluctuations the lack of a groundwater response to earth and atmospheric tides for bh6 and bh8 15 m indicated completely unconfined conditions bh9 bh2 and bh8 50 m showed semi confined conditions with an increasing s2 magnitude indicative of a decrease in the pneumatic permeability of the vadose zone the tidal results also illustrated that the thin clay layers found in the lithological profiles of bh2 bh8 and bh6 fig 6 must have more permeable zones or be of limited horizontal extent this is because atmospheric pressure variations can reach the point of measurement rapid enough to avoid delays which would otherwise occur when propagating through clays that are considered pneumatically tight bh1 and bh11 were confined as indicated by the presence of both m2 and s2 components calculated be values for bh1 and bh11 were 0 29 and 0 99 respectively assuming porosities in the range of 0 5 5 the aquifer compressibilities for the semi confined cases ranged from 10 10 to 10 14 pa 1 while corresponding specific storage values ranged between 10 6 and 10 8 m 1 table 1 from the tidal analysis we derived that most of the study area was unconfined towards the southern part of dodowa the gneiss area was semi confined with a high barometric efficiency furthermore the deeper part of the quartzite area in the north part of dodowa was semi confined 4 4 pumping tests and slug tests based on the results of the groundwater tidal analysis we kept the specific storage values for the confined parts of the models we applied to the pumping and slug test data in mlu at 10 7 m 1 in all cases only aquifer parameters were optimized well diameter parameters were not optimized the results indicated that transmissivities for tsu ranged from 0 5 to 5 4e 5 m2 s table 1 transmissivities of 3 5 4e 5 m2 s at shallow depth bh8 15 m bh8 24 m were significantly higher than 0 8 2 1e 5 m2 s at 35 50 m the specific yield was highest shallow 11 at 15 m and lowest 2 deep table 1 from the permeability and porosity values we inferred that we had stopped drilling in less permeable quartzite also we inferred that either we had not drilled up to the more permeable stratiform fracture layer sfl or the sfl was not present in the case of bh1 and bh8 as an example of the goodness of fit in fig 10 for one pumping test the drawdowns for the 4 screens at various depths were given including the fitted curves for the conglomerate transmissivity was 3 7e 5 m2 s finally for the gneiss of the dsu transmissivities of the water bearing fractures were relatively low 0 2 1 5e 6 m2 s 4 5 hydrochemistry and geochemistry electrical conductivity values ranged from 200 5 600 Œºs cm table 2 while nitrate concentrations ranged from 0 4 mmol l 0 240 mg l samples with high ec values and no nitrate were found towards the south and south east due to the higher reactive metal ion concentrations as indicated by the dilute nitric acid leaching experiments fig 11 groundwater in the gneissic dahomeyan structural unit contained more reactive metal ions like calcium sodium and magnesium while groundwater in the tsu was generally poor on reactive metal ions after the dilute nitric acid experiments in the tsu area at the foot of the hills in the nw ec of shallow groundwater was 207 Œºs cm fig 12 a while concentrations of most ions were low and ph was circumneutral 7 4 groundwater here is of the nacl and nahco3 type table 2 mainly as a result of prolonged dissolution of silicate minerals when going to the center of the cross section where there is built up area ec values increase to over 3000 Œºs cm while ph values drop 1 2 units to 5 5 6 5 fig 12b also alkalinity values increase from less than 0 5 mmol l to more than 1 0 mmol l in the center parts of the study area fig 12c furthermore while nitrate is absent at the fringes of the study area towards the center values increase to over 1 0 mmol l fig 12d because of the presence of nitrate in the discharging groundwater from the spring we discarded the possibility that the watershed was located nw of the spring for the entire study area toc values were generally low 0 5 mmol c table 2 without clear trend also in all cases ammonium was low or absent at the southern boundary of the study area an increase in ec ph and alkalinity occurred while nitrate values reduced to zero 5 synthesis discussion and conclusions using our multi parameter dataset a rather diverse pattern of groundwater system dynamics emerges in the dodowa area in which a number of hydrochemical processes take place our results indicate weathered material on top of tsu and dsu for the tsu composed of phyllites schists and quartzites including its weathering products we attributed 10 o m to clay 10 200 ohm m to sandy clay with quartzite rock fragments and 250 o m up to several 1000 o m to quartzite furthermore the conglomerate had an apparent resistivitiy 200 o m up to 600 o m and for the gneisses of the dsu resistivity values 200 o m up to several 1000 o m were attributed to parent gneiss while values 200 o m were attributed to saprolite above the gneiss generally speaking the thickness of the saprolite of the tsu ranged from 0 m at bh7 to more than 50 m towards the hilly northwest of dodowa fig 4 the presence of the tsu saprolite was confirmed by the drillings and was mainly composed of lateritic clays and sandy clay saprolite thicknesses varied considerably in the center of dodowa saprolite is absent and here quarzitic tsu besides gneissic dsu is exposed at the surface towards the west tsu saprolite thickness is more than 50 m and to the south 25 m or less while the dsu saprolite thickness is less than 10 m since thickness geology and resistivity values of tsu saprolite ranged considerably we inferred that the parent tsu must have been diverse as well and likely composed of softer and more weatherable phyllites and schists intercalated with less weatherable quartzitic layers quist 1976 as reported in kortatsi 2006 mentioned similar thicknesses of weathering depths of the tsu 47 m near the foothills of the akwapim togo range and decreasing to less than 6 m in the heart of the accra plains south of the study area in the tsu groundwater occurrence was mainly in the saprolite while in the dsu groundwater occurrence was mainly in a limited number of water transmitting fractures around 3 fractures per 50 m dsu results from groundwater tidal analysis illustrated that most of the study area can be considered unconfined while the northern tsu saprolite bh1 and the southern fractured gneiss of dsu bh11 form a semi confined aquifer from this it is clear that the clay layer in the vicinity of bh8 above bh8 35 and bh8 50 does not give rise to confinement as both high frequency groundwater level series we measured in bh8 boreholes are unconfined the clay layer in bh1 which had a larger thickness than at bh8 was apparently capable of partly confining groundwater transmissivities of the tsu saprolite ranged from 0 5 to 5 4e 5 m2 s and increased from bottom to top these values are less than the 5 6e 5 1 1e 3 m2 s given by wrri 1996 as reported by kortatsi 2006 specific yield values ranged from 2 to 11 and also increased from bottom to top based on the decrease in both transmissivity and specific storage in depth we concluded that the quartzite we encountered in the tsu at 30 m depth was not part of a stratiform fracture layer sfl or saprock e g vassolo et al 2019 either the sfl was not present or it must have been below drilling depth added to this is the fact that upon drilling the quartzite from 30 50 m there was no release of pressurized water which could be the case when reaching the permeable water containing sfl furthermore we think the quartzite layer in the tsu at this depth extended up gradient towards the north and may even be connected with the quartzite layer in bh1 which could explain the higher groundwater levels in bh8 50 compared to bh8 15 within the tsu saprolite roughly east west oriented we found a body of conglomerate including subrounded but also angular fragments from these observations we concluded that this is a mudflow alluvial type of deposit which either indicates the presence or vicinity of the thrust fault between tsu and dsu as is mentioned in the introduction or is related to a higher energy regime of the dodowa river in the past from a hydrogeological point of view the unit is relatively permeable t 3 7e 5 m2 s from the recorded groundwater table fluctuations which were between 1 and 2 m throughout the year and assuming unconfined conditions porosities in the range of 0 5 for dsu and 5 for tsu saprolite while neglecting horizontal flow components we estimated recharge from precipitation to be in the order of 5 10 mm year 2 4 of annual precipitation for the dsu part of the area and 50 100 mm year 6 11 of annual precipitation for the tsu saprolite part this is in the same range as but less than the 15 of annual precipitation estimated by nii consult 1998 for the accra plains as reported by kortatsi 2006 discharge of the spring in october was 20 30 l s if we assume this rate is constant for all 6 wet months per year and if we assume the spring runs dry during the 6 dry months in any year then the spring discharges around 0 4 mm3 year based on the groundwater level map most of the discharge originates from the nw area of the spring likely from the fractured tsu as part of the akwapim togo mountains or hills the boundaries of the catchment area of the spring are unknown but likely extend to the nw outside the study area as depicted in fig 1 because of the unknown spring catchment boundary we did not convert nor estimate yearly spring discharge volume to rate of groundwater outflow mm day the low concentrations of nitrate we found in the spring water indicated the presence of some waste water or manure pollution possibly originating from close by animal farming since groundwater levels did not show any form of overall rise or decline we assumed the steady state groundwater balance was square besides precipitation excess other in terms of the water balance were waste water return and leakage from the water supply mains besides spring discharge other out terms of the water balance included abstractions for domestic use and evapotranspiration the latter mainly affected groundwater close to the southern part of the study area where unpolluted brackish nacl types of groundwater were found see below based on the very low ion concentrations from the acid leaching experiments we conclude that the tsu saprolite was chemically not very reactive towards the center of the township we mapped elevated ec nitrate and alkalinity while ph values were lower because of the on site waste water disposal practices of the community we concluded that on site infiltration of waste water had occurred this not only gave rise to elevated concentrations of most ions but it also explained the relatively high nitrate concentrations with here and there traces of ammonium assuming that at least some nitrogen in waste water was present as ammonium apparently the diffusion of oxygen from the open air into the aquifer was at least equally rapid as the infiltration of waste water in order to maintain aerobic conditions in the upper waste water affected groundwater whereby ammonium was converted into nitrate thereby consuming oxygen and producing protons nitrification the latter likely caused the ph lowering in this poorly buffered groundwater although a lower ph compared to natural groundwater ph values of 7 could also be explained by a slightly acidic ph value of waste water also due to the same diffusion of oxygen since toc concentrations were in all cases low to very low mobile toc originating from the infiltrating waste water could have decayed thereby producing co2 and water which could have added to elevated bicarbonate concentrations downstream the effect of waste water infiltration ceased to exist here in both tsu and dsu groundwater was composed of unpolluted brackish nacl type of water we think this is the result of evapotranspiration in absence of the sea some 30 km away from the study area weathering of silicate minerals in either tsu saprolite or dsu gneisses produces a nacl or nahco3 type of water with slightly elevated ca and mg concentrations in case of groundwater in the dsu this water is then evapotranspired causing brackish groundwater during the process minerals will tend to precipitate out of the solution when the solubility product is exceeded kortatsi 2006 suggested halite dissolution to be responsible for the nacl type of brackish groundwaters we however are more inclined to think that halite is the end product of the evapotranspiration process when all water in solution is evapotranspired how to include these findings and insights in a water management plan in terms of groundwater reserves based on the present number of wells and measured transmissivities the tsu saprolite is a reliable source of groundwater available at very shallow depths however given the low volumes of the various terms in the water balance and the limited volumes stored any large scale development of groundwater will be difficult or even not possible groundwater can only be used in small quantities at a limited scale and preferably not for household use since the saprolite is rather vulnerable for pollution as is clear from the confinement determination using tidal analysis and the hydro chemical data groundwater in the dsu can only be obtained from fractures which are not very frequent and their transmissivities are very low also groundwater here is mostly brackish so it is not favorable to develop groundwater sources in dsu in the study area due to very thin tsu saprolite towards the south we expect that groundwater system development in the area is local and confined to the dodowa area from our study we concluded that groundwater system dynamics in our study area of only 6 km2 was remarkably varied in terms of aquifer thickness permeability confinement groundwater level response to change and hydrochemistry in the saprolite of the tsu groundwater occurrence was widespread and at shallow depths in the dsu groundwater was found in a limited number of fractures within the parent gneisses this system was potentially deeper than in case of the tsu transmissivities of tsu saprolite decreased with depth from 5 4e 5 m2 s at shallow depths to 3 5e 6 m2 s at depths of around 50 m specific yield values ranged from 2 to 11 transmissivities of the dsu were significantly lower and ranged from 0 2 to 1 2e 6 m2 s the groundwater system was predominantly unconfined therefore the system is vulnerable evidenced by the widespread on site infiltration of waste water with elevated ec alkalinity and nitrate concentrations and lower ph values downgradient towards the southern boundary of the study area the effect of waste water infiltration ceased to exist here groundwater was composed of unpolluted but brackish nacl type of water due to very thin saprolite towards the south we expect that groundwater system development in the area is local and

subjected to dilute acid leaching experiments installed piezometers and equipped them with pressure transducers analyzed tidal signals in high frequency groundwater hydrographs carried out pumping tests and finally took 49 groundwater samples new insights our results indicated a diverse groundwater system on the one hand groundwater was found at shallow depths in the saprolite of the togo structural unit tsu which in unweathered state is composed of phyllites schists and quartzites this system was shallow and predominantly unconfined as revealed by tidal analysis in addition transmissivities of tsu saprolite all in the order of 6e 5 m2 s reduced with depth which indicated either the lack of a stratiform fractured layer or the presence of such layer beyond drilled depths on the other hand groundwater was found in fractures of the gneisses of the dahomeyan structural unit dsu this system was potentially deeper but dsu transmissivities were significantly lower than those of tsu saprolite hydrochemically groundwater was mainly characterized by infiltration of waste water evidenced by elevated ion concentrations including nitrate due to the thinly weathered

a geologically diverse schist shale quartzite environment in their study area in tropical burundi composed of from bottom to top a fractured layer or saprock their deeper aquifer isalterite alloterite and a collapsed clay rich plasmic zone only in valleys the isalterites were made up by coarse sand to fine gravel sandy shales alternations of shales and quartzites reddish silty clay or clayey schists with layers of non swelling red clay while the alloterites were composed of clays weathered schists or sandy schists vassolo et al 2019 wright 1992 notes that transmissivities of basement aquifers in ssa are usually in the range of 1 2 3 5e 5 m2 s which yields sufficient water for small scale use but do not allow large scale groundwater development edet and okereke 2005 found transmissivities in the order of 5 8e 6 m2 s while in southern india guih√©neuf et al 2014 obtained values of 0 7 4 6e 4 m2 s which are all in the same range as reported by wright 1992 the objective of our study is to characterize the shallow hydrogeological system in the weathered basement rock dominated dodowa area in terms of aquifer types water quantity and quality in order to underpin the preparation of a groundwater management plan 2 the dodowa study area dodowa is located in the shai osudoku district in the south eastern part of the greater accra region ghana fig 1 close to the akwapim togo mountain range the district receives a mean annual rainfall of about 900 mm per year and with an average temperature of 27 c kortatsi and j√∏rgensen 2001 the climate can be considered tropical kabo bah et al 2016 the region experiences two rain seasons occurring between may and july and between september and october kortatsi and j√∏rgensen 2001 vegetation in the area is mainly forest on the hills and grassland with mango trees interspersed with small agricultural plots in the lower parts topographically the northwestern part of dodowa is hilly with elevations of 125 150 m a s l while the eastern and southern part have an almost flat topography with elevations of 55 65 m a s l the geology of the area is mainly composed of the togo structural unit tsu and dahomeyan structural unit dsu the tsu comprises a series of metamorphic and highly folded quartzites phyllites and schists ar40 ar39 muscovites dating showed that the tsu is 579 4 0 8 ma in age attoh et al 1997 neo proterozoic by means of a major thrust fault the tsu covers sequences of the dsu which is also older still neo proterozoic and mainly found in the low lying plains attoh et al 1997 the dsu has experienced metamorphism and the unit occurs as alternate belts of acid and basic gneisses here and there the low lying gneissic plain is occupied by isolated inselbergs and ridges of ultrabasic intrusive as well as hills forming outliers of the tsu attoh et al 1997 in the study area both the tsu and dsu have undergone intense weathering which resulted in an unconsolidated top layer or regolith with groundwater tables within 5 m below the land surface with a population of about 15 000 in dodowa most inhabitants are engaged in agriculture households use water from a variety of sources for 38 of the population the main source is groundwater from privately dug wells or boreholes while 56 have access to piped water from the public water supplier gr√∂nwall 2016 except for a main source the majority 55 of the population also reported having a second water source which functions as a back up of those having a second source 73 uses groundwater from dug wells or boreholes 3 materials and methods 3 1 electrical resistivity tomography ert to determine geological structures and groundwater potential of the study area ert was carried out in 7 sections with a total length of 3200 m and a maximum depth of 60 m by employing an abem terrameter sas 1000 resistivity meter in multi electrode set up this technique runs both profiling and vertical electrical sounding concurrently continuous vertical electrical soundings cves to produce a two dimensional 2d resistivity pseudo section output of the subsurface with spatial resolution of 5 m a quality check of the data was carried out and bad data points were removed before inverting the data with the res2dinv modelling software loke and barker 1996 final output from res2dinv used in this study were modelled apparent resistivity sections 3 2 borehole drilling drill core sampling and piezometer installation at 8 locations throughout the dodowa area 6 inch diameter boreholes with depths ranging from 15 to 60 m were drilled using a man diesel speed star drilling rig fitted with 300 psi compressor in rotation with direct circulation whereby rock destruction was achieved by using air or water when required drilling was carried out by a drag bit in roto percussion mode with a down the hole hammer every meter drill cuttings were collected and the lithology was visually observed described and recorded drill cuttings were taken to the ihe delft analytical laboratory delft the netherlands for further analysis see below the general lay out of each borehole is depicted in fig 2 in two boreholes bh2 and bh10 at 5 m depth 2 inch pipes were fitted to the sides of the 4 inch diameter pvc in order to obtain groundwater table observations at shallow depth the constructed boreholes were developed by both air lift and surging until the discharging water was clear finally each borehole was covered by a concrete slab a locked cage and a locked lid in order to prevent people from starting to abstract groundwater from the piezometer and or to prevent contamination of groundwater from above fig 3 3 3 reconnaissance survey of exposed rocks and well inventory a number of reconnaissance walks were carried out to make an inventory of existing large diameter 1 2 m dug wells and to identify exposed geological formations in the dodowa area in addition of 30 dug wells selected based on accessibility while making sure the selected wells were evenly spread over the area elevations relative to mean sea level were determined using a topcon dt 20b digital theodolite 3 4 groundwater level observations a number of newly installed piezometers were equipped with pressure transducers mini diver di501 schlumberger to record pressure at 20 min intervals the barometric pressure was measured in a well attended place inside a compound within the center of dodowa using a barometric diver mini diver di500 schlumberger in order to correct pressures recorded in the well for atmospheric pressure in addition for the 30 leveled large diameter dug wells with a measuring tape groundwater levels were recorded every 2 weeks from early 2016 to mid 2017 3 5 groundwater tidal analysis the groundwater response to earth and atmospheric tides can be used to detect confinement and if confined calculate the barometric efficiency be acworth et al 2016 mcmillan et al 2019 we refer to this as tidal analysis from here onward and note that this is not associated with ocean tides the presence of an earth tide m2 at a frequency of 1 93227 cycles per day cpd amplitude that is significantly stronger than the background noise indicates confined conditions whereby the magnitude is proportional to the degree of confinement rahi and halihan 2013 under unconfined conditions the m2 amplitude is absent but the presence of an atmospheric tide s2 at a frequency of 2 cpd amplitude indicates a delay in atmospheric pressure transfer through the vadose zone caused by a delay in response to barometric forces acting on the pore pressure in the subsurface and the measured water level in the piezometer rasmussen and crawford 1997 this time lag indicates a lower pneumatic permeability of the vadose zone compared to an instantaneous response semi confined conditions and therefore also decreased vulnerability to groundwater contamination from the surface hussein et al 2013 the presence of both m2 and s2 amplitudes indicates confined conditions and justifies the calculation of be as well as specific storage and compressibility acworth et al 2015 2016 rau et al 2018 in this study recorded groundwater levels and atmospheric pressure were used to determine the degree of confinement and be using a new combination of the approaches explained in the works of rahi and hallihan 2013 and acworth et al 2015 2016 2017 we quantified amplitudes and phases of m2 and s2 for atmospheric depicted as superscript at and groundwater depicted as superscript gw pressure measured and earth tide

this method are more accurate compared to time domain approaches turnadge et al 2019 3 6 pumping tests in the newly installed piezometers described above pumping tests and a series of slug tests were carried out to determine transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer pumping tests involved continuously pumping discharging a borehole at a constant rate until the water level dropped to the depth of the pump around 3 m above the bottom of the borehole the duration of the tests varied between 30 360 min after pumping water levels were recorded until recovery to the initial water level these recovery tests took 55 180 min bh8 consists of 4 separate boreholes at various depths 15 25 35 and 50 m fig 3 during the pumping test in one bh8 hole groundwater levels in other bh8 holes were observed in this way hydraulic conditions and the connectivity between the various screens at bh8 could be determined slug tests were carried out for 2 inch diameter piezometers and for piezometers in low permeability layers thereto one or more bails of known volume were taken out of the piezometer and groundwater level recovery was determined using a measuring tape data from all tests were analyzed using the software package mlu hemker 1999 which is based on a 3d analytical solution for transient well flow in layered aquifer systems whereby transmissivities and resistance values of the hydraulic system are determined via curve fitting resistance in this case is defined by the quotient of the saturated thickness and vertical hydraulic conductivity usually of an aquitard when expressing the saturated thickness in m and the hydraulic conductivity in m s then the resistance is expressed in s unlike other aquifer test analysis software supporting a wide variety of different solution types for one and sometimes two aquifers e g theis hantush neuman boulton papadopulos moench bouwer rice mlu is based on a single analytical solution technique for well flow that handles multi aquifer systems aquifers and aquitards single layered stratified aquifers unconfined confined leaky and delayed yield aquifer conditions effects of aquifer and aquitard storativities wellbore storage and skin effect for each pumping well and observation well and partial penetration hemker 1999 carlson and randall 2012 3 7 groundwater sampling 49 fresh groundwater samples were collected in clean 250 ml polyethylene bottles immediately after sampling ec temperature and ph were measured with handheld meters greisinger gmh3431and gmh3530 including a ge100bnc ph electrode then samples were stored in a cool box or refrigerator and alkalinity was determined by titrating with 0 2 m sulphuric acid using a portable titration set in a temporary laboratory in the center of dodowa within 24 h after sample taking with a hach dr 900 colorimeter nitrate was determined using the cadmium reduction method 8039 sulphate using the sulfaver method 8051 phosphate using the ascorbic acid method 8048 silica using the silicomolybdate method 8185 and ammonium using the salicylate method 10 031 samples for cations k mg ca mg fe and mn and anions cl and so4 were filtered through a 0 45 Œºm cellulose acetate filter into 25 ml scintillation vials cation samples were further preserved by adding two drops of concentrated nitric acid total organic carbon toc samples were prepared by adding 2 drops of concentrated sulphuric acid then the samples were frozen after collection all samples were shipped to the ihe delft analytical laboratory to determine cations using an icp ms thermoscientific xseries 2 anions by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1000 and toc using a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc l series with the results of the analyses speciation calculations were carried out using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 but only for those samples with a charge balance error within 15 samples with ion balance errors in excess of 15 were discarded 3 8 reactive metal ions in order to obtain an indication of the geo available or extractable metal ions and to assist in identifying the hydrochemical signature of groundwater in the aquifers in unpolluted condition we employed the dilute nitric acid method iso 17586 2016 thereto after drying and sieving 0 2 g of sieved 2 mm drill cuttings was mixed with 2 ml of 0 43 m nitric acid and then mixed for 24 h mixing was carried out in centrifuge tubes standing up straight using an orbital shaker at 150 rpm after mixing 10 ml of demineralized water was added and samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4500 rpm supernatants were measured on an icp ms as described above 4 results 4 1 geology of the area we found that the boundary of tsu and dsu was exposed and could be easily mapped in the central built up area of dodowa fig 4 where both quartzite belonging to tsu and gneiss belonging to dsu were exposed in addition we observed a layer of conglomerates including the presence of angular breccia type fragments in the vicinity of old ghanata high school to the highest parts of dodowa in the so called zongo area also located in the central built up area ert results showed that apparent resistivities ranged from more than 500 to less than 1 œâm fig 5 for the tsu composed of phyllites schists and quartzites including its weathering products we attributed 10 o m to clay 10 200 ohm m to sandy clay with quartzite rock fragments and 250 o m up to several 1000 o m to quartzite furthermore the conglomerate had an apparent resistivity 200 o m up to 600 o m fig 5 line 3a and for the gneisses of the dsu resistivity values 200 o m up to several 1000 o m were attributed to parent gneiss while values 200 o m were attributed to saprolite above the gneiss generally speaking the thickness of the saprolite of the tsu ranged from 0 m at bh7 to more than 50 m towards the hilly northwest of dodowa fig 4 the presence of the tsu saprolite was confirmed by the drillings and was mainly composed of lateritic clays and sandy clay since thickness geology and resistivity values of tsu saprolite ranged considerably we inferred that the parent tsu must have been diverse as well and likely composed of softer and more weatherable phyllites and schists intercalated with less weatherable quartzitic layers at bh8 and bh1 we drilled up to such less weatherable parent quartzite in contrast to the tsu the thickness of the dsu saprolite was less than 10 m bh9 bh10 and bh11 drilling b2 was mainly in a thick layer of conglomerate 15 m which appeared to be the extension of similar material found exposed at the surface between ghanata high school and the zongo area as described above 4 2 groundwater presence groundwater levels and fluctuations within the tsu saprolite and the conglomerates groundwater tables were 1 5 m below the surface in dsu area at some locations e g bh6 bh10 groundwater was found in the dsu saprolite while at other locations bh9 bh11 the saprolite was dry this shallow groundwater however was perched as the borehole became unsaturated when drilling continued occasionally and only in dsu gneiss a sudden drop of the drilling bit could initiate the first appearance of water in the borehole which indicated the presence of permeable water filled fractures in the dsu gneisses for those boreholes bh6 bh9 bh10 and bh11 we observed 1 3 of those drilling bit drops per borehole indicating the presence of 1 3 water bearing fractures per 50 m of dsu for the entire area tsu dsu and conglomerates we constructed a combined groundwater piezometric level map fig 7 the horizontal groundwater head gradient in the study area was from nw to se in all hydrographs fig 8 groundwater levels gradually dropped to their lowest levels around march may and then increased from march may to june to reach the approximate same level as during the start up of the level measurements in october recorded year round water level fluctuations in any year maximum minus minimum groundwater level in any monitored piezometer were between 1 2 m at bh1 superimposed on the abovementioned seasonal pattern modest 10 20 cm almost instantaneous level increases and decreases can be seen which we interpreted as groundwater level changes possibly due to abstraction in the vicinity of the piezometer the characteristic groundwater level decline after a recharge event representing the emptying of a type linear reservoir was absent of all hydrographs at bh8 those characteristic almost instantaneous increases and recession due to direct recharge and emptying of the groundwater aquifer were clearly present furthermore we observed that the head at bh8 50 m was 1 2 m higher than the head at bh8 15 m which indicated the presence of a vertical upward gradient throughout the year in bh11 there is a clear presence of earth tide effects see next paragraph while in bh9 located close to bh11 this earth tide effect was already completely absent finally in the groundwater hydrographs of bh2 bh8 50 m and bh6 there are brief lows in the groundwater head this is due to temporary abstractions conducted to clean the piezometers towards the west part of the area groundwater heads were very shallow and at one location we observed a spring fig 7 with a discharge in the order of 20 30 l s visually determined during fieldwork in october after a rain season when spring discharge was likely high the discharged spring water joins the dodowa river immediately south of dodowa and continues to flow towards the south from the groundwater level pattern we concluded that the spring is likely fed by the fractured quartzites towards the nw of the spring 4 3 groundwater tidal analysis the groundwater level amplitude spectra limited to the frequency range of interest range between 1 6 and 2 4 cpd for barometric pressure the earth tide record and all boreholes same vertical scale for comparison are summarized in fig 9 the amplitudes for the earth tide component m2 1 93227 cpd and the combined earth atmospheric tide component s2 2 cpd were quantified and highlighted in the plots red and green colored dots respectively fig 9a demonstrates the presence of atmospheric tides at 2 cpd with 1 5 cm head equivalent whereas fig 9b shows the presence of both m2 and s2 as miniscule gravity fluctuations the lack of a groundwater response to earth and atmospheric tides for bh6 and bh8 15 m indicated completely unconfined conditions bh9 bh2 and bh8 50 m showed semi confined conditions with an increasing s2 magnitude indicative of a decrease in the pneumatic permeability of the vadose zone the tidal results also illustrated that the thin clay layers found in the lithological profiles of bh2 bh8 and bh6 fig 6 must have more permeable zones or be of limited horizontal extent this is because atmospheric pressure variations can reach the point of measurement rapid enough to avoid delays which would otherwise occur when propagating through clays that are considered pneumatically tight bh1 and bh11 were confined as indicated by the presence of both m2 and s2 components calculated be values for bh1 and bh11 were 0 29 and 0 99 respectively assuming porosities in the range of 0 5 5 the aquifer compressibilities for the semi confined cases ranged from 10 10 to 10 14 pa 1 while corresponding specific storage values ranged between 10 6 and 10 8 m 1 table 1 from the tidal analysis we derived that most of the study area was unconfined towards the southern part of dodowa the gneiss area was semi confined with a high barometric efficiency furthermore the deeper part of the quartzite area in the north part of dodowa was semi confined 4 4 pumping tests and slug tests based on the results of the groundwater tidal analysis we kept the specific storage values for the confined parts of the models we applied to the pumping and slug test data in mlu at 10 7 m 1 in all cases only aquifer parameters were optimized well diameter parameters were not optimized the results indicated that transmissivities for tsu ranged from 0 5 to 5 4e 5 m2 s table 1 transmissivities of 3 5 4e 5 m2 s at shallow depth bh8 15 m bh8 24 m were significantly higher than 0 8 2 1e 5 m2 s at 35 50 m the specific yield was highest shallow 11 at 15 m and lowest 2 deep table 1 from the permeability and porosity values we inferred that we had stopped drilling in less permeable quartzite also we inferred that either we had not drilled up to the more permeable stratiform fracture layer sfl or the sfl was not present in the case of bh1 and bh8 as an example of the goodness of fit in fig 10 for one pumping test the drawdowns for the 4 screens at various depths were given including the fitted curves for the conglomerate transmissivity was 3 7e 5 m2 s finally for the gneiss of the dsu transmissivities of the water bearing fractures were relatively low 0 2 1 5e 6 m2 s 4 5 hydrochemistry and geochemistry electrical conductivity values ranged from 200 5 600 Œºs cm table 2 while nitrate concentrations ranged from 0 4 mmol l 0 240 mg l samples with high ec values and no nitrate were found towards the south and south east due to the higher reactive metal ion concentrations as indicated by the dilute nitric acid leaching experiments fig 11 groundwater in the gneissic dahomeyan structural unit contained more reactive metal ions like calcium sodium and magnesium while groundwater in the tsu was generally poor on reactive metal ions after the dilute nitric acid experiments in the tsu area at the foot of the hills in the nw ec of shallow groundwater was 207 Œºs cm fig 12 a while concentrations of most ions were low and ph was circumneutral 7 4 groundwater here is of the nacl and nahco3 type table 2 mainly as a result of prolonged dissolution of silicate minerals when going to the center of the cross section where there is built up area ec values increase to over 3000 Œºs cm while ph values drop 1 2 units to 5 5 6 5 fig 12b also alkalinity values increase from less than 0 5 mmol l to more than 1 0 mmol l in the center parts of the study area fig 12c furthermore while nitrate is absent at the fringes of the study area towards the center values increase to over 1 0 mmol l fig 12d because of the presence of nitrate in the discharging groundwater from the spring we discarded the possibility that the watershed was located nw of the spring for the entire study area toc values were generally low 0 5 mmol c table 2 without clear trend also in all cases ammonium was low or absent at the southern boundary of the study area an increase in ec ph and alkalinity occurred while nitrate values reduced to zero 5 synthesis discussion and conclusions using our multi parameter dataset a rather diverse pattern of groundwater system dynamics emerges in the dodowa area in which a number of hydrochemical processes take place our results indicate weathered material on top of tsu and dsu for the tsu composed of phyllites schists and quartzites including its weathering products we attributed 10 o m to clay 10 200 ohm m to sandy clay with quartzite rock fragments and 250 o m up to several 1000 o m to quartzite furthermore the conglomerate had an apparent resistivitiy 200 o m up to 600 o m and for the gneisses of the dsu resistivity values 200 o m up to several 1000 o m were attributed to parent gneiss while values 200 o m were attributed to saprolite above the gneiss generally speaking the thickness of the saprolite of the tsu ranged from 0 m at bh7 to more than 50 m towards the hilly northwest of dodowa fig 4 the presence of the tsu saprolite was confirmed by the drillings and was mainly composed of lateritic clays and sandy clay saprolite thicknesses varied considerably in the center of dodowa saprolite is absent and here quarzitic tsu besides gneissic dsu is exposed at the surface towards the west tsu saprolite thickness is more than 50 m and to the south 25 m or less while the dsu saprolite thickness is less than 10 m since thickness geology and resistivity values of tsu saprolite ranged considerably we inferred that the parent tsu must have been diverse as well and likely composed of softer and more weatherable phyllites and schists intercalated with less weatherable quartzitic layers quist 1976 as reported in kortatsi 2006 mentioned similar thicknesses of weathering depths of the tsu 47 m near the foothills of the akwapim togo range and decreasing to less than 6 m in the heart of the accra plains south of the study area in the tsu groundwater occurrence was mainly in the saprolite while in the dsu groundwater occurrence was mainly in a limited number of water transmitting fractures around 3 fractures per 50 m dsu results from groundwater tidal analysis illustrated that most of the study area can be considered unconfined while the northern tsu saprolite bh1 and the southern fractured gneiss of dsu bh11 form a semi confined aquifer from this it is clear that the clay layer in the vicinity of bh8 above bh8 35 and bh8 50 does not give rise to confinement as both high frequency groundwater level series we measured in bh8 boreholes are unconfined the clay layer in bh1 which had a larger thickness than at bh8 was apparently capable of partly confining groundwater transmissivities of the tsu saprolite ranged from 0 5 to 5 4e 5 m2 s and increased from bottom to top these values are less than the 5 6e 5 1 1e 3 m2 s given by wrri 1996 as reported by kortatsi 2006 specific yield values ranged from 2 to 11 and also increased from bottom to top based on the decrease in both transmissivity and specific storage in depth we concluded that the quartzite we encountered in the tsu at 30 m depth was not part of a stratiform fracture layer sfl or saprock e g vassolo et al 2019 either the sfl was not present or it must have been below drilling depth added to this is the fact that upon drilling the quartzite from 30 50 m there was no release of pressurized water which could be the case when reaching the permeable water containing sfl furthermore we think the quartzite layer in the tsu at this depth extended up gradient towards the north and may even be connected with the quartzite layer in bh1 which could explain the higher groundwater levels in bh8 50 compared to bh8 15 within the tsu saprolite roughly east west oriented we found a body of conglomerate including subrounded but also angular fragments from these observations we concluded that this is a mudflow alluvial type of deposit which either indicates the presence or vicinity of the thrust fault between tsu and dsu as is mentioned in the introduction or is related to a higher energy regime of the dodowa river in the past from a hydrogeological point of view the unit is relatively permeable t 3 7e 5 m2 s from the recorded groundwater table fluctuations which were between 1 and 2 m throughout the year and assuming unconfined conditions porosities in the range of 0 5 for dsu and 5 for tsu saprolite while neglecting horizontal flow components we estimated recharge from precipitation to be in the order of 5 10 mm year 2 4 of annual precipitation for the dsu part of the area and 50 100 mm year 6 11 of annual precipitation for the tsu saprolite part this is in the same range as but less than the 15 of annual precipitation estimated by nii consult 1998 for the accra plains as reported by kortatsi 2006 discharge of the spring in october was 20 30 l s if we assume this rate is constant for all 6 wet months per year and if we assume the spring runs dry during the 6 dry months in any year then the spring discharges around 0 4 mm3 year based on the groundwater level map most of the discharge originates from the nw area of the spring likely from the fractured tsu as part of the akwapim togo mountains or hills the boundaries of the catchment area of the spring are unknown but likely extend to the nw outside the study area as depicted in fig 1 because of the unknown spring catchment boundary we did not convert nor estimate yearly spring discharge volume to rate of groundwater outflow mm day the low concentrations of nitrate we found in the spring water indicated the presence of some waste water or manure pollution possibly originating from close by animal farming since groundwater levels did not show any form of overall rise or decline we assumed the steady state groundwater balance was square besides precipitation excess other in terms of the water balance were waste water return and leakage from the water supply mains besides spring discharge other out terms of the water balance included abstractions for domestic use and evapotranspiration the latter mainly affected groundwater close to the southern part of the study area where unpolluted brackish nacl types of groundwater were found see below based on the very low ion concentrations from the acid leaching experiments we conclude that the tsu saprolite was chemically not very reactive towards the center of the township we mapped elevated ec nitrate and alkalinity while ph values were lower because of the on site waste water disposal practices of the community we concluded that on site infiltration of waste water had occurred this not only gave rise to elevated concentrations of most ions but it also explained the relatively high nitrate concentrations with here and there traces of ammonium assuming that at least some nitrogen in waste water was present as ammonium apparently the diffusion of oxygen from the open air into the aquifer was at least equally rapid as the infiltration of waste water in order to maintain aerobic conditions in the upper waste water affected groundwater whereby ammonium was converted into nitrate thereby consuming oxygen and producing protons nitrification the latter likely caused the ph lowering in this poorly buffered groundwater although a lower ph compared to natural groundwater ph values of 7 could also be explained by a slightly acidic ph value of waste water also due to the same diffusion of oxygen since toc concentrations were in all cases low to very low mobile toc originating from the infiltrating waste water could have decayed thereby producing co2 and water which could have added to elevated bicarbonate concentrations downstream the effect of waste water infiltration ceased to exist here in both tsu and dsu groundwater was composed of unpolluted brackish nacl type of water we think this is the result of evapotranspiration in absence of the sea some 30 km away from the study area weathering of silicate minerals in either tsu saprolite or dsu gneisses produces a nacl or nahco3 type of water with slightly elevated ca and mg concentrations in case of groundwater in the dsu this water is then evapotranspired causing brackish groundwater during the process minerals will tend to precipitate out of the solution when the solubility product is exceeded kortatsi 2006 suggested halite dissolution to be responsible for the nacl type of brackish groundwaters we however are more inclined to think that halite is the end product of the evapotranspiration process when all water in solution is evapotranspired how to include these findings and insights in a water management plan in terms of groundwater reserves based on the present number of wells and measured transmissivities the tsu saprolite is a reliable source of groundwater available at very shallow depths however given the low volumes of the various terms in the water balance and the limited volumes stored any large scale development of groundwater will be difficult or even not possible groundwater can only be used in small quantities at a limited scale and preferably not for household use since the saprolite is rather vulnerable for pollution as is clear from the confinement determination using tidal analysis and the hydro chemical data groundwater in the dsu can only be obtained from fractures which are not very frequent and their transmissivities are very low also groundwater here is mostly brackish so it is not favorable to develop groundwater sources in dsu in the study area due to very thin tsu saprolite towards the south we expect that groundwater system development in the area is local and confined to the dodowa area from our study we concluded that groundwater system dynamics in our study area of only 6 km2 was remarkably varied in terms of aquifer thickness permeability confinement groundwater level response to change and hydrochemistry in the saprolite of the tsu groundwater occurrence was widespread and at shallow depths in the dsu groundwater was found in a limited number of fractures within the parent gneisses this system was potentially deeper than in case of the tsu transmissivities of tsu saprolite decreased with depth from 5 4e 5 m2 s at shallow depths to 3 5e 6 m2 s at depths of around 50 m specific yield values ranged from 2 to 11 transmissivities of the dsu were significantly lower and ranged from 0 2 to 1 2e 6 m2 s the groundwater system was predominantly unconfined therefore the system is vulnerable evidenced by the widespread on site infiltration of waste water with elevated ec alkalinity and nitrate concentrations and lower ph values downgradient towards the southern boundary of the study area the effect of waste water infiltration ceased to exist here groundwater was composed of unpolluted but brackish nacl type of water due to very thin saprolite towards the south we expect that groundwater system development in the area is local and

8369,study region this study presents the empirical observations and numerical model of fluvial discharge q used to estimate the magnitude of the continental input of the par√° river into the atlantic ocean the par√° river is a component of the amazon hydrographic network in northern brazil study focus a q box model was developed to estimate the magnitude of the continental input of the par√° river toward the atlantic ocean in the present study the box model consists of the sum of the different components that contribute to the total input of freshwater into the system and assumes a stationary condition in which the q values box model inputs feed the model with values that are constant over time new hydrological insights for the region the mean q value estimated for the par√° river was 20 946 m3 s 1 the box model indicated the araguaia tocantins hydrographic basin contributes approximately 52 of this input and the amazon basin 44 of the q estimated for the par√° river based on the historical q series it has been found that qpar√° river freshwater inputs vary seasonally in the first half of the year there is a greater contribution of water from the araguaia tocantins basin however in the second half of the year the largest contribution is from the amazon basin at 664 km3 year 1 the annual mean discharge of the par√° river is the fifth largest of the world s principal river systems keywords major rivers amazon continental shelf tropical atlantic ocean 1 introduction rivers are an important component of the integration between continental and oceanic environments the equilibrium between precipitation and evapotranspiration on land masses and other residual exchanges between bodies of water result in the discharge of continental freshwater toward the oceans the input of freshwater transported by rivers is known as the fluvial discharge represented by the q value miranda et al 2002 together the world s 10 largest fluvial systems that is the amazon brazil congo congo orinoco venezuela changjiang china brahmaputra bangladesh mississippi usa yenisey russia paran√° argentina lena russia and mekong laos rivers account for more than 40 of the total amount of fresh water transported to the oceans dai and trenberth 2002 the study of these major rivers is fundamentally important in several different scales ranging from regional to continental and even global levels this importance is related primarily to the role of rivers in primary production and the transportation of water rich in nutrients dagg et al 2004 beyond that the relationship between a local community and the river hydrological systems have spatial and temporal variability scales physical processes associated with geomorphology and climate can cause interannual changes in hydrological systems and the water cycle consequently montagna et al 2018 gouveia et al 2019 anthropic activities also can alter the hydrologic cycle in the case of the amazon region the impacts are basically related to disordered growth furniture speculation fishing activities predatory agriculture and minerals industry el robrini et al 2003 the amazon region stands out for being a sensitive environment due to the increased vulnerability associated with weak coastal management policies over the years understand these hydrological systems characteristics is important to predict strong changes in continental freshwater input as well as to investigate the variability of biological chemical and physical deposits and flows rasmussem et al 2017 the discharge of the principal rivers of northern brazil interacts with extreme tidal amplitudes within an extensive and complex network of floodplains and drainage basins the principal fluvial systems that discharge into the western tropical atlantic ocean are the orinoco amazon and par√° rivers the par√° river is a continental body of water that has no source of its own or unidirectional headwaters and is influenced by strong semidiurnal tidal currents that propagate waves within the system prestes et al 2017 the par√° river is located between three brazilian hydrographic basins i the amazon ii the araguaia tocantins and iii the basins of the northern northeastern atlantic coast of par√° ana 2013 the measurement of q is important for the planning of the management of hydrological ecological and social resources and the effects of climate patterns smith and pavelsky 2008 this value can be calculated in a number of different ways in fluvial systems such as the balance between the precipitation and evapotranspiration rates associated with the characteristics of the hydrographic basin bonetti and miranda 1997 medeiros and kjerfve 1993 in the specific case of major river systems q can be estimated by satellite remote sensing hudson and colditz 2003 roux and dartus 2006 this approach provides an excellent alternative for the estimate of the input of fresh water when monitoring stations are unavailable the box model proved to be the best approach for the estimation of q in an estuarine fluvial system one other method used to estimate q is by the area of the drainage basin and rates of surface flow evapotranspiration and precipitation which can be used to calculate the fluvial discharge bonetti and miranda 1997 medeiros and kjerfve 1993 miranda et al 2002 this approach is inviable for the par√° river however given its spatial configuration and the innumerable systems that make up the complex drainage network of the amazon basin the q value can also be estimated using satellite images alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 brakenridge et al 2005 alsdorf et al 2007 although the cloud covers typical of lower latitudes related to the itcz hamper this approach in brazil the national waters agency ana is responsible for the monitoring of a range of continental systems throughout the country and provides historical series of q values covering a number of decades which are available on its website hidroweb com br and are in the public domain the present study is based on the analysis of these historical series from which mean q values were obtained to compile a box model and estimate the q of the par√° river toward the tropical atlantic ocean box models are used in a number of analytical approaches to determine physical transportation and flow properties cessi 1994 ikeda 1997 miranda et al 2002 stommel 1961 wunsch and minster 1982 several important oceanographic questions remain unanswered however what is the order of magnitude of the freshwater input of the par√° river which of the three basins contributes most water to the river how does the q of the par√° river vary seasonally the present study aimed to resolve these questions but without considering the volume of water transported by local tidal currents the principal objective of the study is thus to understand the influence of the par√° river on the amazon continental shelf and the adjacent tropical atlantic ocean in terms of the magnitude of its q a number of previous studies lentz 1995 oltman 1968 geyer et al 1996 have focused on the input of freshwater from the discharge of the amazon river into the atlantic ocean which accounts for approximately 30 of the total discharge of the all world s rivers wisser et al 2010 up until now few studies have assessed the influence of the discharge of the par√° river into the atlantic ocean the amazon region s hydrological system is peculiar due to the intense freshwater input from the amazon and par√° rivers the estuarine plume influences various processes of the western edge of the tropical north atlantic ocean e g heat fluxes field 2007 ocean circulation coles et al 2013 barrier layer balaguru et al 2012 carbon sequestration for primary production medeiros et al 2015 according to gouveia et al 2019 the amazon river hydrological basin cycle has intensified over the last three decades generating impacts on the q magnitude directly related to precipitation rates although the present work presents a stationary q analysis the hydrology of the system is highly dynamic non stationary and related to feedback processes of the tropical north atlantic ocean this paper is organized in five sections including the introduction section 2 presents a description of the study area and the methods used to estimate the q values as well as the bivariate statistical procedures applied to the data section 3 contains the historical series of data provided by ana 2013 while section presents the results of the box model analysis together with a global comparison of the magnitude of the q of the par√° river and its seasonal variation the conclusions of the study are presented in section 5 2 methods 2 1 study area the par√° river is a component of the amazon hydrographic network in northern brazil fig 1 with approximately 350 km length and 60 km wide at its mouth this river has 25 km in the middle estuary and 10 km at its upstream the bathymetry in its mouth varies from 15 to 35 m depth however neotectonics events generated complex fault geometries maximum bathymetric values 80 m depth are related to normal and strike lip faults in the middle estuary costa et al 2002 local sedimentology is composed of sand silt and clay with the presence of extensive mangrove ecosystems on the river banks along of the entire longitudinal extension souza filho 2005 the par√° is not a river in the strict sense of the term given that it lacks its own source and unidirectional flow in its headwaters but rather it is formed by the input of a number of other fluvial systems before discharging into the atlantic ocean despite the scale of the hydrographic basin within which it is located the par√° river is actually an estuarine system rather than a fluvial system given that it is dominated by intense semidiurnal tidal currents throughout its extension prestes et al 2017 the par√° river is formed at a point known as bocas bay located at the southwestern corner of maraj√≥ island south of the breves strait fig 1 the river then flows to the east south of maraj√≥ island to its confluence with the tocantins river the par√° then veers to the northeast where it receives the input of a number of coastal tributaries before it discharges into the atlantic ocean the par√° river is influenced by three hydrographic basins the amazon basin amazon tapaj√≥s and xingu rivers the araguaia tocantins basin tocantins river and the basins of the northern northeastern atlantic coast guam√° and capim rivers tables 1 and 2 based on the categories defined by ana the study area is a tropical system with universally high precipitation rates divided into two distinct seasons related to the annual variation in q the highest levels of discharge are recorded between january and june when monthly precipitation is 200 500 mm while the lowest levels are registered between july and november when monthly precipitation is typically in the 50 200 mm range gloor et al 2015 inmet 2013 these precipitation patterns may nevertheless vary in their intensity and distribution during el ni√±o and la nin√£ events davidson et al 2012 llopart et al 2014 other physical forces such as the tidal cycle and wind patterns are not considered in the present study which focuses primarily on the development of a model for the q of the par√° river 2 2 data acquisition and processing the input for the box model a q box model was developed to estimate the magnitude of the continental input of the par√° river toward the atlantic ocean in the present study the box model consists of the sum of the different components that contribute to the total input of freshwater into the system and assumes a stationary condition in which the q values box model inputs feed the model with values that are constant over time the historical series of q values were obtained from ana 2013 for the amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam and capim rivers ver fig 1 table 1 the analysis included only rivers with q 80 m3 s 1 the historical series were used to calculate the mean monthly q values of each of the study rivers these values were used as the inputs for the box model which provided an estimate of the q output for the par√° river the par√° river is formed by three inputs q partial i part of the discharge of the amazon river which flows through the breves strait ii the total discharge of the tocantins river to the south of maraj√≥ island and iii the discharge of other coastal fluvial systems which are represented in the present study by the capim and guam√° rivers that are grouped in a single system denominated other tributaries for the purposes of the present study table 2 the total q of the amazon river q amazon was derived from the input of the amazon river at √≥bidos in the brazilian state of par√° in addition to the inputs of the tapaj√≥s and xingu rivers which discharge into the amazon river further downstream fig 1 table 2 the total input of the amazon river toward the tropical atlantic ocean is given by 3 1 q amazon q √≥bidos q xingu q tapaj√≥s based on call√®de et al 2010 and the masters theses of costa 2014 and silva 2009 the percentage of this input that reaches the par√° river through the breves strait i e the q amazon was set at 5 for the purposes of the present study the unpublished gray literature was resorted to here due to the absence of published data on this theme from this the three partial q terms shown in table 2 give q par√° river q partial which can be stated as 3 2 q par√° river q amazon 5 q tocantins q other tributaries where the term q amazon 5 represents the input of the amazon river that flows through the breves strait into bocas bay toward the par√° river fig 1 table 2 the sum of the three terms inputs provides the monthly or annual estimates of q par√° river output the ana monitoring stations table 1 are located only in systems that have unidirectional flow the amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers these continental inputs represent the q values resulting from the topographic variation found along the length of the different hydrographic basins this topographic gradient creates a unidirectional flow derived purely from the continental input which is accelerated by gravity and produces the potential energy of the system fisher 1976 knigton 1998 the box model was proposed because the par√° river does not have any unidirectional flow the estimate of the q par√° river value is also important because of the lack of published data on the magnitude of this continental input as mentioned in the introduction section the amazon region hydrological cycle depends on natural and anthropic physical processes on the main problems affecting the world s hydrological systems bl√∂schl et al 2019 highlights the spatial and temporal variability of physical processes extreme events interfaces ocean atmosphere and subsoil difficulties in acquiring data different methods and numerical modeling and the interaction of society with the natural environment all the mentioned processes produce changes in different scales which do not cover the stationary character adopted in the present work however the proposed model does not contemplate these non stationary variabilities and considers only the temporal average values of the data series these constant values support the stationary character of the q model 2 3 statistical analysis a bivariate analysis is used to determine the nature of the relationship or association between two quantitative numerical variables in the present study the variables are the mean monthly q values 12 values for january through december used to determine the values of q par√° river q amazon 5 q tocantins and q other tributaries the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated between q par√° river and each of the three other q values see eq 3 2 to verify whether they are related linearly the significance of the coefficients was assessed using a paired t test with a 5 significance level Œ± 0 05 this analysis revealed the different relationships between the q par√° river and its component inputs in addition the centralized moving average every three months was calculated to remove the effect of seasonality on q values for statistical analysis morettin and toloi 2006 statistical trend analysis mann kendall tau Œ± 0 05 was performed for the amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers time series this nonparametric test allows identifying trends in q time series statistical analyses include the time series discussion of q 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal series of the q values the historical series of the amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers are shown in fig 2 the historical series of the q values fig 2 table 3 are consistent with the values recorded in previous studies that is a mean of approximately 170 000 m3 s 1 for the amazon river at √≥bidos geyer et al 1996 masson and delecluse 2001 oltman 1968 around 12 000 m3 s 1 for the tapaj√≥s and 8000 m3 s 1 for the xingu mikhailov 2010 11 000 m3 s 1 for the tocantins river costa et al 2003 dai and trenberth 2002 and 800 m3 s 1 for the guam√° capim system freitas et al 2012 clear differences were found in the magnitudes of the q values the historical series of the amazon river is of the order of 105 m3 s 1 while the q of the tocantins tapaj√≥s and xingu rivers is of the order of 104 m3 s 1 with the other tributaries capim and guam√° being of the order of 102 m3 s 1 in the latter system the capim contributes a much greater input than the guam√° river fig 2 table 3 with the exception of the amazon river which presented a minimum q value of the order of 103 m3 s 1 in 1998 the minimum values recorded for the other rivers at given moment of the historical series were in the 101 102 m3 s 1 range table 3 the mean monthly q values fig 2 right column indicate a difference in the seasonal phases among the systems analyzed here the input of the amazon 230 000 m3 s 1 and capim 1100 m3 s 1 rivers peaked in may whereas the xingu 19 000 m3 s 1 tocantins 24 000 m3 s 1 and guam√° 190 m3 s 1 all peaked in april and the tapaj√≥s 25 000 m3 s 1 was the only river to peak in march 3 2 box model the amazon river receives a freshwater input from the tapaj√≥s and xingu rivers between the town of √≥bidos site of the monitoring station and the breves strait fig 1 table 2 the historical mean q amazon value is 189 648 m3 s 1 table 3 previous studies have highlighted a difference of 2 0 104 m3 s 1 between the magnitude de q √≥bidos and q amazon due to the input of q tapajos and q xingu call√®de et al 2010 gibbs 1967 eom et al 2017 mikhailov 2010 the inclusion of the latter values resulted in an increase of approximately 10 in the value of q √≥bidos the value of q amazon 5 derived from these calculations indicates an input of 9249 m3 s 1 into the par√° river through the breves strait table 4 the value of the first term of the box model in eq 3 2 the q tocantins value is of the same order of magnitude as q tapaj√≥s and q xingu which reinforces the need for the quantification of the input of these systems to determine q amazon 5 more reliably as described in section 2 methods the par√° river also receives the total input of the tocantins river q tocantins which according to the historical series would be an annual mean of 10 987 m3 s 1 this is the value of the second term of the box model proposed here in equation 3 2 table 4 the third and final term of eq 3 2 represents the mean freshwater input of the q other tributaries system table 4 after accumulating the input of the amazon river through the breves strait and the total input of the tocantins river the par√° river receives the contribution of these minor rivers including the guam√° and capim on the final leg of its course to the atlantic ocean the estimate of q par√° river was determined by the sum of the three terms of eq 3 2 as shown in section 2 eq 3 2 the sum of the q partial values provides an estimate of the continental input of the par√° river q par√° river as shown in table 4 the mean annual value obtained by this box model analysis was q par√° river 20 946 m3 s 1 fig 3 shows the box model annual historical means of the q of the par√° river which discharges into the tropical atlantic ocean under stationary conditions the most uncertain of the three values that compose the q value provided by the box model of the par√° river eq 3 2 is the input of the amazon river q amazon 5 call√®de et al 2010 concluded that approximately 5 of the total flow of the amazon was deflected toward the par√° river through the breves strait although few empirical data are available on the hydrodynamics of this strait in particular in relation to the intense semidiurnal tidal channels of the continental shelf beardsley et al 1995 le bars et al 2010 the magnitude of the q amazon and q tocantins values is 10 times greater than that of the third system i e q other tributaries 714 m3s 1 the influence of these minor hydrographic basins is thus greatly reduced and they provide only 4 of the input of the q par√° river table 5 by contrast the araguaia tocantins basin q tocantins provides 52 of the input and the amazon 44 despite the 10 error considered in the estimates of the q values sassi et al 2011 the mean annual value found by the box model for q par√° river indicates that the par√° river is influenced primarily by the araguaia tocantins basin under stationary conditions and based on the sum of the mean annual q inputs of the historical series the principal continental input for the par√° river is provided by the tocantins river table 4 fig 3 3 3 the q of the par√° river the magnitude of the input of the par√° river was compared with that of other major fluvial systems worldwide table 5 without considering the fact that the par√° river is a tide dominated system prestes et al 2017 that lacks a true unidirectional fluvial flow the data were compiled from dai and trenberth 2002 who presented q values in km3 year 1 and in this unit the par√° river has a q of approximately 664 km3 year 1 this places the par√° river as the world s fifth largest in terms of its q table 5 bidirectional semidiurnal currents dominate the whole of the 350 km extension of the par√° river which can be characterized as an estuarine system in which the net continental input interacts directly with the barotropic flux generates by the tidal currents prestes et al 2014 recorded current velocities in excess of 2 0 ms 1 in the par√° river with the instantaneous discharges within the estuary of this river reaching 4 0 105 m3s 1 the tidal prism is of the order of billions of cubic meters and is responsible for the transportation of enormous quantities of seawater into the par√° river modifying the magnitude of its input toward the continental shelf the omission of the volume of water transported by the semidiurnal tidal currents underestimates the continental input of the par√° river toward the ocean although the influence of tidal currents was not evaluated in the present study the value resulting from the unidirectional q flow generated by bidirectional tidal currents is denominated the transport of residual volume kjerfve 1990 miranda et al 2002 the box model presented in fig 3 is based on the historical mean q values in a stationary condition although major seasonal variation in q par√° river was also recorded over the course of the year fig 4 this plot shows the monthly means of the three inputs used in eq 3 2 and the total q par√° river for each month april was the month with the highest q value at approximately 3 8 105 m3 s 1 while the lowest value was recorded in october with a mean q of 9 0 103 m3 s 1 in general the magnitude of the continental input of the par√° river is of the order of 104 m3 s 1 even during the periods of reduced flow as observed during the second half of the year as observed in the box model q other tributaries constitutes a contribution of less than 5 to the total value of q par√° river while the relative contributions of the q tocantins and q amazon 5 vary considerably over the course of the year fig 4 when q par√° river is at its peak between december and may the mean monthly contribution of the tocantins river to the q par√° river increases to 65 when the q decreases to its lowest level between august and october by contrast the contribution of the amazon river increases to over 70 fig 4 in other words this analysis revealed that the q of the par√° river is determined during some periods by q amazon 5 and during others by q tocantins depending on the prevailing seasonal conditions which impedes the allocation of the par√° river to only one of these basins that is it is impossible to determine exactly whether the par√° river belongs exclusively to either the amazon or the tocantins basin in addition to the contributions of the amazon river through the breves strait and the tocantins river minor rivers of northeastern par√° in particular the guam√° and capim also provided some input q other tributaries albeit greatly reduced a number of other continental systems are also found along the margins of the par√° river e g the acar√° moju paracauari ponta de pedra rivers ibge 2018 these rivers were not included in the analyses however due to the lack of systematic historical data for most minor rivers given this the present study was restricted to tributaries with a mean q of over 80 m3 s 1 to exemplify the non stationarity model concept monthly discharges values were calculated from 1974 to 1988 fig 5 this period was chosen due to the ana measurements are simultaneous for all water systems used at work amazon tapajos xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers see table 1 in 1980 the monthly value was higher than the historical monthly average 3 8 105 m3 s 1 in april fig 4 with a maximum of 4 4 105 m3 s 1 in addition the minimum q par√° river between 1974 and 1988 is equal to 1 2 105 m3 s 1 unlike the lower monthly averages equal to 9 0 103 m3 s 1 in october fig 4 differences in non stationary q par√° river values can be caused by various natural processes such el ni√±o and la ni√±a phenomena influence geomorphological and climate changes and rainfall as well as anthropic actions during tidal periods semidiurnal diurnal synodical and anomalistic the volume transported on the par√° river increases due to the tidal prism prestes et al 2017 therefore the non stationary conditions that can change q par√° river values are numerous for this reason a stationary model was chosen for this analysis of continental freshwater input the box model proposed in the present study was based on the principal inputs of the par√° river that is the amazon and tocantins rivers and other minor tributaries the magnitude of the continental input of the par√° river is still poorly understood principally considering the lack of permanent monitoring stations and the complexity of the amazon basin as shown in table 5 the discharge of the par√° river is among the world s most intense continental inputs and it has a considerable influence on the continental shelf of the amazon coast and the adjacent oceanic region the results of the present study e g fig 3 permit the calibration of numerical models appropriate for the study region as well as providing important insights into the seasonal variations in the physical processes that integrate the par√° river continental shelf and the tropical atlantic ocean 3 4 the pearson coefficient r paired t test p and mann kendall tau test the comparisons of the mean q values analyzed here indicate that the amazon and tocantins rivers provide the greatest contributions to the final result of the q par√° box model the difference of one order of magnitude between these systems and q other tributaries see table 3 can also be observed in fig 4 despite these differences in the magnitude of the q values between the different components the contribution of the minor rivers q other tributaries was highly correlated with the q par√° river value over the 12 months of the year table 4 in fact all the inputs correlated significantly p 0 05 with q par√° river albeit at slightly different levels table 6 although in all three cases the correlation was relatively strong 0 67 the highest correlation r 0 97 was recorded between q par√° river and q tocantins it is important to note here that the correlation recorded for the q other tributaries values r 0 75 was higher than that r 0 67 recorded for q amazon 5 this difference does not mean that the minor rivers contributed more input to the q par√° river than the box model but rather than the seasonal variation in q par√° river is more closely related to the q tocantins and q other tributaries than the magnitude of the q input one possible explanation for this is the fact that the months with the highest q amazon 5 input are may and june while those for qother tributaries are april and may and the peak months for both the q tocantins and q par√° river are march and april similar differences were observed when the q values were reduced in the second half of the year in particular in september october and november overall then the results of the box model table 4 figs 3 and 4 indicate clearly that q tocantins is the principal source of the water in the par√° river during the second half of the year however q amazon 5 has an increased contribution in relative terms and is dominant in the q fig 4 the seasonal analysis indicates that q other tributaries r 0 75 is more closely related to q par√° river than q amazon 5 r 0 67 due in particular to the inputs during the peak and low months even so the volume contributed by q amazon 5 was many times greater the correlations nevertheless reinforce the conclusion that q tocantins provides the principal contribution to q par√° river statistical trend analysis mann kendall tau was performed for Œ± 0 05 for the time series of the fluvial systems of this work amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers the q period for each system used for trend analysis is presented in table 1 the test results showed there is a no significant trend mann kendall tau test p 0 05 Œ± 0 05 for amazon capim tapaj√≥s tocantins and xingu rivers in contrast the test showed a significant negative trend for the guam√° river mann kendall tau test p 3 0 10 8 Œ± 0 05 the results in table 7 indicates that the guam√° river has a negative trend with a slope of 0 001 the amazon river results presented here were similar to the statistical results found by gouveia et al 2019 with a positive slope of 0 13 although it was a statistically significant trend in the present study as well as a positive trend verified to the tocantins river slope 0 88 4 conclusions the analysis of the historical series of the q values was used to elaborate the box model based on the mean values recorded for each fluvial system that provides input to the par√° river the model estimated that q par√° river 20 946 m3 s 1 under stationary conditions this analysis also revealed that despite the uncertainties with regard to the contribution of the amazon river through the breves strait this river contributes 44 of the mean annual q par√° river however 52 of the input was derived from the tocantins river the other tributaries contributed the remaining 4 of the q par√° river however it was not possible to allocate the par√° river exclusively to the araguaia tocantins basin given the seasonal variation in the annual mean q values fig 4 the seasonal variation in the continental input was also investigated the q of the par√° river peaks in april with a mean of 3 8 105 m3s 1 while it reaches its low point in october at 9 0 103 m3s 1 the input of the q tocantins is predominant during the period of peak q par√° river whereas during the low period q amazon predominates exceeding 70 of the total input of q par√° river in some months in the comparison with other fluvial systems around the world the mean annual q par√° river was 664 km3 year 1 the fifth highest value for any system behind only the amazon brazil congo congo orinoco venezuela and changjiang china rivers the par√° river has a greater magnitude than many other prominent rivers such as the ganges brahmaputra bangladesh mississippi united states and yenisey russia the monthly inputs of all three inputs presented a strong and significant p 0 05 correlation with the q of the par√° river and once again the highest correlation r 0 97 was observed between q tocantins and q par√° river whereas slightly lower values were recorded for q other tributaries r 0 75 and q amazon 5 r 0 67 this reflects a closer relationship with the seasonal variation rather than the magnitude of the input there is a positive trend in the amazon and tocantins rivers q time series but they are not statistically significant in the present work being the positive trend for the guam√° river the only significant result the instantaneous bidirectional flows of the flood and ebb tides may increase the volume of water transported which would alter the order of magnitude of the q of the par√° river toward the tropical atlantic ocean the box model proposed in the present study estimated a total order of magnitude of 104 m3 s 1 for the q par√° river based on the historical mean q values this value may be underestimated however considering the flows generated by the tides this work is important for future studies since unpublished values for q par√° river are presented for the first time this information allows calibrate numerical models for the amazon systems in past studies the magnitude of q par√° river was commonly neglected and associated only with the magnitude of q for the tocantins river however this work has shown that q par√° river is about twice as high as q tocantins understand the seasonal variability of q allows the optimization of

condition in which the q values box model inputs feed the model with values that are constant over time new hydrological insights for the region the mean q value estimated for the par√° river was 20 946 m3 s 1 the box model indicated the araguaia tocantins hydrographic basin contributes approximately 52 of this input and the amazon basin 44 of the q estimated for the par√° river based on the historical q series it has been found that qpar√° river freshwater inputs vary seasonally in the first half of the year there is a greater contribution of water from the araguaia tocantins basin however in the second half of the year the largest contribution is from the amazon basin at 664 km3 year 1 the annual mean discharge of the par√° river is the fifth largest of the world s principal river systems keywords major rivers amazon continental shelf tropical atlantic ocean 1 introduction rivers are an important component of the integration between continental and oceanic environments the equilibrium between precipitation and evapotranspiration on land masses and other residual exchanges between bodies of water result in the discharge of continental freshwater toward the oceans the input of freshwater transported by rivers is known as the fluvial discharge represented by the q value miranda et al 2002 together the world s 10 largest fluvial systems that is the amazon brazil congo congo orinoco venezuela changjiang china brahmaputra bangladesh mississippi usa yenisey russia paran√° argentina lena russia and mekong laos rivers account for more than 40 of the total amount of fresh water transported to the oceans dai and trenberth 2002 the study of these major rivers is fundamentally important in several different scales ranging from regional to continental and even global levels this importance is related primarily to the role of rivers in primary production and the transportation of water rich in nutrients dagg et al 2004 beyond that the relationship between a local community and the river hydrological systems have spatial and temporal variability scales physical processes associated with geomorphology and climate can cause interannual changes in hydrological systems and the water cycle consequently montagna et al 2018 gouveia et al 2019 anthropic activities also can alter the hydrologic cycle in the case of the amazon region the impacts are basically related to disordered growth furniture speculation fishing activities predatory agriculture and minerals industry el robrini et al 2003 the amazon region stands out for being a sensitive environment due to the increased vulnerability associated with weak coastal management policies over the years understand these hydrological systems characteristics is important to predict strong changes in continental freshwater input as well as to investigate the variability of biological chemical and physical deposits and flows rasmussem et al 2017 the discharge of the principal rivers of northern brazil interacts with extreme tidal amplitudes within an extensive and complex network of floodplains and drainage basins the principal fluvial systems that discharge into the western tropical atlantic ocean are the orinoco amazon and par√° rivers the par√° river is a continental body of water that has no source of its own or unidirectional headwaters and is influenced by strong semidiurnal tidal currents that propagate waves within the system prestes et al 2017 the par√° river is located between three brazilian hydrographic basins i the amazon ii the araguaia tocantins and iii the basins of the northern northeastern atlantic coast of par√° ana 2013 the measurement of q is important for the planning of the management of hydrological ecological and social resources and the effects of climate patterns smith and pavelsky 2008 this value can be calculated in a number of different ways in fluvial systems such as the balance between the precipitation and evapotranspiration rates associated with the characteristics of the hydrographic basin bonetti and miranda 1997 medeiros and kjerfve 1993 in the specific case of major river systems q can be estimated by satellite remote sensing hudson and colditz 2003 roux and dartus 2006 this approach provides an excellent alternative for the estimate of the input of fresh water when monitoring stations are unavailable the box model proved to be the best approach for the estimation of q in an estuarine fluvial system one other method used to estimate q is by the area of the drainage basin and rates of surface flow evapotranspiration and precipitation which can be used to calculate the fluvial discharge bonetti and miranda 1997 medeiros and kjerfve 1993 miranda et al 2002 this approach is inviable for the par√° river however given its spatial configuration and the innumerable systems that make up the complex drainage network of the amazon basin the q value can also be estimated using satellite images alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 brakenridge et al 2005 alsdorf et al 2007 although the cloud covers typical of lower latitudes related to the itcz hamper this approach in brazil the national waters agency ana is responsible for the monitoring of a range of continental systems throughout the country and provides historical series of q values covering a number of decades which are available on its website hidroweb com br and are in the public domain the present study is based on the analysis of these historical series from which mean q values were obtained to compile a box model and estimate the q of the par√° river toward the tropical atlantic ocean box models are used in a number of analytical approaches to determine physical transportation and flow properties cessi 1994 ikeda 1997 miranda et al 2002 stommel 1961 wunsch and minster 1982 several important oceanographic questions remain unanswered however what is the order of magnitude of the freshwater input of the par√° river which of the three basins contributes most water to the river how does the q of the par√° river vary seasonally the present study aimed to resolve these questions but without considering the volume of water transported by local tidal currents the principal objective of the study is thus to understand the influence of the par√° river on the amazon continental shelf and the adjacent tropical atlantic ocean in terms of the magnitude of its q a number of previous studies lentz 1995 oltman 1968 geyer et al 1996 have focused on the input of freshwater from the discharge of the amazon river into the atlantic ocean which accounts for approximately 30 of the total discharge of the all world s rivers wisser et al 2010 up until now few studies have assessed the influence of the discharge of the par√° river into the atlantic ocean the amazon region s hydrological system is peculiar due to the intense freshwater input from the amazon and par√° rivers the estuarine plume

sequestration for primary production medeiros et al 2015 according to gouveia et al 2019 the amazon river hydrological basin cycle has intensified over the last three decades generating impacts on the q magnitude directly related to precipitation rates although the present work presents a stationary q analysis the hydrology of the system is highly dynamic non stationary and related to feedback processes of the tropical north atlantic ocean this paper is organized in five sections including the introduction section 2 presents a description of the study area and the methods used to estimate the q values as well as the bivariate statistical procedures applied to the data section 3 contains the historical series of data provided by ana 2013 while section presents the results of the box model analysis together with a global comparison of the magnitude of the q of the par√° river and its seasonal variation the conclusions of the study are presented in section 5 2 methods 2 1 study area the par√° river is a component of the amazon hydrographic network in northern brazil fig 1 with approximately 350 km length and 60 km wide at its mouth this river has 25 km in the middle estuary and 10 km at its upstream the bathymetry in its mouth varies from 15 to 35 m depth however neotectonics events generated complex fault geometries maximum bathymetric values 80 m depth are related to normal and strike lip faults in the middle estuary costa et al 2002 local sedimentology is composed of sand silt and clay with the presence of extensive mangrove ecosystems on the river banks along of the entire longitudinal extension souza filho 2005 the par√° is not a river in the strict sense of the term given that it lacks its own source and unidirectional flow in its headwaters but rather it is formed by the input of a number of other fluvial systems before discharging into the atlantic ocean despite the scale of the hydrographic basin within which it is located the par√° river is actually an estuarine system rather than a fluvial system given that it is dominated by intense semidiurnal tidal currents throughout its extension prestes et al 2017 the par√° river is formed at a point known as bocas bay located at the southwestern corner of maraj√≥ island south of the breves strait fig 1 the river then flows to the east south of maraj√≥ island to its confluence with the tocantins river the par√° then veers to the northeast where it receives the input of a number of coastal tributaries before it discharges into the atlantic ocean the par√° river is influenced by three hydrographic basins the amazon basin amazon tapaj√≥s and xingu rivers the araguaia tocantins basin tocantins river and the basins of the northern northeastern atlantic coast guam√° and capim rivers tables 1 and 2 based on the categories defined by ana the study area is a tropical system with universally high precipitation rates divided into two distinct seasons related to the annual variation in q the highest levels of discharge are recorded between january and june when monthly precipitation is 200 500 mm while the lowest levels are registered between july and november when monthly precipitation is typically in the 50 200 mm range gloor et al 2015 inmet 2013 these precipitation patterns may nevertheless vary in their intensity and distribution during el ni√±o and la nin√£ events davidson et al 2012 llopart et al 2014 other physical forces such as the tidal cycle and wind patterns are not considered in the present study which focuses primarily on the development of a model for the q of the par√° river 2 2 data acquisition and processing the input for the box model a q box model was developed to estimate the magnitude of the continental input of the par√° river toward the atlantic ocean in the present study the box model consists of the sum of the different components that contribute to the total input of freshwater into the system and assumes a stationary condition in which the q values box model inputs feed the model with values that are constant over time the historical series of q values were obtained from ana 2013 for the amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam and capim rivers ver fig 1 table 1 the analysis included only rivers with q 80 m3 s 1 the historical series were used to calculate the mean monthly q values of each of the study rivers these values were used as the inputs for the box model which provided an estimate of the q output for the par√° river the par√° river is formed by three inputs q partial i part of the discharge of the amazon river which flows through the breves strait ii the total discharge of the tocantins river to the south of maraj√≥ island and iii the discharge of other coastal fluvial systems which are represented in the present study by the capim and guam√° rivers that are grouped in a single system denominated other tributaries for the purposes of the present study table 2 the total q of the amazon river q amazon was derived from the input of the amazon river at √≥bidos in the brazilian state of par√° in addition to the inputs of the tapaj√≥s and xingu rivers which discharge into the amazon river further downstream fig 1 table 2 the total input of the amazon river toward the tropical atlantic ocean is given by 3 1 q amazon q √≥bidos q xingu q tapaj√≥s based on call√®de et al 2010 and the masters theses of costa 2014 and silva 2009 the percentage of this input that reaches the par√° river through the breves strait i e the q amazon was set at 5 for the purposes of the present study the unpublished gray literature was resorted to here due to the absence of published data on this theme from this the three partial q terms shown in table 2 give q par√° river q partial which can be stated as 3 2 q par√° river q amazon 5 q tocantins q other tributaries where the term q amazon 5 represents the input of the amazon river that flows through the breves strait into bocas bay toward the par√° river fig 1 table 2 the sum of the three terms inputs provides the monthly or annual estimates of q par√° river output the ana monitoring stations table 1 are located only in systems that have unidirectional flow the amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers these continental inputs represent the q values resulting from the topographic variation found along the length of the different hydrographic basins this topographic gradient creates a unidirectional flow derived purely from the continental input which is accelerated by gravity and produces the potential energy of the system fisher 1976 knigton 1998 the box model was proposed because the par√° river does not have any unidirectional flow the estimate of the q par√° river value is also important because of the lack of published data on the magnitude of this continental input as mentioned in the introduction section the amazon region hydrological cycle depends on natural and anthropic physical processes on the main problems affecting the world s hydrological systems bl√∂schl et al 2019 highlights the spatial and temporal variability of physical processes extreme events interfaces ocean atmosphere and subsoil difficulties in acquiring data different methods and numerical modeling and the interaction of society with the natural environment all the mentioned processes produce changes in different scales which do not cover the stationary character adopted in the present work however the proposed model does not contemplate these non stationary variabilities and considers only the temporal average values of the data series these constant values support the stationary character of the q model 2 3 statistical analysis a bivariate analysis is used to determine the nature of the relationship or association between two quantitative numerical variables in the present study the variables are the mean monthly q values 12 values for january through december used to determine the values of q par√° river q amazon 5 q tocantins and q other tributaries the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated between q par√° river and each of the three other q values see eq 3 2 to verify whether they are related linearly the significance of the coefficients was assessed using a paired t test with a 5 significance level Œ± 0 05 this analysis revealed the different relationships between the q par√° river and its component inputs in addition the centralized moving average every three months was calculated to remove the effect of seasonality on q values for statistical analysis morettin and toloi 2006 statistical trend analysis mann kendall tau Œ± 0 05 was performed for the amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers time series this nonparametric test allows identifying trends in q time series statistical analyses include the time series discussion of q 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal series of the q values the historical series of the amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers are shown in fig 2 the historical series of the q values fig 2 table 3 are consistent with the values recorded in previous studies that is a mean of approximately 170 000 m3 s 1 for the amazon river at √≥bidos geyer et al 1996 masson and delecluse 2001 oltman 1968 around 12 000 m3 s 1 for the tapaj√≥s and 8000 m3 s 1 for the xingu mikhailov 2010 11 000 m3 s 1 for the tocantins river costa et al 2003 dai and trenberth 2002 and 800 m3 s 1 for the guam√° capim system freitas et al 2012 clear differences were found in the magnitudes of the q values the historical series of the amazon river is of the order of 105 m3 s 1 while the q of the tocantins tapaj√≥s and xingu rivers is of the order of 104 m3 s 1 with the other tributaries capim and guam√° being of the order of 102 m3 s 1 in the latter system the capim contributes a much greater input than the guam√° river fig 2 table 3 with the exception of the amazon river which presented a minimum q value of the order of 103 m3 s 1 in 1998 the minimum values recorded for the other rivers at given moment of the historical series were in the 101 102 m3 s 1 range table 3 the mean monthly q values fig 2 right column indicate a difference in the seasonal phases among the systems analyzed here the input of the amazon 230 000 m3 s 1 and capim 1100 m3 s 1 rivers peaked in may whereas the xingu 19 000 m3 s 1 tocantins 24 000 m3 s 1 and guam√° 190 m3 s 1 all peaked in april and the tapaj√≥s 25 000 m3 s 1 was the only river to peak in march 3 2 box model the amazon river receives a freshwater input from the tapaj√≥s and xingu rivers between the town of √≥bidos site of the monitoring station and the breves strait fig 1 table 2 the historical mean q amazon value is 189 648 m3 s 1 table 3 previous studies have highlighted a difference of 2 0 104 m3 s 1 between the magnitude de q √≥bidos and q amazon due to the input of q tapajos and q xingu call√®de et al 2010 gibbs 1967 eom et al 2017 mikhailov 2010 the inclusion of the latter values resulted in an increase of approximately 10 in the value of q √≥bidos the value of q amazon 5 derived from these calculations indicates an input of 9249 m3 s 1 into the par√° river through the breves strait table 4 the value of the first term of the box model in eq 3 2 the q tocantins value is of the same order of magnitude as q tapaj√≥s and q xingu which reinforces the need for the quantification of the input of these systems to determine q amazon 5 more reliably as described in section 2 methods the par√° river also receives the total input of the tocantins river q tocantins which according to the historical series would be an annual mean of 10 987 m3 s 1 this is the value of the second term of the box model proposed here in equation 3 2 table 4 the third and final term of eq 3 2 represents the mean freshwater input of the q other tributaries system table 4 after accumulating the input of the amazon river through the breves strait and the total input of the tocantins river the par√° river receives the contribution of these minor rivers including the guam√° and capim on the final leg of its course to the atlantic ocean the estimate of q par√° river was determined by the sum of the three terms of eq 3 2 as shown in section 2 eq 3 2 the sum of the q partial values provides an estimate of the continental input of the par√° river q par√° river as shown in table 4 the mean annual value obtained by this box model analysis was q par√° river 20 946 m3 s 1 fig 3 shows the box model annual historical means of the q of the par√° river which discharges into the tropical atlantic ocean under stationary conditions the most uncertain of the three values that compose the q value provided by the box model of the par√° river eq 3 2 is the input of the amazon river q amazon 5 call√®de et al 2010 concluded that approximately 5 of the total flow of the amazon was deflected toward the par√° river through the breves strait although few empirical data are available on the hydrodynamics of this strait in particular in relation to the intense semidiurnal tidal channels of the continental shelf beardsley et al 1995 le bars et al 2010 the magnitude of the q amazon and q tocantins values is 10 times greater than that of the third system i e q other tributaries 714 m3s 1 the influence of these minor hydrographic basins is thus greatly reduced and they provide only 4 of the input of the q par√° river table 5 by contrast the araguaia tocantins basin q tocantins provides 52 of the input and the amazon 44 despite the 10 error considered in the estimates of the q values sassi et al 2011 the mean annual value found by the box model for q par√° river indicates that the par√° river is influenced primarily by the araguaia tocantins basin under stationary conditions and based on the sum of the mean annual q inputs of the historical series the principal continental input for the par√° river is provided by the tocantins river table 4 fig 3 3 3 the q of the par√° river the magnitude of the input of the par√° river was compared with that of other major fluvial systems worldwide table 5 without considering the fact that the par√° river is a tide dominated system prestes et al 2017 that lacks a true unidirectional fluvial flow the data were compiled from dai and trenberth 2002 who presented q values in km3 year 1 and in this unit the par√° river has a q of approximately 664 km3 year 1 this places the par√° river as the world s fifth largest in terms of its q table 5 bidirectional semidiurnal currents dominate the whole of the 350 km extension of the par√° river which can be characterized as an estuarine system in which the net continental input interacts directly with the barotropic flux generates by the tidal currents prestes et al 2014 recorded current velocities in excess of 2 0 ms 1 in the par√° river with the instantaneous discharges within the estuary of this river reaching 4 0 105 m3s 1 the tidal prism is of the order of billions of cubic meters and is responsible for the transportation of enormous quantities of seawater into the par√° river modifying the magnitude of its input toward the continental shelf the omission of the volume of water transported by the semidiurnal tidal currents underestimates the continental input of the par√° river toward the ocean although the influence of tidal currents was not evaluated in the present study the value resulting from the unidirectional q flow generated by bidirectional tidal currents is denominated the transport of residual volume kjerfve 1990 miranda et al 2002 the box model presented in fig 3 is based on the historical mean q values in a stationary condition although major seasonal variation in q par√° river was also recorded over the course of the year fig 4 this plot shows the monthly means of the three inputs used in eq 3 2 and the total q par√° river for each month april was the month with the highest q value at approximately 3 8 105 m3 s 1 while the lowest value was recorded in october with a mean q of 9 0 103 m3 s 1 in general the magnitude of the continental input of the par√° river is of the order of 104 m3 s 1 even during the periods of reduced flow as observed during the second half of the year as observed in the box model q other tributaries constitutes a contribution of less than 5 to the total value of q par√° river while the relative contributions of the q tocantins and q amazon 5 vary considerably over the course of the year fig 4 when q par√° river is at its peak between december and may the mean monthly contribution of the tocantins river to the q par√° river increases to 65 when the q decreases to its lowest level between august and october by contrast the contribution of the amazon river increases to over 70 fig 4 in other words this analysis revealed that the q of the par√° river is determined during some periods by q amazon 5 and during others by q tocantins depending on the prevailing seasonal conditions which impedes the allocation of the par√° river to only one of these basins that is it is impossible to determine exactly whether the par√° river belongs exclusively to either the amazon or the tocantins basin in addition to the contributions of the amazon river through the breves strait and the tocantins river minor rivers of northeastern par√° in particular the guam√° and capim also provided some input q other tributaries albeit greatly reduced a number of other continental systems are also found along the margins of the par√° river e g the acar√° moju paracauari ponta de pedra rivers ibge 2018 these rivers were not included in the analyses however due to the lack of systematic historical data for most minor rivers given this the present study was restricted to tributaries with a mean q of over 80 m3 s 1 to exemplify the non stationarity model concept monthly discharges values were calculated from 1974 to 1988 fig 5 this period was chosen due to the ana measurements are simultaneous for all water systems used at work amazon tapajos xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers see table 1 in 1980 the monthly value was higher than the historical monthly average 3 8 105 m3 s 1 in april fig 4 with a maximum of 4 4 105 m3 s 1 in addition the minimum q par√° river between 1974 and 1988 is equal to 1 2 105 m3 s 1 unlike the lower monthly averages equal to 9 0 103 m3 s 1 in october fig 4 differences in non stationary q par√° river values can be caused by various natural processes such el ni√±o and la ni√±a phenomena influence geomorphological and climate changes and rainfall as well as anthropic actions during tidal periods semidiurnal diurnal synodical and anomalistic the volume transported on the par√° river increases due to the tidal prism prestes et al 2017 therefore the non stationary conditions that can change q par√° river values are numerous for this reason a stationary model was chosen for this analysis of continental freshwater input the box model proposed in the present study was based on the principal inputs of the par√° river that is the amazon and tocantins rivers and other minor tributaries the magnitude of the continental input of the par√° river is still poorly understood principally considering the lack of permanent monitoring stations and the complexity of the amazon basin as shown in table 5 the discharge of the par√° river is among the world s most intense continental inputs and it has a considerable influence on the continental shelf of the amazon coast and the adjacent oceanic region the results of the present study e g fig 3 permit the calibration of numerical models appropriate for the study region as well as providing important insights into the seasonal variations in the physical processes that integrate the par√° river continental shelf and the tropical atlantic ocean 3 4 the pearson coefficient r paired t test p and mann kendall tau test the comparisons of the mean q values analyzed here indicate that the amazon and tocantins rivers provide the greatest contributions to the final result of the q par√° box model the difference of one order of magnitude between these systems and q other tributaries see table 3 can also be observed in fig 4 despite these differences in the magnitude of the q values between the different components the contribution of the minor rivers q other tributaries was highly correlated with the q par√° river value over the 12 months of the year table 4 in fact all the inputs correlated significantly p 0 05 with q par√° river albeit at slightly different levels table 6 although in all three cases the correlation was relatively strong 0 67 the highest correlation r 0 97 was recorded between q par√° river and q tocantins it is important to note here that the correlation recorded for the q other tributaries values r 0 75 was higher than that r 0 67 recorded for q amazon 5 this difference does not mean that the minor rivers contributed more input to the q par√° river than the box model but rather than the seasonal variation in q par√° river is more closely related to the q tocantins and q other tributaries than the magnitude of the q input one possible explanation for this is the fact that the months with the highest q amazon 5 input are may and june while those for qother tributaries are april and may and the peak months for both the q tocantins and q par√° river are march and april similar differences were observed when the q values were reduced in the second half of the year in particular in september october and november overall then the results of the box model table 4 figs 3 and 4 indicate clearly that q tocantins is the principal source of the water in the par√° river during the second half of the year however q amazon 5 has an increased contribution in relative terms and is dominant in the q fig 4 the seasonal analysis indicates that q other tributaries r 0 75 is more closely related to q par√° river than q amazon 5 r 0 67 due in particular to the inputs during the peak and low months even so the volume contributed by q amazon 5 was many times greater the correlations nevertheless reinforce the conclusion that q tocantins provides the principal contribution to q par√° river statistical trend analysis mann kendall tau was performed for Œ± 0 05 for the time series of the fluvial systems of this work amazon tapaj√≥s xingu tocantins guam√° and capim rivers the q period for each system used for trend analysis is presented in table 1 the test results showed there is a no significant trend mann kendall tau test p 0 05 Œ± 0 05 for amazon capim tapaj√≥s tocantins and xingu rivers in contrast the test showed a significant negative trend for the guam√° river mann kendall tau test p 3 0 10 8 Œ± 0 05 the results in table 7 indicates that the guam√° river has a negative trend with a slope of 0 001 the amazon river results presented here were similar to the statistical results found by gouveia et al 2019 with a positive slope of 0 13 although it was a statistically significant trend in the present study as well as a positive trend verified to the tocantins river slope 0 88 4 conclusions the analysis of the historical series of the q values was used to elaborate the box model based on the mean values recorded for each fluvial system that provides input to the par√° river the model estimated that q par√° river 20 946 m3 s 1 under stationary conditions this analysis also revealed that despite the uncertainties with regard to the contribution of the amazon river through the breves strait this river contributes 44 of the mean annual q par√° river however 52 of the input was derived from the tocantins river the other tributaries contributed the remaining 4 of the q par√° river however it was not possible to allocate the par√° river exclusively to the araguaia tocantins basin given the seasonal variation in the annual mean q values fig 4 the seasonal variation in the continental input was also investigated the q of the par√° river peaks in april with a mean of 3 8 105 m3s 1 while it reaches its low point in october at 9 0 103 m3s 1 the input of the q tocantins is predominant during the period of peak q par√° river whereas during the low period q amazon predominates exceeding 70 of the total input of q par√° river in some months in the comparison with other fluvial systems around the world the mean annual q par√° river was 664 km3 year 1 the fifth highest value for any system behind only the amazon brazil congo congo orinoco venezuela and changjiang china rivers the par√° river has a greater magnitude than many other prominent rivers such as the ganges brahmaputra bangladesh mississippi united states and yenisey russia the monthly inputs of all three inputs presented a strong and significant p 0 05 correlation with the q of the par√° river and once again the highest correlation r 0 97 was observed between q tocantins and q par√° river whereas slightly lower values were recorded for q other tributaries r 0 75 and q amazon 5 r 0 67 this reflects a closer relationship with the seasonal variation rather than the magnitude of the input there is a positive trend in the amazon and tocantins rivers q time series but they are not statistically significant in the present work being the positive trend for the guam√° river the only significant result the instantaneous bidirectional flows of the flood and ebb tides may increase the volume of water transported which would alter the order of magnitude of the q of the par√° river toward the tropical atlantic ocean the box model proposed in the present study estimated a total order of magnitude of 104 m3 s 1 for the q par√° river based on the historical mean q values this value may be underestimated however considering the flows generated by the tides this work is important for future studies since unpublished values for q par√° river are presented for the first time this information allows calibrate numerical models for the amazon systems in past studies the magnitude of q par√° river was commonly neglected and associated only with the magnitude of q for the tocantins river however this work has shown that q par√° river is about twice as high as q tocantins understand the seasonal variability of q allows the optimization of
