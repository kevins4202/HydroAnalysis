320,traditional probabilistic methods for the simulation of advection diffusion equations ades often overlook the entropic contribution of the discretization e g the number of particles within associated numerical methods many times the gain in accuracy of a highly discretized numerical model is outweighed by its associated computational costs or the noise within the data we address the question of how many particles are needed in a simulation to best approximate and estimate parameters in one dimensional advective diffusive transport to do so we use the well known akaike information criterion aic and a recently developed correction called the computational information criterion comic to guide the model selection process random walk and mass transfer particle tracking methods are employed to solve the model equations at various levels of discretization numerical results demonstrate that the comic provides an optimal number of particles that can describe a more efficient model in terms of parameter estimation and model prediction compared to the model selected by the aic even when the data is sparse or noisy the sampling volume is not uniform throughout the physical domain or the error distribution of the data is non iid gaussian keywords computational information criterion lagrangian modeling particle methods diffusion reaction equation non gaussian error distribution 1 introduction numerical methods of all sorts are used to approximate the solutions of various model equations in hydrology the independent variables in these models are discretized and model coefficients are populated so as to faithfully reproduce some set of measured dependent variables i e data of course both the model solution and the measured data will contain errors therefore a perfect match of model to data is not necessarily desired in fact a perfect match will most often reduce the ability of the model to predict new sets of data because the model is overfit to a single realization of noise see the excellent overview by konishi and kitagawa 2008 the bias between a model that is overfit and an underlying true model was classically addressed by akaike akaike 1974 by considering approximate measures of the entropy of the probability distributions associated with the likelihood that data arises from a specific candidate model in short these measures introduce an entropic penalty to maximum likelihood estimates of goodness of fit when the number of adjustable parameters or coefficients increases in a similar fashion the computational entropy of a model is a bias against its fitness and needs to be accounted for when using a model in a predictive mode for a few examples consider first a particle tracking model of contaminant transport it is often visually pleasing to use a large number of particles in order to obtain a smooth i e low concentration variance histogram for comparison with data however if the noise in the data far exceeds the noise in the histogram then the large number of particles is superfluous from a model prediction perspective indeed the model smoothness is not implied by the data and should not be included in a prediction in addition if the model is used repetitively in a parameter estimation procedure then these extra calculations may also become tangibly burdensome another example is stochastic monte carlo modeling of groundwater flow using an eulerian e g finite difference simulator oftentimes the spatial and temporal discretizations are thought to be a free modeling choice and random realizations of hydraulic conductivity are generated yielding models with arbitrary degrees of freedom subsequently the models are weighted in relation to the goodness of fit e g beven and binley 1992 poeter and anderson 2005 ye et al 2004 but one must ask whether simpler models in terms of both discretization and parameterization should be elevated because of their computational simplicity recently benson et al 2020 showed that a computational entropy penalty called the computational information criterion or comic can be easily used to address this issue for simple systems i e those with constant discretization or particle numbers but it has yet to be shown that those results can be generalized to more realistic modeling scenarios here we show that measures of computational entropy penalty may be extended to less ideal cases in the next section we will review both the comic and the advection dispersion mixed hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equation pde model of interest and then discuss associated lagrangian numerical methods sections 3 and 4 are devoted to understanding the effects of sparse and non uniformly spaced data sets respectively on the information criterion and subsequent parameter estimation next we reformulate the comic in section 5 to account for a non uniform discretization volume and demonstrate its equivalence in terms of particle number selection with the comic derived from a uniform sampling volume in section 6 we derive a more general version of the comic for non gaussian errors and non uniform error variance and test it on noisy data sets conclusions are discussed and summarized in the final section 2 model and methods to enable a complete analysis we use an equation that does not require a numerical solution i e an analytical solution is readily available this restriction is not required the simplest case of the one dimensional constant coefficient advection diffusion equation ade is given by 1 c t v c x d 2 c x 2 where c x t is the solution to the pde v is the velocity and d is the diffusion coefficient as we are interested in particle methods we will restrict our attention to the initial condition c x 0 δ x 0 so that c x t is a probability density function pdf in practice the solution to the pde is approximated by the numerical method c n x t which is a function of a discretization parameter n representing the number of particles in a particle method or nodes in a finite difference approximation the choice of n is arbitrary and we seek a systematic way to choose this modeling parameter the newly developed comic may be used to select models amongst these different levels of discretization benson et al 2020 this criterion is a extension of akaike s an information criterion aic in which there is a penalization of the usage of more information in the form of adjustable parameters to describe the model for completeness we recall that the aic is defined by 2 aic 2 ln l θ 2 p where l θ is the likelihood function evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimate for the unknown parameters θ and p is the number of parameters for a computational model the number of nodes or particles contributes to the entropy and must be accounted for when comparing model predictive fitness in short the kullback and leibler 1951 kullback 1968 relative entropy for a discretized model contributes an extra term to the aic and the comic takes the form 3 comic aic c x t ln δ v x d x where δ v x is the sampling volume here given by the spacing between the particles or nodes in the case that δ v x ω n is constant where ω represents the length of the spatial domain then the comic will merely reduce to 4 comic aic ln n up to a constant it is this quantity that should be minimized in order to identify the best available predictive model konishi and kitagawa 2008 benson et al 2020 for this study we use two lagrangian methods random walk particle tracking rwpt and mass transfer particle tracking mtpt both methods are described in detail elsewhere labolle et al 1996 salamon et al 2006 benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2018 so we only summarize here in its simplest form the rwpt method places a number of particles n at the release position x 0 each with constant mass 1 n at every time step of duration δ t each particle moves with mean v δ t and random deviation 2 d δ t ξ where ξ n 0 1 is a standard normal random variable at any desired time bins of size δ x i centered at points x i are constructed and the particle count n i in each bin is converted to concentration by c n x i t n i n δ x i contrastingly the mtpt method typically allows a portion of the dispersion to be performed by random walks as above and the remaining portion is performed by mass transfer between particles benson et al 2019 2020 sole mari et al 2020 herrera et al 2009 engdahl et al 2017 schmidt et al 2019 the mass transfer between any and all particles is governed by the equation 5 m i t δ t m i t i 1 n m i t m j t w i j where for each particle pair denoted i j 6 w i j 1 4 π d δ t exp s i j 2 4 d δ t ρ i j is the normalized kernel that determines the weight of mass transfer between particles i and j benson and bolster 2016 ρ i j is a normalizing constant that ensures conservation of mass and is typically taken to be the particle density sole mari et al 2019 schmidt et al 2020 and s i j is the distance between particles i and j we note that the choice of the gaussian kernel s bandwidth is a free parameter in this case we choose it to be 2 d δ t making w a normalized version of the fundamental solution to the diffusion equation and this is equivalent to choosing β 1 within the convention of sole mari et al 2019 because the particles continually change mass they are typically pre distributed throughout the domain with zero mass one particle at the release point is given unit mass for this study when we employ an mtpt method all dispersion is modeled by mass transfer i e the particles move only by their mean velocity with no random motion in contrast to the rwpt simulations that only simulate dispersion via random walk with no mass transfer in subsequent sections we perform a variety of numerical simulations using the comic to select the optimal number of particles in a model and perform parameter estimation all numerical simulations were conducted in matlab using a desktop computer with a 3 5 ghz intel core i7 processor and 16 gb of ram the code used to generate the results in this section is available at https github com nhatthanhtran entropy2020 tran 2020b 3 sparsity of data one problem that may arise when collecting data is a limited number of accessible locations the sparsity of data could change the number of particles needed to fit a given data set and subsequently predict others we presume that this will also affect the optimal number of particles predicted by the comic thus instead of assuming a large collection of data e g 30 points we will also consider relatively small data sets 10 points within the domain to assess the degree to which parameter estimates are affected by less data and to what extent the optimal number of particles changes in order to achieve more precise estimates because we are relying on smaller collections of data modification to the aic is necessary cavanaugh 1997 this corrected fitness metric is often denoted as the aicc and defined by hurvich and tsai 1989 7 aicc aic 2 p 2 2 p k p 1 where k is the number of data points and p is the number of parameters in the model this leads to the obvious modification of the comic with δ v ω n as 8 comicc aicc ln n such a correction is relevant when we are attempting to compare different models with various numbers of data points and parameters simulations were conducted by setting the final time t 1 with d 1 v 0 i e no adjustable model parameters and selecting k 10 30 or 200 sample data points c 1 c k from exact values of the analytic solution of the ade 1 on the interval ω 5 5 with uniform spacing we calculate the aicc and comicc with different particle numbers for both the random walk and mass transfer methods for the former the optimal number of particles as given by the comicc appears to increase for the sparse k 10 data case to more than n 10 4 3 20 000 particles fig 1 a on the other hand the mtpt simulations appear relatively stable in terms of their comic fitness with an optimal number of particles around n 3 000 fig 1b we now use these results to fix the comic optimal number of particles in simulations 20 000 for rwpt and 3 000 for mtpt that now seek to estimate the parameters within the ade we choose data points from the analytic solution using v d 1 and use matlab s built in fminsearch function to minimize the aic with initial guesses for both coefficients of 0 5 because the particles do not move in the mtpt algorithm the solutions are the same if run multiple times i e non stochastic results for 30 data points the estimated values of d and v in the mtpt are within 10 6 of their true value 1 on the other hand the rwpt method gives a different result for each realization because of the random walks so we show a box whisker plot for those results in fig 2 for even fewer data points say k 6 the random walk method requires significantly more particles to achieve a sufficient balance between goodness of fit and computational complexity the qualitative behavior and shape of the aic and comic for differing particle numbers are similar to fig 1 and hence are not shown the mass transfer method displays similar behavior to other simulations the comic optimal number of particles occurs at n comic 3 000 and the estimated values of d and v are both within 10 6 of their true value of 1 hence the mtpt is significantly more robust with respect to the size of the data finally we briefly mention that simulations were performed for every chosen particle number in which parameter values were first estimated and then used to compute the fitness metric again the convex shape of the aic and comic for the rwpt method were nearly identical to fig 1 though the new optimal number of particles implied by the comic for the mtpt is n comic 500 one reason for this decrease in optimal particle number is that the mtpt estimates are very close to the exact solution so that any noise in the parameter estimation dominates the overall error fig 3 displays the fitness metrics from mtpt simulations with 30 data points using this new optimal particle number we estimated the values of d and v to be within 10 5 of their true values and these are similar to the parameter estimates obtained using 3 000 particles 4 non uniformly spaced data another issue that may arise under less ideal data collection circumstances is that observations from a field site may not be constrained to a certain grid meaning that the data may not exist at uniformly spaced gridpoints therefore we examine the effects of such spatial heterogeneity on the comic and elucidate how this will affect parameter estimation to generate non uniform data we randomly select data points within the domain of interest more specifically we perform simulations for k 10 and k 30 data points with d 1 v 1 x 0 0 and t 1 additionally the numerical spacing δ v 10 n remains constant calculations of the comic for random data display similar results to the case of equally spaced data so we will use the optimal number of particles from the previous section as well for the rwpt method we perform simulations with 5 000 particles for 30 data points and 20 000 particles for 10 data points for the mtpt method both simulations use 3 000 particles the initial guess for both parameters is 0 5 within all simulations due to the added randomness in the spacing of the data we might anticipate that the parameter estimates would vary more than in the case of uniformly spaced data however the results for these random walk parameter estimation simulations are similar in both the magnitude and the variability of the estimates of both d and v fig 2 for the mtpt method a simulation with 30 data points yields estimates of d and v within 10 5 of their true values similarly a simulation with 10 data points provides estimates of d and v within 10 4 of their true values from these simulations we conclude that the comic provides a useful and informative guide for the choice of particle number and parameter estimation even when the data is not uniformly spaced next we will consider alterations to the comic in order to address non constant sampling volumes 5 non uniform numerical discretization volume in the original calculation of the comic the spatial volume δ v x along which the solution is calculated is assumed to be a constant and this results in eq 4 representing the computational fitness metric however in performing certain simulations this assumption may not hold as either the binning of rwpt particles or positions of mtpt particles may not be evenly distributed throughout the physical domain in contrast to the previous section this issue only arises due to the computational method rather than the collected data in such a case δ v x will vary with x and the calculation of the comic must instead use eq 3 one immediate drawback from this formulation is that the value of the true concentration c x t at any point is unknown still the numerical approximation c n x t can be used to estimate this function within the comic which becomes 9 comic aic c n x t ln δ v x d x in this direction we perform mtpt simulations in which the particles are initially placed randomly within the domain and the random spacing between particles will determine the sampling volume δ v x at each of the n particle locations this is performed with varying particle numbers and the resulting comic of eq 9 is computed for each simulation once again using k 30 data points generated from the analytic solution of the ade to account for the randomness in the initial particle spacing we compute the ensemble average of 30 realizations fig 4 from these simulations two key observations become apparent 1 the optimal number of mtpt particles given by the comic is 18 000 which is much larger than the 3 000 particles predicted by simulations with constant δ v see fig 1b this can be explained by the the randomness of the particle spacing for instance schmidt et al 2018 show that the mtpt algorithm incurs increased error for randomly spaced immobile particles because of mass transfer gaps in areas of sparsely distributed particles the fitness of the method drops sharply compared to the uniformly spaced scenario fig 1 especially when the number of particles becomes small this is clearly demonstrated by the aic in fig 4 as this curve possesses a large negative slope between 100 and 18 000 particles and only plateaus after 18 000 particles at this point the particles are distributed tightly enough in the domain to maintain the diffusion process regardless of the variability in their spacing it should be noted that partitioning a portion of the diffusion process to random walks alleviates the problem of persistent mass transfer gaps benson et al 2020 2 the exact comic calculation which is performed by approximating the integral in 9 and the uniformly spaced comic given by eq 4 have the same convex shape for stationary particles integrating a nonuniform δ v x simply adds a constant value to computing the comic for constant δ v hence the curve is simply shifted vertically without further influencing its shape or the position at which it attains its minimum value and this property persists throughout multiple simulations both fitness metrics provide the identical optimal number of particles of 18 000 thus any calculation of the comic could use the eq 4 regardless of the sampling volume in addition to changes in the comic that arise from data collection or choice of numerical method we will also consider differing statistical assumptions that affect the information criterion and this is performed in the next section 6 non iid non gaussian error processes the original study of the comic benson et al 2020 assumed that the residual between the unknown true concentration c x t and the data c i for i 1 k at each location was an independent and identically distributed iid normal random variable so that 10 c x i t c i ϵ i for every i 1 k where ϵ i n 0 σ 2 and the variance σ 2 must be estimated from the data this led to a log likelihood function hence aic that used the average sum of squared errors for the variance estimate within the fitness metric the assumption of iid gaussian errors is not generally valid and the properties of the error distribution are unknown in most cases here we exploit the fact that the computational solution arises from a particle method in order to approximate the residuals in this scenario chakraborty et al chakraborty et al 2009 showed that a the concentration approximation generated by any particle method is proportional to a binomial random variable that is only asymptotically normal as n δ x 0 and n δ x where δ x is the bin size of the method and b individual concentration errors could be treated as independent with variance proportional to the concentration i e σ i 2 m total n δ x c n x i t where m total is the total mass indeed this can be numerically verified using the rwpt and mtpt methods tran 2020a in chakraborty et al 2009 an alternative information criterion was also proposed for selecting a best model over all parameter choices with the desirable property that the chosen parameter estimate θ serves as a consistent estimator for the true parameter values θ more specifically this criterion arises from an optimal fitting procedure that serves to minimize the weighted mean square error function 11 e θ 1 k i 1 k w i c i c n x i t θ 2 where θ is the vector of unknown model parameters the minimization weights are 12 w i 1 m total c i and the estimator θ is given by 13 θ argmin θ r p e θ for the ade problem described in previous sections we merely have θ v d t we note that in the case that errors are normally distributed minimizing 11 is equivalent to maximizing the log likelihood function for a multivariate gaussian distribution with σ i 2 m total c i for i 1 n see appendix as for the aic this information criterion does not account for the additional information incurred by taking large numbers of particles and hence we augment it to create a new computational information criterion therefore in this case we the define the comic by 14 comic 2 ln 1 k i 1 k 1 m total c i c i c n x i t 2 2 p c n x t ln δ v x d x where c i is the concentration data at location x i and final time t t from the results of the previous section it is beneficial to take δ v constant which reduces this formulation to 15 comic 2 ln 1 k i 1 k 1 m total c i c i c n x i t 2 2 p ln δ v using this criterion we perform simulations of the random walk and mass transfer methods to compute the value of 2 ln e and the comic the formulation and implementation of these methods is analogous to that of the previous section with k 30 randomly spaced data points from fig 5 the optimal number of particles for the mtpt method is 3 000 while for the rwpt method it ranges between 3 200 and 6 400 particles we take the midpoint of these and assume the optimal number of particles is about 5 000 then this predicted value is essentially the same as that stemming from iid gaussian error simulations benson et al 2020 using the optimal number of particles to perform parameter estimation provides mtpt estimates within 10 4 of the true values of d 1 and v 1 because the data is random simulation outcomes may vary but multiple runs with different data display similar qualitative behavior estimated values of d and v using the rwpt method are also similar see fig 2 the maximal absolute error in the estimates of d and v are about 2 5 and 3 respectively which are comparable to the parameter estimation performed for iid gaussian error simulations therefore the comic demonstrates consistency among different error assumptions and estimators in other words optimal model discretization does not strongly depend on the weights in the sum of squared errors lastly we perform similar simulations with noisy data i e data that differs from the analytic solution due to measurement error modeled by independent random concentration noise at each spatial location fig 6 shows the fitness metrics arising from simulated data that is normally distributed with mean equal to the exact concentration from the analytic solution of eq 1 and standard deviation given by α 1 3 1 9 or 1 81 of the exact concentration so that var c i α 2 c x i t 2 we note that any negative sample points are discarded in order to guarantee non negativity of the concentration data set of course the exact value of α can be tuned to adjust for the noise in the data there are several noteworthy features shown in a single realization of the simulations different simulations show similar results 1 for the rwpt simulations the optimal number of particles is strongly determined by the standard deviation of the independent noise held within the data in short the noisier the data the more noise can be contained within the model solution i e fewer particles should be used 2 for the mtpt solution the optimal value of the comic occurs at n 100 particles which is far fewer than the optimal number of particles when α 0 in contrast to the rwpt solutions the number of particles is not strongly affected by the magnitude of noise in the data this can be explained by the formulation of the comic in which the dominant term in the calculation is the aic until n becomes sufficiently large the numerical simulation is converging to the exact solution of the pde i e a normal distribution and as the number of particles nears 100 the approximate solution closely agrees with the exact solution however assuming substantial noise in the data the exact solution is far from the expected normal distribution which means that the aic will remain large even as the computational approximation converges this can be seen by the graph of 2 ln e within fig 6 which plateaus for simulations with more than 100 particles 3 if a given data set is particularly noisy or fails to faithfully represent the underlying solution of the pde one would actually do best to use fewer particles in a simulation when significant noise exists in the data a low noise high n solution is not expected to be a better predictor because it is apt to be over fit to peculiarities in a single noisy data set 7 conclusions we have investigated the use of the comic to select parsimonious and robust computational models for simple advective diffusive transport in a variety of realistic data driven scenarios including noisy sparse and spatially heterogeneous data sets non uniform sampling volumes and non iid errors in the case of non uniform sampling volumes we have shown that the calculation of the comic can be further simplified using the average spacing between particles throughout the domain and this does not influence the particle number selected by the algorithm the results of our simulations demonstrate that under any of these conditions the comic is a flexible criterion that allows the user to select an appropriate number of particles in a simulation so as to guarantee the use of minimal computational information to construct a descriptive model in particular we find that the use of large particles numbers is often superfluous in these simulations and needlessly increases the complexity of a model this highlights the importance of selecting a suitably efficient computational model with minimal information content to best make predictions based on a single given data set in particular we find the following general rules regarding the optimal discretization for rwpt and mtpt simulations and or parameter estimation of advection and diffusion in 1 d 1 for perfect no noise data that is uniformly spaced the number of data does not strongly effect the optimal number of particles in general rwpt with binning required 20 000 particles mtpt required 3 000 2 for either solution technique the parameters can be estimated quite accurately the optimal number of particles in the mtpt simulations drops to 500 when estimating the velocity and diffusion parameters 3 non uniformly spaced data does not change the ability to estimate parameters 4 non uniformly spaced particles in the mtpt technique significantly increases the optimal number of particles because of increased error in the simulations 5 non uniform numerical discretization adds a constant to the comic but does not change the shape of the comic versus discretization curve hence the minimum is not shifted this means that the computational entropy penalty can be estimated by ln n 6 the classical mle fitness metric of average squared error which comes from an assumption of iid normal errors is a reasonably good estimator for errors in which concentration variance is proportional to concentration however as the noise in data increases the optimal number of rwpt particles decreases sharply in short the error of the solution is directly tied to particle numbers and hyper accurate solutions are not representative of the noisy data and may overfit the errors the accuracy of the mtpt method is not tied to particle numbers in the same way once a minimum particle spacing is achieved and so the optimal particle number remains 100 for all noise levels credit authorship contribution statement nhat thanh v tran software

department of energy or the united states government appendix a mles for non iid multivariate gaussian processes we first recall the process of obtaining maximum likelihood parameter estimates θ under the assumption that the errors between model and observations are independent zero mean gaussians in this case the likelihood function is given by a 1 l y θ 2 π k σ θ 1 2 exp 1 2 y t σ θ 1 y where k is the number of observation points σ θ is a diagonal due to independence covariance matrix of errors and y is a vector of residuals satisfying y i c i c x i t for i 1 k now if the errors are further assumed to be identically distributed then σ is a constant multiple of the identity and depends only upon a single variance parameter in this case σ σ 2 i where σ 2 is the assumed variance of the error at each spatial data point x i for i 1 k the log likelihood function then becomes a 2 ln l k 2 ln 2 π k 2 ln σ 2 k 2 σ 2 sse k where sse y y y 2 represents the sum of squared errors maximizing this function using standard tools provides an estimator of the observation variance namely σ 2 sse k removing any constant terms that do not change from one model to another the corresponding log likelihood evaluated at the mle is a 3 ln l ln sse k alternatively if one does not assume that the errors are identically distributed then σ is not a constant multiple of the identity but merely diagonal so that σ σ 1 2 0 0 0 σ 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 σ k 2 hence the error distribution at each spatial data point x i possesses a different variance σ i 2 in this case the mle can be generated using similar methods as above and the resulting values of σ i 2 are given by the multivariate sum of squared errors σ i 2 1 n ℓ 1 n y ℓ i 2 where y 1 y n is a collection of residual vectors with each y ℓ representing a single sample from all spatial points namely y ℓ i c i c x i t for the ℓ th sample with i 1 k of course if only one sample is collected at each spatial gridpoint so that n 1 and y represents the single data vector then the variance estimator reduces to σ i 2 y i 2 unfortunately this does not provide a sharp estimate as the standard deviation of the error distribution is merely equal to the data value at every spatial point therefore to provide a realistic estimate of these values we would require multiple concentration measurements at each spatial data point and at a fixed time t in the absence of this data or a suitable approximation the variance of the error distribution cannot be accurately determined because of this difficulty chakraborty et al chakraborty et al 2009 proposed an alternative minimization criterion which uses a weighted mean square error as described within section 6 and this is derived only under the assumption that the error is approximately gaussian this criterion enables us to generate a consistent parameter estimate when only a single concentration sample is available at each spatial location

associated numerical methods many times the gain in accuracy of a highly discretized numerical model is outweighed by its associated computational costs or the noise within the data we address the

1 introduction numerical methods of all sorts are used to approximate the solutions of various model equations in hydrology the independent variables in these models are discretized and model coefficients are populated so as to faithfully reproduce some set of measured dependent variables i e data of course both the model solution and the measured data will contain errors therefore a perfect match of model to data is not necessarily desired in fact a perfect match will most often reduce the ability of the model to predict new sets of data because the model is overfit to a single realization of noise see the excellent overview by konishi and kitagawa 2008 the bias between a model that is overfit and an underlying true model was classically addressed by akaike akaike 1974 by considering approximate measures of the entropy of the probability distributions associated with the likelihood that data arises from a specific candidate model in short these measures introduce an entropic penalty to maximum likelihood estimates of goodness of fit when the number of adjustable parameters or coefficients increases in a similar fashion the computational entropy of a model is a bias against its fitness and needs to be accounted for when using a model in a predictive mode for a few examples consider first a particle tracking model of contaminant transport it is often visually pleasing to use a large number of particles in order to obtain a smooth i e low concentration variance histogram for comparison with data however if the noise in the data far exceeds the noise in the histogram then the large number of particles is superfluous from a model prediction perspective indeed the model smoothness is not implied by the data and should not be included in a prediction in addition if the model is used repetitively in a parameter estimation procedure then these extra calculations may also become tangibly burdensome another example is stochastic monte carlo modeling of

conductivity are generated yielding models with arbitrary degrees of freedom subsequently the models are weighted in relation to the goodness of fit e g beven and binley 1992 poeter and anderson 2005 ye et al 2004 but one must ask whether simpler models in terms of both discretization and parameterization should be elevated because of their computational simplicity recently benson et al 2020 showed that a computational entropy penalty called the computational information criterion or comic can be easily used to address this issue for simple systems i e those with constant discretization or particle numbers but it has yet to be shown that those results can be generalized to more realistic modeling scenarios here we show that measures of computational entropy penalty may be extended to less ideal cases in the next section we will review both the comic and the advection dispersion mixed hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equation pde model of interest and then discuss associated lagrangian numerical methods sections 3 and 4 are devoted to understanding the effects of sparse and non uniformly spaced data sets respectively on the information criterion and subsequent parameter estimation next we reformulate the comic in section 5 to account for a non uniform discretization volume and demonstrate its equivalence in terms of particle number selection with the comic derived from a uniform sampling volume in section 6 we derive a more general version of the comic for non gaussian errors and non uniform error variance and test it on noisy data sets conclusions are discussed and summarized in the final section 2 model and methods to enable a complete analysis we use an equation that does not require a numerical solution i e an analytical solution is readily available this restriction is not required the simplest case of the one dimensional constant coefficient advection diffusion equation ade is given by 1 c t v c x d 2 c x 2 where c x t is the solution to the pde v is the velocity and d is the diffusion coefficient as we are interested in particle methods we will restrict our attention to the initial condition c x 0 δ x 0 so that c x t is a probability density function pdf in practice the solution to the pde is approximated by the numerical method c n x t which is a function of a discretization parameter n representing the number of particles in a particle method or nodes in a finite difference approximation the choice of n is arbitrary and we seek a systematic way to choose this modeling parameter the newly developed comic may be used to select models amongst these different levels of discretization benson et al 2020 this criterion is a extension of akaike s an information criterion aic in which there is a penalization of the usage of more information in the form of adjustable parameters to describe the model for completeness we recall that the aic is defined by 2 aic 2 ln l θ 2 p where l θ is the likelihood function evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimate for the unknown parameters θ and p is the number of parameters for a computational model the number of nodes or particles contributes to the entropy and must be accounted for when comparing model predictive fitness in short the kullback and leibler 1951 kullback 1968 relative entropy for a discretized model contributes an extra term to the aic and the comic takes the form 3 comic aic c x t ln δ v x d x where δ v x is the sampling volume here given by the spacing between the particles or nodes in the case that δ v x ω n is constant where ω represents the length of the spatial domain then the comic will merely reduce to 4 comic aic ln n up to a constant it is this quantity that should be minimized in order to identify the best available predictive model konishi and kitagawa 2008 benson et al 2020 for this study we use two lagrangian methods random walk particle tracking rwpt and mass transfer particle tracking mtpt both methods are described in detail elsewhere labolle et al 1996 salamon et al 2006 benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2018 so we only summarize here in its simplest form the rwpt method places a number of particles n at the release position x 0 each with constant mass 1 n at every time step of duration δ t each particle moves with mean v δ t and random deviation 2 d δ t ξ where ξ n 0 1 is a standard normal random variable at any desired time bins of size δ x i centered at points x i are constructed and the particle count n i in each bin is converted to concentration by c n x i t n i n δ x i contrastingly the mtpt method typically allows a portion of the dispersion to be performed by random walks as above and the remaining portion is performed by mass transfer between particles benson et al 2019 2020 sole mari et al 2020 herrera et al 2009 engdahl et al 2017 schmidt et al 2019 the mass transfer between any and all particles is governed by the equation 5 m i t δ t m i t i 1 n m i t m j t w i j where for each particle pair denoted i j 6 w i j 1 4 π d δ t exp s i j 2 4 d δ t ρ i j is the normalized kernel that determines the weight of mass transfer between particles i and j benson and bolster 2016 ρ i j is a normalizing constant that ensures conservation of mass and is typically taken to be the particle density sole mari et al 2019 schmidt et al 2020 and s i j is the distance between particles i and j we note that the choice of the gaussian kernel s bandwidth is a free parameter in this case we choose it to be 2 d δ t making w a normalized version of the fundamental solution to the diffusion equation and this is equivalent to choosing β 1 within the convention of sole mari et al 2019 because the particles continually change mass they are typically pre distributed throughout the domain with zero mass one particle at the release point is given unit mass for this study when we employ an mtpt method all dispersion is modeled by mass transfer i e the particles move only by their mean velocity with no random motion in contrast to the rwpt simulations that only simulate dispersion via random walk with no mass transfer in subsequent sections we perform a variety of numerical simulations using the comic to select the optimal number of particles in a model and perform parameter estimation all numerical simulations were conducted in matlab using a desktop computer with a 3 5 ghz intel core i7 processor and 16 gb of ram the code used to generate the results in this section is available at https github com nhatthanhtran entropy2020 tran 2020b 3 sparsity of data one problem that may arise when collecting data is a limited number of accessible locations the sparsity of data could change the number of particles needed to fit a given data set and subsequently predict others we presume that this will also affect the optimal number of particles predicted by the comic thus instead of assuming a large collection of data e g 30 points we will also consider relatively small data sets 10 points within the domain to assess the degree to which parameter estimates are affected by less data and to what extent the optimal number of particles changes in order to achieve more precise estimates because we are relying on smaller collections of data modification to the aic is necessary cavanaugh 1997 this corrected fitness metric is often denoted as the aicc and defined by hurvich and tsai 1989 7 aicc aic 2 p 2 2 p k p 1 where k is the number of data points and p is the number of parameters in the model this leads to the obvious modification of the comic with δ v ω n as 8 comicc aicc ln n such a correction is relevant when we are attempting to compare different models with various numbers of data points and parameters simulations were conducted by setting the final time t 1 with d 1 v 0 i e no adjustable model parameters and selecting k 10 30 or 200 sample data points c 1 c k from exact values of the analytic solution of the ade 1 on the interval ω 5 5 with uniform spacing we calculate the aicc and comicc with different particle numbers for both the random walk and mass transfer methods for the former the optimal number of particles as given by the comicc appears to increase for the sparse k 10 data case to more than n 10 4 3 20 000 particles fig 1 a on the other hand the mtpt simulations appear relatively stable in terms of their comic fitness with an optimal number of particles around n 3 000 fig 1b we now use these results to fix the comic optimal number of particles in simulations 20 000 for rwpt and 3 000 for mtpt that now seek to estimate the parameters within the ade we choose data points from the analytic solution using v d 1 and use matlab s built in fminsearch function to minimize the aic with initial guesses for both coefficients of 0 5 because the particles do not move in the mtpt algorithm the solutions are the same if run multiple times i e non stochastic results for 30 data points the estimated values of d and v in the mtpt are within 10 6 of their true value 1 on the other hand the rwpt method gives a different result for each realization because of the random walks so we show a box whisker plot for those results in fig 2 for even fewer data points say k 6 the random walk method requires significantly more particles to achieve a sufficient balance between goodness of fit and computational complexity the qualitative behavior and shape of the aic and comic for differing particle numbers are similar to fig 1 and hence are not shown the mass transfer method displays similar behavior to other simulations the comic optimal number of particles occurs at n comic 3 000 and the estimated values of d and v are both within 10 6 of their true value of 1 hence the mtpt is significantly more robust with respect to the size of the data finally we briefly mention that simulations were performed for every chosen particle number in which parameter values were first estimated and then used to compute the fitness metric again the convex shape of the aic and comic for the rwpt method were nearly identical to fig 1 though the new optimal number of particles implied by the comic for the mtpt is n comic 500 one reason for this decrease in optimal particle number is that the mtpt estimates are very close to the exact solution so that any noise in the parameter estimation dominates the overall error fig 3 displays the fitness metrics from mtpt simulations with 30 data points using this new optimal particle number we estimated the values of d and v to be within 10 5 of their true values and these are similar to the parameter estimates obtained using 3 000 particles 4 non uniformly spaced data another issue that may arise under less ideal data collection circumstances is that observations from a field site may not be constrained to a certain grid meaning that the data may not exist at uniformly spaced gridpoints therefore we examine the effects of such spatial heterogeneity on the comic and elucidate how this will affect parameter estimation to generate non uniform data we randomly select data points within the domain of interest more specifically we perform simulations for k 10 and k 30 data points with d 1 v 1 x 0 0 and t 1 additionally the numerical spacing δ v 10 n remains constant calculations of the comic for random data display similar results to the case of equally spaced data so we will use the optimal number of particles from the previous section as well for the rwpt method we perform simulations with 5 000 particles for 30 data points and 20 000 particles for 10 data points for the mtpt method both simulations use 3 000 particles the initial guess for both parameters is 0 5 within all simulations due to the added randomness in the spacing of the data we might anticipate that the parameter estimates would vary more than in the case of uniformly spaced data however the results for these random walk parameter estimation simulations are similar in both the magnitude and the variability of the estimates of both d and v fig 2 for the mtpt method a simulation with 30 data points yields estimates of d and v within 10 5 of their true values similarly a simulation with 10 data points provides estimates of d and v within 10 4 of their true values from these simulations we conclude that the comic provides a useful and informative guide for the choice of particle number and parameter estimation even when the data is not uniformly spaced next we will consider alterations to the comic in order to address non constant sampling volumes 5 non uniform numerical discretization volume in the original calculation of the comic the spatial volume δ v x along which the solution is calculated is assumed to be a constant and this results in eq 4 representing the computational fitness metric however in performing certain simulations this assumption may not hold as either the binning of rwpt particles or positions of mtpt particles may not be evenly distributed throughout the physical domain in contrast to the previous section this issue only arises due to the computational method rather than the collected data in such a case δ v x will vary with x and the calculation of the comic must instead use eq 3 one immediate drawback from this formulation is that the value of the true concentration c x t at any point is unknown still the numerical approximation c n x t can be used to estimate this function within the comic which becomes 9 comic aic c n x t ln δ v x d x in this direction we perform mtpt simulations in which the particles are initially placed randomly within the domain and the random spacing between particles will determine the sampling volume δ v x at each of the n particle locations this is performed with varying particle numbers and the resulting comic of eq 9 is computed for each simulation once again using k 30 data points generated from the analytic solution of the ade to account for the randomness in the initial particle spacing we compute the ensemble average of 30 realizations fig 4 from these simulations two key observations become apparent 1 the optimal number of mtpt particles given by the comic is 18 000 which is much larger than the 3 000 particles predicted by simulations with constant δ v see fig 1b this can be explained by the the randomness of the particle spacing for instance schmidt et al 2018 show that the mtpt algorithm incurs increased error for randomly spaced immobile particles because of mass transfer gaps in areas of sparsely distributed particles the fitness of the method drops sharply compared to the uniformly spaced scenario fig 1 especially when the number of particles becomes small this is clearly demonstrated by the aic in fig 4 as this curve possesses a large negative slope between 100 and 18 000 particles and only plateaus after 18 000 particles at this point the particles are distributed tightly enough in the domain to maintain the diffusion process regardless of the variability in their spacing it should be noted that partitioning a portion of the diffusion process to random walks alleviates the problem of persistent mass transfer gaps benson et al 2020 2 the exact comic calculation which is performed by approximating the integral in 9 and the uniformly spaced comic given by eq 4 have the same convex shape for stationary particles integrating a nonuniform δ v x simply adds a constant value to computing the comic for constant δ v hence the curve is simply shifted vertically without further influencing its shape or the position at which it attains its minimum value and this property persists throughout multiple simulations both fitness metrics provide the identical optimal number of particles of 18 000 thus any calculation of the comic could use the eq 4 regardless of the sampling volume in addition to changes in the comic that arise from data collection or choice of numerical method we will also consider differing statistical assumptions that affect the information criterion and this is performed in the next section 6 non iid non gaussian error processes the original study of the comic benson et al 2020 assumed that the residual between the unknown true concentration c x t and the data c i for i 1 k at each location was an independent and identically distributed iid normal random variable so that 10 c x i t c i ϵ i for every i 1 k where ϵ i n 0 σ 2 and the variance σ 2 must be estimated from the data this led to a log likelihood function hence aic that used the average sum of squared errors for the variance estimate within the fitness metric the assumption of iid gaussian errors is not generally valid and the properties of the error distribution are unknown in most cases here we exploit the fact that the computational solution arises from a particle method in order to approximate the residuals in this scenario chakraborty et al chakraborty et al 2009 showed that a the concentration approximation generated by any particle method is proportional to a binomial random variable that is only asymptotically normal as n δ x 0 and n δ x where δ x is the bin size of the method and b individual concentration errors could be treated as independent with variance proportional to the concentration i e σ i 2 m total n δ x c n x i t where m total is the total mass indeed this can be numerically verified using the rwpt and mtpt methods tran 2020a in chakraborty et al 2009 an alternative information criterion was also proposed for selecting a best model over all parameter choices with the desirable property that the chosen parameter estimate θ serves as a consistent estimator for the true parameter values θ more specifically this criterion arises from an optimal fitting procedure that serves to minimize the weighted mean square error function 11 e θ 1 k i 1 k w i c i c n x i t θ 2 where θ is the vector of unknown model parameters the minimization weights are 12 w i 1 m total c i and the estimator θ is given by 13 θ argmin θ r p e θ for the ade problem described in previous sections we merely have θ v d t we note that in the case that errors are normally distributed minimizing 11 is equivalent to maximizing the log likelihood function for a multivariate gaussian distribution with σ i 2 m total c i for i 1 n see appendix as for the aic this information criterion does not account for the additional information incurred by taking large numbers of particles and hence we augment it to create a new computational information criterion therefore in this case we the define the comic by 14 comic 2 ln 1 k i 1 k 1 m total c i c i c n x i t 2 2 p c n x t ln δ v x d x where c i is the concentration data at location x i and final time t t from the results of the previous section it is beneficial to take δ v constant which reduces this formulation to 15 comic 2 ln 1 k i 1 k 1 m total c i c i c n x i t 2 2 p ln δ v using this criterion we perform simulations of the random walk and mass transfer methods to compute the value of 2 ln e and the comic the formulation and implementation of these methods is analogous to that of the previous section with k 30 randomly spaced data points from fig 5 the optimal number of particles for the mtpt method is 3 000 while for the rwpt method it ranges between 3 200 and 6 400 particles we take the midpoint of these and assume the optimal number of particles is about 5 000 then this predicted value is essentially the same as that stemming from iid gaussian error simulations benson et al 2020 using the optimal number of particles to perform parameter estimation provides mtpt estimates within 10 4 of the true values of d 1 and v 1 because the data is random simulation outcomes may vary but multiple runs with different data display similar qualitative behavior estimated values of d and v using the rwpt method are also similar see fig 2 the maximal absolute error in the estimates of d and v are about 2 5 and 3 respectively which are comparable to the parameter estimation performed for iid gaussian error simulations therefore the comic demonstrates consistency among different error assumptions and estimators in other words optimal model discretization does not strongly depend on the weights in the sum of squared errors lastly we perform similar simulations with noisy data i e data that differs from the analytic solution due to measurement error modeled by independent random concentration noise at each spatial location fig 6 shows the fitness metrics arising from simulated data that is normally distributed with mean equal to the exact concentration from the analytic solution of eq 1 and standard deviation given by α 1 3 1 9 or 1 81 of the exact concentration so that var c i α 2 c x i t 2 we note that any negative sample points are discarded in order to guarantee non negativity of the concentration data set of course the exact value of α can be tuned to adjust for the noise in the data there are several noteworthy features shown in a single realization of the simulations different simulations show similar results 1 for the rwpt simulations the optimal number of particles is strongly determined by the standard deviation of the independent noise held within the data in short the noisier the data the more noise can be contained within the model solution i e fewer particles should be used 2 for the mtpt solution the optimal value of the comic occurs at n 100 particles which is far fewer than the optimal number of particles when α 0 in contrast to the rwpt solutions the number of particles is not strongly affected by the magnitude of noise in the data this can be explained by the formulation of the comic in which the dominant term in the calculation is the aic until n becomes sufficiently large the numerical simulation is converging to the exact solution of the pde i e a normal distribution and as the number of particles nears 100 the approximate solution closely agrees with the exact solution however assuming substantial noise in the data the exact solution is far from the expected normal distribution which means that the aic will remain large even as the computational approximation converges this can be seen by the graph of 2 ln e within fig 6 which plateaus for simulations with more than 100 particles 3 if a given data set is particularly noisy or fails to faithfully represent the underlying solution of the pde one would actually do best to use fewer particles in a simulation when significant noise exists in the data a low noise high n solution is not expected to be a better predictor because it is apt to be over fit to peculiarities in a single noisy data set 7 conclusions we have investigated the use of the comic to select parsimonious and robust computational models for simple advective diffusive transport in a variety of realistic data driven scenarios including noisy sparse and spatially heterogeneous data sets non uniform sampling volumes and non iid errors in the case of non uniform sampling volumes we have shown that the calculation of the comic can be further simplified using the average spacing between particles throughout the domain and this does not influence the particle number selected by the algorithm the results of our simulations demonstrate that under any of these conditions the comic is a flexible criterion that allows the user to select an appropriate number of particles in a simulation so as to guarantee the use of minimal computational information to construct a descriptive model in particular we find that the use of large particles numbers is often superfluous in these simulations and needlessly increases the complexity of a model this highlights the importance of selecting a suitably efficient computational model with minimal information content to best make predictions based on a single given data set in particular we find the following general rules regarding the optimal discretization for rwpt and mtpt simulations and or parameter estimation of advection and diffusion in 1 d 1 for perfect no noise data that is uniformly spaced the number of data does not strongly effect the optimal number of particles in general rwpt with binning required 20 000 particles mtpt required 3 000 2 for either solution technique the parameters can be estimated quite accurately the optimal number of particles in the mtpt simulations drops to 500 when estimating the velocity and diffusion parameters 3 non uniformly spaced data does not change the ability to estimate parameters 4 non uniformly spaced particles in the mtpt technique significantly increases the optimal number of particles because of increased error in the simulations 5 non uniform numerical discretization adds a constant to the comic but does not change the shape of the comic versus discretization curve hence the minimum is not shifted this means that the computational entropy penalty can be estimated by ln n 6 the classical mle fitness metric of average squared error which comes from an assumption of iid normal errors is a reasonably good estimator for errors in which concentration variance is proportional to concentration however as the noise in data increases the optimal number of rwpt particles decreases sharply in short the error of the solution is directly tied to particle numbers and hyper accurate solutions are not representative of the noisy data and may overfit the errors the accuracy of the mtpt method is not tied to particle numbers in the same way once a minimum particle spacing is achieved and so the optimal particle number remains 100 for all noise levels credit authorship contribution statement nhat thanh v tran software

department of energy or the united states government appendix a mles for non iid multivariate gaussian processes we first recall the process of obtaining maximum likelihood parameter estimates θ under the assumption that the errors between model and observations are independent zero mean gaussians in this case the likelihood function is given by a 1 l y θ 2 π k σ θ 1 2 exp 1 2 y t σ θ 1 y where k is the number of observation points σ θ is a diagonal due to independence covariance matrix of errors and y is a vector of residuals satisfying y i c i c x i t for i 1 k now if the errors are further assumed to be identically distributed then σ is a constant multiple of the identity and depends only upon a single variance parameter in this case σ σ 2 i where σ 2 is the assumed variance of the error at each spatial data point x i for i 1 k the log likelihood function then becomes a 2 ln l k 2 ln 2 π k 2 ln σ 2 k 2 σ 2 sse k where sse y y y 2 represents the sum of squared errors maximizing this function using standard tools provides an estimator of the observation variance namely σ 2 sse k removing any constant terms that do not change from one model to another the corresponding log likelihood evaluated at the mle is a 3 ln l ln sse k alternatively if one does not assume that the errors are identically distributed then σ is not a constant multiple of the identity but merely diagonal so that σ σ 1 2 0 0 0 σ 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 σ k 2 hence the error distribution at each spatial data point x i possesses a different variance σ i 2 in this case the mle can be generated using similar methods as above and the resulting values of σ i 2 are given by the multivariate sum of squared errors σ i 2 1 n ℓ 1 n y ℓ i 2 where y 1 y n is a collection of residual vectors with each y ℓ representing a single sample from all spatial points namely y ℓ i c i c x i t for the ℓ th sample with i 1 k of course if only one sample is collected at each spatial gridpoint so that n 1 and y represents the single data vector then the variance estimator reduces to σ i 2 y i 2 unfortunately this does not provide a sharp estimate as the standard deviation of the error distribution is merely equal to the data value at every spatial point therefore to provide a realistic estimate of these values we would require multiple concentration measurements at each spatial data point and at a fixed time t in the absence of this data or a suitable approximation the variance of the error distribution cannot be accurately determined because of this difficulty chakraborty et al chakraborty et al 2009 proposed an alternative minimization criterion which uses a weighted mean square error as described within section 6 and this is derived only under the assumption that the error is approximately gaussian this criterion enables us to generate a consistent parameter estimate when only a single concentration sample is available at each spatial location 
321,fundamental understanding of processes controlling geological carbon sequestration gcs requires flow and transport modeling in well characterized aquifer sedimentary deposits we use three dimensional heterogeneous models based on new field studies which incorporate the most important aspects of multiscale architecture in fluvial aquifers in addition we use the associated facies dependent constitutive relations for both relative permeability and capillary pressure curves and their hysteresis the novelty of this work is to evaluate how co2 fate and transport is controlled by 1 the spatial organization volume proportions and connectivity of sedimentary facies types 2 facies dependent constitutive relations and their hysteretic behavior and 3 presence and or absence of dissolved components such as methane ch4 in brine model results suggest that the amounts of snap off and solubility trapping are enhanced by increasing the volume proportion and degree of connectivity of high permeability facies types results also demonstrate that ignoring relative permeability hysteresis leads to underestimation of snap off trapping and overestimation of solubility trapping in contrast neglecting capillary pressure hysteresis i e non hysteretic pc results in overestimation of snap off trapping and underestimation of solubility trapping if capillary pressure is totally neglected i e pc 0 the amount of trapped co2 by snap off and dissolution are respectively overestimated and underestimated competitive co2 and ch4 dissolution in brine results in exsolution of ch4 from the aqueous phase into the gaseous phase facies connectivity and constitutive relations are also critical for the transport of exsolved ch4 however disregarding dissolved ch4 leads to overestimation of co2 trapping capacities keywords co2 sequestration multiscale heterogeneity connectivity impurity relative permeability and capillary pressure hysteresis 1 introduction geological carbon storage gcs is considered a viable strategy for decreasing the high concentration of carbon dioxide co2 in the atmosphere lackner 2003 holloway 2005 metz et al 2005 juanes et al 2006 schrag 2007 benson and cole 2008 dai et al 2020 during gcs anthropogenic co2 is captured and injected into deep geological formations such as depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs or brine saturated aquifers for long term storage although co2 injection into hydrocarbon reservoirs is an effective option for enhanced oil recovery eor purposes brine saturated saline aquifers have the largest storage capacity and thus have been the subject of most prior gcs studies mathias et al 2011 cheng et al 2012 espinet et al 2013 hoteit et al 2019 jayasekara et al 2020 in such aquifers dissolved components such as methane ch4 may be present as brine impurities resulting in additional gcs implementation complexities such as affecting the storage capacity qin et al 2008 oldenburg et al 2013 vilarrasa et al 2013 raad and hassanzadeh 2016 chaudhuri et al 2018 jia et al 2018 brines are commonly associated with near saturation levels of methane the percentage of dissolved ch4 in brine depends on different factors such as pressure temperature and brine salinity in addition the proximity of the aquifer to oil bearing reservoir and also potential leak from oil reservoirs are important factors hosseini et al 2013 field scale experiments at the frio pressure 15 mpa temperature 65 c and salinity 93 000 mg l and cranfield co2 sequestration pilot projects pressure 32 mpa temperature 125 c and salinity 150 000 mg l have respectively 42 mm and 60 mm dissolved ch4 kharaka et al 2006 lu et al 2012b hosseini et al 2013 soltanian et al 2018a this study focuses on co2 injection into brine saturated aquifers which contain dissolved ch4 there are four trapping mechanisms that control the fate and transport of injected co2 co2 trapping below caprock i e structural trapping dissolution of injected co2 into brine i e solubility trapping dissolved co2 mineralization due to geochemical reactions between rock minerals and brine i e mineral trapping and storage of co2 due to capillary mechanisms within the permeable sections of an aquifer i e residual capillary trapping kumar et al 2005 hesse et al 2008 hassanzadeh et al 2009 doughty 2010 saaltink et al 2013 there are two types of residual capillary trapping in heterogeneous aquifers snap off trapping and capillary pinning snap off trapping is a process in which counter imbibition of brine the wetting phase behind the advancing plume traps a portion of co2 the non wetting phase leading to spontaneous disconnection of the co2 phase in the form of immobile bubbles capillary pinning occurs due to aquifer heterogeneity resulting in different capillary entry pressures pe between different facies types three dimensional 3d bodies of sediments and rocks see soltanian and ritzi 2014 in capillary pinning no disconnection of the co2 phase into an immobile fraction occurs at the pore scale instead co2 locally accumulates above residual saturations as a volume of connected and potentially mobile phase within some flow pathways the efficiency of trapping mechanisms depends upon the facies types present and their connectivity as well as the associated facies dependent properties i e constitutive relations defining relative permeability and capillary pressure curves along with their hysteretic behavior han et al 2010 altundas et al 2011 hyman et al 2019 singh et al 2020 computational modeling of multiphase flow and transport is an effective approach to fundamentally understand how these properties affect gcs as they are able to represent the details of geologic heterogeneity across different spatial scales as well as the associated facies dependent constitutive relations however this level of characterization requires intensive data on geometrical relations representing aquifer architecture and the petrophysical properties e g permeability and porosity therein and thus many prior studies have resorted to utilizing simplified or synthetic aquifer models and or simplified multiphase flow physics e g ignoring facies dependent relations hysteresis and the complexities of dissolved hydrocarbon components the goal of this work is to provide a more comprehensive realistic view of the fate of co2 injected into aquifers we achieve this by developing and utilizing 3d and high resolution numerical models of co2 ch4 brine multiphase flow which incorporate most important aspects of aquifer architecture many candidate aquifers for gcs and eor are located within fluvial deposition systems such as the lower mt simon sandstone in illinois the victor interval of the ivishak formation in alaska and the lower tuscaloosa formation in alabama tye et al 2003 hovorka et al 2004 lu et al 2011 krevor et al 2012 olierook et al 2014 jackson and krevor 2020 ward 2020 the depositional environment of such formations often results in discontinuous boundaries between coarse grain cg and fine grain fg cross strata which can create tortuous flow pathways that drive multiscale and multipath channeling of co2 during and after injection zhou et al 2019 quantifying the hydraulic connectivity of such deposits is challenging at best but a few recent studies has revealed that such heterogeneities fundamentally affect the shape and dynamics of co2 plumes lu et al 2012a lu et al 2012b soltanian et al 2017 jackson and krevor 2020 further trapping processes are often controlled by the juxtaposition of cg and fg cross strata as well as by the preferential flow pathways created by interconnecting facies of cg strata gershenzon et al 2015c krishnamurthy et al 2019 these studies however did not include the important aspects of multiphase flow systems such as the combined effects of relative permeability kr capillary pressure pc hysteresis and complexities associated with the presence of dissolved hydrocarbons in this work we examine such complexities and provide new insights into co2 fate and transport during its injection into multiscale geological media most prior knowledge is based on results from two dimensional 2d models which underrepresent the true facies connectivity in 3d sahimi 1994 han et al 2010 deng et al 2012 amooie et al 2017a amooie et al 2017b bech and frykman 2018 aziz et al 2020 erfani et al 2020 ershadnia et al 2020 here we model co2 injection into 3d heterogeneous aquifers with known facies connectivity both with and without dissolved ch4 we consider facies dependent relative permeability and capillary pressure curves with and without facies dependent hysteresis because we include multiphase flow physics in our models our results provide base cases for testing upscaling methods or inverse type problems related to gcs we do not include co2 mineralization as we focus on shorter time periods than those important in the dominant geochemical reactions which result in mineralization most prior simulation studies ignored co2 mineralization in brine bearing aquifers especially sandstone formations due to very low reactivity and slow reaction time scales xu et al 2004 flett et al 2007 han et al 2010 doughty and freifeld 2013 hosseini et al 2013 al khdheeawi et al 2017 delshad et al 2013 we present the results from a series of numerical simulations and analyze how co2 storage capacities are affected by 1 the connectivity of cg cross strata by comparing cases with and without full connectivity percolating clusters 2 relative permeability hysteresis by comparing cases with and without kr hysteresis 3 capillary pressure hysteresis by comparing cases with pc hysteresis to cases without pc hysteresis as well as cases with no capillarity effects and 4 the presence of dissolved ch4 by comparing cases with and without dissolved ch4 in the formation brine in each simulation the amounts of mobile co2 snap off trapping and dissolution are quantified during and after co2 injection we also study the dynamics of exsolved ch4 if present and investigate how the plumes of co2 and ch4 in the gas phase are transported 2 methodology 2 1 multiscale aquifer architecture the complex sedimentary architecture of fluvial aquifers makes it challenging to estimate the behavior of a co2 plume and to evaluate the storage capacity and the risk of co2 leakage further detailed information about the sediment structure is lacking because it is hard to sample and access the subsurface ramanathan et al 2010 recent studies have led to the development of conceptual models of sedimentary architecture in fluvial aquifers which contain stratal facies types ranging in size from fractions of a meter to kilometers lunt et al 2004 lunt and bridge 2007 using these conceptual understandings a geometric based simulation approach geosim was developed to create high resolution 3d heterogeneity models that represent the most important aspects of the multiscale stratal architecture of fluvial deposits guin et al 2010 ramanathan et al 2010 geosim generates facies types across different scales ramanathan et al 2010 gershenzon et al 2015c gershenzon et al 2016 gershenzon et al 2017a gershenzon et al 2017b for example at the largest scale geosim generates the deposits of active channels and compound bars the compound bars in turn are comprised of smaller scale unit bars within the unit bar deposits geosim generates the smallest scale cross sets with different textures facies types at each scale form the bounding surfaces for an assemblage of smaller facies types at the next lower scale and each of those include a bounding surface for facies types that are still smaller in scale fig 1 in gershenzon et al 2015c geosim models can capture the geometry of cg cross strata which may be connected across domain boundaries in spanning clusters i e percolate at all scales and thus form preferential flow pathways the number size and orientation of the connected clusters change across different scales e g see visualizations of connectivity in gershenzon et al 2015c based on percolation theory percolation occurs at volume proportions above the theoretical threshold for random infinite media 31 guin and ritzi 2008 thus simulations must be performed in 3d to capture multiscale connectivity the geometry of spanning cluster s and the resulting preferential flow pathways the complex heterogeneity and the highly non linear nature of multiphase flow equations create significant challenges in achieving numerically stable solutions especially when using separate constitutive relations for each facies type to make our multiphase flow and transport simulations computationally tractable after generating multiscale heterogeneity models in geosim i e all scales from larger scale compound bars to smallest scale cross strata are represented we combine the smallest scale facies types together to create cg cross strata and non cg i e fg cross strata this differentiation is important as cg cross strata have significantly different properties e g orders of magnitude higher permeability than fg cross strata and can thus form preferential flow pathways across different scales klingbeil et al 1999 lunt et al 2004 liu et al 2020 the models created by geosim have been used in computational research on subsurface fluid flow and mass transport in petroleum reservoirs and aquifers targeted for gcs projects soltanian et al 2017 gershenzon et al 2017b for example gershenzon et al 2015a investigated how co2 plume dynamics and trapping mechanisms are influenced by the multiscale architecture generated by geosim they found that 1 small scale cg cross strata control co2 trapping mechanisms and hence the shape and spatial distributions of the co2 plume 2 the proportion spatial organization and the location of high permeability cg cross strata affect the co2 plume dynamics and 3 inclusion of capillary pressure hysteresis may have negligible impacts on the co2 plume dynamics in this work we use geosim generated models for studying co2 injection into a brine saturated aquifer though the goal is quite different than that of prior studies gershenzon et al 2015a gershenzon et al 2017a gershenzon et al 2017b these novel differences include 1 presence of brine impurity e g ch4 2 comparing and evaluating effects of constitutive relations and their hysteresis on co2 storage capacity and 3 the size of the modeling domain to include more cg cross strata especially in the vertical direction to better study and understand the effect of connectivity this is also important in capturing more of the larger scale strata e g compound bar deposits and channel fills i e lower permeability baffles that especially affect vertical migration of co2 in the domain within the heterogeneity models we simulate gcs in two heterogeneity distributions that are well quantified in terms of connectivity based on the cg sediment volume proportion a poorly connected case 19 cg sediments by volume and a well connected case 28 cg sediments by volume fig 1 table 1 comparison between these heterogeneity models is useful for quantifying how the connectivity of cg cross strata affects gcs specifically co2 fate and transport we examined each heterogeneity model using a search algorithm to identify how cg cross strata are connected across the aquifer domain there is no spanning cluster and only 7 of cg cells are connected in the poorly connected case heterogeneity model 1 while 91 of cg cells are connected in one cluster that spans the domain boundaries in the well connected case heterogeneity model 2 2 2 modeling approach we use cmg gem computer modeling group 2019 to perform multiphase flow simulations cmg gem is a multi dimensional and equation of state eos based compositional simulator capable of modeling different gcs processes occurring in a fully coupled framework e g advective and dispersive flow phase equilibrium between gaseous co2 and aqueous brine the cmg gem simulator has been successfully implemented in previous studies for different gcs projects worldwide kumar et al 2005 han et al 2010 saadatpoor et al 2010 hosseini et al 2012 kim et al 2017 soltanian et al 2019 the generated indicator data from geosim and the resulting permeability fields were incorporated into the computational grid of cmg gem before discussing the approaches used for modeling the co2 ch4 brine system it is necessary to describe the complexities that may arise due to the exsolution of native gases e g ch4 from brine during gcs projects the solubility of co2 in brine is about one order of magnitude higher than that of ch4 thus the injected co2 is able to remove ch4 from brine through a competitive dissolution process the exsolved ch4 has lower viscosity and accordingly higher mobility and will propagate faster than co2 and thus accumulates as a bank in front of the gaseous co2 plume displacement of ch4 by co2 has been observed in several large scale co2 injection projects including cranfield site hosseini et al 2013 we use the pressure and temperature conditions reported in the cranfield pilot project the initial aquifer pressure and the constant temperature are 32 06 mpa and 125 c respectively under these conditions the maximum ch4 solubility in brine is 0 62 mole percent as determined by henry s law li and nghiem 1986 in this paper we study how neglecting the initial dissolved ch4 may affect co2 storage capacity we use the peng robinson eos to model phase equilibrium compositions of co2 and ch4 the initial molar ratio of ch4 to co2 dissolved in the brine is 11 1 and initial mole fractions of brine co2 and ch4 are 0 9933 0 0005 and 0 0062 respectively pure co2 is injected at a rate of 131 3 kg min for 15 days total injected volume of 6 44 107 moles representing 13 of the storage capacity at an injection well located at x 0 m and y 50 m fig 1 the well is vertically perforated across the thickness of the aquifer we monitor the co2 plume dynamics during injection and for 185 days post injection the model domain is 100 m 100 m 15 m and the grid cells size are 2 m 2 m 0 05 m total of 750 000 grid cells the grid resolution is high enough to capture variability in the length and thickness of the small scale cross strata and their connectivity consistent with prior works gershenzon et al 2015a gershenzon et al 2017a models include the heterogeneity created by an assemblage of varying scales of heterogeneity geosim generated models are essentially maps of indicator data cell specific values defining different facies types representing heterogeneity which are used to generate permeability fields and assign separate facies dependent relations such as capillary pressure fig 1 frequency distributions are the same as those reported in gershenzon et al 2015a representing permeability values for different facies types observed in the lower mt simon sandstone tye et al 2003 freiburg et al 2016 ritzi et al 2016 the top and bottom sides of the domain are no flow boundaries and other boundaries are open to flow following the approach used by juanes et al 2006 we use different constitutive relations e g relative permeability and capillary pressure curves for fg and cg facies to properly represent different multiphase flow dynamics in our previous simulation studies on co2 injection in aquifers the porosity distribution of subsurface formations was included soltanian et al 2017 soltanian et al 2019 however in the models presented here we found that including such distribution changes the results only slightly but increases the simulation time significantly therefore we first use a positive power law correlation presented by holtz 2002 to obtain the porosity of each grid cell from its permeability value and then calculate the geometric mean of porosities for fg and cg facies types we use the obtained values as a representation of porosity for each facies type thereby leading to a binary porosity distribution table 2 we obtain the average irreducible water saturation swi and the maximum residual gas saturation s g r m a x for each facies type following the approach of holtz 2002 1 s w i 5 159 log k ϕ 1 559 2 s g r m a x 0 969 ϕ 0 5473 where k and φ are the geometric mean of permeability and porosity of each facies type respectively saturation is related to capillary pressure through the brooks corey function dullien 2012 the drainage portion of the relative permeability curves for the aqueous and gas phase are defined by 3 k r w s s w i 1 s w i n w 4 k r g k r g s w i 1 s s w i s g c r 1 s g r s w i s g c r 2 1 1 s s w i s g c r 1 s g r s w i s g c r n g where s gr is the residual gas saturation and s gcr is the critical gas saturation s gcr is 0 04 for both fg and cg cross strata the nw and ng reflect pore size distributions for drainage processes nw and ng are set to 5 and 4 respectively krevor et al 2012 the brine phase relative permeability curves are considered essentially the same for both drainage and imbibition processes as the aquifer is water wet kumar et al 2005 juanes et al 2006 however the gas relative permeability depends on whether it is displacing or being displaced by the brine here the gas relative permeability hysteresis is modeled by killough s approach killough 1976 5 k r g k r g d r s g drainage k r g d r s g s h i f t e d imbibition where k r g d r s g is drainage curve for gas relative permeability sg shifted is calculated using the expression below 6 s g s h i f t e d s g r s g h s g r s g h s g r h s g s g r h and 7 1 s g r h s g r 1 s g h s g r 1 s g r m a x s g r 1 s g m a x s g r where sgr is residual gas saturation sgh is equal to sg when the shift to imbibition occurs i e gas saturation at brine reversal and sgrh is the value of sgr corresponding to sgh within land 1968 equation s g m a x is equal to 1 swr and s g r m a x is the facies dependent maximum residual gas saturation values of s g r m a x for cg and fg facies types are calculated as 0 2 and 0 32 respectively using eq 2 the brooks corey function brooks and corey 1966 is also used to calculate the capillary pressure curves for the drainage 8 p c d p e s s w i 1 s w i 1 λ where pcd bar is the capillary pressure pe bar is capillary entry pressure or the displacement pressure and s and swi are water saturation and irreducible water saturation respectively the λ is the pore size distribution index for the brooks corey model values of pe and λ for the fg facies type were chosen as pe 0 046 bar and λ 0 55 respectively following the values used in gershenzon et al 2017b the entry pressure for cg facies type is calculated by scaling the values for fg rocks using the leverett j function leverett 1941 9 p e c g p e f g k f g ϕ c g k c g ϕ f g 0 5 for imbibition a curve analogous to the drainage curve is used however the imbibition curve crosses the saturation axis at a value of s 1 sgr fig 2 b the imbibition capillary pressure curves are estimated with the residual gas saturation chosen to be consistent with the values of 0 32 and 0 2 used for the residual gas saturation in the relative permeability functions table 2 provides all hydraulic geometric and physical properties of the aquifer 2 3 modeling scenarios we simulate 14 different scenarios that allow us to make a consistent comparison between the geosim models with 19 volume proportion of cg with no percolating clusters and 28 volume proportion of cg with a percolating cluster spanning all domain boundaries table 3 cases 1 6 and cases 7 12 are scenarios with 19 and 28 volume proportion of cg respectively cases 1 12 all have dissolved ch4 included in the simulation case 1 and case 7 represent the most realistic conditions here in which we include dissolved ch4 in brine and represent facies dependent capillarity and relative permeability curves as well as their hysteretic behavior cases 13 and 14 are similar to cases 1 and 7 but they do not have initially dissolved ch4 in formation brine table 3 3 impact of heterogeneity structures and facies connectivity on co2 storage capacity prior related studies have shown that the presence of high permeability cg cross sets within fluvial type reservoirs affects oil production rate the dynamics of co2 convective mixing and the shape and dynamics of co2 plumes gershenzon et al 2015c soltanian et al 2017 importantly these aquifers are dominated by an assemblage of fg and cg cross strata with distinct permeability distributions capillary entry pressures relative permeabilities and capillary pressure curves and hysteretic behavior a group of continuously connected cg cross strata is referred to as a cluster and create preferential flow pathways within the aquifer such clusters are considered to span opposing boundaries e g spanning cluster if their extent in x y and z directions is equal to the aquifer size in those directions guin et al 2010 showed that tortuous spanning pathways exist through connected cg cells when cg cross sets comprise at least 20 of the volume of the deposits thus the volume proportion of cg facies is the most important factor controlling the number size and orientation of cg clusters even for a given volume proportion the properties of clusters change across the different hierarchical scales in our models the cross strata of cg are simulated discretely the connectivity of cg cells in a cluster is defined based on face to face cell adjacency connected cg cells at the smallest scale form flow pathways that vertically span a single unit bar deposit many clusters within unit bars connect into a smaller number of larger clusters at the scale of multiple unit bars at the scale of a compound bar deposit these clusters are typically connected in one or two large clusters that span any pair of opposing domain boundaries fig 3 depicts the mass distribution of injected co2 in mobile snap off trapping and dissolved fractions as a function of time for cases 1 12 in table 3 these values are directly determined by the cmg gem software the general behavior of co2 distribution is the same in non percolating 19 cg and percolating 28 cg cases the results of case 1 19 cg with no percolating cluster and case 7 28 cg with a percolating cluster are presented to understand how the presence of cg facies connectivity influences mobile and trapped co2 trapped by snap off and dissolution as well as the spatial distribution of co2 plume during and after injection we begin with snap off trapping snap off trapping is absent in the aquifer during injection with a constant injection rate if the gas relative permeability curve starts from zero at zero gas saturation however here a visible amount of co2 is trapped by snap off during injection figs 3 4 a due to the non zero critical gas saturation sgcr which is 4 for both cg and fg facies types in our macroscopic continuum formulations gas does not flow in a local control volume grid cell unless its cell averaged saturation exceeds sgcr in other words if sg is less than 4 anywhere in the domain the gaseous co2 is regarded as snap off trapping therein accordingly a larger area that is invaded by a co2 plume during the injection stage will result in a higher amount of co2 trapped by snap off to confirm that residual trapping during injection is only due to the non zero sgcr we set the latter to zero for both facies types and indeed observe no snap off trapping in that scenario not shown once co2 is injected it preferentially invades the higher permeability cg clusters if cg clusters are not connected co2 is trapped and becomes immobile if there is connectivity co2 mainly propagates horizontally because the lengths of lateral branches of cg clusters are typically larger than their local thickness the results show that the difference in the amount of co2 trapped by snap off between non percolating and percolating cases is nearly 1 at the end of the injection period figs 4a 5 b which is attributed to an increase in the area invaded by the co2 plume in the presence of connected pathways after co2 injection stops co2 begins to redistribute throughout the aquifer at this stage viscous forces become negligible and co2 transport is governed by buoyancy and capillary forces the remaining gaseous co2 in fg facies types at the end of injection period can easily migrate upward through the overlying cg cross set because for a given co2 saturation p c s fg c o 2 in fg facies is larger than the pe in overlain cg facies fig 2b this migration continues as long as the cg clusters are connected further even if the rising co2 encounters fg facies types on its way up this process can continue if driving forces for vertical displacement of co2 are greater than the pe in overlying fg facies types in contrast the co2 plume remaining in cg facies types at the end of injection period cannot migrate to overlain fg facies and it mainly remains immobile unless the summation of p c s cg c o 2 in the cg facies and the buoyant force per area of facies is larger than the pe in fg facies type i e p c s cg c o 2 ρ w ρ c o 2 gh p e fg here g is gravitational acceleration and h is the average thickness of co2 layer otherwise the co2 plume is pinned below local contacts between an underlying facies type with smaller pe i e cg cross sets and an overlying facies type with larger pe i e fg cross sets our results show that most important factors controlling snap off trapping are the area swept by co2 as well as the gaseous co2 saturation attained before brine imbibition in invaded zones the value of sgh explained in section 2 2 these two factors can have competing effects in the amount of co2 trapped by snap off the amount of co2 trapped by snap off is dependent on the co2 saturation pinned below capillary barriers before water imbibition the larger the fraction of pores initially filled with co2 larger sgh the more snap off trapping will occur as brine re imbibes the pore space ide et al 2007 krevor et al 2015 however accumulation of immobile gaseous co2 below capillary barriers leads to a smaller area of aquifer is being swept by co2 reducing the snap off trapping due to the non zero residual gas saturation sgr the more area is swept by co2 the more co2 is trapped by snap off for example in the percolating case the co2 plume sweeps a larger area before encountering any capillary pressure barrier resulting in more snap off trapping conversely on average the amount of gaseous co2 that is accumulated below the fg layers prior to brine reversal is reduced which can limit the amount of snap off trapping the opposite is true with non percolating case results show that the presence of spanning clusters enhances snap off trapping by about 4 figs 4b 5c this suggests that the effects caused by the reduction in the average amount of attained gas saturation throughout the domain are overcompensated by the increase in transport pathways of the co2 plume thereby leading to more overall snap off trapping solubility trapping is also influenced by the presence of connected cg facies types results show that the percentage of solubility trapping at the end of the injection period increases from 19 in the non percolating case to over 20 in the percolating case fig 4a the total contact area between co2 and brine is larger in the latter leading to more solubility trapping larger contact area between co2 and brine is obvious if one compares the plume shape in fig 5b this is consistent with increased snap off trapping caused by the wider distribution of the co2 plume in the percolating case once injection stops the co2 plume spreads more in the percolating case than in the non percolating case and results in 30 and 24 solubility trapping respectively figs 4b 5c the so called mobile co2 i e total amount of injected co2 minus its trapped amount by both solubility and snap off trapping includes the portion of capillary pinned co2 and the portion that is truly mobile and may escape the aquifer if the confinement of caprock is compromised the variation of mobile co2 simply shows an inverse relationship to snap off and solubility trapping figs 3 4 by the end of the simulation time roughly 45 of the injected co2 remains mobile in the non percolating case however the mobile co2 in the percolating case is 35 this occurs primarily because the amount of capillary pinned co2 which is considered as mobile portion increases in the absence of connected pathways through cg facies types recall that the presence of spanning cg clusters leads to an increase in the efficiency of co2 trapping mechanisms which is a favorable scenario from a sequestration standpoint the presence of full connectivity in an aquifer can maximize the snap off and solubility trapping and minimize mobile co2 in theory however it is also possible that the co2 plume affects a much larger area which could enhance the risk of co2 leakage the best aquifers are those that increase the storage of co2 in snap off and dissolved forms as well as decreasing buoyancy driven co2 migration the results highlight the importance of properly characterizing the facies architecture in evaluating the storage permanence of injected co2 4 impact of constitutive relations on co2 storage capacity mathematical functions are often used to represent the saturation dependent non linear relationships for gas and brine relative permeabilities and capillary pressure as well as their hysteretic behavior however prior studies related to modeling gcs often used simplifying assumptions e g neglecting the hysteresis in capillary pressure curve to alleviate the computational difficulties accompanying the multiphase flow simulations kumar et al 2005 saadatpoor et al 2010 such difficulties are even more pronounced for 3d high resolution models that also represent some degree of heterogeneity in petrophysical properties here we provide a comprehensive study of possible scenarios by considering facies dependent relative permeabilities and capillary pressure and their hysteresis the goal is to show how such simplifying assumptions might result in overestimation or underestimation of the processes of interests in gcs e g co2 storage capacity as discussed before a similar pattern of co2 distribution is observed between the non percolating cases and the corresponding percolating cases figs 3 4 due to such similarities we compare the results for non percolating cases cases 1 6 such comparison provides insights into how the dynamics of co2 plume are affected by facies dependent constitutive relations for capillarity relative permeability and hysteresis in cases 1 to 3 relative permeabilities kr are facies dependent and the hysteresis is incorporated however they differ in pc such that case 1 has pc hysteresis case 2 has no pc hysteresis and in case 3 there is no pc at all cases 4 to 6 are similar to cases 1 to 3 except that there is no hysteresis in kr table 3 4 1 impact of relative permeability hysteresis on co2 storage capacity to describe the effect of kr hysteresis on co2 storage capacity we compare case 1 to case 4 in both cases the amount of co2 trapped by snap off and dissolution is similar which indicates that it is not critical to consider kr hysteresis when simulating injection fig 4a this is because during the co2 injection the drainage portion of the kr curve is considered however the results are different for the post injection period in case 4 the snap off trapping is underestimated by about 20 and the solubility trapping is overestimated by 4 compared to the case 1 fig 4b when kr is hysteretic the leading edge of the co2 plume displaces the brine in a drainage like mechanism while the trailing edge is displaced by brine in an imbibition like process a trail of co2 is thus left leading to snap off trapping in contrast when kr hysteresis is ignored the trailing edge of the co2 plume migrates as fast as the leading edge and no snap off trapping occurs doughty 2007 however here since residual gas saturation is 4 snap off trapping occurs in all cases the lesser occurrence of snap off trapping in case 4 leads to a more mobile co2 plume compared to the case 1 which then implies a larger overall area of formation that is invaded by co2 in a given time this larger invaded area amounts accordingly to larger overall solubility trapping for the case with non hysteretic kr in summary we conclude that ignoring relative permeability hysteresis of the non wetting phase co2 leads to underestimation of the snap off trapping and overestimation of the solubility trapping the same behavior is observed between cases 2 and 5 and cases 3 and 6 meaning that this result is irrespective of how capillary pressure curve is defined 4 2 impact of capillary pressure on co2 storage capacity we evaluate the effect of pc on the efficiency of co2 trapping mechanisms by comparing three cases hysteretic pc case 1 non hysteretic pc case 2 and no pc case 3 the main difference between cases 1 to 3 and similarly 7 to 9 is related to capillary pinning which occurs whenever rock types have different capillary entry pressures pe saadatpoor et al 2010 capillary pinning is absent when pc is ignored or when it is the same for different rock types saadatpoor et al 2010 we compare cases 2 and 3 with the case 1 that represents the most realistic scenario the comparison between case 1 and case 2 shows that the hysteresis in capillary pressure is not critical during the co2 injection period since as the drainage portion of the pc curve is followed at all times throughout the domain this results in similar dynamics and shape of co2 plume within the first 15 days figs 4a 6 a however the simulation results show stark differences in the post injection period for a given facies type the sealing integrity can be different during drainage and imbibition processes depending on how pc sw curve is defined in case 1 because the capillary imbibition process takes place and the pe tends to zero at the residual gas saturation the integrity of barriers i e fg facies type is completely lost e g see dashed lines in fig 2b thus the buoyant co2 in addition to migration from fg to cg facies types can easily penetrate the fg facies from underlying cg facies and reach the top boundary as soon as the injection ceases in addition pc hysteresis smears the saturation front in the middle of the computational domain making it difficult to distinguish the dominant effect of the sedimentary architecture during the post injection period fig 6b in case 2 because the pc curves are the same for both drainage and imbibition the values of pe are the same during and after co2 injection as a result the integrity of the barriers does not change overtime and remains constant e g see solid lines in fig 2b thus in case 2 the buoyant co2 cannot penetrate the fg facies from the cg facies and accumulates below any seals created by the fg facies unless the summation of pc in the cg facies and the buoyant force per area of facies is greater than the pe of the fg facies see fig 6b the absence of pc hysteresis and as a result the presence of capillary barriers in case 2 has two consequences for rising co2 first since the same total mass of co2 is injected in every case the magnitude of buoyant co2 capable of migrating in uninvaded zone reduces compared to case 1 leading to underestimation of solubility trapping second a large amount of rising co2 is pinned below local contacts between an underlying cg facies type with smaller pe and an overlying fg facies type with larger pe thus as discussed before the brine imbibes a larger volume of pinned co2 resulting in an overestimation of snap off trapping fig 4b heterogeneity in capillarity controls co2 transport pathways as evidenced by the comparison between cases 1 and 3 fig 6 transport pathways are capillarity dominated and the gas front is highly ramified during injection in case 1 but in case 3 the plume front is less channeled and does not migrate as much laterally essentially in case 3 the injected co2 mainly travels through pathways of least resistance which are solely defined by the spatial organization of high permeability cg facies types therefore in case 3 a smaller volume of the aquifer is invaded by the gaseous co2 resulting in underestimation of both snap off and solubility trapping in injection stage figs 4a 6a once co2 injection ceases due to the dominance of buoyancy forces over viscous forces and hence the absence of capillary barriers in both cases 1 and 3 the pe in both cases is zero in post injection periods the direction of co2 migration immediately switches from horizontal to vertical and the majority of mobile co2 starts moving upward from its present position therefore in case 3 where the lateral extension of the co2 plume is shorter at the end of injection period fig 6a a smaller volume of uncontacted brine is invaded by rising co2 fig 6b resulting in underestimation of solubility trapping fig 4b in contrast the amount of trapped co2 by snap off is highly overestimated in case 3 that lacks capillarity effects fig 4b in both cases 1 and 3 the same volume of co2 is injected over a period of 15 days in the latter case where a smaller volume of aquifer is occupied by co2 as mentioned above larger values for the pinned co2 are hence expected in invaded areas on average this then implies a relatively higher overestimated amount of snap off trapping for case 3 fig s 4b 6a as the brine imbibes back into pore spaces that are filled with such larger co2 amount i e larger sgh our comparative results illustrated in fig 4 reveal that the impact of capillarity type on snap off trapping in post injection stage has further dependency on whether relative permeability is hysteretic or not this can be understood by comparing the trends of snap off trapping amount against the capillarity type among cases 1 to 3 with those of cases 4 to 6 in fig 4b which are opposite to each other the effect of capillarity on snap off trapping is observable only if kr hysteresis is accounted for otherwise even though the migration distance and hence shape and dynamics of the co2 plume is affected by capillary barriers if present no snap off trapping would be normally predicted in the absence of kr hysteresis when kr hysteresis is ignored the only factor leading to the occurrence of snap off trapping is the non zero critical gas saturation thus the larger the area invaded by the co2 plume the more co2 is trapped by snap off fig 4b in contrast the trend of solubility trapping in cases 4 to 6 is qualitatively consistent with what is observed in cases 1 to 3 fig 4b as stated in the previous section whether kr is hysteretic or not can make a difference to the amount of dissolved co2 however it seems for a given time period the resulting increase in solubility trapping and co2 spreading due to the absence of kr hysteresis here are virtually the same for all three capillarity types such that the overall trend of solubility trapping is maintained and is irrespective of the presence of hysteresis in relative permeability therefore all the discussion about the effect of capillarity on co2 dissolution for cases 1 to 3 can be directly applied not only for the explanation of solubility trapping behavior but also for snap off trapping in cases 4 to 6 5 impact of heterogeneity structures and facies connectivity on ch4 exsolution it is well recognized that brine saturated aquifers especially those nearby hydrocarbon reservoirs could contain dissolved hydrocarbon species such as ch4 taggart 2010 previous simulation studies and field observations have shown that the injection of co2 in such aquifers gives rise to the formation of a propagating ch4 rich bank within the gaseous phase and ahead of the co2 front hosseini et al 2012 oldenburg et al 2013 this is because the viscosity of gaseous ch4 is typically lower than that of the co2 if leakage occurs the ch4 plume would then breakthrough first ch4 leakage into shallower depths is of great concern from a risk assessment prospective ershadnia et al 2020 mahmoodpour et al 2020 however it is not fully known how the bank of ch4 rich gas is transported in aquifers of different degrees of heterogeneity a number of studies also considered ch4 exsolution due to co2 injection but without representing the scale of sedimentary architecture like that considered here taggart 2010 hosseini et al 2012 as shown in previous sections high resolution heterogeneity models with well quantified connectivity combined with facies based constitutive relations can provide fundamental insights into what the multiphase flow dynamics may really look like in an aquifer during co2 injection motivated by this we report on how ch4 exsolution and its transport are affected by small scale sedimentary architecture as well as facies connectivity fig 7 shows the amount of exsolved ch4 and dissolved co2 for cases 1 12 our results indicate that ch4 exsolution is directly related to co2 dissolution fig s 7a b higher co2 dissolution amounts to higher ch4 exsolution to elucidate the role of sedimentary architecture we compare non percolating case case 1 and percolating case case 7 the amount of exsolved ch4 is increased by 3 for the percolating case at the end of injection period fig 7c this corresponds to a slight difference in co2 dissolution in considered cases the exsolution amount difference between the two cases reaches nearly 18 post injection due to the greater difference in co2 dissolution for that stage fig 7d overall the probability of ch4 exsolution increases in the presence of connectivity of cg facies types which can be undesirable from a storage safety standpoint exsolved ch4 mainly exits from high permeability well connected pathways created by cg clusters in cases 1 and 7 fig 8 this is due to the propagation of the injected co2 preferentially through cg clusters stripping the ch4 from brine and pushing it within the gas phase forward one main difference between our observations and prior works is that prior works considered larger scale heterogeneities and thus a large bank of moving gaseous ch4 was observed in their visualization taggart 2010 hosseini et al 2013 soltanian et al 2018a here we argue that such a clearly defined bank may not be observed if small scale sedimentary strata are included which directly affects the maximum concentration of dissolved ch4 as well as its mole fraction within the gas phase in our simulations the initial amount of dissolved ch4 is 2 78 108 moles results show that 1 2 of dissolved ch4 is exsolved due to co2 injection for example in case 1 the total amount exsolved is 1 5 at the end of the post injection period although this percentage seems low in a large scale gcs project it translates to a significant amount of ch4 rich gas that may migrate to shallower depths should the integrity of the target aquifer be compromised in addition due to the different pressure and temperature conditions in a shallow aquifer each molar volume of liberated ch4 gas amounts to a larger volume of gaseous ch4 based on our conditions 32 06 mpa and 125 c one can calculate the gas expansion factor eg of 250 scm m3 ahmed 2007 this means that each cubic meter of exsolved ch4 can contaminate 250 m3 of atmosphere in case of leakage the extent of such risk crucially depends on the mixing and spreading dynamics of both gaseous and dissolved ch4 as controlled by sedimentary architecture and also the proximity of potential leakage pathways such as open fractures faults and leaky wells thus adequate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity and connectivity of high permeability facies is of great importance to predict the likelihood for and the degree of environmental risks associated with gcs projects we also found that the amount of dissolved co2 can yield an estimate of the amount of exsolved ch4 results show that under the assumption of ch4 saturated brine at 32 06 mpa and 125 c the molar ratio of exsolved ch4 to dissolved co2 is roughly 25 at any given time this behavior is observed regardless of whether or not a spanning cluster occurs in the aquifer for example in case 1 the ratio between these two portions at the end of storage period is 3 9 106 moles ch4 to 1 54 107 moles co2 which is equal to 25 3 fig 7a b this shows that phase equilibrium flash calculations could be used to estimate the overall dissolution and exsolution amount without a need to perform cumbersome numerical simulations peng and robinson 1976 6 impact of constitutive relations on ch4 exsolution 6 1 impact of relative permeability hysteresis on ch4 exsolution to evaluate the effect of hysteresis in kr we compare case 1 and case 4 both cases show similar amounts of exsolved ch4 during and at the end of injection period fig 7a c thus kr hysteresis is negligible as long as co2 is injected with a constant rate once injection stops in case 4 where snap off trapping is far less the volume of connected and potentially mobile co2 is larger than in case 1 resulting in an overestimation of solubility trapping accordingly the amount of exsolved ch4 is overestimated by 13 at the end of the storage period fig 7d the co2 plume invades more of the aquifer larger contact area between brine and co2 in case 4 than in case 1 leading to greater exsolved ch4 amount after 200 days fig 9 the same behavior is consistently seen between cases 2 and 5 and cases 3 and 6 6 2 impact of capillary pressure on ch4 exsolution to evaluate the effects of pc hysteresis on the amount and dynamics of exsolved ch4 we compare case 1 with pc hysteresis and case 2 without pc hysteresis both cases have kr hysteresis model results are as expected during injection fig 7a c however exsolved ch4 is underestimated by 6 in the absence of pc hysteresis at the end of storage period fig 7a d due to the presence of sealing layers in case 2 that slow down the vertical migration of co2 and result in lower dissolution of co2 and correspondingly exsolution of ch4 fig 7b d it is unlikely that the exsolved ch4 dissolves into brine under the same pressure and temperature and it must be held either by capillary trapping processes i e snap off and capillary pinning or cap rock taggart 2010 in case 3 where the capillarity effect is neglected i e pc 0 the results further suggest an underestimation of exsolved ch4 in both injection and post injection periods 10 and 13 respectively compared to case 1 fig 7c d visual inspection of ch4 plumes in fig 10 shows that the surface area between co2 rich zones darker regions and ch4 rich zones lighter regions in case 3 is less ramified than that in case 1 this is because in case 3 ch4 exsolution mainly occurs through pathways of less resistance which are determined solely by permeability distribution of cg facies types the co2 and tracer breakthrough curves at observation wells are important for determining different parameters such as the co2 transport pathways residence times within the monitoring and verification framework the storage capacity of aquifer and potential leakage of co2 and ch4 ch4 and gas tracer breakthrough to observation wells have been used as an early indicators of co2 arrival to observation wells soltanian et al 2016 soltanian et al 2018b simulation results show that after 15 days the co2 rich bank preferentially reaches the right aquifer boundary in case 1 however there is no sign of gaseous co2 in some of the connected flow pathways by cg cross sets in case 3 where pc and its hysteresis are ignored fig 10 thus we conclude that overall ignoring pc causes a delay in the arrival time of co2 bank and it may also change co2 transport pathways 7 effect of dissolved ch4 on co2 trapping capacity here we investigate how ch4 dissolved in brine can affect the co2 storage capacity for this purpose we compare cases 1 7 13 and 14 case 1 and case 7 have 19 cg and 28 cg respectively cases 13 and 14 are respectively identical to cases 1 and 7 except that there is no initial dissolved ch4 in brine in the former the fluid system in cases 1 and 7 comprises three components brine co2 and ch4 with initial mole fractions 0 9933 0 0005 and 0 0062 respectively in cases 13 and 14 initial mole fractions for binary mixture of brine and co2 are 0 9995 and 0 0005 respectively after 200 days neglecting the initial dissolved ch4 results in an overestimation of the capacity of trapping mechanisms and underestimation of mobile co2 fig 11 this is because under this condition there is no competitive dissolution of co2 and ch4 in brine our results show that the co2 dissolution and its snap off trapped phase in the non percolating case are overestimated by 2 6 and 4 respectively however mobile co2 is underestimated by 4 2 fig 11 similarly in the percolating case co2 dissolution and its snap off trapped phase are overestimated by 4 1 and 2 7 respectively and mobile co2 is underestimated by 6 7 fig 11 8 conclusions we performed a series of high resolution and 3d numerical simulations to examine how sedimentary architecture of brine saturated aquifers and connectivity of high permeability cross strata as well as facies dependent relative permeability and capillary pressure curves and their hysteresis affect multiphase flow dynamics during co2 geological sequestration we also studied the complexity of dissolved ch4 in brine we used models of sedimentary architecture that realistically reflect the most important features of fluvial type aquifers including the multiscale connectivity of cg cross strata we quantified the amount of exsolved ch4 trapped co2 by snap off trapping and dissolved and mobile co2 the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 a similar trend is observed between models with no percolating clusters and those that incorporate a percolating cluster in terms of the distribution of injected co2 within the aquifer 2 the amounts of snap off trapping and dissolved co2 are enhanced by increasing the degree of connectivity of high permeability facies types 3 ignoring relative permeability hysteresis of the non wetting phase co2 leads to an underestimation of snap off trapping and an overestimation of solubility trapping 4 ignoring capillary pressure hysteresis results in an overestimation of co2 trapped by snap off trapping and an underestimation of solubility trapping 5 if capillary pressure is assumed to be zero the amount of snap off trapping is considerably overestimated while the amount of solubility trapping is underestimated 6 ch4 exsolution is a direct consequence of co2 dissolution due to their competitiveness for dissolution therefore in the presence of connectivity preferential flow pathways will increase the possibility of ch4 leakage this is an unfavorable result from a sequestration viewpoint 7 ignoring the initial dissolved ch4 in brine not only leads to an overestimation of storage capacities but it also results in an underestimation of potential risks associated with ch4 leakage during gcs projects 8 based on these analyses we suggest that aquifers with 1 higher volume proportions of cg facies types 2 lower amounts of dissolved impurity and 3 smaller contrasts in pe of fg and cg rocks are more promising target formations for increasing trapping capacity and decreasing mobile co2 in gcs projects credit

321,fundamental understanding of processes controlling geological carbon sequestration gcs requires flow and transport modeling in well characterized aquifer sedimentary deposits we use three dimensional heterogeneous models based on new field studies which incorporate the most important aspects of multiscale architecture in fluvial aquifers in addition we use the associated facies dependent constitutive relations for both relative permeability and capillary pressure curves and their hysteresis the novelty of this work is to evaluate how co2 fate and transport is controlled by 1 the spatial organization volume proportions and connectivity of sedimentary facies types 2 facies dependent constitutive relations and their hysteretic behavior and 3 presence and or absence of dissolved components such as methane ch4 in brine model results suggest that the amounts of snap off and solubility trapping are enhanced by increasing the volume proportion and degree of connectivity of high permeability facies types results also demonstrate that ignoring relative permeability hysteresis leads to underestimation of snap off trapping and overestimation of solubility trapping in contrast neglecting capillary pressure hysteresis i e non hysteretic pc results in overestimation of snap off trapping and underestimation of solubility trapping if capillary pressure is totally neglected i e pc 0 the amount of trapped co2 by snap off and dissolution are respectively overestimated and underestimated competitive co2 and ch4 dissolution in brine results in exsolution of ch4 from the aqueous phase into the gaseous phase facies connectivity and constitutive relations are also critical for the transport of exsolved ch4 however disregarding dissolved ch4 leads to overestimation of co2 trapping capacities keywords co2 sequestration multiscale heterogeneity connectivity impurity relative permeability and capillary pressure hysteresis 1 introduction geological carbon storage gcs is considered a viable strategy for decreasing the high concentration of carbon dioxide co2 in the atmosphere lackner 2003 holloway 2005 metz et al 2005 juanes et al 2006 schrag 2007 benson and cole 2008 dai et al 2020 during gcs anthropogenic co2 is captured and injected into deep geological formations such as depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs or brine saturated aquifers for long term storage although co2 injection into hydrocarbon reservoirs is an effective option for enhanced oil recovery eor purposes brine saturated saline aquifers have the largest storage capacity and thus have been the subject of most prior gcs studies mathias et al 2011 cheng et al 2012 espinet et al 2013 hoteit et al 2019 jayasekara et al 2020 in such aquifers dissolved components such as methane ch4 may be present as brine impurities resulting in additional gcs implementation complexities such as affecting the storage capacity qin et al 2008 oldenburg et al 2013 vilarrasa et al 2013 raad and hassanzadeh 2016 chaudhuri et al 2018 jia et al 2018 brines are commonly associated with near saturation levels of methane the percentage of dissolved ch4 in brine depends on different factors such as pressure temperature and brine salinity in addition the proximity of the aquifer to oil bearing reservoir and also potential leak from oil reservoirs are important factors hosseini et al 2013 field scale experiments at the frio pressure 15 mpa temperature 65 c and salinity 93 000 mg l and cranfield co2 sequestration pilot projects pressure 32 mpa temperature 125 c and salinity 150 000 mg l have respectively 42 mm and 60 mm dissolved ch4 kharaka et al 2006 lu et al 2012b hosseini et al 2013 soltanian et al 2018a this study focuses on co2 injection into brine saturated aquifers which contain dissolved ch4 there are four trapping mechanisms that control the fate and transport of injected co2 co2 trapping below caprock i e structural trapping dissolution of injected co2 into brine i e solubility trapping dissolved co2 mineralization due to geochemical reactions between rock minerals and brine i e mineral trapping and storage of co2 due to capillary mechanisms within the permeable sections of an aquifer i e residual capillary trapping kumar et al 2005 hesse et al 2008 hassanzadeh et al 2009 doughty 2010 saaltink et al 2013 there are two types of residual capillary trapping in heterogeneous aquifers snap off trapping and capillary pinning snap off trapping is a process in which counter imbibition of brine the wetting phase behind the advancing plume traps a portion of co2 the non wetting phase leading to spontaneous disconnection of the co2 phase in the form of immobile bubbles capillary pinning occurs due to aquifer heterogeneity resulting in different capillary entry pressures pe between different facies types three dimensional 3d bodies of sediments and rocks see soltanian and ritzi 2014 in capillary pinning no disconnection of the co2 phase into an immobile fraction occurs at the pore scale instead co2 locally accumulates above residual saturations as a volume of connected and potentially mobile phase within some flow pathways the efficiency of trapping mechanisms depends upon the facies types present and their connectivity as well as the associated facies dependent properties i e constitutive relations defining relative permeability and capillary pressure curves along with their hysteretic behavior han et al 2010 altundas et al 2011 hyman et al 2019 singh et al 2020 computational modeling of multiphase flow and transport is an effective approach to fundamentally understand how these properties affect gcs as they are able to represent the details of geologic heterogeneity across different spatial scales as well as the associated facies dependent constitutive relations however this level of characterization requires intensive data on geometrical relations representing aquifer architecture and the petrophysical properties e g permeability and porosity therein and thus many prior studies have resorted to utilizing simplified or synthetic aquifer models and or simplified multiphase flow physics e g ignoring facies dependent relations hysteresis and the complexities of dissolved hydrocarbon components the goal of this work is to provide a more comprehensive realistic view of the fate of co2 injected into aquifers we achieve this by developing and utilizing 3d and high resolution numerical models of co2 ch4 brine multiphase flow which incorporate most important aspects of aquifer architecture many candidate aquifers for gcs and eor are located within fluvial deposition systems such as the lower mt simon sandstone in illinois the victor interval of the ivishak formation in alaska and the lower tuscaloosa formation in alabama tye et al 2003 hovorka et al 2004 lu et al 2011 krevor et al 2012 olierook et al 2014 jackson and krevor 2020 ward 2020 the depositional environment of such formations often results in discontinuous boundaries between coarse grain cg and fine grain fg cross strata which can create tortuous flow pathways that drive multiscale and multipath channeling of co2 during and after injection zhou et al 2019 quantifying the hydraulic connectivity of such deposits is challenging at best but a few recent studies has revealed that such heterogeneities fundamentally affect the shape and dynamics of co2 plumes lu et al 2012a lu et al 2012b soltanian et al 2017 jackson and krevor 2020 further trapping processes are often controlled by the juxtaposition of cg and fg cross strata as well as by the preferential flow pathways created by interconnecting facies of cg strata gershenzon et al 2015c krishnamurthy et al 2019 these studies however did not include the important aspects of multiphase flow systems such as the combined effects of relative permeability kr capillary pressure pc hysteresis and complexities associated with the presence of dissolved hydrocarbons in this work we examine such complexities and provide new insights into co2 fate and transport during its injection into multiscale geological media most prior knowledge is based on results from two dimensional 2d models which underrepresent the true facies connectivity in 3d sahimi 1994 han et al 2010 deng et al 2012 amooie et al 2017a amooie et al 2017b bech and frykman 2018 aziz et al 2020 erfani et al 2020 ershadnia et al 2020 here we model co2 injection into 3d heterogeneous aquifers with known facies connectivity both with and without dissolved ch4 we consider facies dependent relative permeability and capillary pressure curves with and without facies dependent hysteresis because we include multiphase flow physics in our models our results provide base cases for testing upscaling methods or inverse type problems related to gcs we do not include co2 mineralization as we focus on shorter time periods than those important in the dominant geochemical reactions which result in mineralization most prior simulation studies ignored co2 mineralization in brine bearing aquifers especially sandstone formations due to very low reactivity and slow reaction time scales xu et al 2004 flett et al 2007 han et al 2010 doughty and freifeld 2013 hosseini et al 2013 al khdheeawi et al 2017 delshad et al 2013 we present the results from a series of numerical simulations and analyze how co2 storage capacities are affected by 1 the connectivity of cg cross strata by comparing cases with and without full connectivity percolating clusters 2 relative permeability hysteresis by comparing cases with and without kr hysteresis 3 capillary pressure hysteresis by comparing cases with pc hysteresis to cases without pc hysteresis as well as cases with no capillarity effects and 4 the presence of dissolved ch4 by comparing cases with and without dissolved ch4 in the formation brine in each simulation the amounts of mobile co2 snap off trapping and dissolution are quantified during and after co2 injection we also study the dynamics of exsolved ch4 if present and investigate how the plumes of co2 and ch4 in the gas phase are transported 2 methodology 2 1 multiscale aquifer architecture the complex sedimentary architecture of fluvial aquifers makes it challenging to estimate the behavior of a co2 plume and to evaluate the storage capacity and the risk of co2 leakage further detailed information about the sediment structure is lacking because it is hard to sample and access the subsurface ramanathan et al 2010 recent studies have led to the development of conceptual models of sedimentary architecture in fluvial aquifers which contain stratal facies types ranging in size from fractions of a meter to kilometers lunt et al 2004 lunt and bridge 2007 using these conceptual understandings a geometric based simulation approach geosim was developed to create high resolution 3d heterogeneity models that represent the most important aspects of the multiscale stratal architecture of fluvial deposits guin et al 2010 ramanathan et al 2010 geosim generates facies types across different scales ramanathan et al 2010 gershenzon et al 2015c gershenzon et al 2016 gershenzon et al 2017a gershenzon et al 2017b for example at the largest scale geosim generates the deposits of active channels and compound bars the compound bars in turn are comprised of smaller scale unit bars within the unit bar deposits geosim generates the smallest scale cross sets with different textures facies types at each scale form the bounding surfaces for an assemblage of smaller facies types at the next lower scale and each of those include a bounding surface for facies types that are still smaller in scale fig 1 in gershenzon et al 2015c geosim models can capture the geometry of cg cross strata which may be connected across domain boundaries in spanning clusters i e percolate at all scales and thus form preferential flow pathways the number size and orientation of the connected clusters change across different scales e g see visualizations of connectivity in gershenzon et al 2015c based on percolation theory percolation occurs at volume proportions above the theoretical threshold for random infinite media 31 guin and ritzi 2008 thus simulations must be performed in 3d to capture multiscale connectivity the geometry of spanning cluster s and the resulting preferential flow pathways the complex heterogeneity and the highly non linear nature of multiphase flow equations create significant challenges in achieving numerically stable solutions especially when using separate constitutive relations for each facies type to make our multiphase flow and transport simulations computationally tractable after generating multiscale heterogeneity models in geosim i e all scales from larger scale compound bars to smallest scale cross strata are represented we combine the smallest scale facies types together to create cg cross strata and non cg i e fg cross strata this differentiation is important as cg cross strata have significantly different properties e g orders of magnitude higher permeability than fg cross strata and can thus form preferential flow pathways across different scales klingbeil et al 1999 lunt et al 2004 liu et al 2020 the models created by geosim have been used in computational research on subsurface fluid flow and mass transport in petroleum reservoirs and aquifers targeted for gcs projects soltanian et al 2017 gershenzon et al 2017b for example gershenzon et al 2015a investigated how co2 plume dynamics and trapping mechanisms are influenced by the multiscale architecture generated by geosim they found that 1 small scale cg cross strata control co2 trapping mechanisms and hence the shape and spatial distributions of the co2 plume 2 the proportion spatial organization and the location of high permeability cg cross strata affect the co2 plume dynamics and 3 inclusion of capillary pressure hysteresis may have negligible impacts on the co2 plume dynamics in this work we use geosim generated models for studying co2 injection into a brine saturated aquifer though the goal is quite different than that of prior studies gershenzon et al 2015a gershenzon et al 2017a gershenzon et al 2017b these novel differences include 1 presence of brine impurity e g ch4 2 comparing and evaluating effects of constitutive relations and their hysteresis on co2 storage capacity and 3 the size of the modeling domain to include more cg cross strata especially in the vertical direction to better study and understand the effect of connectivity this is also important in capturing more of the larger scale strata e g compound bar deposits and channel fills i e lower permeability baffles that especially affect vertical migration of co2 in the domain within the heterogeneity models we simulate gcs in two heterogeneity distributions that are well quantified in terms of connectivity based on the cg sediment volume proportion a poorly connected case 19 cg sediments by volume and a well connected case 28 cg sediments by volume fig 1 table 1 comparison between these heterogeneity models is useful for quantifying how the connectivity of cg cross strata affects gcs specifically co2 fate and transport we examined each heterogeneity model using a search algorithm to identify how cg cross strata are connected across the aquifer domain there is no spanning cluster and only 7 of cg cells are connected in the poorly connected case heterogeneity model 1 while 91 of cg cells are connected in one cluster that spans the domain boundaries in the well connected case heterogeneity model 2 2 2 modeling approach we use cmg gem computer modeling group 2019 to perform multiphase flow simulations cmg gem is a multi dimensional and equation of state eos based compositional simulator capable of modeling different gcs processes occurring in a fully coupled framework e g advective and dispersive flow phase equilibrium between gaseous co2 and aqueous brine the cmg gem simulator has been successfully implemented in previous studies for different gcs projects worldwide kumar et al 2005 han et al 2010 saadatpoor et al 2010 hosseini et al 2012 kim et al 2017 soltanian et al 2019 the generated indicator data from geosim and the resulting permeability fields were incorporated into the computational grid of cmg gem before discussing the approaches used for modeling the co2 ch4 brine system it is necessary to describe the complexities that may arise due to the exsolution of native gases e g ch4 from brine during gcs projects the solubility of co2 in brine is about one order of magnitude higher than that of ch4 thus the injected co2 is able to remove ch4 from brine through a competitive dissolution process the exsolved ch4 has lower viscosity and accordingly higher mobility and will propagate faster than co2 and thus accumulates as a bank in front of the gaseous co2 plume displacement of ch4 by co2 has been observed in several large scale co2 injection projects including cranfield site hosseini et al 2013 we use the pressure and temperature conditions reported in the cranfield pilot project the initial aquifer pressure and the constant temperature are 32 06 mpa and 125 c respectively under these conditions the maximum ch4 solubility in brine is 0 62 mole percent as determined by henry s law li and nghiem 1986 in this paper we study how neglecting the initial dissolved ch4 may affect co2 storage capacity we use the peng robinson eos to model phase equilibrium compositions of co2 and ch4 the initial molar ratio of ch4 to co2 dissolved in the brine is 11 1 and initial mole fractions of brine co2 and ch4 are 0 9933 0 0005 and 0 0062 respectively pure co2 is injected at a rate of 131 3 kg min for 15 days total injected volume of 6 44 107 moles representing 13 of the storage capacity at an injection well located at x 0 m and y 50 m fig 1 the well is vertically perforated across the thickness of the aquifer we monitor the co2 plume dynamics during injection and for 185 days post injection the model domain is 100 m 100 m 15 m and the grid cells size are 2 m 2 m 0 05 m total of 750 000 grid cells the grid resolution is high enough to capture variability in the length and thickness of the small scale cross strata and their connectivity consistent with prior works gershenzon et al 2015a gershenzon et al 2017a models include the heterogeneity created by an assemblage of varying scales of heterogeneity geosim generated models are essentially maps of indicator data cell specific values defining different facies types representing heterogeneity which are used to generate permeability fields and assign separate facies dependent relations such as capillary pressure fig 1 frequency distributions are the same as those reported in gershenzon et al 2015a representing permeability values for different facies types observed in the lower mt simon sandstone tye et al 2003 freiburg et al 2016 ritzi et al 2016 the top and bottom sides of the domain are no flow boundaries and other boundaries are open to flow following the approach used by juanes et al 2006 we use different constitutive relations e g relative permeability and capillary pressure curves for fg and cg facies to properly represent different multiphase flow dynamics in our previous simulation studies on co2 injection in aquifers the porosity distribution of subsurface formations was included soltanian et al 2017 soltanian et al 2019 however in the models presented here we found that including such distribution changes the results only slightly but increases the simulation time significantly therefore we first use a positive power law correlation presented by holtz 2002 to obtain the porosity of each grid cell from its permeability value and then calculate the geometric mean of porosities for fg and cg facies types we use the obtained values as a representation of porosity for each facies type thereby leading to a binary porosity distribution table 2 we obtain the average irreducible water saturation swi and the maximum residual gas saturation s g r m a x for each facies type following the approach of holtz 2002 1 s w i 5 159 log k ϕ 1 559 2 s g r m a x 0 969 ϕ 0 5473 where k and φ are the geometric mean of permeability and porosity of each facies type respectively saturation is related to capillary pressure through the brooks corey function dullien 2012 the drainage portion of the relative permeability curves for the aqueous and gas phase are defined by 3 k r w s s w i 1 s w i n w 4 k r g k r g s w i 1 s s w i s g c r 1 s g r s w i s g c r 2 1 1 s s w i s g c r 1 s g r s w i s g c r n g where s gr is the residual gas saturation and s gcr is the critical gas saturation s gcr is 0 04 for both fg and cg cross strata the nw and ng reflect pore size distributions for drainage processes nw and ng are set to 5 and 4 respectively krevor et al 2012 the brine phase relative permeability curves are considered essentially the same for both drainage and imbibition processes as the aquifer is water wet kumar et al 2005 juanes et al 2006 however the gas relative permeability depends on whether it is displacing or being displaced by the brine here the gas relative permeability hysteresis is modeled by killough s approach killough 1976 5 k r g k r g d r s g drainage k r g d r s g s h i f t e d imbibition where k r g d r s g is drainage curve for gas relative permeability sg shifted is calculated using the expression below 6 s g s h i f t e d s g r s g h s g r s g h s g r h s g s g r h and 7 1 s g r h s g r 1 s g h s g r 1 s g r m a x s g r 1 s g m a x s g r where sgr is residual gas saturation sgh is equal to sg when the shift to imbibition occurs i e gas saturation at brine reversal and sgrh is the value of sgr corresponding to sgh within land 1968 equation s g m a x is equal to 1 swr and s g r m a x is the facies dependent maximum residual gas saturation values of s g r m a x for cg and fg facies types are calculated as 0 2 and 0 32 respectively using eq 2 the brooks corey function brooks and corey 1966 is also used to calculate the capillary pressure curves for the drainage 8 p c d p e s s w i 1 s w i 1 λ where pcd bar is the capillary pressure pe bar is capillary entry pressure or the displacement pressure and s and swi are water saturation and irreducible water saturation respectively the λ is the pore size distribution index for the brooks corey model values of pe and λ for the fg facies type were chosen as pe 0 046 bar and λ 0 55 respectively following the values used in gershenzon et al 2017b the entry pressure for cg facies type is calculated by scaling the values for fg rocks using the leverett j function leverett 1941 9 p e c g p e f g k f g ϕ c g k c g ϕ f g 0 5 for imbibition a curve analogous to the drainage curve is used however the imbibition curve crosses the saturation axis at a value of s 1 sgr fig 2 b the imbibition capillary pressure curves are estimated with the residual gas saturation chosen to be consistent with the values of 0 32 and 0 2 used for the residual gas saturation in the relative permeability functions table 2 provides all hydraulic geometric and physical properties of the aquifer 2 3 modeling scenarios we simulate 14 different scenarios that allow us to make a consistent comparison between the geosim models with 19 volume proportion of cg with no percolating clusters and 28 volume proportion of cg with a percolating cluster spanning all domain boundaries table 3 cases 1 6 and cases 7 12 are scenarios with 19 and 28 volume proportion of cg respectively cases 1 12 all have dissolved ch4 included in the simulation case 1 and case 7 represent the most realistic conditions here in which we include dissolved ch4 in brine and represent facies dependent capillarity and relative permeability curves as well as their hysteretic behavior cases 13 and 14 are similar to cases 1 and 7 but they do not have initially dissolved ch4 in formation brine table 3 3 impact of heterogeneity structures and facies connectivity on co2 storage capacity prior related studies have shown that the presence of high permeability cg cross sets within fluvial type reservoirs affects oil production rate the dynamics of co2 convective mixing and the shape and dynamics of co2 plumes gershenzon et al 2015c soltanian et al 2017 importantly these aquifers are dominated by an assemblage of fg and cg cross strata with distinct permeability distributions capillary entry pressures relative permeabilities and capillary pressure curves and hysteretic behavior a group of continuously connected cg cross strata is referred to as a cluster and create preferential flow pathways within the aquifer such clusters are considered to span opposing boundaries e g spanning cluster if their extent in x y and z directions is equal to the aquifer size in those directions guin et al 2010 showed that tortuous spanning pathways exist through connected cg cells when cg cross sets comprise at least 20 of the volume of the deposits thus the volume proportion of cg facies is the most important factor controlling the number size and orientation of cg clusters even for a given volume proportion the properties of clusters change across the different hierarchical scales in our models the cross strata of cg are simulated discretely the connectivity of cg cells in a cluster is defined based on face to face cell adjacency connected cg cells at the smallest scale form flow pathways that vertically span a single unit bar deposit many clusters within unit bars connect into a smaller number of larger clusters at the scale of multiple unit bars at the scale of a compound bar deposit these clusters are typically connected in one or two large clusters that span any pair of opposing domain boundaries fig 3 depicts the mass distribution of injected co2 in mobile snap off trapping and dissolved fractions as a function of time for cases 1 12 in table 3 these values are directly determined by the cmg gem software the general behavior of co2 distribution is the same in non percolating 19 cg and percolating 28 cg cases the results of case 1 19 cg with no percolating cluster and case 7 28 cg with a percolating cluster are presented to understand how the presence of cg facies connectivity influences mobile and trapped co2 trapped by snap off and dissolution as well as the spatial distribution of co2 plume during and after injection we begin with snap off trapping snap off trapping is absent in the aquifer during injection with a constant injection rate if the gas relative permeability curve starts from zero at zero gas saturation however here a visible amount of co2 is trapped by snap off during injection figs 3 4 a due to the non zero critical gas saturation sgcr which is 4 for both cg and fg facies types in our macroscopic continuum formulations gas does not flow in a local control volume grid cell unless its cell averaged saturation exceeds sgcr in other words if sg is less than 4 anywhere in the domain the gaseous co2 is regarded as snap off trapping therein accordingly a larger area that is invaded by a co2 plume during the injection stage will result in a higher amount of co2 trapped by snap off to confirm that residual trapping during injection is only due to the non zero sgcr we set the latter to zero for both facies types and indeed observe no snap off trapping in that scenario not shown once co2 is injected it preferentially invades the higher permeability cg clusters if cg clusters are not connected co2 is trapped and becomes immobile if there is connectivity co2 mainly propagates horizontally because the lengths of lateral branches of cg clusters are typically larger than their local thickness the results show that the difference in the amount of co2 trapped by snap off between non percolating and percolating cases is nearly 1 at the end of the injection period figs 4a 5 b which is attributed to an increase in the area invaded by the co2 plume in the presence of connected pathways after co2 injection stops co2 begins to redistribute throughout the aquifer at this stage viscous forces become negligible and co2 transport is governed by buoyancy and capillary forces the remaining gaseous co2 in fg facies types at the end of injection period can easily migrate upward through the overlying cg cross set because for a given co2 saturation p c s fg c o 2 in fg facies is larger than the pe in overlain cg facies fig 2b this migration continues as long as the cg clusters are connected further even if the rising co2 encounters fg facies types on its way up this process can continue if driving forces for vertical displacement of co2 are greater than the pe in overlying fg facies types in contrast the co2 plume remaining in cg facies types at the end of injection period cannot migrate to overlain fg facies and it mainly remains immobile unless the summation of p c s cg c o 2 in the cg facies and the buoyant force per area of facies is larger than the pe in fg facies type i e p c s cg c o 2 ρ w ρ c o 2 gh p e fg here g is gravitational acceleration and h is the average thickness of co2 layer otherwise the co2 plume is pinned below local contacts between an underlying facies type with smaller pe i e cg cross sets and an overlying facies type with larger pe i e fg cross sets our results show that most important factors controlling snap off trapping are the area swept by co2 as well as the gaseous co2 saturation attained before brine imbibition in invaded zones the value of sgh explained in section 2 2 these two factors can have competing effects in the amount of co2 trapped by snap off the amount of co2 trapped by snap off is dependent on the co2 saturation pinned below capillary barriers before water imbibition the larger the fraction of pores initially filled with co2 larger sgh the more snap off trapping will occur as brine re imbibes the pore space ide et al 2007 krevor et al 2015 however accumulation of immobile gaseous co2 below capillary barriers leads to a smaller area of aquifer is being swept by co2 reducing the snap off trapping due to the non zero residual gas saturation sgr the more area is swept by co2 the more co2 is trapped by snap off for example in the percolating case the co2 plume sweeps a larger area before encountering any capillary pressure barrier resulting in more snap off trapping conversely on average the amount of gaseous co2 that is accumulated below the fg layers prior to brine reversal is reduced which can limit the amount of snap off trapping the opposite is true with non percolating case results show that the presence of spanning clusters enhances snap off trapping by about 4 figs 4b 5c this suggests that the effects caused by the reduction in the average amount of attained gas saturation throughout the domain are overcompensated by the increase in transport pathways of the co2 plume thereby leading to more overall snap off trapping solubility trapping is also influenced by the presence of connected cg facies types results show that the percentage of solubility trapping at the end of the injection period increases from 19 in the non percolating case to over 20 in the percolating case fig 4a the total contact area between co2 and brine is larger in the latter leading to more solubility trapping larger contact area between co2 and brine is obvious if one compares the plume shape in fig 5b this is consistent with increased snap off trapping caused by the wider distribution of the co2 plume in the percolating case once injection stops the co2 plume spreads more in the percolating case than in the non percolating case and results in 30 and 24 solubility trapping respectively figs 4b 5c the so called mobile co2 i e total amount of injected co2 minus its trapped amount by both solubility and snap off trapping includes the portion of capillary pinned co2 and the portion that is truly mobile and may escape the aquifer if the confinement of caprock is compromised the variation of mobile co2 simply shows an inverse relationship to snap off and solubility trapping figs 3 4 by the end of the simulation time roughly 45 of the injected co2 remains mobile in the non percolating case however the mobile co2 in the percolating case is 35 this occurs primarily because the amount of capillary pinned co2 which is considered as mobile portion increases in the absence of connected pathways through cg facies types recall that the presence of spanning cg clusters leads to an increase in the efficiency of co2 trapping mechanisms which is a favorable scenario from a sequestration standpoint the presence of full connectivity in an aquifer can maximize the snap off and solubility trapping and minimize mobile co2 in theory however it is also possible that the co2 plume affects a much larger area which could enhance the risk of co2 leakage the best aquifers are those that increase the storage of co2 in snap off and dissolved forms as well as decreasing buoyancy driven co2 migration the results highlight the importance of properly characterizing the facies architecture in evaluating the storage permanence of injected co2 4 impact of constitutive relations on co2 storage capacity mathematical functions are often used to represent the saturation dependent non linear relationships for gas and brine relative permeabilities and capillary pressure as well as their hysteretic behavior however prior studies related to modeling gcs often used simplifying assumptions e g neglecting the hysteresis in capillary pressure curve to alleviate the computational difficulties accompanying the multiphase flow simulations kumar et al 2005 saadatpoor et al 2010 such difficulties are even more pronounced for 3d high resolution models that also represent some degree of heterogeneity in petrophysical properties here we provide a comprehensive study of possible scenarios by considering facies dependent relative permeabilities and capillary pressure and their hysteresis the goal is to show how such simplifying assumptions might result in overestimation or underestimation of the processes of interests in gcs e g co2 storage capacity as discussed before a similar pattern of co2 distribution is observed between the non percolating cases and the corresponding percolating cases figs 3 4 due to such similarities we compare the results for non percolating cases cases 1 6 such comparison provides insights into how the dynamics of co2 plume are affected by facies dependent constitutive relations for capillarity relative permeability and hysteresis in cases 1 to 3 relative permeabilities kr are facies dependent and the hysteresis is incorporated however they differ in pc such that case 1 has pc hysteresis case 2 has no pc hysteresis and in case 3 there is no pc at all cases 4 to 6 are similar to cases 1 to 3 except that there is no hysteresis in kr table 3 4 1 impact of relative permeability hysteresis on co2 storage capacity to describe the effect of kr hysteresis on co2 storage capacity we compare case 1 to case 4 in both cases the amount of co2 trapped by snap off and dissolution is similar which indicates that it is not critical to consider kr hysteresis when simulating injection fig 4a this is because during the co2 injection the drainage portion of the kr curve is considered however the results are different for the post injection period in case 4 the snap off trapping is underestimated by about 20 and the solubility trapping is overestimated by 4 compared to the case 1 fig 4b when kr is hysteretic the leading edge of the co2 plume displaces the brine in a drainage like mechanism while the trailing edge is displaced by brine in an imbibition like process a trail of co2 is thus left leading to snap off trapping in contrast when kr hysteresis is ignored the trailing edge of the co2 plume migrates as fast as the leading edge and no snap off trapping occurs doughty 2007 however here since residual gas saturation is 4 snap off trapping occurs in all cases the lesser occurrence of snap off trapping in case 4 leads to a more mobile co2 plume compared to the case 1 which then implies a larger overall area of formation that is invaded by co2 in a given time this larger invaded area amounts accordingly to larger overall solubility trapping for the case with non hysteretic kr in summary we conclude that ignoring relative permeability hysteresis of the non wetting phase co2 leads to underestimation of the snap off trapping and overestimation of the solubility trapping the same behavior is observed between cases 2 and 5 and cases 3 and 6 meaning that this result is irrespective of how capillary pressure curve is defined 4 2 impact of capillary pressure on co2 storage capacity we evaluate the effect of pc on the efficiency of co2 trapping mechanisms by comparing three cases hysteretic pc case 1 non hysteretic pc case 2 and no pc case 3 the main difference between cases 1 to 3 and similarly 7 to 9 is related to capillary pinning which occurs whenever rock types have different capillary entry pressures pe saadatpoor et al 2010 capillary pinning is absent when pc is ignored or when it is the same for different rock types saadatpoor et al 2010 we compare cases 2 and 3 with the case 1 that represents the most realistic scenario the comparison between case 1 and case 2 shows that the hysteresis in capillary pressure is not critical during the co2 injection period since as the drainage portion of the pc curve is followed at all times throughout the domain this results in similar dynamics and shape of co2 plume within the first 15 days figs 4a 6 a however the simulation results show stark differences in the post injection period for a given facies type the sealing integrity can be different during drainage and imbibition processes depending on how pc sw curve is defined in case 1 because the capillary imbibition process takes place and the pe tends to zero at the residual gas saturation the integrity of barriers i e fg facies type is completely lost e g see dashed lines in fig 2b thus the buoyant co2 in addition to migration from fg to cg facies types can easily penetrate the fg facies from underlying cg facies and reach the top boundary as soon as the injection ceases in addition pc hysteresis smears the saturation front in the middle of the computational domain making it difficult to distinguish the dominant effect of the sedimentary architecture during the post injection period fig 6b in case 2 because the pc curves are the same for both drainage and imbibition the values of pe are the same during and after co2 injection as a result the integrity of the barriers does not change overtime and remains constant e g see solid lines in fig 2b thus in case 2 the buoyant co2 cannot penetrate the fg facies from the cg facies and accumulates below any seals created by the fg facies unless the summation of pc in the cg facies and the buoyant force per area of facies is greater than the pe of the fg facies see fig 6b the absence of pc hysteresis and as a result the presence of capillary barriers in case 2 has two consequences for rising co2 first since the same total mass of co2 is injected in every case the magnitude of buoyant co2 capable of migrating in uninvaded zone reduces compared to case 1 leading to underestimation of solubility trapping second a large amount of rising co2 is pinned below local contacts between an underlying cg facies type with smaller pe and an overlying fg facies type with larger pe thus as discussed before the brine imbibes a larger volume of pinned co2 resulting in an overestimation of snap off trapping fig 4b heterogeneity in capillarity controls co2 transport pathways as evidenced by the comparison between cases 1 and 3 fig 6 transport pathways are capillarity dominated and the gas front is highly ramified during injection in case 1 but in case 3 the plume front is less channeled and does not migrate as much laterally essentially in case 3 the injected co2 mainly travels through pathways of least resistance which are solely defined by the spatial organization of high permeability cg facies types therefore in case 3 a smaller volume of the aquifer is invaded by the gaseous co2 resulting in underestimation of both snap off and solubility trapping in injection stage figs 4a 6a once co2 injection ceases due to the dominance of buoyancy forces over viscous forces and hence the absence of capillary barriers in both cases 1 and 3 the pe in both cases is zero in post injection periods the direction of co2 migration immediately switches from horizontal to vertical and the majority of mobile co2 starts moving upward from its present position therefore in case 3 where the lateral extension of the co2 plume is shorter at the end of injection period fig 6a a smaller volume of uncontacted brine is invaded by rising co2 fig 6b resulting in underestimation of solubility trapping fig 4b in contrast the amount of trapped co2 by snap off is highly overestimated in case 3 that lacks capillarity effects fig 4b in both cases 1 and 3 the same volume of co2 is injected over a period of 15 days in the latter case where a smaller volume of aquifer is occupied by co2 as mentioned above larger values for the pinned co2 are hence expected in invaded areas on average this then implies a relatively higher overestimated amount of snap off trapping for case 3 fig s 4b 6a as the brine imbibes back into pore spaces that are filled with such larger co2 amount i e larger sgh our comparative results illustrated in fig 4 reveal that the impact of capillarity type on snap off trapping in post injection stage has further dependency on whether relative permeability is hysteretic or not this can be understood by comparing the trends of snap off trapping amount against the capillarity type among cases 1 to 3 with those of cases 4 to 6 in fig 4b which are opposite to each other the effect of capillarity on snap off trapping is observable only if kr hysteresis is accounted for otherwise even though the migration distance and hence shape and dynamics of the co2 plume is affected by capillary barriers if present no snap off trapping would be normally predicted in the absence of kr hysteresis when kr hysteresis is ignored the only factor leading to the occurrence of snap off trapping is the non zero critical gas saturation thus the larger the area invaded by the co2 plume the more co2 is trapped by snap off fig 4b in contrast the trend of solubility trapping in cases 4 to 6 is qualitatively consistent with what is observed in cases 1 to 3 fig 4b as stated in the previous section whether kr is hysteretic or not can make a difference to the amount of dissolved co2 however it seems for a given time period the resulting increase in solubility trapping and co2 spreading due to the absence of kr hysteresis here are virtually the same for all three capillarity types such that the overall trend of solubility trapping is maintained and is irrespective of the presence of hysteresis in relative permeability therefore all the discussion about the effect of capillarity on co2 dissolution for cases 1 to 3 can be directly applied not only for the explanation of solubility trapping behavior but also for snap off trapping in cases 4 to 6 5 impact of heterogeneity structures and facies connectivity on ch4 exsolution it is well recognized that brine saturated aquifers especially those nearby hydrocarbon reservoirs could contain dissolved hydrocarbon species such as ch4 taggart 2010 previous simulation studies and field observations have shown that the injection of co2 in such aquifers gives rise to the formation of a propagating ch4 rich bank within the gaseous phase and ahead of the co2 front hosseini et al 2012 oldenburg et al 2013 this is because the viscosity of gaseous ch4 is typically lower than that of the co2 if leakage occurs the ch4 plume would then breakthrough first ch4 leakage into shallower depths is of great concern from a risk assessment prospective ershadnia et al 2020 mahmoodpour et al 2020 however it is not fully known how the bank of ch4 rich gas is transported in aquifers of different degrees of heterogeneity a number of studies also considered ch4 exsolution due to co2 injection but without representing the scale of sedimentary architecture like that considered here taggart 2010 hosseini et al 2012 as shown in previous sections high resolution heterogeneity models with well quantified connectivity combined with facies based constitutive relations can provide fundamental insights into what the multiphase flow dynamics may really look like in an aquifer during co2 injection motivated by this we report on how ch4 exsolution and its transport are affected by small scale sedimentary architecture as well as facies connectivity fig 7 shows the amount of exsolved ch4 and dissolved co2 for cases 1 12 our results indicate that ch4 exsolution is directly related to co2 dissolution fig s 7a b higher co2 dissolution amounts to higher ch4 exsolution to elucidate the role of sedimentary architecture we compare non percolating case case 1 and percolating case case 7 the amount of exsolved ch4 is increased by 3 for the percolating case at the end of injection period fig 7c this corresponds to a slight difference in co2 dissolution in considered cases the exsolution amount difference between the two cases reaches nearly 18 post injection due to the greater difference in co2 dissolution for that stage fig 7d overall the probability of ch4 exsolution increases in the presence of connectivity of cg facies types which can be undesirable from a storage safety standpoint exsolved ch4 mainly exits from high permeability well connected pathways created by cg clusters in cases 1 and 7 fig 8 this is due to the propagation of the injected co2 preferentially through cg clusters stripping the ch4 from brine and pushing it within the gas phase forward one main difference between our observations and prior works is that prior works considered larger scale heterogeneities and thus a large bank of moving gaseous ch4 was observed in their visualization taggart 2010 hosseini et al 2013 soltanian et al 2018a here we argue that such a clearly defined bank may not be observed if small scale sedimentary strata are included which directly affects the maximum concentration of dissolved ch4 as well as its mole fraction within the gas phase in our simulations the initial amount of dissolved ch4 is 2 78 108 moles results show that 1 2 of dissolved ch4 is exsolved due to co2 injection for example in case 1 the total amount exsolved is 1 5 at the end of the post injection period although this percentage seems low in a large scale gcs project it translates to a significant amount of ch4 rich gas that may migrate to shallower depths should the integrity of the target aquifer be compromised in addition due to the different pressure and temperature conditions in a shallow aquifer each molar volume of liberated ch4 gas amounts to a larger volume of gaseous ch4 based on our conditions 32 06 mpa and 125 c one can calculate the gas expansion factor eg of 250 scm m3 ahmed 2007 this means that each cubic meter of exsolved ch4 can contaminate 250 m3 of atmosphere in case of leakage the extent of such risk crucially depends on the mixing and spreading dynamics of both gaseous and dissolved ch4 as controlled by sedimentary architecture and also the proximity of potential leakage pathways such as open fractures faults and leaky wells thus adequate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity and connectivity of high permeability facies is of great importance to predict the likelihood for and the degree of environmental risks associated with gcs projects we also found that the amount of dissolved co2 can yield an estimate of the amount of exsolved ch4 results show that under the assumption of ch4 saturated brine at 32 06 mpa and 125 c the molar ratio of exsolved ch4 to dissolved co2 is roughly 25 at any given time this behavior is observed regardless of whether or not a spanning cluster occurs in the aquifer for example in case 1 the ratio between these two portions at the end of storage period is 3 9 106 moles ch4 to 1 54 107 moles co2 which is equal to 25 3 fig 7a b this shows that phase equilibrium flash calculations could be used to estimate the overall dissolution and exsolution amount without a need to perform cumbersome numerical simulations peng and robinson 1976 6 impact of constitutive relations on ch4 exsolution 6 1 impact of relative permeability hysteresis on ch4 exsolution to evaluate the effect of hysteresis in kr we compare case 1 and case 4 both cases show similar amounts of exsolved ch4 during and at the end of injection period fig 7a c thus kr hysteresis is negligible as long as co2 is injected with a constant rate once injection stops in case 4 where snap off trapping is far less the volume of connected and potentially mobile co2 is larger than in case 1 resulting in an overestimation of solubility trapping accordingly the amount of exsolved ch4 is overestimated by 13 at the end of the storage period fig 7d the co2 plume invades more of the aquifer larger contact area between brine and co2 in case 4 than in case 1 leading to greater exsolved ch4 amount after 200 days fig 9 the same behavior is consistently seen between cases 2 and 5 and cases 3 and 6 6 2 impact of capillary pressure on ch4 exsolution to evaluate the effects of pc hysteresis on the amount and dynamics of exsolved ch4 we compare case 1 with pc hysteresis and case 2 without pc hysteresis both cases have kr hysteresis model results are as expected during injection fig 7a c however exsolved ch4 is underestimated by 6 in the absence of pc hysteresis at the end of storage period fig 7a d due to the presence of sealing layers in case 2 that slow down the vertical migration of co2 and result in lower dissolution of co2 and correspondingly exsolution of ch4 fig 7b d it is unlikely that the exsolved ch4 dissolves into brine under the same pressure and temperature and it must be held either by capillary trapping processes i e snap off and capillary pinning or cap rock taggart 2010 in case 3 where the capillarity effect is neglected i e pc 0 the results further suggest an underestimation of exsolved ch4 in both injection and post injection periods 10 and 13 respectively compared to case 1 fig 7c d visual inspection of ch4 plumes in fig 10 shows that the surface area between co2 rich zones darker regions and ch4 rich zones lighter regions in case 3 is less ramified than that in case 1 this is because in case 3 ch4 exsolution mainly occurs through pathways of less resistance which are determined solely by permeability distribution of cg facies types the co2 and tracer breakthrough curves at observation wells are important for determining different parameters such as the co2 transport pathways residence times within the monitoring and verification framework the storage capacity of aquifer and potential leakage of co2 and ch4 ch4 and gas tracer breakthrough to observation wells have been used as an early indicators of co2 arrival to observation wells soltanian et al 2016 soltanian et al 2018b simulation results show that after 15 days the co2 rich bank preferentially reaches the right aquifer boundary in case 1 however there is no sign of gaseous co2 in some of the connected flow pathways by cg cross sets in case 3 where pc and its hysteresis are ignored fig 10 thus we conclude that overall ignoring pc causes a delay in the arrival time of co2 bank and it may also change co2 transport pathways 7 effect of dissolved ch4 on co2 trapping capacity here we investigate how ch4 dissolved in brine can affect the co2 storage capacity for this purpose we compare cases 1 7 13 and 14 case 1 and case 7 have 19 cg and 28 cg respectively cases 13 and 14 are respectively identical to cases 1 and 7 except that there is no initial dissolved ch4 in brine in the former the fluid system in cases 1 and 7 comprises three components brine co2 and ch4 with initial mole fractions 0 9933 0 0005 and 0 0062 respectively in cases 13 and 14 initial mole fractions for binary mixture of brine and co2 are 0 9995 and 0 0005 respectively after 200 days neglecting the initial dissolved ch4 results in an overestimation of the capacity of trapping mechanisms and underestimation of mobile co2 fig 11 this is because under this condition there is no competitive dissolution of co2 and ch4 in brine our results show that the co2 dissolution and its snap off trapped phase in the non percolating case are overestimated by 2 6 and 4 respectively however mobile co2 is underestimated by 4 2 fig 11 similarly in the percolating case co2 dissolution and its snap off trapped phase are overestimated by 4 1 and 2 7 respectively and mobile co2 is underestimated by 6 7 fig 11 8 conclusions we performed a series of high resolution and 3d numerical simulations to examine how sedimentary architecture of brine saturated aquifers and connectivity of high permeability cross strata as well as facies dependent relative permeability and capillary pressure curves and their hysteresis affect multiphase flow dynamics during co2 geological sequestration we also studied the complexity of dissolved ch4 in brine we used models of sedimentary architecture that realistically reflect the most important features of fluvial type aquifers including the multiscale connectivity of cg cross strata we quantified the amount of exsolved ch4 trapped co2 by snap off trapping and dissolved and mobile co2 the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 a similar trend is observed between models with no percolating clusters and those that incorporate a percolating cluster in terms of the distribution of injected co2 within the aquifer 2 the amounts of snap off trapping and dissolved co2 are enhanced by increasing the degree of connectivity of high permeability facies types 3 ignoring relative permeability hysteresis of the non wetting phase co2 leads to an underestimation of snap off trapping and an overestimation of solubility trapping 4 ignoring capillary pressure hysteresis results in an overestimation of co2 trapped by snap off trapping and an underestimation of solubility trapping 5 if capillary pressure is assumed to be zero the amount of snap off trapping is considerably overestimated while the amount of solubility trapping is underestimated 6 ch4 exsolution is a direct consequence of co2 dissolution due to their competitiveness for dissolution therefore in the presence of connectivity preferential flow pathways will increase the possibility of ch4 leakage this is an unfavorable result from a sequestration viewpoint 7 ignoring the initial dissolved ch4 in brine not only leads to an overestimation of storage capacities but it also results in an underestimation of potential risks associated with ch4 leakage during gcs projects 8 based on these analyses we suggest that aquifers with 1 higher volume proportions of cg facies types 2 lower amounts of dissolved impurity and 3 smaller contrasts in pe of fg and cg rocks are more promising target formations for increasing trapping capacity and decreasing mobile co2 in gcs projects credit

normal university lanzhou 730000 china corresponding author 1 these authors contributed equally to this study and share first authorship the consumption of local blue green physical water blue green pw is linked to imported virtual water imported vw within economic production the quantitative analysis of interactions between blue green pw and imported vw is important for integrated management of water resources in inland arid areas this study used the north tianshan mountains ntm as a case study to demonstrate the construction of a framework to account for local blue green pw and imported vw in regional economic production using an input output model the results showed that the consumption and transfer of blue green pw in the agricultural sector constitute the most important part of the water cycle in the ntm production consumed relatively less imported vw 51 3 of which was by the secondary and tertiary industries vw consumed by the primary industry in the ntm was closely correlated with that by the secondary and tertiary industries whereas low consumption by the primary industry in the ntm and high demand for primary industry products from outside regions resulted in the direct outflow of large amount of blue green vw the current structure of trade in vw also contributed to increasing water shortages in the ntm this study proposed that the enhancement of the cyclic strength of the primary industry in the local economic system is an effective measure to reduce water loss and improve water utilization efficiency in addition by considering the results of industrial linkage analysis of economic sectors this study proposed that the government should promote the development of industries with large water storage potential such as construction manufacturing and forestry and that adjustment of the structure of local industries should be accelerated so as to reduce the loss of vw during local economic production and trade flows of the primary industry keywords blue water green water imported virtual water virtual water trade industrial linkage 1 introduction it is widely recognized that the rapid acceleration of the development of human society and the economy over recent decades has resulted in increasingly frequent and more severe water shortages and anthropogenic activities are having a profound impact on the dynamics of water resource conditions and on the health of the ecological environment hoekstra et al 2012 zeitoun et al 2013 over the last two decades the focus of water resources management and assessment has gradually changed from physical water pw to physical water virtual water vw this change of focus has promoted a more comprehensive approach to improving water management and alleviating regional water shortages allan 1993 it is clear that pw and vw are highly interdependent as not only is local pw directly consumed during economic production in a region but it is also consumed as part of local vw and imported vw and can flow across economic sectors and regions through the supply chain zhang et al 2019 this recognition of the relationship between pw vw has become the basis for management of water resources among competing demands within different economic sectors zhang et al 2011 mubako and lant 2013 past studies on the linkages between pw and vw have mainly focused on the flow of pw and vw resources between regions and the analysis of the relationship between socio economic activities and water consumption at different scales the research of pw vw flow at a global level has mainly focused on describing the impact of global trade on water resources quantitative research on pw vw flow at the regional level has mainly focused on the impact of trade in vw on local resources and the economy chen et al 2013 some studies have also focused on the relationship between blue pw and blue vw within a single region liu et al 2017 despite the numerous past studies on pw vw some shortcomings and uncertainties remain past studies have mainly concentrated on country or basin level study areas and few studies have divided the study area according to administrative borders by adopting an administrative spatial scale transfer characteristics of pw vw within or across administrative regions under the influence of local policies and industrial structure can be highlighted in addition few studies have comprehensively considered the transformations between local blue water green water and imported vw among industries among these green water can be described as water that infiltrates soil and is stored in unsaturated soil through precipitation whereas green vw plays an important role in reducing production input cost and maintaining ecosystem services during regional industrial development hou et al 2018 in addition under conditions of local water resources and imported vw being activated concurrently in a region few studies have use industrial linkage indicators to evaluate local industries with greater future potential for increasing water storage capacity and development potential wang et al 2019a for some water scarce administrative regions the above three points are extremely important for rational allocation of local water resources and industrial adjustment within some water scarce administrative regions the present study approached the linkage between pw and vw from two perspectives the first was the application of a bottom up crop growth and water use model for water accounting haida et al 2019 the tracking of indirect water consumption through various links in the industrial supply chain is a challenge under this method in addition agricultural products are regarded as primary products under this approach and are located at the starting point of the industrial supply chain therefore the bottom up method is more suitable for calculating vw consumption of the agricultural sector in contrast the top down approach generally involves the application of a life cycle assessment or input output analysis the top down approach starts from the highest level defined by the system boundary moving down to lower levels in which the input output method can distinguish between intermediate use and final demand within the economic production processes mannan et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 input output analysis is able to avoid truncation errors and can facilitate the tracking of the vw flow direction of the entire economic sector by regional water managers the results of input output analysis can reflect the inter sectoral linkage of vw flow through the various supply chains of industries however because this method considers the overall economic activity of the region the resolution of accounting needs to be constrained by reducing the categories within the sector for example within the application of the method to vw accounting in agriculture dominated regions the method generally lacks sufficient detail for consideration of the components of different crop types in the agricultural sector zhao et al 2017 previous studies in which input output analysis was conducted within certain developing countries or regions generally grouped forestry animal husbandry fisheries and production of various crops in the agricultural sector into a single sector due to data limitations zhang and anadon 2014 recent development of a hybrid approach has appended the bottom up satellite approaches with more detailed representation of agricultural sectors to the top down input output model this hybrid approach has been applied to vw research at a global level and within the european union wang and zimmerman 2016 steen olsen et al 2012 however agricultural water use remains the dominant water use in most countries and regions around the world particularly in china as the scale of foreign trade imports and exports continues to expand imported vw has participated extensively in regional economic development in the form of imported products zhang et al 2016 therefore the use of this hybrid approach for the analysis of pw vw relationships in a region requires the consideration of vw imported from other regions this consideration is particularly important for comprehensive research within economically underdeveloped regions dominated by agriculture and can be more in line with the current strategic layout of vw and actual economic development needs of water scarce countries or regions zhang et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the present study applied a combination of input output analysis and the cropwat model to propose a blue green pw and imported vw transfer accounting framework for a typical inland arid region with an agriculture dominated economy the study area of the present study was the north tianshan mountains ntm incorporating ten administrative districts namely changji bozhou ili tacheng altay shihezi urumqi karamay turpan and hami fig 1 the present study calculated the consumption of blue and green water by 15 crop production sub sectors in the agricultural sector based on the accounting framework the transfer and allocation between local blue green water and imported vw was analyzed for various economic sectors industries with water storage development potential in the ntm were evaluated through industrial linkage indicators the current study further analyzed the causes of the large outflow of vw from the study area and the factors hindering the inflow of vw into the study area from outside regions the framework presented in the current study can be used as a prospective analytical tool to guide the management of water resources in inland arid areas the framework is also broadly applicable to inland arid areas in china or internationally and can provide a reference for the implementation of a local vw strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 physical setting the ntm is located in the hinterland of eurasia and has a total area of 60 26 104 km2 the ntm has a typical temperate continental arid climate with an average annual precipitation and evaporation of 150 mm 200 mm and 1 500 mm 2 700 mm respectively and an average annual temperature of 5 9 the total amounts of precipitation and water resources in the ntm in 2016 were 121 03 km³ and 44 43 km³ respectively among which surface and underground water amounts were 42 15 km³ and 23 06 km³ respectively and the amount of underground water with no interaction with surface water was 20 77 km³ lei et al 2019 in addition the total population of the ntm in 2016 was 1 241 104 and the annual output of the social economy was 90 035 billion dollars the tertiary industry had the highest output 43 40 billion dollars whereas those of the secondary and the primary industries were 37 939 billion dollars and 8 69 billion dollars respectively the total value of imported and export trade was 19 966 billion dollars the ntm is bordered by inner mongolia and gansu within china as well as by mongolia russia kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan with 11 land border ports xinjiang uygur autonomous region statistics bureau 2013 2017 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 update input output table the present study selected 2016 as the study period as the input output table in china is compiled every five years and national and provincial input output tables for 2017 were not formally released until june 2016 the bi proportional scaling method was used in the current study to update the input output table of xinjiang in 2012 compiled by the xinjiang statistics bureau mcmenamin and haring 1974 the bi proportional scaling method is characterized by low data requirements and rapid tabulation and has been widely used in the compilation and updating of input output tables in various countries and regions fritz et al 2003 almazán gómez et al 2019 fig 2 shows the process adopted for the updated ntm input output table in 2016 2 2 2 distinguishing between local physical water and imported virtual water the classification standard of sectors in the input output table was used to combine the 42 sectors in the input output table into nine sectors appendix table a1 liu 2012 it was assumed that the component proportions of products and services in intermediate use and final demand remained relatively stable in all sectors it was also assumed that the discrepancies in quality among the same kinds of products produced by local and outside sectors were not significant finally it was assumed that the proportions of products produced by local sectors or imported from outside were approximately equal within intermediate use and final demand wang et al 2009 these assumptions are reasonable for the ntm as convenient transportation and free trade has facilitated commodity trading with outside regions yang 2015 the local and imported products were further specified under the above assumptions using the following steps 1 calculate the proportion of final demand and intermediate use of products from various sectors thereby estimating the proportion of the quantity of various imported products so as to estimate the intermediate use and final demand of imported products 2 subtract the intermediate use of imported products from the total intermediate use of all economic sectors in the input output table in 2016 to obtain the intermediate use of local products 3 subtract the final demand of imported products from the total final demand to obtain the final demand of the local products it is worth noting that when accounting for the output of various sectors the imported products consumed by residents should be excluded because they are independent from the production of local sectors whereas imported products for intermediate use are considered to participate in the entire process of economic production and the value of these products is transferred to the output products of local sectors therefore the input output model of allocation in sectors is obtained as 1 k h y i a 1 f 1 f 2 e in eq 1 k and h are the intermediate use vectors of local and imported products in economic production respectively y is the final demand vector of products which includes government and resident expenditure f 1 capital formation f 2 and export e and i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix of technical and economic relationships between each sector the matrix c is further obtained by the eq 2 2 c k h i a 1 i y in eq 2 c is the complete consumption matrix of the economic sector for local and imported products and y is the diagonal matrix of y based on the assumptions mentioned above the complete consumption matrix of local products ck and imported products ch in production is as follows 3 c k c c h c k k h 1 c in eq 3 k and h are the diagonal matrices of total intermediate use of

green water consumed by animal husbandry in the primary industry was not directly regulated it was assumed that only the crop growth process in the agricultural sector of the ntm directly consumed green water and the impact of blue water consumption on changes in green water consumption was not considered zhang et al 2011 therefore the cropwat model developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao was used to simulate the effective rainfall er and irrigation requirement ir of major crops in the ntm following which the consumption of blue and green pw by

2016 including the total output value final consumption gross capital formation and imported export volume were collected from the xinjiang statistical yearbook 2016 and the statistical yearbooks of regions or counties in xinjiang the blue pw consumption data for forestry animal husbandry and fisheries in the primary industry were collected from the xinjiang water resources bulletin 2017 the blue pw consumption data for the secondary and tertiary industries were calculated based on the water consumption per unit of gross domestic product gdp water consumption per unit of value added water consumption quota of industry and output of major products sourced from the xinjiang statistical yearbook 2016 the agricultural sector of the ntm was divided into 15 sub sectors p1 rice p2 wheat p3 coarse cereals p4 soybeans p5 cotton p6 oil plants p7 sugar beets p8 vegetables p9 melons p10 potatoes p11 alfalfa p12 grapes p13 apples p14 fragrant pears and p15 red jujube these 15 sectors accounted for 97 1 of the total cultivated area in the ntm the consumption amounts of blue and green pw by these 15 sub sectors were calculated during which crop growth parameters were derived from the crop database of the fao the effective irrigation area crop yield and other production data were derived from the xinjiang statistical yearbook 2016 meteorological data such as precipitation sunshine hours and temperature were collected from 38 weather stations located in the ntm 3 results 3 1 the consumption of local blue green physical water and imported virtual water total pw in the ntm was 23 063 km3 blue pw 19 966 km3 green pw 3 097 km3 table 1 the agricultural sector in the ntm consumed 72 9 of total pw the agricultural sub sector p5 cotton consumed the largest proportion of blue and green pw accounting for 38 3 of total pw followed by p2 wheat and p3 coarse cereals accounting for 19 9 and 19 1 of total pw respectively fig 3 among the other primary sectors animal husbandry and forestry consumed 9 8 and 9 4 of total pw respectively the secondary and tertiary sectors in the ntm accounted for small proportions of total pw consumed at only 5 3 and 0 8 respectively imported vw consumed by various sectors for intermediate use was much lower than consumption of local pw and while the agricultural sector consumed the majority of imported vw vw constituted only 1 8 of total agricultural water consumption moreover vw was divided into direct and indirect vw direct vw consumed by the agricultural sector 9 283 km3 was lower than that of locally produced blue green pw 16 822 km3 whereas an opposite pattern was evident in the other sectors the demand for imported vw in primary industry 0 393 km3 was higher than that for indirect vw 0 187 km3 whereas the opposite was true for secondary and tertiary industries hence it can be concluded that the dependence of primary industry on local pw was much higher than that of the secondary and tertiary industries whereas the secondary and tertiary industries tended to rely on indirect consumption of vw rather than on local pw 3 2 the transfer of local blue green physical water and imported virtual water eqs 5 and 6 were used to study the transfer of local blue pw green pw and imported vw in economic production fig 4 the high blue pw consumption of primary industry resulted in blue pw being the main source of vw for other industries whereas internal transfer of blue pw in primary industry resulted in this sector having a high vw output taking the agricultural sector as an example the quantity of blue vw used for the internal transfer of vw was 7 402 km3 accounting for 53 9 of total blue pw consumption whereas the internal transfer of green vw also accounted for greater than 50 0 of total green pw compared with the agricultural sector the direct consumption of local blue pw by other sectors was much less however these sectors were able to obtain blue green vw from the local agricultural sector the blue vw transferred from other sectors to the agricultural sector accounted for only 13 of total pw consumed by the agricultural sector in contrast the amount of blue green vw transferred from the agricultural sector to other sectors ranged from 76 forestry to 629 manufacturing of the total pw consumed by other sectors by combining the results of consumption of blue green pw by the 15 agricultural sub sectors outlined in section 3 1 p5 cotton was the sub sector with the largest intermediate use of blue green pw blue pw 5 537 km3 green pw 0 907 km3 this result indicates that cotton contributed most to the indirect blue green vw of other sectors the results showed that the primary industry sectors obtained less vw from imported products whereas other industries showed relatively large demand for imported vw from primary sector products the vw transferred through imported construction and manufacturing products constituted a large proportion of total imported transferred vw the vw from imported agricultural sector products was mainly transferred to manufacturing agricultural sector and animal husbandry by comparing the results of consumption and transfers it was found that the agricultural sector was the largest supplier of vw the construction sector received the highest quantity of vw followed by animal husbandry forestry manufacturing and services the indirect vw consumed by these sectors could be linked to the local blue green pw and imported vw of the agricultural sector the animal husbandry sector received the second highest quantity of vw possibly because this sector consumed a large amount of agricultural sub sector production such as that by the p2 wheat and p3 coarse cereals sub sectors huang and yang 2018 3 3 allocation and trade of virtual water in various sectors fig 5 shows the inter sectoral vw allocation and trade between the ntm and outside regions the results showed that vw export constituted the largest percentage of total vw output of the ntm 43 9 at 10 466 km3 followed by local capital formation and expenditure at 8 911 km3 and 4 492 km3 respectively in addition the direct consumption of imported vw by local residents of 1 466 km3 was higher than that by economic production of 0 806 km3 and direct consumption of imported vw was mainly concentrated in the manufacturing agriculture and construction sectors at 0 664 km3 0 257 km3 and 0 214 km3 respectively the cumulative amount of vw used for local capital formation in the secondary and tertiary industries was higher than that of local expenditure and exports whereas the amount of vw exported for primary industry was higher than that of local capital formation and expenditure ntm was a net export region of vw 8 195 km3 with primary industry being a net exporter of vw 9 458 km3 in contrast the secondary and tertiary industries were net importers of vw 1 135 km3 and 0 129 km3 respectively the export volumes of local blue and green vw were 8 874 km3 and 1 361 km3 respectively of the blue pw and green pw consumed by local economic production 44 5 and 43 9 were converted into vw export respectively among which export of blue vw in the agricultural sector accounted for 56 2 of the total consumption of blue pw the re export of imported vw in all sectors was less than 40 of imported vw consumption ranging from 13 0 to 37 5 it was evident that a large proportion of local blue green water resources were used for the vw export of agricultural products in the ntm 3 4 industrial linkage of various economic sectors eqs 11 and 12 were used to create the bar graph shown in fig 6 which shows the influence coefficient αj and driving force coefficient βi of various sectors in fig 6 the top three most important sub sectors are ranked for each sector and are represented by different colors on the stacked bar chart with grey indicating the combined importance of the remaining six sectors with lowest influence or driving force measures it was clear that 8 construction and 2 forestry had above average influence compared to other sectors of the economy and the αj values of these sectors were higher than the βi values indicating that they were directly highly reliant on products provided by other sectors particularly 6 manufacturing and 9 services meanwhile the 1 agricultural sector also showed a greater impact on 3 animal husbandry 4 fisheries and 6 manufacturing three sectors namely the 1 agricultural sector 6 manufacturing and 4 fisheries showed above average driving force effects when compared with the remaining economic sectors and the βi values of these sectors were higher than their respective αj values an increase in the final demand of production by these sectors would result in increasing vw consumption by the vw receiving economic sector the sectors with the largest contribution of driving forces included 6 manufacturing 8 construction and 9 services 4 discussion 4 1 a unified accounting framework for regional blue green physical water and imported virtual water the process of consumption and transfer of blue green pw and imported vw in the ntm was clarified through the use of an environmental input output model which allowed the study of the allocation characteristics of vw from various sectors previous studies have focused on the consumption and trade flows of vw in the ntm and revealed the typical conflicts resulting from economic development and increasing stress on water resources wang 2019 the results of the current study confirm the findings of several previous studies first the agricultural sector was found to consume the majority of local blue green pw in the ntm whereas consumption of imported vw by the agricultural sector was relatively low compared to that by production and direct consumption by residents lei et al 2019 found that the primary industry consumed 94 1 of water in the ntm in 2012 the present study found that 93 9 of blue green pw consumed by production in the ntm in 2016 was attributed to the primary industry indicating that the region has shown a consistent economic production pattern of domination by basic agriculture for a long period secondly the agricultural sector accounted for the largest net export volume of blue green vw among all economic sectors whereas manufacturing imported the highest volume of vw among all sectors yang et al 2015 concluded that the large amount of vw exported from the local agricultural sector was the main reason for continuously increasing water consumption in the ntm while the present study found that the export of local blue green vw in the agricultural sector accounted for 53 9 of local blue green pw consumption the imported vw of this sector was less than 7 of total vw exported indicating that the agricultural sector established a strong connection with other local sectors through blue green pw this connection hindered the flow of nonlocal agricultural products into the ntm as well as the import of water intensive agricultural products from other regions the export of a large number of water intensive agricultural products would further aggravate the scarcity of local water resources therefore the transfer of pressure of local economic production on water resources to other water rich regions through trade is a challenge in the ntm zhao et al 2010 in addition to the above results the present study offered a novel approach that differs from existing research in three aspects first the present study disaggregated the primary industry sector into an input output framework and further divided direct consumption of blue green pw among the agricultural sub sectors this approach can help water resource managers to determine whether particular crops are suitable for planting in terms of impact to limited local water resources secondly the present study integrated imported vw into the local vw accounting framework to estimate the overall impact of local blue green vw and imported vw on the study area previous studies mostly focused on the status of water resources in the region and generally argued for the import of a number of water intensive products from water rich regions to ensure the security of water resources in water scarce areas zhou 2012 however the results of blue green pw and imported vw consumption and allocation in the present study demonstrated that inland arid areas as represented by ntm should enhance recycling of products of the agricultural sector to indirectly ease the trend of the rapid outflow of local vw through the commodity trade by considering the results of industry linkage analysis the present study also found that the αj and βi of the services electricity mining and separating sectors have double high characteristics relative to other sectors fig 6 i e the influence and driving force coefficients of these sectors services electricity mining and separating are generally higher than those of other sectors which shows that these sectors have greater water storage potential thirdly in terms of vw output the framework created in the present study was able to identify flow of blue green and imported vw in local expenditure capital formation and export respectively which allowed the identification of multiple relevant factors contributing to regional water resources security 4 2 water regulation strategies and sustainable approaches research into the linkages between local blue green pw and imported vw in the ntm is of great significance for achieving sustainable use of water resources in inland arid areas the majority of local blue green pw in the ntm is currently used within the production of low value added agricultural products and the contribution of imported vw to local economic production is relatively low the consumption of imported vw by manufacturing and construction was second only to the agricultural sector these findings can be used to guide water conservation policy and to optimize current agriculture dominated production in the ntm firstly the key to alleviating water stress within the ntm is the regulation of water consumption and vw output in the local primary industry certain measures can be taken by government such as the prohibition of arbitrary reclamation and irrigation area expansion the stabilization of the market prices of various agricultural products the creation of agricultural incentives for discouraging the planting of water intensive crops such as cotton and the provision of economic subsidies to farmers secondly the linkages between local pw and imported vw can be strengthened by increasing the proportion of intermediate demand driven vw of the agricultural sector the government could strengthen economic and technical linkages between the primary industry and other industries such as the development of the livestock processing industry this approach would enhance the use of products of the primary industry within regional economic production thereby allowing products from the local primary industry to be used to greater extent in the region the secondary industry in the ntm is poorly developed compared to that in the coastal areas of china and is characterized by a low level of industrial structure and a low resource utilization efficiency the products of the secondary industry in the ntm therefore consume more pw per unit during the production process further aggravating water resource stress in the ntm wang 2018 therefore the manufacturing sectors such as the petrochemical sector could use more energy efficient equipment promote new technologies within the production process and search for energy saving products or alternative forms of energy such as biomass energy through the import of vw from outside in terms of vw trade flows the government could reduce the export of local water intensive products produced by the primary industry and increase the imports of finished consumable goods produced by the secondary and tertiary industries it is suggested that the ntm should prioritize the development of manufacturing construction or services into which large amounts of vw from local agricultural and livestock products can be input thereby increasing the economic value of vw in the products of the primary industry with the maturation of the conversion of cropland to forest and grassland project in china and the prospering xinjiang through tourism strategy proposed by local government guo 2019 the development of the secondary and tertiary industries could also provide new job opportunities local residents and particularly farmers should be encouraged to engage in social production activities which have higher profit margins and are more in line with the future positive economic development model so as to reduce the loss of vw through production and trade flow in the primary industry 4 3 limitations although the present study elucidates the relationship between local blue green pw and imported vw in the ntm some shortcomings due to the limitations on data acquisition remain and certain analysis methods require further research one of the limitations of the current study was that there was no distinction between groundwater and surface water within the consumption by all sectors in economic production according to statistics groundwater consumption by economic production within the ntm increased from 3 976 km3 in 2006 to 6 599 km3 in 2016 indicating that there is rapidly increasing exploitation of groundwater in the ntm by economic production xinjiang water resources bulletin 2007 2017 therefore future studies should distinguish between the dependence of local economic sectors on surface water and groundwater the present study also assumed that locally produced products and imported products were of similar quality and the compositions of local and imported products involved in the transfer of vw were obtained according to the proportions of the two kinds of products within intermediate use while this approach may not fully represent reality the assumption is considered reasonable on the one hand the economic outputs of various sectors in the ntm changed little from 2012 to 2016 and the proportions of import and export trade of related products remained basically stable xinjiang uygur autonomous region statistics bureau 2013 2017 on the other hand on the basis of foreign trade policy issued by local government supply and demand and the market price of local and imported products changed little resulting in small differences in quality between local and imported products in the ntm song et al 2019 the present study also used the bi proportional scaling method to update the current input output table since the update interval used has an impact on the accuracy of economic production data the analysis of results may have been affected to some extent however due to the complexity of the input output table structure difficulties in the update of data are common within input output analysis 5 conclusion the present study provided a comprehensive framework to account for consumption and linkages between local blue green pw and imported vw within economic production in the ntm based on a combination of environmental input output analysis and the cropwat model the framework presented in the current study can be used to explain the high pressure of blue green pw consumption within local economic production and the difficulties encountered when importing water intensive products into the agriculture dominated inland arid region more specifically blue green water in the agricultural sector constituted the main body of the water cycle in the ntm and while imported vw remained relatively small it was concentrated in the agricultural sector manufacturing and construction the amount of vw outputted was higher than that used for local capital formation and expenditure vw trade resulted in the export of 44 5 43 9 and 10 2 of local blue water green water and imported vw respectively to other regions the results showed that the structure of local industry was not conducive to water resources storage whereas low consumption within the ntm and the high demand in outside regions for products of the primary industry were the direct reasons for the outflow of blue green vw the ntm was found to be a net vw exporting region since exported vw was mainly contained in water intensive products such as cotton this vw trade pattern would aggravate the pressure on water resources in the short term whereas over the long run this vw pattern was not conducive to local social stability and economic development the results showed that the ntm is facing similar challenges to many other inland arid regions and this region has drawn considerable attention bazrafshan et al 2020 cui et al 2018 bae and dall erba 2018 with a focus on solving the outflow of vw of the agriculture dominated inland arid region resulting from economic development these results also show that although inland arid regions are constantly developing water saving technologies local water resources are becoming increasingly scarce meanwhile the results of economic sector linkage analysis such as the influence and driving force coefficients can be linked with regional industrial development policy measures which will facilitate the identification of sectors in the region with water saving and water storage potential thereby providing some sustainable solutions or future industrial restructuring future research can extended the current framework to a multi region input output analysis framework to compare vw flow of local areas with nonlocal areas under bilateral or multi lateral trade thereby providing a more systematic

normal university lanzhou 730000 china corresponding author 1 these authors contributed equally to this study and share first authorship the consumption of local blue green physical water blue green pw is linked to imported virtual water imported vw within economic production the quantitative analysis of interactions between blue green pw and imported vw is important for integrated management of water resources in inland arid areas this study used the north tianshan mountains ntm as a case study to demonstrate the construction of a framework to account for local blue green pw and imported vw in regional economic production using an input output model the results showed that the consumption and transfer of blue green pw in the agricultural sector constitute the most important part of the water cycle in the ntm production consumed relatively less imported vw 51 3 of which was by the secondary and tertiary industries vw consumed by the primary industry in the ntm was closely correlated with that by the secondary and tertiary industries whereas low consumption by the primary industry in the ntm and high demand for primary industry products from outside regions resulted in the direct outflow of large amount of blue green vw the current structure of trade in vw also contributed to increasing water shortages in the ntm this study proposed that the enhancement of the cyclic strength of the primary industry in the local economic system is an effective measure to reduce water loss and improve water utilization efficiency in addition by considering the results of industrial linkage analysis of economic sectors this study proposed that the government should promote the development of industries with large water storage potential such as construction manufacturing and forestry and that adjustment of the structure of local industries should be accelerated so as to reduce the loss of vw during local economic production and trade flows of the primary industry keywords blue water green water imported virtual water virtual water trade industrial linkage 1 introduction it is widely recognized that the rapid acceleration of the development of human society and the economy over recent decades has resulted in increasingly frequent and more severe water shortages and anthropogenic activities are having a profound impact on the dynamics of water resource conditions and on the health of the ecological environment hoekstra et al 2012 zeitoun et al 2013 over the last two decades the focus of water resources management and assessment has gradually changed from physical water pw to physical water virtual water vw this change of focus has promoted a more comprehensive approach to improving water management and alleviating regional water shortages allan 1993 it is clear that pw and vw are highly interdependent as not only is local pw directly consumed during economic production in a region but it is also consumed as part of local vw and imported vw and can flow across economic sectors and regions through the supply chain zhang et al 2019 this recognition of the relationship between pw vw has become the basis for management of water resources among competing demands within different economic sectors zhang et al 2011 mubako and lant 2013 past studies on the linkages between pw and vw have mainly focused on the flow of pw and vw resources between regions and the analysis of the relationship between socio economic activities and water consumption at different scales the research of pw vw flow at a global level has mainly focused on describing the impact of global trade on water resources quantitative research on pw vw flow at the regional level has mainly focused on the impact of trade in vw on local resources and the economy chen et al 2013 some studies have also focused on the relationship between blue pw and blue vw within a single region liu et al 2017 despite the numerous past studies on pw vw some shortcomings and uncertainties remain past studies have mainly concentrated on country or basin level study areas and few studies have divided the study area according to administrative borders by adopting an administrative spatial scale transfer characteristics of pw vw within or across administrative regions under the influence of local policies and industrial structure can be highlighted in addition few studies have comprehensively considered the transformations between local blue water green water and imported vw among industries among these green water can be described as water that infiltrates soil and is stored in unsaturated soil through precipitation whereas green vw plays an important role in reducing production input cost and maintaining ecosystem services during regional industrial development hou et al 2018 in addition under conditions of local water resources and imported vw being activated concurrently in a region few studies have use industrial linkage indicators to evaluate local industries with greater future potential for increasing water storage capacity and development potential wang et al 2019a for some water scarce administrative regions the above three points are extremely important for rational allocation of local water resources and industrial adjustment within some water scarce administrative regions the present study approached the linkage between pw and vw from two perspectives the first was the application of a bottom up crop growth and water use model for water accounting haida et al 2019 the tracking of indirect water consumption through various links in the industrial supply chain is a challenge under this method in addition agricultural products are regarded as primary products under this approach and are located at the starting point of the industrial supply chain therefore the bottom up method is more suitable for calculating vw consumption of the agricultural sector in contrast the top down approach generally involves the application of a life cycle assessment or input output analysis the top down approach starts from the highest level defined by the system boundary moving down to lower levels in which the input output method can distinguish between intermediate use and final demand within the economic production processes mannan et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 input output analysis is able to avoid truncation errors and can facilitate the tracking of the vw flow direction of the entire economic sector by regional water managers the results of input output analysis can reflect the inter sectoral linkage of vw flow through the various supply chains of industries however because this method considers the overall economic activity of the region the resolution of accounting needs to be constrained by reducing the categories within the sector for example within the application of the method to vw accounting in agriculture dominated regions the method generally lacks sufficient detail for consideration of the components of different crop types in the agricultural sector zhao et al 2017 previous studies in which input output analysis was conducted within certain developing countries or regions generally grouped forestry animal husbandry fisheries and production of various crops in the agricultural sector into a single sector due to data limitations zhang and anadon 2014 recent development of a hybrid approach has appended the bottom up satellite approaches with more detailed representation of agricultural sectors to the top down input output model this hybrid approach has been applied to vw research at a global level and within the european union wang and zimmerman 2016 steen olsen et al 2012 however agricultural water use remains the dominant water use in most countries and regions around the world particularly in china as the scale of foreign trade imports and exports continues to expand imported vw has participated extensively in regional economic development in the form of imported products zhang et al 2016 therefore the use of this hybrid approach for the analysis of pw vw relationships in a region requires the consideration of vw imported from other regions this consideration is particularly important for comprehensive research within economically underdeveloped regions dominated by agriculture and can be more in line with the current strategic layout of vw and actual economic development needs of water scarce countries or regions zhang et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the present study applied a combination of input output analysis and the cropwat model to propose a blue green pw and imported vw transfer accounting framework for a typical inland arid region with an agriculture dominated economy the study area of the present study was the north tianshan mountains ntm incorporating ten administrative districts namely changji bozhou ili tacheng altay shihezi urumqi karamay turpan and hami fig 1 the present study calculated the consumption of blue and green water by 15 crop production sub sectors in the agricultural sector based on the accounting framework the transfer and allocation between local blue green water and imported vw was analyzed for various economic sectors industries with water storage development potential in the ntm were evaluated through industrial linkage indicators the current study further analyzed the causes of the large outflow of vw from the study area and the factors hindering the inflow of vw into the study area from outside regions the framework presented in the current study can be used as a prospective analytical tool to guide the management of water resources in inland arid areas the framework is also broadly applicable to inland arid areas in china or internationally and can provide a reference for the implementation of a local vw strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 physical setting the ntm is located in the hinterland of eurasia and has a total area of 60 26 104 km2 the ntm has a typical temperate continental arid climate with an average annual precipitation and evaporation of 150 mm 200 mm and 1 500 mm 2 700 mm respectively and an average annual temperature of 5 9 the total amounts of precipitation and water resources in the ntm in 2016 were 121 03 km³ and 44 43 km³ respectively among which surface and underground water amounts were 42 15 km³ and 23 06 km³ respectively and the amount of underground water with no interaction with surface water was 20 77 km³ lei et al 2019 in addition the total population of the ntm in 2016 was 1 241 104 and the annual output of the social economy was 90 035 billion dollars the tertiary industry had the highest output 43 40 billion dollars whereas those of the secondary and the primary industries were 37 939 billion dollars and 8 69 billion dollars respectively the total value of imported and export trade was 19 966 billion dollars the ntm is bordered by inner mongolia and gansu within china as well as by mongolia russia kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan with 11 land border ports xinjiang uygur autonomous region statistics bureau 2013 2017 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 update input output table the present study selected 2016 as the study period as the input output table in china is compiled every five years and national and provincial input output tables for 2017 were not formally released until june 2016 the bi proportional scaling method was used in the current study to update the input output table of xinjiang in 2012 compiled by the xinjiang statistics bureau mcmenamin and haring 1974 the bi proportional scaling method is characterized by low data requirements and rapid tabulation and has been widely used in the compilation and updating of input output tables in various countries and regions fritz et al 2003 almazán gómez et al 2019 fig 2 shows the process adopted for the updated ntm input output table in 2016 2 2 2 distinguishing between local physical water and imported virtual water the classification standard of sectors in the input output table was used to combine the 42 sectors in the input output table into nine sectors appendix table a1 liu 2012 it was assumed that the component proportions of products and services in intermediate use and final demand remained relatively stable in all sectors it was also assumed that the discrepancies in quality among the same kinds of products produced by local and outside sectors were not significant finally it was assumed that the proportions of products produced by local sectors or imported from outside were approximately equal within intermediate use and final demand wang et al 2009 these assumptions are reasonable for the ntm as convenient transportation and free trade has facilitated commodity trading with outside regions yang 2015 the local and imported products were further specified under the above assumptions using the following steps 1 calculate the proportion of final demand and intermediate use of products from various sectors thereby estimating the proportion of the quantity of various imported products so as to estimate the intermediate use and final demand of imported products 2 subtract the intermediate use of imported products from the total intermediate use of all economic sectors in the input output table in 2016 to obtain the intermediate use of local products 3 subtract the final demand of imported products from the total final demand to obtain the final demand of the local products it is worth noting that when accounting for the output of various sectors the imported products consumed by residents should be excluded because they are independent from the production of local sectors whereas imported products for intermediate use are considered to participate in the entire process of economic production and the value of these products is transferred to the output products of local sectors therefore the input output model of allocation in sectors is obtained as 1 k h y i a 1 f 1 f 2 e in eq 1 k and h are the intermediate use vectors of local and imported products in economic production respectively y is the final demand vector of products which includes government and resident expenditure f 1 capital formation f 2 and export e and i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix of technical and economic relationships between each sector the matrix c is further obtained by the eq 2 2 c k h i a 1 i y in eq 2 c is the complete consumption matrix of the economic sector for local and imported products and y is the diagonal matrix of y based on the assumptions mentioned above the complete consumption matrix of local products ck and imported products ch in production is as follows 3 c k c c h c k k h 1 c in eq 3 k and h are the diagonal matrices of total intermediate use of local products and imported products respectively the vw coefficient matrix of the sectors from the perspective of production is obtained tan et al 2019 4 w t w d i a 1 in eq 4 wt is the coefficient matrix of complete water consumption and wd is the coefficient matrix of direct water consumption hence the transfer matrix of local physical water in economic production wk is expressed as 5 w k w d c k the substitution method which is widely used in the study of the regional energy trade is used to calculate the vw volume in nonlocal input products wang et al 2019b the transfer matrix of

2016 including the total output value final consumption gross capital formation and imported export volume were collected from the xinjiang statistical yearbook 2016 and the statistical yearbooks of regions or counties in xinjiang the blue pw consumption data for forestry animal husbandry and fisheries in the primary industry were collected from the xinjiang water resources bulletin 2017 the blue pw consumption data for the secondary and tertiary industries were calculated based on the water consumption per unit of gross domestic product gdp water consumption per unit of value added water consumption quota of industry and output of major products sourced from the xinjiang statistical yearbook 2016 the agricultural sector of the ntm was divided into 15 sub sectors p1 rice p2 wheat p3 coarse cereals p4 soybeans p5 cotton p6 oil plants p7 sugar beets p8 vegetables p9 melons p10 potatoes p11 alfalfa p12 grapes p13 apples p14 fragrant pears and p15 red jujube these 15 sectors accounted for 97 1 of the total cultivated area in the ntm the consumption amounts of blue and green pw by these 15 sub sectors were calculated during which crop growth parameters were derived from the crop database of the fao the effective irrigation area crop yield and other production data were derived from the xinjiang statistical yearbook 2016 meteorological data such as precipitation sunshine hours and temperature were collected from 38 weather stations located in the ntm 3 results 3 1 the consumption of local blue green physical water and imported virtual water total pw in the ntm was 23 063 km3 blue pw 19 966 km3 green pw 3 097 km3 table 1 the agricultural sector in the ntm consumed 72 9 of total pw the agricultural sub sector p5 cotton consumed the largest proportion of blue and green pw accounting for 38 3 of total pw followed by p2 wheat and p3 coarse cereals accounting for 19 9 and 19 1 of total pw respectively fig 3 among the other primary sectors animal husbandry and forestry consumed 9 8 and 9 4 of total pw respectively the secondary and tertiary sectors in the ntm accounted for small proportions of total pw consumed at only 5 3 and 0 8 respectively imported vw consumed by various sectors for intermediate use was much lower than consumption of local pw and while the agricultural sector consumed the majority of imported vw vw constituted only 1 8 of total agricultural water consumption moreover vw was divided into direct and indirect vw direct vw consumed by the agricultural sector 9 283 km3 was lower than that of locally produced blue green pw 16 822 km3 whereas an opposite pattern was evident in the other sectors the demand for imported vw in primary industry 0 393 km3 was higher than that for indirect vw 0 187 km3 whereas the opposite was true for secondary and tertiary industries hence it can be concluded that the dependence of primary industry on local pw was much higher than that of the secondary and tertiary industries whereas the secondary and tertiary industries tended to rely on indirect consumption of vw rather than on local pw 3 2 the transfer of local blue green physical water and imported virtual water eqs 5 and 6 were used to study the transfer of local blue pw green pw and imported vw in economic production fig 4 the high blue pw consumption of primary industry resulted in blue pw being the main source of vw for other industries whereas internal transfer of blue pw in primary industry resulted in this sector having a high vw output taking the agricultural sector as an example the quantity of blue vw used for the internal transfer of vw was 7 402 km3 accounting for 53 9 of total blue pw consumption whereas the internal transfer of green vw also accounted for greater than 50 0 of total green pw compared with the agricultural sector the direct consumption of local blue pw by other sectors was much less however these sectors were able to obtain blue green vw from the local agricultural sector the blue vw transferred from other sectors to the agricultural sector accounted for only 13 of total pw consumed by the agricultural sector in contrast the amount of blue green vw transferred from the agricultural sector to other sectors ranged from 76 forestry to 629 manufacturing of the total pw consumed by other sectors by combining the results of consumption of blue green pw by the 15 agricultural sub sectors outlined in section 3 1 p5 cotton was the sub sector with the largest intermediate use of blue green pw blue pw 5 537 km3 green pw 0 907 km3 this result indicates that cotton contributed most to the indirect blue green vw of other sectors the results showed that the primary industry sectors obtained less vw from imported products whereas other industries showed relatively large demand for imported vw from primary sector products the vw transferred through imported construction and manufacturing products constituted a large proportion of total imported transferred vw the vw from imported agricultural sector products was mainly transferred to manufacturing agricultural sector and animal husbandry by comparing the results of consumption and transfers it was found that the agricultural sector was the largest supplier of vw the construction sector received the highest quantity of vw followed by animal husbandry forestry manufacturing and services the indirect vw consumed by these sectors could be linked to the local blue green pw and imported vw of the agricultural sector the animal husbandry sector received the second highest quantity of vw possibly because this sector consumed a large amount of agricultural sub sector production such as that by the p2 wheat and p3 coarse cereals sub sectors huang and yang 2018 3 3 allocation and trade of virtual water in various sectors fig 5 shows the inter sectoral vw allocation and trade between the ntm and outside regions the results showed that vw export constituted the largest percentage of total vw output of the ntm 43 9 at 10 466 km3 followed by local capital formation and expenditure at 8 911 km3 and 4 492 km3 respectively in addition the direct consumption of imported vw by local residents of 1 466 km3 was higher than that by economic production of 0 806 km3 and direct consumption of imported vw was mainly concentrated in the manufacturing agriculture and construction sectors at 0 664 km3 0 257 km3 and 0 214 km3 respectively the cumulative amount of vw used for local capital formation in the secondary and tertiary industries was higher than that of local expenditure and exports whereas the amount of vw exported for primary industry was higher than that of local capital formation and expenditure ntm was a net export region of vw 8 195 km3 with primary industry being a net exporter of vw 9 458 km3 in contrast the secondary and tertiary industries were net importers of vw 1 135 km3 and 0 129 km3 respectively the export volumes of local blue and green vw were 8 874 km3 and 1 361 km3 respectively of the blue pw and green pw consumed by local economic production 44 5 and 43 9 were converted into vw export respectively among which export of blue vw in the agricultural sector accounted for 56 2 of the total consumption of blue pw the re export of imported vw in all sectors was less than 40 of imported vw consumption ranging from 13 0 to 37 5 it was evident that a large proportion of local blue green water resources were used for the vw export of agricultural products in the ntm 3 4 industrial linkage of various economic sectors eqs 11 and 12 were used to create the bar graph shown in fig 6 which shows the influence coefficient αj and driving force coefficient βi of various sectors in fig 6 the top three most important sub sectors are ranked for each sector and are represented by different colors on the stacked bar chart with grey indicating the combined importance of the remaining six sectors with lowest influence or driving force measures it was clear that 8 construction and 2 forestry had above average influence compared to other sectors of the economy and the αj values of these sectors were higher than the βi values indicating that they were directly highly reliant on products provided by other sectors particularly 6 manufacturing and 9 services meanwhile the 1 agricultural sector also showed a greater impact on 3 animal husbandry 4 fisheries and 6 manufacturing three sectors namely the 1 agricultural sector 6 manufacturing and 4 fisheries showed above average driving force effects when compared with the remaining economic sectors and the βi values of these sectors were higher than their respective αj values an increase in the final demand of production by these sectors would result in increasing vw consumption by the vw receiving economic sector the sectors with the largest contribution of driving forces included 6 manufacturing 8 construction and 9 services 4 discussion 4 1 a unified accounting framework for regional blue green physical water and imported virtual water the process of consumption and transfer of blue green pw and imported vw in the ntm was clarified through the use of an environmental input output model which allowed the study of the allocation characteristics of vw from various sectors previous studies have focused on the consumption and trade flows of vw in the ntm and revealed the typical conflicts resulting from economic development and increasing stress on water resources wang 2019 the results of the current study confirm the findings of several previous studies first the agricultural sector was found to consume the majority of local blue green pw in the ntm whereas consumption of imported vw by the agricultural sector was relatively low compared to that by production and direct consumption by residents lei et al 2019 found that the primary industry consumed 94 1 of water in the ntm in 2012 the present study found that 93 9 of blue green pw consumed by production in the ntm in 2016 was attributed to the primary industry indicating that the region has shown a consistent economic production pattern of domination by basic agriculture for a long period secondly the agricultural sector accounted for the largest net export volume of blue green vw among all economic sectors whereas manufacturing imported the highest volume of vw among all sectors yang et al 2015 concluded that the large amount of vw exported from the local agricultural sector was the main reason for continuously increasing water consumption in the ntm while the present study found that the export of local blue green vw in the agricultural sector accounted for 53 9 of local blue green pw consumption the imported vw of this sector was less than 7 of total vw exported indicating that the agricultural sector established a strong connection with other local sectors through blue green pw this connection hindered the flow of nonlocal agricultural products into the ntm as well as the import of water intensive agricultural products from other regions the export of a large number of water intensive agricultural products would further aggravate the scarcity of local water resources therefore the transfer of pressure of local economic production on water resources to other water rich regions through trade is a challenge in the ntm zhao et al 2010 in addition to the above results the present study offered a novel approach that differs from existing research in three aspects first the present study disaggregated the primary industry sector into an input output framework and further divided direct consumption of blue green pw among the agricultural sub sectors this approach can help water resource managers to determine whether particular crops are suitable for planting in terms of impact to limited local water resources secondly the present study integrated imported vw into the local vw accounting framework to estimate the overall impact of local blue green vw and imported vw on the study area previous studies mostly focused on the status of water resources in the region and generally argued for the import of a number of water intensive products from water rich regions to ensure the security of water resources in water scarce areas zhou 2012 however the results of blue green pw and imported vw consumption and allocation in the present study demonstrated that inland arid areas as represented by ntm should enhance recycling of products of the agricultural sector to indirectly ease the trend of the rapid outflow of local vw through the commodity trade by considering the results of industry linkage analysis the present study also found that the αj and βi of the services electricity mining and separating sectors have double high characteristics relative to other sectors fig 6 i e the influence and driving force coefficients of these sectors services electricity mining and separating are generally higher than those of other sectors which shows that these sectors have greater water storage potential thirdly in terms of vw output the framework created in the present study was able to identify flow of blue green and imported vw in local expenditure capital formation and export respectively which allowed the identification of multiple relevant factors contributing to regional water resources security 4 2 water regulation strategies and sustainable approaches research into the linkages between local blue green pw and imported vw in the ntm is of great significance for achieving sustainable use of water resources in inland arid areas the majority of local blue green pw in the ntm is currently used within the production of low value added agricultural products and the contribution of imported vw to local economic production is relatively low the consumption of imported vw by manufacturing and construction was second only to the agricultural sector these findings can be used to guide water conservation policy and to optimize current agriculture dominated production in the ntm firstly the key to alleviating water stress within the ntm is the regulation of water consumption and vw output in the local primary industry certain measures can be taken by government such as the prohibition of arbitrary reclamation and irrigation area expansion the stabilization of the market prices of various agricultural products the creation of agricultural incentives for discouraging the planting of water intensive crops such as cotton and the provision of economic subsidies to farmers secondly the linkages between local pw and imported vw can be strengthened by increasing the proportion of intermediate demand driven vw of the agricultural sector the government could strengthen economic and technical linkages between the primary industry and other industries such as the development of the livestock processing industry this approach would enhance the use of products of the primary industry within regional economic production thereby allowing products from the local primary industry to be used to greater extent in the region the secondary industry in the ntm is poorly developed compared to that in the coastal areas of china and is characterized by a low level of industrial structure and a low resource utilization efficiency the products of the secondary industry in the ntm therefore consume more pw per unit during the production process further aggravating water resource stress in the ntm wang 2018 therefore the manufacturing sectors such as the petrochemical sector could use more energy efficient equipment promote new technologies within the production process and search for energy saving products or alternative forms of energy such as biomass energy through the import of vw from outside in terms of vw trade flows the government could reduce the export of local water intensive products produced by the primary industry and increase the imports of finished consumable goods produced by the secondary and tertiary industries it is suggested that the ntm should prioritize the development of manufacturing construction or services into which large amounts of vw from local agricultural and livestock products can be input thereby increasing the economic value of vw in the products of the primary industry with the maturation of the conversion of cropland to forest and grassland project in china and the prospering xinjiang through tourism strategy proposed by local government guo 2019 the development of the secondary and tertiary industries could also provide new job opportunities local residents and particularly farmers should be encouraged to engage in social production activities which have higher profit margins and are more in line with the future positive economic development model so as to reduce the loss of vw through production and trade flow in the primary industry 4 3 limitations although the present study elucidates the relationship between local blue green pw and imported vw in the ntm some shortcomings due to the limitations on data acquisition remain and certain analysis methods require further research one of the limitations of the current study was that there was no distinction between groundwater and surface water within the consumption by all sectors in economic production according to statistics groundwater consumption by economic production within the ntm increased from 3 976 km3 in 2006 to 6 599 km3 in 2016 indicating that there is rapidly increasing exploitation of groundwater in the ntm by economic production xinjiang water resources bulletin 2007 2017 therefore future studies should distinguish between the dependence of local economic sectors on surface water and groundwater the present study also assumed that locally produced products and imported products were of similar quality and the compositions of local and imported products involved in the transfer of vw were obtained according to the proportions of the two kinds of products within intermediate use while this approach may not fully represent reality the assumption is considered reasonable on the one hand the economic outputs of various sectors in the ntm changed little from 2012 to 2016 and the proportions of import and export trade of related products remained basically stable xinjiang uygur autonomous region statistics bureau 2013 2017 on the other hand on the basis of foreign trade policy issued by local government supply and demand and the market price of local and imported products changed little resulting in small differences in quality between local and imported products in the ntm song et al 2019 the present study also used the bi proportional scaling method to update the current input output table since the update interval used has an impact on the accuracy of economic production data the analysis of results may have been affected to some extent however due to the complexity of the input output table structure difficulties in the update of data are common within input output analysis 5 conclusion the present study provided a comprehensive framework to account for consumption and linkages between local blue green pw and imported vw within economic production in the ntm based on a combination of environmental input output analysis and the cropwat model the framework presented in the current study can be used to explain the high pressure of blue green pw consumption within local economic production and the difficulties encountered when importing water intensive products into the agriculture dominated inland arid region more specifically blue green water in the agricultural sector constituted the main body of the water cycle in the ntm and while imported vw remained relatively small it was concentrated in the agricultural sector manufacturing and construction the amount of vw outputted was higher than that used for local capital formation and expenditure vw trade resulted in the export of 44 5 43 9 and 10 2 of local blue water green water and imported vw respectively to other regions the results showed that the structure of local industry was not conducive to water resources storage whereas low consumption within the ntm and the high demand in outside regions for products of the primary industry were the direct reasons for the outflow of blue green vw the ntm was found to be a net vw exporting region since exported vw was mainly contained in water intensive products such as cotton this vw trade pattern would aggravate the pressure on water resources in the short term whereas over the long run this vw pattern was not conducive to local social stability and economic development the results showed that the ntm is facing similar challenges to many other inland arid regions and this region has drawn considerable attention bazrafshan et al 2020 cui et al 2018 bae and dall erba 2018 with a focus on solving the outflow of vw of the agriculture dominated inland arid region resulting from economic development these results also show that although inland arid regions are constantly developing water saving technologies local water resources are becoming increasingly scarce meanwhile the results of economic sector linkage analysis such as the influence and driving force coefficients can be linked with regional industrial development policy measures which will facilitate the identification of sectors in the region with water saving and water storage potential thereby providing some sustainable solutions or future industrial restructuring future research can extended the current framework to a multi region input output analysis framework to compare vw flow of local areas with nonlocal areas under bilateral or multi lateral trade thereby providing a more systematic

323,we encounter three phase flow in porous media within a range of settings such as enhanced oil recovery geologic co2 sequestration and groundwater remediation while an abundance of studies has been performed on the behavior of two fluid phases e g oil water or air water in porous media relatively little information exists for three phase flow systems e g oil water air this work explores the relationships between capillary pressure pc saturation s and fluid fluid interfacial area a for water wet three phase flow systems where water is the wetting phase oil is the intermediate wet phase and air or gas is the non wetting phase specifically we examine whether the pc s a relationships exhibit hysteresis during drainage and imbibition cycles we present data collected via x ray microtomography resulting in high resolution three dimensional images of the fluid configurations for varying degrees of saturation among the findings of the study based on the available data we highlight that 1 the pc s a relationship is non hysteretic for both the oil water fluid pair and the air oil fluid pair and 2 that this same relationship is independent of the initial water saturation at the point of air injection this finding suggests that both the oil water and air oil fluid pairs in a three phase system can be adequately described by the thermodynamics based theory originally proposed by hassanizadeh and gray 1993 as is the case for the equivalent two phase system keywords three phase flow capillary pressure saturation hysteresis interfacial area thermodynamics 1 introduction multi phase flow in porous media includes many scenarios of relevance to subsurface flow multi phase flow particularly three phase flow is studied in fields as varied as petroleum engineering environmental engineering and groundwater hydrology we may encounter a three phase system when a non aqueous phase liquid napl leaks from an underground storage tank into an unsaturated zone of the subsurface during geologic carbon sequestration when co2 is injected into a depleted oil reservoir and trapped or when oil recovery is enhanced via air injection sophisticated models of the interactions of the various fluids and the porous medium are required for accurate prediction of fluid configurations and potential movement during such scenarios there are a myriad of experimental results and numerical models to help better understand subsurface multi phase flow and an integral component of modeling fluid flow behavior is the capillary pressure saturation pc s relationship generally attempts at numerical simulation of a multi phase flow system begin with this relationship yet many studies have led to the conclusion that capillary pressure is not uniquely dependent on the saturation of the system but it is also dependent on the saturation history of the system thus introducing the concept of hysteresis e g fenwick and blunt 1998 lenhard 1992 the inherent hysteresis in porous media systems has made it difficult to develop appropriate models of flow in such systems the failure of the capillary pressure saturation relationship to uniquely describe drainage and imbibition in multi phase systems led researchers to reexamine how we describe multi phase flow in porous media from a thermodynamic perspective among those hassanizadeh and gray 1990 developed an extended form of darcy s law using momentum balance equations and determined that capillary pressure is a function of not just saturation but exhibits a dependence on fluid fluid interfacial area aij as well they proposed that the traditional hysteresis observed in the pc s relationship is actually a projection of the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area pc s a surface onto the capillary pressure saturation pc s plane hassanizadeh and gray 1993 the model developed by hassanizadeh and gray 1993 has subsequently been shown for instance via pore scale network modeling held and celia 2001 to be fully defined for a two phase flow system when using either interfacial area or common lines that is the fluid fluid solid contact lines as the third variable the concept has been further refined in recent modeling work by e g mcclure et al 2016 who found that to produce closure relations for models based on continuum mechanics another topological invariant besides interfacial area namely the euler characteristic can help to uniquely describe two phase flow systems using advanced experimental techniques many two phase flow experiments have also been performed to test the theory originally introduced by hassanizadeh and gray 1990 chen et al 2007 used a two dimensional etched lithography micromodel to show that capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surfaces were unique for their studied system eliminating hysteresis chen et al 2007 similarly using three dimensional x ray microtomography porter et al 2009 verified the two dimensional findings of chen et al 2007 and also showed that due to the non hysteretic nature of the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surface scanning curve data is not required to describe the relationship it is fully defined by the main branches porter et al 2009 the surface created by the three state variables can then be fitted with a biquadratic polynomial and is smooth on the continuum scale porter et al 2010 reeves and celia 1996 with the understanding of the importance of interfacial area as a state variable in defining a system additional models have been developed including models that allow for prediction of the interfacial area saturation relationship from the capillary pressure saturation relationship and pore size distribution diamantopoulos et al 2016 and for using the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surface to model interfacial areas for non equilibrium systems joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 most recently both karadimitriou et al 2014 and godinez brizuela et al 2017 using two dimensional micromodel experiments and meisenheimer et al 2020 in three dimensional systems have shown that for a specific porous medium transient non equilibrium and quasi static quasi equilibrium capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surfaces are statistically different suggesting that a single relationship does not exist independent of flow condition traditionally three phase flow has been extended from two phase descriptions by expanding two phase capillary pressure equivalents e g lenhard and parker 1988 kantzas et al 1998 which is a reasonable approximation for water wet systems where water is wetting phase oil intermediate wet phase and air is non wetting phase this implies that conceptually water will occupy the smallest pores and corners of larger pores air will occupy the central part of the largest pores and oil will occupy the intermediate sized pores as well as layers between air and water in pore corners in theory if there is no or little contact between air and water this further implies that oil water capillary pressure could be assumed to be a function of water saturation only while air oil capillary pressure could be considered to be a function of only air saturation or equivalently total liquid saturation e g lenhard and parker 1988 however if all three phases in a system are in contact in the same pore this affects all the capillary pressures and the system can no longer be modeled using a two phase capillary pressure relationship piri and blunt 2004 lenhard and parker 1988 instead the three phase capillary pressures must generally be described as functions of two saturations van dijke and sorbie 2007 helland and skjæveland 2006 irrespective of the saturation dependencies of the capillary pressures these relationships will still exhibit hysteresis and it is not known whether the inclusion of interfacial area will eliminate this hysteresis from such relationships in three phase flow systems another problem with the prediction of three phase flow in porous media is that the models used are often based on darcy s law which is generally not valid in three phase flow because movement of phase segments that are not hydraulically connected typically occurs e g van dijke et al 2004 helland et al 2019 examples of such motions are double displacements in which a continuous phase displaces a disconnected ganglion of another phase that in turn displaces a continuous third phase due to capillary forces van dijke et al 2004 khishvand et al 2016 helland et al 2019 and multiple displacements where the continuous phases displace a chain of several disconnected phase ganglia e g qin et al 2019 scanziani et al 2020a jettestuen et al 2020 this means that three phase experiments must be performed to verify whether these theories originated with hassanizadeh and gray 1990 are still valid with the addition of another fluid phase recently three phase flow experiments of water alternate gas invasions in porous rocks have been combined with x ray microtomography imaging for visualization and characterization of three phase fluid distributions a major part of these investigations has focused on imaging the fluids at static states after invasion e g iglauer et al 2013 carroll et al 2015 scanziani et al 2018 alhosani et al 2019 or at steady state flow conditions khishvand et al 2016 sabti et al 2019 qin et al 2019 analysis of multi phase images after different fluid invasions was used to gain insights of fluid distributions and pore occupancies with respect to pore size scanziani et al 2018 qin et al 2019 sabti et al 2019 alhosani et al 2019 alhosani et al 2021 occurrence of double and multiple displacements khishvand et al 2016 scanziani et al 2018 qin et al 2019 alhosani et al 2019 trapping and morphological description of fluid ganglia iglauer et al 2013 carroll et al 2015 iglauer et al 2016 iglauer et al 2019 wettability in three phase systems khishvand et al 2016 iglauer et al 2019 alhosani et al 2021 as well as states of interfacial area and capillary pressure after invasion qin et al 2019 alhosani et al 2021 imaging at dynamic three phase flow conditions have been used to analyze pore scale displacement mechanisms like double and multiple displacements in more detail and how interfacial area and capillary pressure changes over time scanziani et al 2020a scanziani et al 2020b alhosani et al 2020 however little emphasis has been placed on exploring hysteresis between drainage and imbibition in three phase systems neither for quasi static nor dynamic flow conditions as illustrated above the basic premise that hysteresis in the pc s relationship can be alleviated by inclusion of topological invariants such as interfacial configurations remains largely unexplored for three phase flow systems and is thus the focus of this research specifically the objective of the study was to determine experimentally whether each of the phase pairs in a water wet three phase system air water air oil and oil water can be described via a capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship thus allowing us to establish a more robust model to describe three phase flow including hysteresis to this end we investigated if the hysteresis between three phase drainage and imbibition cycles in water wet bead packs can be eliminated by adding interfacial areas to the respective capillary pressure saturation relationships 2 materials and methods to create a simplified porous medium matrix a mixture of soda lime glass beads was placed in a glass column height 45 mm inner diameter 5 mm using this manufactured porous medium as opposed to core samples of real rock allows for complete control over the wettability characteristics of the medium as well as for more consistent physical properties porosity mineralogy permeability etc between successive experiments a glass bead mixture with bead diameters by weight of 35 650 μm 35 800 μm and 30 1000 μm 1400 μm was used in each experiment the resulting porosity for the three runs varied between 30 35 the fluids used in the system were water air and decane decane is a non spreading oil negative spreading coefficient of 4 02 dyne cm with a density of 0 73 g ml and a viscosity of 0 859 cp the interfacial tensions of the fluid pairs can be found in table 1 contrast agents were added to improve image contrast between the water air and oil a brine solution was created by mixing potassium iodide ki and water at a weight ratio of 1 6 similarly iodobenzene was added to decane at a weight ratio of 1 24 the difference in iodine concentration was sufficient to distinguish water from decane imaging was performed at an energy slightly above the iodine absorption edge 33 2 kev providing significant contrast between the phases and thereby allowing for easier segmentation during image analysis the bead filled column was mounted in a sample holder with a semi permeable membrane on both ends the bottom membrane was hydrophilic magna 1 2 μm allowing only water to enter and exit the column while the membrane at the top was hydrophobic pall corporation ptfe 0 45 μm allowing only oil to pass through blocking both water and air there were two air vents located on the sides of the column allowing air to enter or leave when open flow was controlled via the water lines connected to the bottom of the column using a syringe pump that either injects water into the system imbibition or pulls water out of the system drainage the resulting changes in pressure caused by the movement of the pump and thus the water phase leads to the movement of the other mobile fluids in the system using the syringe pump the flow rates remained low 0 5ml hr keeping the system in a quasi static state fig 1 is a schematic of the experimental set up and sample holder we begin with the glass bead column fully saturated with water a step one in fig 2 consists of drainage of the water from the column as oil is brought into the system from above drainage continues until irreducible water saturation is reached in the column b once irreducible water saturation is reached water is imbibed back into the system forcing oil out the top of the column until residual oil saturation c or the limit of imbibition is reached the first two steps were performed to create baseline two phase flow data and prepare the system for controlled three phase displacement in the third step the third phase air is introduced into the system a second drainage is performed with air vents opened on the side of the column about two thirds of the way up seen in fig 1 during the second drainage the valve to the oil reservoir is closed so no additional oil can enter or leave the system as drainage proceeds air enters the column until irreducible water saturation is reached d then the fourth and final step of the experiment is initiated a three phase imbibition process water is pumped into the column and every phase can exit the column via the air vents on the sides creating a system of three phase flow with each phase being mobile ending at e three different experimental trials were performed starting with air injection at different water saturations at the beginning of the three phase portion of the flow scheme c we note that although the oil valve is closed in the three phase drainage and imbibition cycles all three saturations can vary within the imaged section of the column see fig 2 so that three phase flow occurs overall we anticipate the drainage imbibition cycles in the column represent double displacements of the disconnected oil in which air and water displace the oil downward during air invasion and then upward during water invasion in the analysis of the collected 3d images of the phase distributions we will use the term connected phase to describe the part of the phase that reaches the opposite boundary i e water reaching the top boundary and oil reaching the bottom boundary of the imaged section otherwise we term the phase disconnected 2 1 imaging throughout the flow process x ray microtomography is used to capture images of the fluid distributions imaging was performed using synchrotron radiation at the gsecars 13 bmd beamline at the advanced photon source aps at argonne national laboratory to achieve sufficient contrast between all three fluid phases a si crystal monochromator is used to produce monochromatic x rays at an energy level slightly above the iodine edge the dimensions of the resulting images are 1920 1920 1200 voxels requiring about 15 minutes to acquire using a 1 second exposure time and producing a voxel size of 3 2 μm pixel images were obtained after the fluids had equilibrated for 15 minutes following each change in saturation that was induced by either adding or withdrawing water with the pump 2 2 image processing and segmentation the images produced are greyscale images as seen in fig 3 a for the purpose of processing the image is considered to be a four phase image consisting of water beads oil and air in order from bright to dark phase the raw images do not have sufficient contrast as can be seen by the lack of distinct peaks in the histogram fig 3a we used imagej to enhance the contrast between the phases by stretching the histogram fig 3b schneider et al 2012 and the image was then smoothed using the non local means nlm filter buades and morel 2005 using avizo fire the nlm filter results in an image that has very little noise and distinct peaks between the phases see the improved histogram in fig 3c two different segmentation methods were used markov random field mrf kulkarni et al 2012 with the image processing library quantim4 https www ufz de index php en 39198 and watershed beucher and lantuejoul 1979 using avizo fire whereas the watershed method is simpler and less time consuming to use the mrf method preserves films and oil layers better than the watershed method schlüter et al 2014 so the watershed algorithm was typically used to segment two phase data and mrf was used to segment three phase data the thresholds needed by both the watershed and mrf segmentation algorithms were determined using five different approaches maximum variance otsu 1979 minimum error kittler and illingworth 1986 maximum entropy kapur et al 1984 fuzzy c means ridler and calvard 1978 and shape tsai 1995 the average value from these methods was used in the subsequent segmentation an example of a final segmented image with porous medium and 3 fluid phases reliably identified can be seen in fig 3d 2 3 image analysis from these segmented images we were able to measure the saturation interfacial areas and curvatures for each point of the flow process drainage and imbibition to determine saturation the number of voxels that make up each phase is recorded and the saturation is found by dividing by the total number of fluid voxels to calculate the interfacial area surfaces are generated at the intersection between two phase classes using a marching cubes algorithm lorensen and cline 1987 the area of each triangle making up the surface mesh is summed resulting in the total fluid fluid interfacial area fig 4 depicts the interfacial surfaces generated note that there is very little air water interfacial area in our data due to the presence of oil layers between the air and water phases when determining bulk phase curvatures it is important to separate the connected and disconnected phases this is because fluid ganglia that get trapped in the system will relax to equilibrium states with capillary pressures that generally differ from the capillary pressure between continuous phases li et al 2018 moreover fluid ganglia mobilized by double displacements in three phase systems will have capillary pressures that vary as the interfaces move through wide and narrow pore regions this behavior can also differ significantly to the corresponding connected phases helland et al 2019 thus surfaces must be generated for the interfaces between each connected phase fig 4 the avizo fire mean curvature module is used to perform the measurement on the surfaces as described by li et al 2018 the distance weighted average curvature calculated over the triangles located within 20 of the maximum distance from the edge of the surface li et al 2018 is used as the mean curvature fig 4 the capillary pressure can then be calculated from the mean curvature via the young laplace equation as verified in the study by li et al 2018 an accurate curvature based measurement of the air water capillary pressure cannot be determined due to the limited connected air water interfacial areas and the air water capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship will therefore not be pursued in this study we note here that while curvatures and pressures reported represent only connected phases interfacial areas represent the total areas connected and disconnected phases 2 4 surface modeling the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surfaces were modeled using a bi quadratic equation eq 1 similar to porter et al 2009 1 a p c s a p c 2 b p c c p c s d s e s 2 f where a b c d e f are best fit parameters minimizing the root mean square error between the surface and the data points 3 results discussion in the following we denote capillary pressures and specific interfacial areas for the system of air a oil o and water w as p c ij pi pj and aij ij ao ow aw respectively and phase saturations as si i a o w here pi denotes pressure of phase i further the young laplace equation relates capillary pressure to interfacial tension σ ij and mean interface curvature c m ij by 2 p c i j 2 σ i j c m i j i j a o o w a w 3 1 initial water saturation fig 5 shows the saturation paths for the three different experimental trials of drainage and imbibition the results show that all three saturations vary in the imaged section of the column during the experiments indicating that three phase flow occurs despite that one of the phases cannot exit the column each trial initiated the three phase air invasion portion of the experiment at a different initial water saturation 19 42 and 72 for runs 1 3 respectively fig 6 depicts the capillary pressure saturation and interfacial area saturation relationships for the three different runs for the capillary pressure saturation relationship we observe that for the air oil fluid pair the results for the three different runs align well and this is also the case for the oil water fluid pair in the first two runs however the third run sw 72 has significantly lower capillary pressures for the oil water fluid pair and this deviation appears to increase as the run proceeds we believe that the lowering of the capillary pressure for run 3 in particular during imbibition is due to wettability alteration of the bead pack caused by prolonged x ray exposure of beads in contact with the oil phase as described by brown et al 2014 we explore this further in a subsequent publication which shows that the average oil water contact angle changes from approximately 50 at the start of air invasion to approximately 90 at the end of the experiment behnoudfar 2020 x ray induced wettability alteration of the glass beads would cause the water wet data to trend towards more oil wet behavior the interfacial area saturation relationship for runs 2 and 3 align for both fluid pairs while we observe some deviation for run 1 we suspect the images that were collected for the first run did not have sufficient time for interfaces to relax and reach a quasi equilibrium state resulting in non equilibrium interfacial areas for the oil water fluid pair that are generally higher than the interfacial areas at similar saturations for the subsequent runs as also reported by karadimitriou et al 2014 and meisenheimer et al 2020 for the air oil fluid pair the drainage data matches that of run 2 and 3 while the imbibition curve has an almost opposite slope to the other data sets with higher values at low sa and lower values at high sa it is worth noting that for run 1 air injection was initiated at a fairly low water saturation 19 a saturation range that is dominated by poorly connected water phase this may contribute to an overall lack of equilibration of interfaces in the timeframe allowed before the system was scanned a problem not observed when air was injected at higher saturations in runs 2 and 3 the initial water saturation at the point of air injection for the three phase portion of flow does not appear to affect the capillary pressure saturation or interfacial area saturation relationships in terms of the saturation dependencies of these relationships it seems sufficient to describe capillary pressure and interfacial area for the air oil fluid pair as functions of only air saturation while for the oil water fluid pair capillary pressure and interfacial area could be described as functions of only the water saturation while this is consistent with previous studies under drainage conditions at water wet states e g lenhard and parker 1988 our results suggest that these saturation dependencies also apply to the capillary pressures and interfacial areas during three phase drainage imbibition cycles conducted after a two phase saturation history composed of an oil water drainage imbibition cycle thus for the remainder of this study the three different experimental trials will be combined creating a more complete data set representing a single three phase system following the discussion above a few exceptions are however made for run 1 imbibition data when interfacial area is evaluated and for run 3 imbibition data when capillary pressure is discussed 3 2 comparison to other data sets to better understand our data we compared it to other relevant available data sets the experimental characteristics for each of these data sets are summarized in table 2 each experiment used the same distribution of glass beads in systems with interface relaxation flow was halted before each image was captured allowing the fluid interfaces to relax into a quasi equilibrium state whereas in systems without interface relaxation images were captured during slow flow in the young laplace equation eq 2 capillary pressure is dependent on interfacial tension thus to compare data sets for different oil water fluid pairs the capillary pressures were scaled by the ratio of interfacial tensions 3 2 1 two phase oil water system first we compare our data to the two phase oil water data of schlüter et al 2017 fig 7 we use only data that is unaffected by wettability alteration for the capillary pressure saturation comparison i e excluding run 3 the data of schlüter et al 2017 was collected at a very low flowrate allowing for the assumption that the system was always in a quasi equilibrium state by allowing for relaxation of the interfaces our three phase experiments also achieved quasi equilibrium at each imaged saturation the scaled capillary pressure saturation curves fig 7a show a strong match between the two phase data collected by schlüter et al 2017 and our data both validating the capillary pressure values of our three phase data and confirming the concept that a short time of interface relaxation does not affect capillary pressure of the system when flow rate is sufficiently low the interfacial area however is greatly affected by interface relaxation the relaxation time allows for a rearrangement of the interfaces as they approach their equilibrium state as the capillary pressure increases or water saturation decreases the effect of relaxation on the interfacial area also increases this behavior was also recently reported by meisenheimer et al 2020 and meisenheimer and wildenschild 2021 and is most likely due to a greater departure from equilibrium as pressures increase causing the amount of relaxation needed to reach equilibrium to increase as well 3 2 2 three phase oil water spreading system when comparing to wildenschild and brown 2012 wildenschild 2016 three phase data both the spreading characteristics of the oil and the use of a different invading fluid must be accounted for in these experiments air invaded drained the column while the oil saturation was fixed whereas in wildenschild and brown 2012 oil invaded drained the column while the air saturation was fixed in the latter case air initially resides inside the column as disconnected ganglia surrounded by water upon oil invasion oil will spread spontaneously on the air water interfaces once it has established direct contact with air fig 8 shows wildenschild and brown 2012 data compared to our three phase data for the oil water fluid pair while fig 9 compares selected three phase fluid configurations the differences in both capillary pressure and interfacial area appear as expected for a comparison between a spreading and a non spreading system interfacial areas for the spreading system are larger than those for the non spreading system schaefer et al 2000 both the non spreading and spreading experiments presented here exhibit oil layers however the oil films that form in a spreading system are stable and can be sustained in thinner layers films than the layers formed in a non spreading system blunt et al 2002 oil layers in the non spreading system arise exclusively due to the wetting order where oil is the intermediate wet phase in our experiments they form when air displaces oil at a sufficiently high oil water capillary pressure that favors oil layer formation in the pore corners on the other hand for the spreading system thin oil films spontaneously imbibe along the air water interfaces this occurs with lower oil water capillary pressure because these films can be located farther away from the bead contact points than in the non spreading system and they will thus have a higher oil water interfacial area in both cases configurations around bead contact points typically consists of a pendular ring of oil that surrounds another pendular ring of water that coats the bead contact points while air occupies the central portion of the pores the capillary pressure saturation plot also fits expected trends for a spreading versus a non spreading oil note for the purpose of comparing pc s curves in fig 8a the imbibition data for run 3 is omitted due to suspected wettability alteration which strongly affects spreading behavior the entry capillary pressure between the two systems is consistent the slope however is drastically different mani and mohanty 1997 generally non spreading oils form layers that at a threshold thickness become unstable and break to form blobs a higher oil water capillary pressure is needed to move these blobs than to move oil in the hydraulically connected thin films of the spreading oil at low water saturations in our experiments we observe that air displaces disconnected oil that in turn pushes water into narrower pore spaces leading to a high oil water capillary pressure at low water saturations in the non spreading system this behavior was also observed in pore scale simulations of gas invasion on sandstone helland et al 2019 however in the spreading system the spontaneous imbibition of oil at the air water interfaces provides the oil direct access to a larger part of the water filled pores in the column we anticipate that direct displacement of water by oil in these pores results in a lower oil water capillary pressure as observed in fig 8a finally we note that from fig 8 the limit of imbibition for the non spreading phase run 2 is 44 water saturation sg 48 so 8 whereas for the spreading system it is 64 water saturation sg 19 so 17 3 3 capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationships and hysteresis to explore the full three dimensional dependencies the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surfaces were established using the method described in section 2 4 fig 10 depicts the unique surfaces for oil water and air oil fluid pairs based on all the drainage and imbibition experiments from the three runs recall that there was an insufficient amount of interfacial area present to establish data for the air water interfaces to determine how similar the surfaces are a test was performed to determine the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae for the unique surface compared to the individual surfaces generated from each run since these runs all had the same experimental characteristics the maximum error generated between individual surfaces and the unique surface model is used as the threshold for experimental variation below which the surfaces are considered similar the error thresholds used can be found in table 3 to test hassanizadeh and gray s 1990 theory regarding the uniqueness of the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship for three phase flow systems the rmse and mae were calculated between the drainage and imbibition surfaces as well as each of them against the unique surface generated for the system the error values are presented in table 4 for the oil water fluid pair the error in all three surface pairs is negligible below the error threshold indicated in table 3 meaning that in accordance with theory the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship is non hysteretic fig 11 depicts the oil water fluid pair drainage and imbibition surfaces for the air oil fluid pair the error in the drainage and imbibition surface is not negligible as indicated by the high rmse and mae values and we also observe a large difference between these two surfaces see fig 12 the difference between the drainage and unique surface can be considered fairly negligible but the difference between the imbibition surface and the unique surface is not thus we cannot eliminate the possibility that hysteresis exists in the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surface for the air oil fluid pair based on the full combined data set however since hysteresis is eliminated in one fluid pair oil water it would follow that in theory energetically hysteresis should also be eliminated in the other fluid pairs to address this a closer inspection of fig 6 specifically the interfacial area saturation plot for air oil reiterates the difference discussed earlier between the imbibition curve for run 1 and those of run 2 and 3 and we anticipate that this could contribute to the poor match between the surfaces thus the hysteresis analysis was repeated for the combined data set with run 1 imbibition data eliminated and the results are illustrated in fig 13 and table 5 unfortunately the removal of the run 1 imbibition data means that the surface between drainage and imbibition no longer has sufficient data to produce a proper fit as indicated by high rmse or mae values for that surface pair however the match between both drainage and imbibition and the unique surface is now much improved with quite low rmse and mae values even though the data to support a conclusion at this point is somewhat limited these results suggest that hysteresis is eliminated for the oil air fluid pair as well a finding that seems thermodynamically much more feasible as mentioned previously recall that for run 1 air injection was initiated at a fairly low water saturation 19 a saturation range that is dominated by disconnected water phase likely leading to an overall lack of equilibration of interfaces in the timeframe allowed before the system was scanned because disconnected phase needs more time to equilibrate this could suggest that elimination of hysteresis for the air oil fluid pair is contingent on the fluids being equilibrated at the time of measurement in a recent two phase study meisenheimer et al 2020 found that data for non equilibrium interfacial area is indeed different from quasi equilibrium data similarly schlüter et al 2017 showed that after a change fast equilibration of fluids occurs within 3 seconds however this quick adaptation to an abrupt change does not lead to an optimal fluid configuration in terms of helmholtz free energy this happens in a second stage where very slow relaxation of fluid interfaces progress towards an energetic minimum we expect this process to be impaired when one of the fluid phases is highly disconnected and even further delayed when there are three fluid phases present because equilibration of water in pore corners will affect the oil it contacts via oil water capillary pressure and interface relaxation this in turn affects the air oil interfacial area and capillary pressure because oil contacts air as well air will be located in pore centers and water in pore corners with oil in between thus a small change in position of oil water interfaces due to relaxation will not affect oil water interfacial area as much because the oil water interface is located in pore corners however it will affect air oil interfacial area more because air oil interfaces are located closer to pore centers where small adjustments of interface positions can lead to larger changes in interfacial area based on the above findings and discussion we interpret these results as suggestive of hysteresis being eliminated for the air oil fluid pair as well as for the oil water pair for quasi equilibrium conditions during three phase flow 4 conclusions in this study we examined the relationship between capillary pressure saturation and interfacial area for a three phase flow system using x ray microtomography we were able to capture high resolution three dimensional images of the flow system from which saturation interfacial area and capillary pressure were measured the main findings are the initial water saturation at the point of air injection in this three phase flow system does not affect the capillary pressure saturation relationship or the interfacial area saturation relationship as long as the system is in at least a quasi equilibrium state and one can therefore conclude that each of the relationships for drainage and imbibition are unique for this particular system consequently for the air oil fluid pair capillary pressure and interfacial area are functions of air saturation while for the oil water fluid pair they are functions of water saturation it should therefore be possible to adequately describe them by thermodynamic theory such as originally proposed by hassanizadeh and gray 1990 for the oil water fluid pair in a three phase flow system hysteresis in the interfacial area saturation relationship is minimal and the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship fully eliminates hysteresis for air oil the same conclusion can be drawn as long as the system is in a quasi equilibrated state when the measurements are made we have therefore shown that similar to two phase flow systems the two fluid pairs in the three phase system investigated here oil water and air oil both adhere to hassanizadeh and gray 1993 s original theory which predicts that hysteresis is eliminated for the pc s a relationship our results suggest that interface relaxation greatly affects formation of interfacial area but it does not notably affect capillary pressure these results are applicable to three phase non spreading flow systems with invading air in a water wet porous medium the experimental trials were potentially somewhat affected by wettability alteration in run 3 and limited equilibration interface relaxation for the run 1 imbibition data further testing is therefore needed to verify that those variations do not significantly influence the overall relationship this work has expanded on existing experimental data exploring two phase flow that has shown good agreement with thermodynamic theory the present work illustrates that this is also the case for three phase flow at water wet states work is in progress to simulate the three phase data presented here using a pore scale simulation model for three phase capillary dominated displacement helland et al 2019 the model will track the measured saturation paths while it calculates capillary pressure and interfacial area at each equilibrium state as three phase pore scale measurements are expensive and technically challenging pore scale simulations can extrapolate existing measurements and supply more numerical data this will improve the foundation for probing the thermodynamic theory hassanizadeh and gray 1990 in three phase systems as it was done for two phase systems e g held and celia 2001 a future research question would be to address the issue of spreading behavior for more strongly non spreading systems when the three fluids meet at triple points rather than forming oil layers i e where substantial interfacial area for all three fluid pairs would be present not just air oil and oil water would hysteresis still be eliminated the ability to describe three phase flow functions for capillary pressure and relative permeability uniquely by means of appropriate state variables like interfacial area and saturation can potentially have great impact for modelling three phase flow processes in subsurface reservoirs where complex hysteresis behavior typically arises examples include water alternate gas injections for improved oil recovery and cyclic injection of carbon dioxide for geologic storage reservoir simulations of such processes are known to depend strongly on the adopted hysteresis model spiteri and juanes 2006 although a model with new state variables will introduce additional complexity such as new evolution equations it should eliminate hysteresis as a source of uncertainty and thereby improve the reliability of simulations credit authorship contribution statement rebecca paustian data curtion investigation software

323,we encounter three phase flow in porous media within a range of settings such as enhanced oil recovery geologic co2 sequestration and groundwater remediation while an abundance of studies has been performed on the behavior of two fluid phases e g oil water or air water in porous media relatively little information exists for three phase flow systems e g oil water air this work explores the relationships between capillary pressure pc saturation s and fluid fluid interfacial area a for water wet three phase flow systems where water is the wetting phase oil is the intermediate wet phase and air or gas is the non wetting phase specifically we examine whether the pc s a relationships exhibit hysteresis during drainage and imbibition cycles we present data collected via x ray microtomography resulting in high resolution three dimensional images of the fluid configurations for varying degrees of saturation among the findings of the study based on the available data we highlight that 1 the pc s a relationship is non hysteretic for both the oil water fluid pair and the air oil fluid pair and 2 that this same relationship is independent of the initial water saturation at the point of air injection this finding suggests that both the oil water and air oil fluid pairs in a three phase system can be adequately described by the thermodynamics based theory originally proposed by hassanizadeh and gray 1993 as is the case for the equivalent two phase system keywords three phase flow capillary pressure saturation hysteresis interfacial area thermodynamics 1 introduction multi phase flow in porous media includes many scenarios of relevance to subsurface flow multi phase flow particularly three phase flow is studied in fields as varied as petroleum engineering environmental engineering and groundwater hydrology we may encounter a three phase system when a non aqueous phase liquid napl leaks from an underground storage tank into an unsaturated zone of the subsurface during geologic carbon sequestration when co2 is injected into a depleted oil reservoir and trapped or when oil recovery is enhanced via air injection sophisticated models of the interactions of the various fluids and the porous medium are required for accurate prediction of fluid configurations and potential movement during such scenarios there are a myriad of experimental results and numerical models to help better understand subsurface multi phase flow and an integral component of modeling fluid flow behavior is the capillary pressure saturation pc s relationship generally attempts at numerical simulation of a multi phase flow system begin with this relationship yet many studies have led to the conclusion that capillary pressure is not uniquely dependent on the saturation of the system but it is also dependent on the saturation history of the system thus introducing the concept of hysteresis e g fenwick and blunt 1998 lenhard 1992 the inherent hysteresis in porous media systems has made it difficult to develop appropriate models of flow in such systems the failure of the capillary pressure saturation relationship to uniquely describe drainage and imbibition in multi phase systems led researchers to reexamine how we describe multi phase flow in porous media from a thermodynamic perspective among those hassanizadeh and gray 1990 developed an extended form of darcy s law using momentum balance equations and determined that capillary pressure is a function of not just saturation but exhibits a dependence on fluid fluid interfacial area aij as well they proposed that the traditional hysteresis observed in the pc s relationship is actually a projection of the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area pc s a surface onto the capillary pressure saturation pc s plane hassanizadeh and gray 1993 the model developed by hassanizadeh and gray 1993 has subsequently been shown for instance via pore scale network modeling held and celia 2001 to be fully defined for a two phase flow system when using either interfacial area or common lines that is the fluid fluid solid contact lines as the third variable the concept has been further refined in recent modeling work by e g mcclure et al 2016 who found that to produce closure relations for models based on continuum mechanics another topological invariant besides interfacial area namely the euler characteristic can help to uniquely describe two phase flow systems using advanced experimental techniques many two phase flow experiments have also been performed to test the theory originally introduced by hassanizadeh and gray 1990 chen et al 2007 used a two dimensional etched lithography micromodel to show that capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surfaces were unique for their studied system eliminating hysteresis chen et al 2007 similarly using three dimensional x ray microtomography porter et al 2009 verified the two dimensional findings of chen et al 2007 and also showed that due to the non hysteretic nature of the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surface scanning curve data is not required to describe the relationship it is fully defined by the main branches porter et al 2009 the surface created by the three state variables can then be fitted with a biquadratic polynomial and is smooth on the continuum scale porter et al 2010 reeves and celia 1996 with the understanding of the importance of interfacial area as a state variable in defining a system additional models have been developed including models that allow for prediction of the interfacial area saturation relationship from the capillary pressure saturation relationship and pore size distribution diamantopoulos et al 2016 and for using the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surface to model interfacial areas for non equilibrium systems joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 most recently both karadimitriou et al 2014 and godinez brizuela et al 2017 using two dimensional micromodel experiments and meisenheimer et al 2020 in three dimensional systems have shown that for a specific porous medium transient non equilibrium and quasi static quasi equilibrium capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surfaces are statistically different suggesting that a single relationship does not exist independent of flow condition traditionally three phase flow has been extended from two phase descriptions by expanding two phase capillary pressure equivalents e g lenhard and parker 1988 kantzas et al 1998 which is a reasonable approximation for water wet systems where water is wetting phase oil intermediate wet phase and air is non wetting phase this implies that conceptually water will occupy the smallest pores and corners of larger pores air will occupy the central part of the largest pores and oil will occupy the intermediate sized pores as well as layers between air and water in pore corners in theory if there is no or little contact between air and water this further implies that oil water capillary pressure could be assumed to be a function of water saturation only while air oil capillary pressure could be considered to be a function of only air saturation or equivalently total liquid saturation e g lenhard and parker 1988 however if all three phases in a system are in contact in the same pore this affects all the capillary pressures and the system can no longer be modeled using a two phase capillary pressure relationship piri and blunt 2004 lenhard and parker 1988 instead the three phase capillary pressures must generally be described as functions of two saturations van dijke and sorbie 2007 helland and skjæveland 2006 irrespective of the saturation dependencies of the capillary pressures these relationships will still exhibit hysteresis and it is not known whether the inclusion of interfacial area will eliminate this hysteresis from such relationships in three phase flow systems another problem with the prediction of three phase flow in porous media is that the models used are often based on darcy s law which is generally not valid in three phase flow because movement of phase segments that are not hydraulically connected typically occurs e g van dijke et al 2004 helland et al 2019 examples of such motions are double displacements in which a continuous phase displaces a disconnected ganglion of another phase that in turn displaces a continuous third phase due to capillary forces van dijke et al 2004 khishvand et al 2016 helland et al 2019 and multiple displacements where the continuous phases displace a chain of several disconnected phase ganglia e g qin et al 2019 scanziani et al 2020a jettestuen et al 2020 this means that three phase experiments must be performed to verify whether these theories originated with hassanizadeh and gray 1990 are still valid with the addition of another fluid phase recently three phase flow experiments of water alternate gas invasions in porous rocks have been combined with x ray microtomography imaging for visualization and characterization of three phase fluid distributions a major part of these investigations has focused on imaging the fluids at static states after invasion e g iglauer et al 2013 carroll et al 2015 scanziani et al 2018 alhosani et al 2019 or at steady state flow conditions khishvand et al 2016 sabti et al 2019 qin et al 2019 analysis of multi phase images after different fluid invasions was used to gain insights of fluid distributions and pore occupancies with respect to pore size scanziani et al 2018 qin et al 2019 sabti et al 2019 alhosani et al 2019 alhosani et al 2021 occurrence of double and multiple displacements khishvand et al 2016 scanziani et al 2018 qin et al 2019 alhosani et al 2019 trapping and morphological description of fluid ganglia iglauer et al 2013 carroll et al 2015 iglauer et al 2016 iglauer et al 2019 wettability in three phase systems khishvand et al 2016 iglauer et al 2019 alhosani et al 2021 as well as states of interfacial area and capillary pressure after invasion qin et al 2019 alhosani et al 2021 imaging at dynamic three phase flow conditions have been used to analyze pore scale displacement mechanisms like double and multiple displacements in more detail and how interfacial area and capillary pressure changes over time scanziani et al 2020a scanziani et al 2020b alhosani et al 2020 however little emphasis has been placed on exploring hysteresis between drainage and imbibition in three phase systems neither for quasi static nor dynamic flow conditions as illustrated above the basic premise that hysteresis in the pc s relationship can be alleviated by inclusion of topological invariants such as interfacial configurations remains largely unexplored for three phase flow systems and is thus the focus of this research specifically the objective of the study was to determine experimentally whether each of the phase pairs in a water wet three phase system air water air oil and oil water can be described via a capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship thus allowing us to establish a more robust model to describe three phase flow including hysteresis to this end we investigated if the hysteresis between three phase drainage and imbibition cycles in water wet bead packs can be eliminated by adding interfacial areas to the respective capillary pressure saturation relationships 2 materials and methods to create a simplified porous medium matrix a mixture of soda lime glass

of 35 650 μm 35 800 μm and 30 1000 μm 1400 μm was used in each experiment the resulting porosity for the three runs varied between 30 35 the fluids used in the system were water air and decane decane is a non spreading oil negative spreading coefficient of 4 02 dyne cm with a density of 0 73 g ml and a viscosity of 0 859 cp the interfacial tensions of the fluid pairs can be found in table 1 contrast agents were added to improve image contrast between the water air and oil a brine solution was created by mixing potassium iodide ki and water at a weight ratio of 1 6 similarly iodobenzene was added to decane at a weight ratio of 1 24 the difference in iodine concentration was sufficient to distinguish water from decane imaging was performed at an energy slightly above the iodine absorption edge 33 2 kev providing significant contrast between the phases and thereby allowing for easier segmentation during image analysis the bead filled column was mounted in a sample holder with a semi permeable membrane on both ends the bottom membrane was hydrophilic magna 1 2 μm allowing only water to enter and exit the column while the membrane at the top was hydrophobic pall corporation ptfe 0 45 μm allowing only oil to pass through blocking both water and air there were two air vents located on the sides of the column allowing air to enter or leave when open flow was controlled via the water lines connected to the bottom of the column using a syringe pump that either injects water into the system imbibition or pulls water out of the system drainage the resulting changes in pressure caused by the movement of the pump and thus the water phase leads to the movement of the other mobile fluids in the system using the syringe pump the flow rates remained low 0 5ml hr keeping the system in a quasi static state fig 1 is a schematic of the experimental set up and sample holder we begin with the glass bead column fully saturated with water a step one in fig 2 consists of drainage of the water from the column as oil is brought into the system from above drainage continues until irreducible water saturation is reached in the column b once irreducible water saturation is reached water is imbibed back into the system forcing oil out the top of the column until residual oil saturation c or the limit of imbibition is reached the first two steps were performed to create baseline two phase flow data and prepare the system for controlled three phase displacement in the third step the third phase air is introduced into the system a second drainage is performed with air vents opened on the side of the column about two thirds of the way up seen in fig 1 during the second drainage the valve to the oil reservoir is closed so no additional oil can enter or leave the system as drainage proceeds air enters the column until irreducible water saturation is reached d then the fourth and final step of the experiment is initiated a three phase imbibition process water is pumped into the column and every phase can exit the column via the air vents on the sides creating a system of three phase flow with each phase being mobile ending at e three different experimental trials were performed starting with air injection at different water saturations at the beginning of the three phase portion of the flow scheme c we note that although the oil valve is closed in the three phase drainage and imbibition cycles all three saturations can vary within the imaged section of the column see fig 2 so that three phase flow occurs overall we anticipate the drainage imbibition cycles in the column represent double displacements of the disconnected oil in which air and water displace the oil downward during air invasion and then upward during water invasion in the analysis of the collected 3d images of the phase distributions we will use the term connected phase to describe the part of the phase that reaches the opposite boundary i e water reaching the top boundary and oil reaching the bottom boundary of the imaged section otherwise we term the phase disconnected 2 1 imaging throughout the flow process x ray microtomography is used to capture images of the fluid distributions imaging was performed using synchrotron radiation at the gsecars 13 bmd beamline at the advanced photon source aps at argonne national laboratory to achieve sufficient contrast between all three fluid phases a si crystal monochromator is used to produce monochromatic x rays at an energy level slightly above the iodine edge the dimensions of the resulting images are 1920 1920 1200 voxels requiring about 15 minutes to acquire using a 1 second exposure time and producing a voxel size of 3 2 μm pixel images were obtained after the fluids had equilibrated for 15 minutes following each change in saturation that was induced by either adding or withdrawing water with the pump 2 2 image processing and segmentation the images produced are greyscale images as seen in fig 3 a for the purpose of processing the image is considered to be a four phase image consisting of water beads oil and air in order from bright to dark phase the raw images do not have sufficient contrast as can be seen by the lack of distinct peaks in the histogram fig 3a we used imagej to enhance the contrast between the phases by stretching the histogram fig 3b schneider et al 2012 and the image was then smoothed using the non local means nlm filter buades and morel 2005 using avizo fire the nlm filter results in an image that has very little noise and distinct peaks between the phases see the improved histogram in fig 3c two different segmentation methods were used markov random field mrf kulkarni et al 2012 with the image processing library quantim4 https www ufz de index php en 39198 and watershed beucher and lantuejoul 1979 using avizo fire whereas the watershed method is simpler and less time consuming to use the mrf method preserves films and oil layers better than the watershed method schlüter et al 2014 so the watershed algorithm was typically used to segment two phase data and mrf was used to segment three phase data the thresholds needed by both the watershed and mrf segmentation algorithms were determined using five different approaches maximum variance otsu 1979 minimum error kittler and illingworth 1986 maximum entropy kapur et al 1984 fuzzy c means ridler and calvard 1978 and shape tsai 1995 the average value from these methods was used in the subsequent segmentation an example of a final segmented image with porous medium and 3 fluid phases reliably identified can be seen in fig 3d 2 3 image analysis from these segmented images we were able to measure the saturation interfacial areas and curvatures for each point of the flow process drainage and imbibition to determine saturation the number of voxels that make up each phase is recorded and the saturation is found by dividing by the total number of fluid voxels to calculate the interfacial area surfaces are generated at the intersection between two phase classes using a marching cubes algorithm lorensen and cline 1987 the area of each triangle making up the surface mesh is summed resulting in the total fluid fluid interfacial area fig 4 depicts the interfacial surfaces generated note that there is very little air water interfacial area in our data due to the presence of oil layers between the air and water phases when determining bulk phase curvatures it is important to separate the connected and disconnected phases this is because fluid ganglia that get trapped in the system will relax to equilibrium states with capillary pressures that generally differ from the capillary pressure between continuous phases li et al 2018 moreover fluid ganglia mobilized by double displacements in three phase systems will have capillary pressures that vary as the interfaces move through wide and narrow pore regions this behavior can also differ significantly to the corresponding connected phases helland et al 2019 thus surfaces must be generated for the interfaces between each connected phase fig 4 the avizo fire mean curvature module is used to perform the measurement on the surfaces as described by li et al 2018 the distance weighted average curvature calculated over the triangles located within 20 of the maximum distance from the edge of the surface li et al 2018 is used as the mean curvature fig 4 the capillary pressure can then be calculated from the mean curvature via the young laplace equation as verified in the study by li et al 2018 an accurate curvature based measurement of the air water capillary pressure cannot be determined due to the limited connected air water interfacial areas and the air water capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship will therefore not be pursued in this study we note here that while curvatures and pressures reported represent only connected phases interfacial areas represent the total areas connected and disconnected phases 2 4 surface modeling the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surfaces were modeled using a bi quadratic equation eq 1 similar to porter et al 2009 1 a p c s a p c 2 b p c c p c s d s e s 2 f where a b c d e f are best fit parameters minimizing the root mean square error between the surface and the data points 3 results discussion in the

w a w 3 1 initial water saturation fig 5 shows the saturation paths for the three different experimental trials of drainage and imbibition the results show that all three saturations vary in the imaged section of the column during the experiments indicating that three phase flow occurs despite that one of the phases cannot exit the column each trial initiated the three phase air invasion portion of the experiment at a different initial water saturation 19 42 and 72 for runs 1 3 respectively fig 6 depicts the capillary pressure saturation and interfacial area saturation relationships for the three different runs for the capillary pressure saturation relationship we observe that for the air oil fluid pair the results for the three different runs align well and this is also the case for the oil water fluid pair in the first two runs however the third run sw 72 has significantly lower capillary pressures for the oil water fluid pair and this deviation appears to increase as the run proceeds we believe that the lowering of the capillary pressure for run 3 in particular during imbibition is due to wettability alteration of the bead pack caused by prolonged x ray exposure of beads in contact with the oil phase as described by brown et al 2014 we explore this further in a subsequent publication which shows that the average oil water contact angle changes from approximately 50 at the start of air invasion to approximately 90 at the end of the experiment behnoudfar 2020 x ray induced wettability alteration of the glass beads would cause the water wet data to trend towards more oil wet behavior the interfacial area saturation relationship for runs 2 and 3 align for both fluid pairs while we observe some deviation for run 1 we suspect the images that were collected for the first run did not have sufficient time for interfaces to relax and reach a quasi equilibrium state resulting in non equilibrium interfacial areas for the oil water fluid pair that are generally higher than the interfacial areas at similar saturations for the subsequent runs as also reported by karadimitriou et al 2014 and meisenheimer et al 2020 for the air oil fluid pair the drainage data matches that of run 2 and 3 while the imbibition curve has an almost opposite slope to the other data sets with higher values at low sa and lower values at high sa it is worth noting that for run 1 air injection was initiated at a fairly low water saturation 19 a saturation range that is dominated by poorly connected water phase this may contribute to an overall lack of equilibration of interfaces in the timeframe allowed before the system was scanned a problem not observed when air was injected at higher saturations in runs 2 and 3 the initial water saturation at the point of air injection for the three phase portion of flow does not appear to affect the capillary pressure saturation or interfacial area saturation relationships in terms of the saturation dependencies of these relationships it seems sufficient to describe capillary pressure and interfacial area for the air oil fluid pair as functions of only air saturation while for the oil water fluid pair capillary pressure and interfacial area could be described as functions of only the water saturation while this is consistent with previous studies under drainage conditions at water wet states e g lenhard and parker 1988 our results suggest that these saturation dependencies also apply to the capillary pressures and interfacial areas during three phase drainage imbibition cycles conducted after a two phase saturation history composed of an oil water drainage imbibition cycle thus for the remainder of this study the three different experimental trials will be combined creating a more complete data set representing a single three phase system following the discussion above a few exceptions are however made for run 1 imbibition data when interfacial area is evaluated and for run 3 imbibition data when capillary pressure is discussed 3 2 comparison to other data sets to better understand our data we compared it to other relevant available data sets the experimental characteristics for each of these data sets are summarized in table 2 each experiment used the same distribution of glass beads in systems with interface relaxation flow was halted before each image was captured allowing the fluid interfaces to relax into a quasi equilibrium state whereas in systems without interface relaxation images were captured during slow flow in the young laplace equation eq 2 capillary pressure is dependent on interfacial tension thus to compare data sets for different oil water fluid pairs the capillary pressures were scaled by the ratio of interfacial tensions 3 2 1 two phase oil water system first we compare our data to the two phase oil water data of schlüter et al 2017 fig 7 we use only data that is unaffected by wettability alteration for the capillary pressure saturation comparison i e excluding run 3 the data of schlüter et al 2017 was collected at a very low flowrate allowing for the assumption that the system was always in a quasi equilibrium state by allowing for relaxation of the interfaces our three phase experiments also achieved quasi equilibrium at each imaged saturation the scaled capillary pressure saturation curves fig 7a show a strong match between the two phase data collected by schlüter et al 2017 and our data both validating the capillary pressure values of our three phase data and confirming the concept that a short time of interface relaxation does not affect capillary pressure of the system when flow rate is sufficiently low the interfacial area however is greatly affected by interface relaxation the relaxation time allows for a rearrangement of the interfaces as they approach their equilibrium state as the capillary pressure increases or water saturation decreases the effect of relaxation on the interfacial area also increases this behavior was also recently reported by meisenheimer et al 2020 and meisenheimer and wildenschild 2021 and is most likely due to a greater departure from equilibrium as pressures increase causing the amount of relaxation needed to reach equilibrium to increase as well 3 2 2 three phase oil water spreading system when comparing to wildenschild and brown 2012 wildenschild 2016 three phase data both the spreading characteristics of the oil and the use of a different invading fluid must be accounted for in these experiments air invaded drained the column while the oil saturation was fixed whereas in wildenschild and brown 2012 oil invaded drained the column while the air saturation was fixed in the latter case air initially resides inside the column as disconnected ganglia surrounded by water upon oil invasion oil will spread spontaneously on the air water interfaces once it has established direct contact with air fig 8 shows wildenschild and brown 2012 data compared to our three phase data for the oil water fluid pair while fig 9 compares selected three phase fluid configurations the differences in both capillary pressure and interfacial area appear as expected for a comparison between a spreading and a non spreading system interfacial areas for the spreading system are larger than those for the non spreading system schaefer et al 2000 both the non spreading and spreading experiments presented here exhibit oil layers however the oil films that form in a spreading system are stable and can be sustained in thinner layers films than the layers formed in a non spreading system blunt et al 2002 oil layers in the non spreading system arise exclusively due to the wetting order where oil is the intermediate wet phase in our experiments they form when air displaces oil at a sufficiently high oil water capillary pressure that favors oil layer formation in the pore corners on the other hand for the spreading system thin oil films spontaneously imbibe along the air water interfaces this occurs with lower oil water capillary pressure because these films can be located farther away from the bead contact points than in the non spreading system and they will thus have a higher oil water interfacial area in both cases configurations around bead contact points typically consists of a pendular ring of oil that surrounds another pendular ring of water that coats the bead contact points while air occupies the central portion of the pores the capillary pressure saturation plot also fits expected trends for a spreading versus a non spreading oil note for the purpose of comparing pc s curves in fig 8a the imbibition data for run 3 is omitted due to suspected wettability alteration which strongly affects spreading behavior the entry capillary pressure between the two systems is consistent the slope however is drastically different mani and mohanty 1997 generally non spreading oils form layers that at a threshold thickness become unstable and break to form blobs a higher oil water capillary pressure is needed to move these blobs than to move oil in the hydraulically connected thin films of the spreading oil at low water saturations in our experiments we observe that air displaces disconnected oil that in turn pushes water into narrower pore spaces leading to a high oil water capillary pressure at low water saturations in the non spreading system this behavior was also observed in pore scale simulations of gas invasion on sandstone helland et al 2019 however in the spreading system the spontaneous imbibition of oil at the air water interfaces provides the oil direct access to a larger part of the water filled pores in the column we anticipate that direct displacement of water by oil in these pores results in a lower oil water capillary pressure as observed in fig 8a finally we note that from fig 8 the limit of imbibition for the non spreading phase run 2 is 44 water saturation sg 48 so 8 whereas for the spreading system it is 64 water saturation sg 19 so 17 3 3 capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationships and hysteresis to explore the full three dimensional dependencies the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surfaces were established using the method described in section 2 4 fig 10 depicts the unique surfaces for oil water and air oil fluid pairs based on all the drainage and imbibition experiments from the three runs recall that there was an insufficient amount of interfacial area present to establish data for the air water interfaces to determine how similar the surfaces are a test was performed to determine the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae for the unique surface compared to the individual surfaces generated from each run since these runs all had the same experimental characteristics the maximum error generated between individual surfaces and the unique surface model is used as the threshold for experimental variation below which the surfaces are considered similar the error thresholds used can be found in table 3 to test hassanizadeh and gray s 1990 theory regarding the uniqueness of the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship for three phase flow systems the rmse and mae were calculated between the drainage and imbibition surfaces as well as each of them against the unique surface generated for the system the error values are presented in table 4 for the oil water fluid pair the error in all three surface pairs is negligible below the error threshold indicated in table 3 meaning that in accordance with theory the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship is non hysteretic fig 11 depicts the oil water fluid pair drainage and imbibition surfaces for the air oil fluid pair the error in the drainage and imbibition surface is not negligible as indicated by the high rmse and mae values and we also observe a large difference between these two surfaces see fig 12 the difference between the drainage and unique surface can be considered fairly negligible but the difference between the imbibition surface and the unique surface is not thus we cannot eliminate the possibility that hysteresis exists in the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area surface for the air oil fluid pair based on the full combined data set however since hysteresis is eliminated in one fluid pair oil water it would follow that in theory energetically hysteresis should also be eliminated in the other fluid pairs to address this a closer inspection of fig 6 specifically the interfacial area saturation plot for air oil reiterates the difference discussed earlier between the imbibition curve for run 1 and those of run 2 and 3 and we anticipate that this could contribute to the poor match between the surfaces thus the hysteresis analysis was repeated for the combined data set with run 1 imbibition data eliminated and the results are illustrated in fig 13 and table 5 unfortunately the removal of the run 1 imbibition data means that the surface between drainage and imbibition no longer has sufficient data to produce a proper fit as indicated by high rmse or mae values for that surface pair however the match between both drainage and imbibition and the unique surface is now much improved with quite low rmse and mae values even though the data to support a conclusion at this point is somewhat limited these results suggest that hysteresis is eliminated for the oil air fluid pair as well a finding that seems thermodynamically much more feasible as mentioned previously recall that for run 1 air injection was initiated at a fairly low water saturation 19 a saturation range that is dominated by disconnected water phase likely leading to an overall lack of equilibration of interfaces in the timeframe allowed before the system was scanned because disconnected phase needs more time to equilibrate this could suggest that elimination of hysteresis for the air oil fluid pair is contingent on the fluids being equilibrated at the time of measurement in a recent two phase study meisenheimer et al 2020 found that data for non equilibrium interfacial area is indeed different from quasi equilibrium data similarly schlüter et al 2017 showed that after a change fast equilibration of fluids occurs within 3 seconds however this quick adaptation to an abrupt change does not lead to an optimal fluid configuration in terms of helmholtz free energy this happens in a second stage where very slow relaxation of fluid interfaces progress towards an energetic minimum we expect this process to be impaired when one of the fluid phases is highly disconnected and even further delayed when there are three fluid phases present because equilibration of water in pore corners will affect the oil it contacts via oil water capillary pressure and interface relaxation this in turn affects the air oil interfacial area and capillary pressure because oil contacts air as well air will be located in pore centers and water in pore corners with oil in between thus a small change in position of oil water interfaces due to relaxation will not affect oil water interfacial area as much because the oil water interface is located in pore corners however it will affect air oil interfacial area more because air oil interfaces are located closer to pore centers where small adjustments of interface positions can lead to larger changes in interfacial area based on the above findings and discussion we interpret these results as suggestive of hysteresis being eliminated for the air oil fluid pair as well as for the oil water pair for quasi equilibrium conditions during three phase flow 4 conclusions in this study we examined the relationship between capillary pressure saturation and interfacial area for a three phase flow system using x ray microtomography we were able to capture high resolution three dimensional images of the flow system from which saturation interfacial area and capillary pressure were measured the main findings are the initial water saturation at the point of air injection in this three phase flow system does not affect the capillary pressure saturation relationship or the interfacial area saturation relationship as long as the system is in at least a quasi equilibrium state and one can therefore conclude that each of the relationships for drainage and imbibition are unique for this particular system consequently for the air oil fluid pair capillary pressure and interfacial area are functions of air saturation while for the oil water fluid pair they are functions of water saturation it should therefore be possible to adequately describe them by thermodynamic theory such as originally proposed by hassanizadeh and gray 1990 for the oil water fluid pair in a three phase flow system hysteresis in the interfacial area saturation relationship is minimal and the capillary pressure saturation interfacial area relationship fully eliminates hysteresis for air oil the same conclusion can be drawn as long as the system is in a quasi equilibrated state when the measurements are made we have therefore shown that similar to two phase flow systems the two fluid pairs in the three phase system investigated here oil water and air oil both adhere to hassanizadeh and gray 1993 s original theory which predicts that hysteresis is eliminated for the pc s a relationship our results suggest that interface relaxation greatly affects formation of interfacial area but it does not notably affect capillary pressure these results are applicable to three phase non spreading flow systems with invading air in a water wet porous medium the experimental trials were potentially somewhat affected by wettability alteration in run 3 and limited equilibration interface relaxation for the run 1 imbibition data further testing is therefore needed to verify that those variations do not significantly influence the overall relationship this work has expanded on existing experimental data exploring two phase flow that has shown good agreement with thermodynamic theory the present work illustrates that this is also the case for three phase flow at water wet states work is in progress to simulate the three phase data presented here using a pore scale simulation model for three phase capillary dominated displacement helland et al 2019 the model will track the measured saturation paths while it calculates capillary pressure and interfacial area at each equilibrium state as three phase pore scale measurements are expensive and technically challenging pore scale simulations can extrapolate existing measurements and supply more numerical data this will improve the foundation for probing the thermodynamic theory hassanizadeh and gray 1990 in three phase systems as it was done for two phase systems e g held and celia 2001 a future research question would be to address the issue of spreading behavior for more strongly non spreading systems when the three fluids meet at triple points rather than forming oil layers i e where substantial interfacial area for all three fluid pairs would be present not just air oil and oil water would hysteresis still be eliminated the ability to describe three phase flow functions for capillary pressure and relative permeability uniquely by means of appropriate state variables like interfacial area and saturation can potentially have great impact for modelling three phase flow processes in subsurface reservoirs where complex hysteresis behavior typically arises examples include water alternate gas injections for improved oil recovery and cyclic injection of carbon dioxide for geologic storage reservoir simulations of such processes are known to depend strongly on the adopted hysteresis model spiteri and juanes 2006 although a model with new state variables will introduce additional complexity such as new evolution equations it should eliminate hysteresis as a source of uncertainty and thereby improve the reliability of simulations credit authorship contribution statement rebecca paustian data curtion investigation software

324,the plasticity of root water uptake determines the maintenance of transpiration during periods of water limitation and drought however the mechanistic basis of plant water uptake as well as the implications of water uptake strategies at the individual and ecosystem scale remain elusive we model three dimensional root water uptake under variably saturated conditions for a one hectare temperate forest plot for a growing season with a pronounced mid season dry period variations in root architecture hydraulic properties and degree of lateral interaction between root systems produce divergent local responses to water limitation and provide insights on individual and community response to meteorological conditions results demonstrate the plasticity of ecosystem scale responses to surface drying where interacting roots shift regions of active uptake to deeper soil layers with less abundant root biomass these shifts a product of both root system and soil hydraulic properties illustrate intimate links between root and soil hydraulics in determining plant water sourcing we further demonstrate that root lateral interactions are beneficial at the ecosystem scale even when trees compete for water specifically a more spatially extensive root system facilitates access to a larger soil water reservoir often ameliorating water limitation and reducing sharp water potential gradients while the reduction of water stress is a benefit it can be offset by increased root construction and maintenance costs associated with the larger rooting system a plausible viability region

ground processes physically based computational models of soil and root water dynamics provide an opportunity to explore and quantify the role of root spatial interactions in silico without the need for destructive field measurements in this work we introduce a computationally scalable model of three dimensional rwu that captures forest plot scale dynamics including lateral interactions while maintaining critical plant scale structural and hydraulic information we use observed field conditions during a typical growing season in a temperate mixed deciduous forest located in northern michigan the primary objective of this study is to explore and quantify the role of lateral root interactions in water uptake processes at the individual tree and plot scales spatiotemporal patterns of water uptake soil moisture and plant water status were compared for a range of root lateral spread scenarios architectures and hydraulic properties finally we explore the implications that strategies of carbon investment in rooting structure may have on forest systems that experience water limitation 2 model theory 2 1 root hydraulic architecture 2 1 1 root system architecture root

characterizes the root system s response to non uniform soil water potential the two cases yield whole root system equivalent conductance krs and the compensatory conductance kcomp kcomp is a plant scale parameter that quantifies the degree to which water uptake is locally enhanced in wetter soil regions and reduced in drier ones when soil water potential is uniform compensatory root water uptake is equal to zero similar to the suf krs and kcomp only depends on specific root architecture and hydraulic properties couvreur et al 2012 couvreur et al 2012 also showed that for roots with high axial conductance krs and kcomp can be approximated as equal these plant or macroscale quantities are further used in a coupled root and soil water physics model to simulate water uptake at a

growing season a species specific tree inventory was conducted within a 50m by 50m plot in the footprint of the us umb eddy covariance tower he et al 2014 this area serves as the domain for all subsequent analysis and model simulations spatial coordinates of all trees within the area were used to specify root collar locations small trees dbh 10cm of the same species collocated within 2m of each other were assumed to share the same root system and aggregated to form a single stem to prevent domain edge effects the computational area was expanded by 25m on all sides with additional trees added at random following plot derived distributions of stem density and size the entire computational domain is thus 100m x 100m x 2m and contains 574 trees with dbh values ranging from 5 to 73 5cm site specific allometric relationships from previous studies were used to approximate tree height crown diameter and crown height table 1 garrity et al 2012 crowns were assumed to be ellipsoids for the purpose of determining their volume this information was used to generate time series of tree potential transpiration 3 3 forcing data time varying boundary conditions specifically net

precipitation and losses due to interception processes is uniformly distributed throughout the domain horizontal homogeneity of precipitation is a simplification of actual conditions where interception and throughfall processes may produce highly heterogeneous patterns of soil water infiltration this simplification was chosen for the purpose of this numerical exercise to isolate the effects of root system architecture and lateral interaction on water uptake patterns 3 4 soil hydraulic properties soil saturation and pressure were characterized using mualem van genuchten mvg soil characteristic curves van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 parameters defining the shape of the curve were taken from he et al 2014 and derived from rajkai and várallyay 1992 to define soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves the two soil parameter sets represent potential conditions for the observed soil composition table 2 supplementary material s2 3 5 root distributions and zones of uptake modeled root architectures rely upon inference from measured root structural information in particular root length root length density rld is used to describe the length of root per soil volume rld does not linearly scale with the more commonly measured root biomass and requires additional information for conversion including root diameter distribution fig 2 a root biomass density rbd was quantified at 20cm intervals to a soil depth of 80cm using cores sampled near the us umb tower he et al 2013 the median dry weight root mass by depth was fitted to an exponential decay function given by rbd z 5478 8exp 0 038 z where z is depth cm the broad spatial distribution of root sampling throughout the inventoried plot was intended to capture the range of system wide rather than individual tree specific root length srl the ratio of root dry mass to root length was measured for root diameters 2mm root length and diameter were estimated using the winrhizo software regent instruments canada fine root distribution was divided into four diameter classes 0 0 05 mm 0 05 0 1mm 0 1 0 15mm and 1 5 2 0mm based on fractions reported for similar temperate forest sites makita et al 2009

relationship between root spatial interactions and tree water status fig 3 scenario 1 sc1 or localized acts as a lower bound for root lateral spread in which the root system extent mirrors the extent of the above ground crown projection scenarios 2 and 3 sc2 and sc3 or intermediate and extensive utilize the lower and upper confidence intervals for root allometric relationships for semi humid environments from casper et al 2003 with lateral spread a function of crown volume fig 3b while the coarse architecture of the root systems expand fine roots are spatially redistributed weighted by individual size such that each scenario maintains the same median root length density profile fig 2b and fig 4 3 7 root competition index tree size is frequently used to extrapolate system scale behavior from local measurements while size plays a large role in determining the area from which individuals acquire water and nutrients it does not account for competition from neighboring individuals to account for both system size and spatial interactions we adapted analogous above ground competition metrics arney 1973 to develop a root competition index rci the rci is given by 9 r c i i 100 j 1 n a i j r a i r a i where aij is the area of root zone overlap between subject tree i and competitor j rai is plan area of root system i and n is the number of competitors as defined by area overlap an rci value of 100 indicates zero interaction between root systems to characterize the impact of lateral interaction on water uptake and water potential status representative individuals were selected using k means cluster analysis lloyd 1982 the selection of cluster variables was an attempt to balance changes in root overlap with differences in demand due to tree size specifically for each lateral spread scenario clusters k 4 were obtained according to rci and dbh first each cluster partition was assigned a value 1 4 that weighted its degree of interaction relative to the other partitions based on rci for example a cluster value of 1 would indicate low spatial interaction relative to the other clusters while a value of 4 would indicate a high degree of spatial interaction relative to the other clusters the assigned cluster values for each individual was summed across the three lateral spread scenarios to determine an aggregate rank with values ranging 3 12 the aggregate rank accounts for nonlinear changes in root system interaction areas across sc1 sc3 and unites them under one metric the aggregate rank is a measure of relative competition status but does not fully account for differences in demand based on tree size therefore cluster analysis was repeated for the aggregate rank and dbh randomly selected individuals from each cluster were used for further analysis 3 9 quantifying carbon water tradeoffs several metrics were used to quantify individual root structural investment and response to water limitation relative carbon investment in root structure between the scenarios was quantified for fine roots and coarse roots for each modeled individual relative carbon investment c for a root system p can be described as 10 c p l p l m i n l m a x l m i n where lp is the total root length for root system p lmin is the minimum total root length from all individuals within the simulation domain and lmax is the maximum total length from all individuals within the simulation domain across all lateral spread scenarios the relative carbon investment was computed separately for coarse roots and fine roots days where potential demand was not met i e tact tpot were counted across the simulation period and compared between the scenarios these are referred to as soil controlled days as dry soils impede the individual s ability to meet atmospheric moisture demands as lateral spread increases the volume of the soil water reservoir also increases at the cost of increased interaction the cost of cooperation w quantifies the relative water benefit conferred upon an individual for expansion of the root system and is analogous to an aridity index it is computed for an individual root system p as 11 w p 1 t a c t p t p o t p where tact is determined following eq 6 and tpot following eq 7 a value of 0 indicates that all potential demand is met while a value of 1 indicates that no water uptake occurs beyond a simple aridity index wp is a measure of the cost of cooperation across root scenarios when all other abiotic facts e g soil climate are held constant beyond a simple aridity index wp is a measure of the cost of cooperation across root scenarios when all other abiotic facts e g soil climate are held constant additionally the centroid of root water uptake characterizes the center of mass of the moisture sink density distribution due to an individual s transpiration flux when the moisture sink density distribution is proportional to the root length density distribution the centroid of uptake will occur at the root distribution s center of mass 0 385m for the distribution illustrated in fig 2b a shift of the centroid above the center of mass indicates that roots in shallow layers are contributing proportionately more to uptake than deeper roots the opposite is true when the centroid shifts below the root distribution center of mass to compare shifts across the different scenarios with variable magnitudes of cumulative uptake each individual s centroid was weighted by its daily water uptake 4 results 4 1 degree of root interaction the three rooting scenarios produced a wide range of root interaction lateral spread ranged from 1 2 4 8m 1 3 9 8m and 4 2 31 0m for the localized intermediate and extensive scenarios respectively the rci ranged from 100 477 100 834 and 2784 5479 across the rooting scenarios supplemental material fig s11 a value of 100 indicates no root system overlap and was found in both the localized sc1 and intermediate sc2 rooting scenarios the largest degree of interaction occurred within the northwest quadrant of the analysis domain fig 5 c which consisted of primarily large growth trees with a higher relative stem density cluster analysis identified four major groups based on root competition and tree size the four groups were labeled low interaction moderate interaction high interaction and large trees fig 5a b the three interaction groups encompass individuals with dbh 30cm binned according to rank these clusters have ranks ranging from 3 5 5 8 and 9 12 respectively the large tree cluster encompasses individuals with dbh 30cm spanning the moderate and high interaction levels with ranks ranging from 6 10 representative individuals from each cluster n 3 5 were randomly selected and used in the subsequent analysis fig 5c table s5 4 2 magnitude of water uptake the growing season was marked by consistent rainfall events until simulation day 22 when precipitation events decreased in magnitude and frequency fig 1a the mid season dry period ended on day 68 when more frequent precipitation resumed a comparison of eddy covariance measured latent heat fluxes with modeled domain scale tpot indicate that despite relative soil dryness observed tact was not constrained fig 1c with a cumulative total of 281mm over the period for the modeled systems the relationship between tpot and tact was driven by soil hydraulic properties and rooting scenario under soil 1 simulated tact does not meet tpot due to excessive drying of the soil across the scenarios fig 6 a as root lateral spread increases accessible soil water reservoirs grow increasing system wide cumulative uptake tact from 183 to 233mm for soil 2 which had higher porosity and overall soil water content uptake was not as constrained and tpot was met across all three scenarios the difference in rwu between soils 1 and 2 which were derived using the same soil textural information supplemental material s2 indicates a strong control of soil hydraulic parameterization over rwu and the onset of water limitation decoupled from root hydraulic parameterization the influence of root structural archetype e g flat roots vs tap roots was examined across all lateral spread scenarios for individuals the cumulative difference in rwu across the growing season varied from 0 11 2 and 0 4 5 for the localized sc1 and extensive sc3 lateral spreads respectively see supplemental material s6 for individual breakdown averaged across the representative groups differences were most pronounced for large trees with localized roots table 3 large trees and to a lesser extent those experiencing high relative competition table 3 high interaction given the similarity between the two architecture responses all subsequent results and discussion will refer to the flat root structural archetype unless otherwise noted while system wide water uptake increases with root lateral expansion the effects differ among interaction groups fig 6b d for the extensive rooting scenario sc3 periods of water stress as indicated by the number of soil controlled days increase for the low interaction group stay relatively the same for the moderate interaction group and decrease for the high interaction and large tree groups fig 6b mean diurnal uptake increases for the high interaction and large tree groups fig 6c d with these groups contributing the bulk to system wide increases in cumulative water uptake fig 6a d 4 3 shifting zones of water uptake under water limitation soil 1 individual uptake during the mid period shifts away from the root system s center of mass into deeper soil layers fig 7 left panel the centroid of rwu responds quickly to small pulses of rainfall returning to the center of root mass distribution or to surface layers as water percolates through the soil column the mid period rainfall events were not large enough to saturate the entire soil column with the centroid returning to deeper layers as the rainfall pulse was depleted as lateral interaction increases the magnitude and timing of centroid shifts change across all representative groups dense areas of the forest i e areas of moderate and high interaction and large trees experience larger downward shifts in the centroid of uptake relative to less dense areas of low interaction as root lateral spread becomes more extensive the low interaction group experiences a downward shift of the centroid indicating shallow soil drying and higher competitive stress across all groups the onset of deeper uptake occurs earlier in the dry period days 23 35 for the localized scenario compared to the extensive scenario where uptake shifts around day 33 while the shifts in rwu occur later and are shorter for extensive rooting they are more intense with deeper uptake occurring across all representative groups without water limitation soil 2 fig 7 right panel there are no significant shifts away from the center of root mass distribution at the plot scale water uptake from characteristic wet days 22 26 and dry days 34 38 periods were compared for four soil layers fig 8 during the well watered period the relative contribution of different soil layers to domain scale rwu is fairly consistent mirroring the root length density distribution however as these layers dry and water limitation sets in the relative contribution of deeper soil layers specifically 40 60cm and 60 80cm increases by 10 15 these shifts are seen across all lateral interaction scenarios but at varying intensity 4 4 soil moisture mean soil water content in the root zone top 80 cm decreased from 0 20 m3 m 3 in the early growing season to 0 10 m3 m 3 in the mid season dry period as rain events became more frequent mean water content rose above 0 10 m3 m 3 mean soil water content values were comparatively lower during the dry period for the extensive rooting scenario sc3 indicative of the higher rates of cumulative uptake fig 9 a b during the dry period spatial patterns of soil moisture closely track root system distributions fig 9c d with localized roots sc1 displaying higher spatial heterogeneity than extensive roots sc3 this is especially apparent when examining the coefficient of variation cv of root zone soil water potential across the simulation period fig 9e the localized sc1 and intermediate sc2 rooting scenarios with similar root density distributions show similar patterns of cv with values exceeding 1 during the dry period cv for extensive sc3 rooting is lower never exceeding 1 even during the mid season dry period implying a relatively higher homogeneity in the spatial distribution of root zone soil water for comparison the cv of rld is 1 25 1 07 and 0 95 for the localized intermediate and extensive rooting scenarios respectively during periods of high precipitation the cv of swp is lower than the cv of rld as soil reservoirs are depleted during the dry period the cv of swp approaches or exceeds the cv of rld these periods of higher variability in soil water potential compared to root density may arise from the interplay between local root hydraulic properties and individual uptake demands overall these results highlight two complementary processes mean soil moisture behavior and variability of soil moisture as mean water content decreases in sc3 relative to sc1 i e θ s c 3 θ s c 1 spatial variability of soil water content as decreases i e cvsc3 cvsc1 4 5 carbon investment vs water acquisition median plot scale fine root density was the same across all tested scenarios fig 4a b with increasing lateral spread fine roots were distributed proportionately across coarse structural roots as such relative fine root carbon costs remained relatively consistent between all three scenarios fig 10 a as the coarse root architectures expanded from localized rooting sc1 to more extensive rooting sc3 relative carbon costs for coarse roots increased as a function of tree size with the extensively rooted trees investing upwards of nine fold more towards lateral structure compared to the localized scenario fig 10b these differences are most pronounced in large growth trees dbh 25cm large cluster which make up more than two thirds the canopy crown volume fig 10c expansion of the root system increases the size of an individual s soil water reservoir but benefits to water uptake can be dampened by increased interactions with neighboring roots so that the actual useable water volume may not keep pace with increases in root system volume fig 10d while increasing lateral spread alleviates constrained uptake the cost of cooperation w becomes smaller to a degree individuals are still unable to meet the full atmospheric demand w is larger than zero despite large investments in structural carbon for the large tree and high interaction groups water benefit e g alleviation of water stress is not gained with w reaching a lower limit low and moderate interaction groups with relatively low competitive pressures compared to their peers are able to meet atmospheric demand w close to zero while maintaining low relative carbon costs 5 discussion 5 1 root processes and soil moisture patterns root water uptake plays an important role in the spatiotemporal evolution of soil moisture but the driving mechanisms e g growth hydraulics distribution etc underlying these patterns are not fully understood see summary by koch et al 2019 the three lateral spread scenarios presented help elucidate the contribution of rooting distributions and competition on soil water content and plant water sourcing the results further show the intimate connection between root and soil hydraulics while derived from the same soil textural information and observed field conditions the two soil hydraulic parameterizations show two different water regimes one soil hydraulic parameterization inducing water limitation and the other not while the subsequent discussion focuses primarily on the water limiting case it is worth noting that these responses are highly dependent on soil hydraulic properties as shallow soil layers 0 30cm are depleted of water plant water sourcing shifts to deeper soil layers fig 7 left panel when soil water is sufficient as in soil 2 table 2 all groups are able to fulfill their water demands showing little evidence of deviation of the centroid of uptake away from the center of mass fig 7 right panel the intensity frequency and duration of these shifts are the combined effects individual water demands and local competition the intensity of downward shifts in water sourcing are largely driven by root system overlap and interaction in the localized rooting scenario sc1 the low and moderate interaction groups fig 7 left panel green and yellow lines have relatively exclusive access to their soil water reserves meeting their modest atmospheric demands and averting extreme drying from shallow layers water uptake occurs across the entire root profile illustrated by no deviation of the centroid of uptake from the center of mass as lateral spreads increase and water reserves become shared among root networks low and moderate individuals experience enhanced shallow soil drying shifting their overall uptake to deeper soil layers the high interaction group fig 7 left panel red lines maintains shared soil water reservoirs across the lateral rooting scenarios but as root lateral spreads become extensive the magnitude or intensity of centroid deviations become greater while the intensity of centroid shifts is greater for extensive root systems this is offset by differences in frequency and duration the onset of deeper water uptake while not as strong occurs sooner upwards of 10 days for localized root systems this is primarily limited to large trees and those with moderate or high interaction lateral expansion of these root systems not only decreases the frequency of these shifts but increases overall uptake due to soil reservoir increases fig 6 c d across the rooting scenarios spatial patterns of soil moisture closely track root spatial distributions becoming more homogeneous as roots expand laterally fig 9 for a given soil medium the homogenization of soil moisture represents a minimization of the free energy of the system heterogeneous fields contain sharp soil water potential gradients and unutilized pockets of moisture in their thermodynamic assessment of rwu hildebrandt et al 2016 demonstrated that homogeneous soil water potentials minimize energy dissipation losses during water transport delaying the onset of water limitation compared to heterogeneous conditions this implies that in environments prone to water limiting soil drying a root distribution which promotes homogeneity is a thermodynamically favorable means of delaying the onset of physiological water stress while maintaining the same amount of overall fine root length between scenarios the coefficient of variation for the extensive systems cvsc3 decreased upwards of 50 70 during the mid season dry period while cumulative transpiration increased 26 over localized roots cvsc1 the modeled homogeneous distribution of soil water of the extensive roots sc3 contributed to a more homogeneous soil water potential field and subsequently higher rates of water uptake further consequences of large soil water potential gradients may include the cavitation of root xylem vessels or physical separation of fine roots from the soil decreasing the conductance of water from the soil into the plant within the leaf decline of water conductance has been shown to begin in outside xylem vessels a mechanism suggested to mitigate the effect of increasing xylem tensions that may lead to cavitation of water transport vessels scoffoni et al 2017 within the rhizosphere the shrinkage of roots promotes a disconnection from soils carminati et al 2009 separating the rhizosphere from highly negative soil water potentials the ability of roots to dynamically adjust their region of uptake due to this decoupling is an important strategy to ameliorate the potentially physiologically detrimental effects of dry soils carminati and vetterlein 2013 5 2 the carbon cost and water benefit of exploration as roots extend laterally or down through soil layers individuals incur a greater overall carbon cost both from tissue construction and subsequent respiratory maintenance fig 10a b this growth increases the size of an individual s soil water reservoir but benefits to water uptake can be dampened by increased interactions with neighboring roots so that the actual useable water volume may not keep pace with increases in root system volume as such water benefits from carbon investment depend largely on forest density and tree size e g relative competition and demand but reach a threshold upon which further benefit cannot be gained by expansion fig 10d the four presented interaction groups low moderate and high interaction and large tree provide a point of comparison for how relative competition and atmospheric demands for water generate independent pressures for root system segregation or expansion low and moderate interaction groups have low relative competition and demand and are analogous to young or low density forest stands these groups perform well with localized lateral roots sc1 able to nearly or fully meet their atmospheric demand without the need for extensive exploration figs 6a 10d this is not the case for individuals in denser stand areas high interaction or with large atmospheric demands large trees large trees with dbh 25 cm fig 5b constrain uptake more often and earlier than smaller trees with similar relative competition similar rci unable to meet their proportionately larger atmospheric demands high interaction root systems also experience the impacts of water limitation more strongly than other groups fig 6b d 10d extensive lateral rooting sc3 reduces the number of soil controlled days for these groups improving their overall performance though expansion does not fully alleviate water stress for these groups it suggests that as forests become denser or larger more extensive root structures confer a water acquisition benefit despite increases in root competition greater rci the low interaction group composed of smaller trees with relatively lower demand benefits most from horizontal segregation i e the lateral isolation of the root system from competitors while larger trees with higher demands must forego segregation in order to meet their larger water demands particularly during times of low precipitation exclusive soil water access is a benefit only while soil water reservoirs are sufficient to meet demand it is expected that in the space of costs and benefits resulting from the imposed root spatial exploration there should be an optimal or viable region of co existence in this region access to a larger soil reservoir has the benefit of water stress alleviation i e w reduction even when competing for soil water with other individuals and results in justifiable carbon costs up to a point after which further investments in rooting spread do not provide additional water uptake benefits this is expected to be particularly true for individuals with high interaction or large size despite having high relative carbon costs fig 10a d additional water benefit reaches a lower limit as seen from the lack of reduction in w fig 10d beyond this threshold carbon investment or allocation is best channeled towards other means of drought response an alternative viable strategy to ameliorate drought stress is to access deeper soil water deep rooting has long been proposed as a coping mechanism for water limitation in some species e g barbeta et al 2015 nepstad et al 1994 thomsen et al 2013 this study instituted a uniform rooting depth of 80 cm a depth which encompasses a majority of the fine root profile as evidenced by field data to isolate the impact of lateral spread within this limit mean soil water content in deep soil layers 1 m remained greater than 0 10m3 m 3 across the simulated period observations from us umb show dry deep soil layers with soils from 1 to 3m maintaining moisture close to residual saturation 0 03 0 04m3 m 3 for the majority of the growing season fig 1b our results indirectly support empirical evidence from the same study site of deep water uptake during periods of infrequent precipitation in matheny et al 2014 deep rooted red oaks quercus rubra were able to meet atmospheric demand during dry periods while shallow rooted red maples acer rubrum were not the different rooting depth strategies of these two species were confirmed using xylem water isotope analysis matheny et al 2017a to cope with water limitation individuals experiencing high atmospheric demand and those with high competitive pressure or lateral interaction must optimize both lateral spread and rooting depth to maintain water uptake during dry periods our analysis supports empirical studies that highlight the importance of both tree size and spatial proximity as determinants of stable plant water relations during drought lechuga et al 2018 5 3 representation of root structure and their coupling with stem and canopies in models implementation of interacting root system structure and rwu in terrestrial models is an area of opportunity for large scale terrestrial models warren et al 2015 three dimensional representation of individual root architecture requires substantial data for parameterization and validation operating within a limited data space compared to analogous above ground properties the simulations here used best available data for community structure soil conditions and species specific hydraulic properties within the study area supplemental material s3 despite scant information about below ground structure and function valuable insights are gained by coupling root hydraulic architecture and interaction with models that capture soil water dynamics one and quasi two dimensional representations of root profiles have offered insights into how forest below ground structure can help sustain transpiration during dry periods by fully utilizing different zones of available moisture e g ivanov et al 2012 expanding upon these insights we have shown that lateral interaction and competition between root systems plays a quantifiable role in plant water sourcing the four representative groups showed divergent behavior in their response to water limitation in terms of zones of uptake and ability to meet potential demand individuals of the same size but with different degrees of interaction responded differently with higher degrees of interaction driving water uptake into deeper soil layers assigning hydraulic properties and atmospheric demand by species would be a future avenue of research and may further elucidate the complex interplay of plant hydraulic strategies at the individual and community scale representative groups were determined as a function of their size and degree of competitive interaction hydraulic strategy serves as a potential third axis for determining representative groups either within pre existing plant functional types that are utilized by most earth system models or as a novel paradigm to define plant groupings on a more physical basis matheny et al 2017b here we neglected stem hydraulic resistance though it may become substantial in tall cavitating trees a simplistic beam hydraulics such as plant functional types that are utilized by most earth system models accounting for vertical variations of sapwood geometry and hydraulic traits couvreur et al 2018 or more detailed stem architecture and capacitance model mirfenderesgi et al 2016 bohrer et al 2005 could be implemented in future versions and would allow more realistic feedbacks between cavitation and leaf regulation of transpiration bartlett et al 2016 for this numerical exercise net precipitation was distributed uniformly across the domain decoupling soil moisture patterns generated from root processes from those generated by precipitation throughfall guswa et al 2012 demonstrated that horizontal variability in soil moisture is modulated in space and time by root e g hydraulic redistribution and compensatory water uptake and canopy processes e g interception and stemflow as such incorporating heterogeneous precipitation would be an avenue of future research the current generation of dynamic global vegetation models dgvms has made tremendous strides in the representation of above ground canopy structure with several modes of representation that allow for testing of hypotheses that address the dynamics among individuals or cohorts in their acquisition of light and other resources fisher et al 2018 further refinement of below ground structure especially in the horizontal dimension is urgently needed to represent spatial and temporal niches of soil environment and control on vegetation function these improvements need to have mechanistic coupling with more fully resolved soil hydraulics to provide the critical basis for linkage between below and above ground processes needed to address questions of resource acquisition carbon allocation and relevant tradeoffs 6 conclusions in this work we presented a coupled three dimensional model of soil water dynamics and root water uptake that utilizes a hybrid macroscale approach to represent three dimensional root hydraulic architecture this model was used to examine the role of root lateral interactions on root water uptake processes and plant water sourcing under water limiting conditions spatial root distributions and the degree of lateral interaction between root systems is shown to shape the spatiotemporal evolution of soil moisture with interaction contributing to the shift of water uptake to deeper soil horizons during periods of low precipitation exploration of the root system through expansion of lateral roots results in the homogenization of soil water potentials a thermodynamically favorable condition which also helps delay the onset of water limitation however root lateral expansion comes with higher carbon investment cost in root tissue production and

324,the plasticity of root water uptake determines the maintenance of transpiration during periods of water limitation and drought however the mechanistic basis of plant water uptake as well as the implications of water uptake strategies at the individual and ecosystem scale remain elusive we model three dimensional root water uptake under variably saturated conditions for a one hectare temperate forest plot for a growing season with a pronounced mid season dry period variations in root architecture hydraulic properties and degree of lateral interaction between root systems produce divergent local responses to water limitation and provide insights on individual and community response to meteorological conditions results demonstrate the plasticity of ecosystem scale responses to surface drying where interacting roots shift regions of active uptake to deeper soil layers with less abundant root biomass these shifts a product of both root system and soil hydraulic properties illustrate intimate links between root and soil hydraulics in determining plant water sourcing we further demonstrate that root lateral interactions are beneficial at the ecosystem scale even when trees compete for water specifically a more spatially extensive root system facilitates access to a larger soil water reservoir often ameliorating water limitation and reducing sharp water potential gradients while the reduction of water stress is a benefit it can be offset by increased root construction and maintenance costs associated with the larger rooting system a plausible viability region of root communal co existence is therefore implied where competitive pressures and root production costs are balanced by a potential water benefit keywords root water uptake root hydraulics water

subsurface dynamics is needed to fully describe water energy and ecological dynamics for vegetated ecosystems mcdowell et al 2013 over the past decade there has been a unified effort to increase representation of root zone processes in models across spatial scales and disciplinary foci couvreur et al 2012 manoli et al 2014 sulis et al 2019 a number of reviews have highlighted current implementations of root system function and opportunities for improvement e g fatichi et al 2015b javaux et al 2013 warren et al 2015 across scales the majority of models rely on one dimensional profiles of root biomass or length with depth largely ignoring the lateral dimension of root mass and function while pioneering studies have examined water uptake for overlapping root systems e g manoli et al 2014 they typically examine a limited number of individuals with minimal representation of root topology or architecture for systems that face water limitation either from short term seasonal dry periods or longer term droughts plasticity of root water uptake rwu establishes the ability of individuals to meet atmospheric demand for moisture and maintain physiological function the manifestion of plasticity is determined by both intrinsic properties of individuals and interactions within the community and environment of particular interest is how the spatial distribution of root structural and hydraulic properties contribute to the plasticity of rwu partitioning of root distribution or root niche separation and stratified rooting depth may allow root systems to maintain adequate water supply during periods of water limitation brum et al 2018 ivanov et al 2012 silvertown et al 2015 rooting depth in particular is widely used in hydrological models to represent the region of plant available moisture yang et al 2016 a proposed complement to vertical root segregation is the horizontal segregation of root systems likely an equally crucial but less understood

into the distribution of plant rooting depths guswa 2008 yang et al 2016 and soil moisture dynamics schymanski et al 2008 across precipitation regimes yet despite the ubiquitous co mingling of lateral roots the implications of investment in lateral root structure on water acquisition in natural forest ecosystems remains largely unaddressed given inherent challenges to in situ measurement of below ground processes physically based computational models of soil and root water dynamics provide an opportunity to explore and quantify the role of root spatial interactions in silico without the need for destructive field measurements in this work we introduce a computationally scalable model of three dimensional rwu that captures forest plot scale dynamics including lateral interactions while maintaining critical plant scale structural and hydraulic information we use observed field conditions during a typical growing season in a temperate mixed deciduous forest located in northern michigan the primary objective of this study is to explore and quantify the role of lateral root interactions in water uptake processes at the individual tree and plot scales spatiotemporal patterns of water uptake soil moisture and plant water status were compared for a range of root lateral spread scenarios architectures and hydraulic properties finally we explore the implications that strategies of carbon investment in rooting structure may have on forest systems that experience water limitation 2 model theory 2 1 root hydraulic architecture 2 1 1 root system architecture root system architecture varies between and within species with axes of variation arising from both physiological and environmental factors typically system topology can be classified as one of three archetypes flat dominated by lateral roots near the surface with secondary roots reaching deeper into the soil tap a dominant carrot like vertical root with secondary roots sprouting laterally or dimorphic a mixed form of flat and tap root systems sutton and tinus 1983 as technology to assess actual root architecture in field conditions without destructive measures e g ground penetrating radar is still developing and unavailable for our study area we use both flat and tap archetypes while a given ecosystem may contain multiple topologies each scenario in this study was assigned a single archetype by choosing opposing topologies for comparison we capture the range of potential root system configurations three dimensional root structures were generated using rootbox v5e available from https www csc univie ac at rootbox leitner et al 2010 a dynamic root growth model that utilizes lindenmayer system l system strings lindenmayer 1977 to generate branching segments along predefined production rules production parameters were defined to generate two general root archetypes tap and flat root systems supplementary material s 1 2 1 2 hydraulic parameterization root hydraulic parameterization is accomplished through a hybrid macroscale approach couvreur et al 2012 meunier et al 2017 the approach uses special cases of microscale rwu equations doussan et al 2006 to generate macroscale parameters that are computationally tractable for large domain simulations yet maintain microscale hydraulic information specifically for each modeled root architecture root segments are assigned intrinsic hydraulic conductivities that quantify the ease with which water flows from root surfaces to the stem microscopic rwu is solved one time for two cases 1 uniform and 2 hydrostatic soil water potential distribution with depth from case 1 the relative contribution of each root segment to overall water uptake is determined and described as standard uptake fraction suf by couvreur et al 2012 the suf values depend on the specific root architecture and root hydraulic properties and are independent of the distribution of soil water potential or transpiration rate case 2 characterizes the root system s response to non uniform soil water potential the two cases yield whole root system equivalent conductance krs and the compensatory conductance kcomp kcomp is a plant scale parameter that quantifies the degree to which water uptake is locally enhanced in wetter soil regions and reduced in drier ones when soil water potential is uniform compensatory root water uptake is equal to zero similar to the suf krs and kcomp only depends on specific root architecture and hydraulic properties couvreur et al 2012 couvreur et al 2012 also showed that for roots with high axial conductance krs and kcomp can be approximated as equal these plant or macroscale quantities are further used in a coupled root and soil water physics model to simulate water uptake at a larger plot size scale the couvreur macroscopic parameterization scheme has been previously coupled to the r swms couvreur et al 2012 2014 hydrus baram et al 2016 cai et al 2018 and clm models sulis

richards equation richards 1931 richardson 1922 to describe flow in variably saturated soil root water uptake is described as a source sink term in the richards equation using the macroscale parameterization couvreur et al 2012 the governing equation of the variably saturated flow mode in pflotran is given by 1 d ρ ϕ s d t ρ κ k r μ φ ρ g z s x y z t where ρ kg m 3 is the density of water

volumes with defined soil properties hereafter referred to as soil grid cells multiple root systems may occupy the soil grid cell each contributing to the overall uptake rate at a soil grid cell k the

growing season a species specific tree inventory was conducted within a 50m by 50m plot in the footprint of the us umb eddy covariance tower he et al 2014 this area serves as the domain for all subsequent analysis and model simulations spatial coordinates of all trees within the area were used to specify root collar locations small trees dbh 10cm of the same species collocated within 2m of each other were assumed to share the same root system and aggregated to form a single stem to prevent domain edge effects the computational area was expanded by 25m on all sides with additional trees added at random following plot derived distributions of stem density and size the entire computational domain is thus 100m x 100m x 2m and contains 574 trees with dbh values ranging from 5 to 73 5cm site specific allometric relationships from previous studies were used to approximate tree height crown diameter and crown height table 1 garrity et al 2012 crowns were assumed to be ellipsoids for the purpose of determining their volume this information was used to generate time series of tree potential transpiration 3 3 forcing data time varying boundary conditions specifically net precipitation and potential transpiration tpot were generated for a subset of the 2010 growing season 06 07 2010 08 23 2010 fig 1 c using tribs veggie ivanov et al 2008 an ecohydrological model that represents water and energy processes and essential regulatory processes for vegetation specifically ecosystem scale tpot was determined by imposing ample soil moisture conditions to ensure that water

precipitation and losses due to interception processes is uniformly distributed throughout the domain horizontal homogeneity of precipitation is a simplification of actual conditions where interception and throughfall processes may produce highly heterogeneous patterns of soil water infiltration this simplification was chosen for the purpose of this numerical exercise to isolate the effects of root system architecture and lateral interaction on water uptake patterns 3 4 soil hydraulic properties soil saturation and pressure were characterized using mualem van genuchten mvg soil characteristic curves van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 parameters defining the shape of the curve were taken from he et al 2014 and derived from rajkai and várallyay 1992 to define soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves the two soil parameter sets represent potential conditions for the observed soil composition table 2 supplementary material s2 3 5 root distributions and zones of uptake modeled root architectures rely upon inference from measured root structural information in particular root length root length density rld is used to describe the length of root per soil volume rld does not linearly scale with the more commonly measured root biomass and requires additional information for conversion including root diameter distribution fig 2 a root biomass density rbd was quantified at 20cm intervals to a soil depth of 80cm using cores sampled near the us umb tower he et al 2013 the median dry weight root mass by depth was fitted to an exponential decay function given by rbd z 5478 8exp 0 038 z where z is depth cm the broad spatial distribution of root sampling throughout the inventoried plot was intended to capture the range of system wide rather than individual tree specific root length srl the ratio of root dry mass to root length was measured for root diameters 2mm root length and diameter were estimated using the winrhizo software regent instruments canada fine root distribution was divided into four diameter classes 0 0 05 mm 0 05 0 1mm 0 1 0 15mm and 1 5 2 0mm based on fractions reported for similar temperate forest sites makita et al 2009 montagnoli et al 2012 the rld profile is described as 8 rld z c 1 c f c rbd z sr l c where rbd z is root biomass density g m 3 as a function of depth z srl is specific root length for diameter class c m g 1 f is the fractional percentage of diameter class i and c 4 is the number of root diameter classes 3 6 lateral spread scenarios three scenarios of lateral spread were designed to examine the relationship between root spatial interactions and tree water status fig 3 scenario 1 sc1 or localized acts as a lower bound for root lateral spread in which the root system extent mirrors the extent of the above ground crown projection scenarios 2 and 3 sc2 and sc3 or intermediate and extensive utilize the lower and upper confidence intervals for root allometric relationships for semi humid environments from casper et al 2003 with lateral spread a function of crown volume fig 3b while the coarse architecture of the root systems expand fine roots are spatially redistributed weighted by individual size such that each scenario maintains the same median root length density profile fig 2b and fig 4 3 7 root competition index tree size is frequently used to extrapolate system scale behavior from local measurements while size plays a large role in determining the area from which individuals acquire water and nutrients it does not account for competition from neighboring individuals to account for both system size and spatial interactions we adapted analogous above ground competition metrics arney 1973 to develop a root competition index rci the rci is given by 9 r c i i 100 j 1 n a i j r a i r a i where aij is the area of root zone overlap between subject tree i and competitor j rai is plan area of root system i and n is the number of competitors as defined by area overlap an rci value of 100 indicates zero interaction between root systems to characterize the impact of lateral interaction on water uptake and water potential status representative individuals were selected using k means cluster analysis lloyd 1982 the selection of cluster variables was an attempt to balance changes in root overlap with differences in demand due to tree size specifically for each lateral spread scenario clusters k 4 were obtained according to rci and dbh first each cluster partition was assigned a value 1 4 that weighted its degree of interaction relative to the other partitions based on rci for example a cluster value of 1 would indicate low spatial interaction relative to the other clusters while a value of 4 would indicate a high degree of spatial interaction relative to the other clusters the assigned cluster values for each individual was summed across the three lateral spread scenarios to determine an aggregate rank with values ranging 3 12 the aggregate rank accounts for nonlinear changes in root system interaction areas across sc1 sc3 and unites them under one metric the aggregate rank is a measure of relative competition status but does not fully account for differences in demand based on tree size therefore cluster analysis was repeated for the aggregate rank and dbh randomly selected individuals from each cluster were used for further analysis 3 9 quantifying carbon water tradeoffs several metrics were used to quantify individual root structural investment and response to water limitation relative carbon investment in root structure between the scenarios was quantified for fine roots and coarse roots for each modeled individual relative carbon investment c for a root system p can be described as 10 c p l p l m i n l m a x l m i n where lp is the total root length for root system p lmin is the minimum total root length from all individuals within the simulation domain and lmax is the maximum total length from all individuals within the simulation domain across all lateral spread scenarios the relative carbon investment was computed separately for coarse roots and fine roots days where potential demand was not met i e tact tpot were counted across the simulation period and compared between the scenarios these are referred to as soil controlled days as dry soils impede the individual s ability to meet atmospheric moisture demands as lateral spread increases the volume of the soil water reservoir also increases at the cost of increased interaction the cost of cooperation w quantifies the relative water benefit conferred upon an individual for expansion of the root system and is analogous to an aridity index it is computed for an individual root system p as 11 w p 1 t a c t p t p o t p where tact is determined following eq 6 and tpot following eq 7 a value of 0 indicates that all potential demand is met while a value of 1 indicates that no water uptake occurs beyond a simple aridity index wp is a measure of the cost of cooperation across root scenarios when all other abiotic facts e g soil climate are held constant beyond a simple aridity index wp is a measure of the cost of cooperation across root scenarios when all other abiotic facts e g soil climate are held constant additionally the centroid of root water uptake characterizes the center of mass of the moisture sink density distribution due to an individual s transpiration flux when the moisture sink density distribution is proportional to the root length density distribution the centroid of uptake will occur at the root distribution s center of mass 0 385m for the distribution illustrated in fig 2b a shift of the centroid above the center of mass indicates that roots in shallow layers are contributing proportionately more to uptake than deeper roots the opposite is true when the centroid shifts below the root distribution center of mass to compare shifts across the different scenarios with variable magnitudes of cumulative uptake each individual s centroid was weighted by its daily water uptake 4 results 4 1 degree of root interaction the three rooting scenarios produced a wide range of root interaction lateral spread ranged from 1 2 4 8m 1 3 9 8m and 4 2 31 0m for the localized intermediate and extensive scenarios respectively the rci ranged from 100 477 100 834 and 2784 5479 across the rooting scenarios supplemental material fig s11 a value of 100 indicates no root system overlap and was found in both the localized sc1 and intermediate sc2 rooting scenarios the largest degree of interaction occurred within the northwest quadrant of the analysis domain fig 5 c which consisted of primarily large growth trees with a higher relative stem density cluster analysis identified four major groups based on root competition and tree size the four groups were labeled low interaction moderate interaction high interaction and large trees fig 5a b the three interaction groups encompass individuals with dbh 30cm binned according to rank these clusters have ranks ranging from 3 5 5 8 and 9 12 respectively the large tree cluster encompasses individuals with dbh 30cm spanning the moderate and high interaction levels with ranks ranging from 6 10 representative individuals from each cluster n 3 5 were randomly selected and used in the subsequent analysis fig 5c table s5 4 2 magnitude of water uptake the growing season was marked by consistent rainfall events until simulation day 22 when precipitation events decreased in magnitude and frequency fig 1a the mid season dry period ended on day 68 when more frequent precipitation resumed a comparison of eddy covariance measured latent heat fluxes with modeled domain scale tpot indicate that despite relative soil dryness observed tact was not constrained fig 1c with a cumulative total of 281mm over the period for the modeled systems the relationship between tpot and tact was driven by soil hydraulic properties and rooting scenario under soil 1 simulated tact does not meet tpot due to excessive drying of the soil across the scenarios fig 6 a as root lateral spread increases accessible soil water reservoirs grow increasing system wide cumulative uptake tact from 183 to 233mm for soil 2 which had higher porosity and overall soil water content uptake was not as constrained and tpot was met across all three scenarios the difference in rwu between soils 1 and 2 which were derived using the same soil textural information supplemental material s2 indicates a strong control of soil hydraulic parameterization over rwu and the onset of water limitation decoupled from root hydraulic parameterization the influence of root structural archetype e g flat roots vs tap roots was examined across all lateral spread scenarios for individuals the cumulative difference in rwu across the growing season varied from 0 11 2 and 0 4 5 for the localized sc1 and extensive sc3 lateral spreads respectively see supplemental material s6 for individual breakdown averaged across the representative groups differences were most pronounced for large trees with localized roots table 3 large trees and to a lesser extent those experiencing high relative competition table 3 high interaction given the similarity between the two architecture responses all subsequent results and discussion will refer to the flat root structural archetype unless otherwise noted while system wide water uptake increases with root lateral expansion the effects differ among interaction groups fig 6b d for the extensive rooting scenario sc3 periods of water stress as indicated by the number of soil controlled days increase for the low interaction group stay relatively the same for the moderate interaction group and decrease for the high interaction and large tree groups fig 6b mean diurnal uptake increases for the high interaction and large tree groups fig 6c d with these groups contributing the bulk to system wide increases in cumulative water uptake fig 6a d 4 3 shifting zones of water uptake under water limitation soil 1 individual uptake during the mid period shifts away from the root system s center of mass into deeper soil layers fig 7 left panel the centroid of rwu responds quickly to small pulses of rainfall returning to the center of root mass distribution or to surface layers as water percolates through the soil column the mid period rainfall events were not large enough to saturate the entire soil column with the centroid returning to deeper layers as the rainfall pulse was depleted as lateral interaction increases the magnitude and timing of centroid shifts change across all representative groups dense areas of the forest i e areas of moderate and high interaction and large trees experience larger downward shifts in the centroid of uptake relative to less dense areas of low interaction as root lateral spread becomes more extensive the low interaction group experiences a downward shift of the centroid indicating shallow soil drying and higher competitive stress across all groups the onset of deeper uptake occurs earlier in the dry period days 23 35 for the localized scenario compared to the extensive scenario where uptake shifts around day 33 while the shifts in rwu occur later and are shorter for extensive rooting they are more intense with deeper uptake occurring across all representative groups without water limitation soil 2 fig 7 right panel there are no significant shifts away from the center of root mass distribution at the plot scale water uptake from characteristic wet days 22 26 and dry days 34 38 periods were compared for four soil layers fig 8 during the well watered period the relative contribution of different soil layers to domain scale rwu is fairly consistent mirroring the root length density distribution however as these layers dry and water limitation sets in the relative contribution of deeper soil layers specifically 40 60cm and 60 80cm increases by 10 15 these shifts are seen across all lateral interaction scenarios but at varying intensity 4 4 soil moisture mean soil water content in the root zone top 80 cm decreased from 0 20 m3 m 3 in the early growing season to 0 10 m3 m 3 in the mid season dry period as rain events became more frequent mean water content rose above 0 10 m3 m 3 mean soil water content values were comparatively lower during the dry period for the extensive rooting scenario sc3 indicative of the higher rates of cumulative uptake fig 9 a b during the dry period spatial patterns of soil moisture closely track root system distributions fig 9c d with localized roots sc1 displaying higher spatial heterogeneity than extensive roots sc3 this is especially apparent when examining the coefficient of variation cv of root zone soil water potential across the simulation period fig 9e the localized sc1 and intermediate sc2 rooting scenarios with similar root density distributions show similar patterns of cv with values exceeding 1 during the dry period cv for extensive sc3 rooting is lower never exceeding 1 even during the mid season dry period implying a relatively higher homogeneity in the spatial distribution of root zone soil water for comparison the cv of rld is 1 25 1 07 and 0 95 for the localized intermediate and extensive rooting scenarios respectively during periods of high precipitation the cv of swp is lower than the cv of rld as soil reservoirs are depleted during the dry period the cv of swp approaches or exceeds the cv of rld these periods of higher variability in soil water potential compared to root density may arise from the interplay between local root hydraulic properties and individual uptake demands overall these results highlight two complementary processes mean soil moisture behavior and variability of soil moisture as mean water content decreases in sc3 relative to sc1 i e θ s c 3 θ s c 1 spatial variability of soil water content as decreases i e cvsc3 cvsc1 4 5 carbon investment vs water acquisition median plot scale fine root density was the same across all tested scenarios fig 4a b with increasing lateral spread fine roots were distributed proportionately across coarse structural roots as such relative fine root carbon costs remained relatively consistent between all three scenarios fig 10 a as the coarse root architectures expanded from localized rooting sc1 to more extensive rooting sc3 relative carbon costs for coarse roots increased as a function of tree size with the extensively rooted trees investing upwards of nine fold more towards lateral structure compared to the localized scenario fig 10b these differences are most pronounced in large growth trees dbh 25cm large cluster which make up more than two thirds the canopy crown volume fig 10c expansion of the root system increases the size of an individual s soil water reservoir but benefits to water uptake can be dampened by increased interactions with neighboring roots so that the actual useable water volume may not keep pace with increases in root system volume fig 10d while increasing lateral spread alleviates constrained uptake the cost of cooperation w becomes smaller to a degree individuals are still unable to meet the full atmospheric demand w is larger than zero despite large investments in structural carbon for the large tree and high interaction groups water benefit e g alleviation of water stress is not gained with w reaching a lower limit low and moderate interaction groups with relatively low competitive pressures compared to their peers are able to meet atmospheric demand w close to zero while maintaining low relative carbon costs 5 discussion 5 1 root processes and soil moisture patterns root water uptake plays an important role in the spatiotemporal evolution of soil moisture but the driving mechanisms e g growth hydraulics distribution etc underlying these patterns are not fully understood see summary by koch et al 2019 the three lateral spread scenarios presented help elucidate the contribution of rooting distributions and competition on soil water content and plant water sourcing the results further show the intimate connection between root and soil hydraulics while derived from the same soil textural information and observed field conditions the two soil hydraulic parameterizations show two different water regimes one soil hydraulic parameterization inducing water limitation and the other not while the subsequent discussion focuses primarily on the water limiting case it is worth noting that these responses are highly dependent on soil hydraulic properties as shallow soil layers 0 30cm are depleted of water plant water sourcing shifts to deeper soil layers fig 7 left panel when soil water is sufficient as in soil 2 table 2 all groups are able to fulfill their water demands showing little evidence of deviation of the centroid of uptake away from the center of mass fig 7 right panel the intensity frequency and duration of these shifts are the combined effects individual water demands and local competition the intensity of downward shifts in water sourcing are largely driven by root system overlap and interaction in the localized rooting scenario sc1 the low and moderate interaction groups fig 7 left panel green and yellow lines have relatively exclusive access to their soil water reserves meeting their modest atmospheric demands and averting extreme drying from shallow layers water uptake occurs across the entire root profile illustrated by no deviation of the centroid of uptake from the center of mass as lateral spreads increase and water reserves become shared among root networks low and moderate individuals experience enhanced shallow soil drying shifting their overall uptake to deeper soil layers the high interaction group fig 7 left panel red lines maintains shared soil water reservoirs across the lateral rooting scenarios but as root lateral spreads become extensive the magnitude or intensity of centroid deviations become greater while the intensity of centroid shifts is greater for extensive root systems this is offset by differences in frequency and duration the onset of deeper water uptake while not as strong occurs sooner upwards of 10 days for localized root systems this is primarily limited to large trees and those with moderate or high interaction lateral expansion of these root systems not only decreases the frequency of these shifts but increases overall uptake due to soil reservoir increases fig 6 c d across the rooting scenarios spatial patterns of soil moisture closely track root spatial distributions becoming more homogeneous as roots expand laterally fig 9 for a given soil medium the homogenization of soil moisture represents a minimization of the free energy of the system heterogeneous fields contain sharp soil water potential gradients and unutilized pockets of moisture in their thermodynamic assessment of rwu hildebrandt et al 2016 demonstrated that homogeneous soil water potentials minimize energy dissipation losses during water transport delaying the onset of water limitation compared to heterogeneous conditions this implies that in environments prone to water limiting soil drying a root distribution which promotes homogeneity is a thermodynamically favorable means of delaying the onset of physiological water stress while maintaining the same amount of overall fine root length between scenarios the coefficient of variation for the extensive systems cvsc3 decreased upwards of 50 70 during the mid season dry period while cumulative transpiration increased 26 over localized roots cvsc1 the modeled homogeneous distribution of soil water of the extensive roots sc3 contributed to a more homogeneous soil water potential field and subsequently higher rates of water uptake further consequences of large soil water potential gradients may include the cavitation of root xylem vessels or physical separation of fine roots from the soil decreasing the conductance of water from the soil into the plant within the leaf decline of water conductance has been shown to begin in outside xylem vessels a mechanism suggested to mitigate the effect of increasing xylem tensions that may lead to cavitation of water transport vessels scoffoni et al 2017 within the rhizosphere the shrinkage of roots promotes a disconnection from soils carminati et al 2009 separating the rhizosphere from highly negative soil water potentials the ability of roots to dynamically adjust their region of uptake due to this decoupling is an important strategy to ameliorate the potentially physiologically detrimental effects of dry soils carminati and vetterlein 2013 5 2 the carbon cost and water benefit of exploration as roots extend laterally or down through soil layers individuals incur a greater overall carbon cost both from tissue construction and subsequent respiratory maintenance fig 10a b this growth increases the size of an individual s soil water reservoir but benefits to water uptake can be dampened by increased interactions with neighboring roots so that the actual useable water volume may not keep pace with increases in root system volume as such water benefits from carbon investment depend largely on forest density and tree size e g relative competition and demand but reach a threshold upon which further benefit cannot be gained by expansion fig 10d the four presented interaction groups low moderate and high interaction and large tree provide a point of comparison for how relative competition and atmospheric demands for water generate independent pressures for root system segregation or expansion low and moderate interaction groups have low relative competition and demand and are analogous to young or low density forest stands these groups perform well with localized lateral roots sc1 able to nearly or fully meet their atmospheric demand without the need for extensive exploration figs 6a 10d this is not the case for individuals in denser stand areas high interaction or with large atmospheric demands large trees large trees with dbh 25 cm fig 5b constrain uptake more often and earlier than smaller trees with similar relative competition similar rci unable to meet their proportionately larger atmospheric demands high interaction root systems also experience the impacts of water limitation more strongly than other groups fig 6b d 10d extensive lateral rooting sc3 reduces the number of soil controlled days for these groups improving their overall performance though expansion does not fully alleviate water stress for these groups it suggests that as forests become denser or larger more extensive root structures confer a water acquisition benefit despite increases in root competition greater rci the low interaction group composed of smaller trees with relatively lower demand benefits most from horizontal segregation i e the lateral isolation of the root system from competitors while larger trees with higher demands must forego segregation in order to meet their larger water demands particularly during times of low precipitation exclusive soil water access is a benefit only while soil water reservoirs are sufficient to meet demand it is expected that in the space of costs and benefits resulting from the imposed root spatial exploration there should be an optimal or viable region of co existence in this region access to a larger soil reservoir has the benefit of water stress alleviation i e w reduction even when competing for soil water with other individuals and results in justifiable carbon costs up to a point after which further investments in rooting spread do not provide additional water uptake benefits this is expected to be particularly true for individuals with high interaction or large size despite having high relative carbon costs fig 10a d additional water benefit reaches a lower limit as seen from the lack of reduction in w fig 10d beyond this threshold carbon investment or allocation is best channeled towards other means of drought response an alternative viable strategy to ameliorate drought stress is to access deeper soil water deep rooting has long been proposed as a coping mechanism for water limitation in some species e g barbeta et al 2015 nepstad et al 1994 thomsen et al 2013 this study instituted a uniform rooting depth of 80 cm a depth which encompasses a majority of the fine root profile as evidenced by field data to isolate the impact of lateral spread within this limit mean soil water content in deep soil layers 1 m remained greater than 0 10m3 m 3 across the simulated period observations from us umb show dry deep soil layers with soils from 1 to 3m maintaining moisture close to residual saturation 0 03 0 04m3 m 3 for the majority of the growing season fig 1b our results indirectly support empirical evidence from the same study site of deep water uptake during periods of infrequent precipitation in matheny et al 2014 deep rooted red oaks quercus rubra were able to meet atmospheric demand during dry periods while shallow rooted red maples acer rubrum were not the different rooting depth strategies of these two species were confirmed using xylem water isotope analysis matheny et al 2017a to cope with water limitation individuals experiencing high atmospheric demand and those with high competitive pressure or lateral interaction must optimize both lateral spread and rooting depth to maintain water uptake during dry periods our analysis supports empirical studies that highlight the importance of both tree size and spatial proximity as determinants of stable plant water relations during drought lechuga et al 2018 5 3 representation of root structure and their coupling with stem and canopies in models implementation of interacting root system structure and rwu in terrestrial models is an area of opportunity for large scale terrestrial models warren et al 2015 three dimensional representation of individual root architecture requires substantial data for parameterization and validation operating within a limited data space compared to analogous above ground properties the simulations here used best available data for community structure soil conditions and species specific hydraulic properties within the study area supplemental material s3 despite scant information about below ground structure and function valuable insights are gained by coupling root hydraulic architecture and interaction with models that capture soil water dynamics one and quasi two dimensional representations of root profiles have offered insights into how forest below ground structure can help sustain transpiration during dry periods by fully utilizing different zones of available moisture e g ivanov et al 2012 expanding upon these insights we have shown that lateral interaction and competition between root systems plays a quantifiable role in plant water sourcing the four representative groups showed divergent behavior in their response to water limitation in terms of zones of uptake and ability to meet potential demand individuals of the same size but with different degrees of interaction responded differently with higher degrees of interaction driving water uptake into deeper soil layers assigning hydraulic properties and atmospheric demand by species would be a future avenue of research and may further elucidate the complex interplay of plant hydraulic strategies at the individual and community scale representative groups were determined as a function of their size and degree of competitive interaction hydraulic strategy serves as a potential third axis for determining representative groups either within pre existing plant functional types that are utilized by most earth system models or as a novel paradigm to define plant groupings on a more physical basis matheny et al 2017b here we neglected stem hydraulic resistance though it may become substantial in tall cavitating trees a simplistic beam hydraulics such as plant functional types that are utilized by most earth system models accounting for vertical variations of sapwood geometry and hydraulic traits couvreur et al 2018 or more detailed stem architecture and capacitance model mirfenderesgi et al 2016 bohrer et al 2005 could be implemented in future versions and would allow more realistic feedbacks between cavitation and leaf regulation of transpiration bartlett et al 2016 for this numerical exercise net precipitation was distributed uniformly across the domain decoupling soil moisture patterns generated from root processes from those generated by precipitation throughfall guswa et al 2012 demonstrated that horizontal variability in soil moisture is modulated in space and time by root e g hydraulic redistribution and compensatory water uptake and canopy processes e g interception and stemflow as such incorporating heterogeneous precipitation would be an avenue of future research the current generation of dynamic global vegetation models dgvms has made tremendous strides in the representation of above ground canopy structure with several modes of representation that allow for testing of hypotheses that address the dynamics among individuals or cohorts in their acquisition of light and other resources fisher et al 2018 further refinement of below ground structure especially in the horizontal dimension is urgently needed to represent spatial and temporal niches of soil environment and control on vegetation function these improvements need to have mechanistic coupling with more fully resolved soil hydraulics to provide the critical basis for linkage between below and above ground processes needed to address questions of resource acquisition carbon allocation and relevant tradeoffs 6 conclusions in this work we presented a coupled three dimensional model of soil water dynamics and root water uptake that utilizes a hybrid macroscale approach to represent three dimensional root hydraulic architecture this model was used to examine the role of root lateral interactions on root water uptake processes and plant water sourcing under water limiting conditions spatial root distributions and the degree of lateral interaction between root systems is shown to shape the spatiotemporal evolution of soil moisture with interaction contributing to the shift of water uptake to deeper soil horizons during periods of low precipitation exploration of the root system through expansion of lateral roots results in the homogenization of soil water potentials a thermodynamically favorable condition which also helps delay the onset of water limitation however root lateral expansion comes with higher carbon investment cost in root tissue production and maintenance suggesting that an optimal or viable region exists which balances resource acquisition needs with investments in structure this work further demonstrates that lateral or horizontal interactions are a critical dimension to consider when examining ecosystem water relations especially under conditions of water limitation supplemental information the pflotran root model repository
