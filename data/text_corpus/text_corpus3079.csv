15395,cometabolism has shown great potential in increasing the engineering feasibility of microalgae based biotechnologies for the aerobic treatment of antibiotics polluted wastewaters yet the underlying mechanisms involved in improved microalgal performance remain unknown in this study we incorporated transcriptomics gene network analysis and enzymatic activities with cometabolic pathways of tetracycline tc by chlorella pyrenoidosa to identify the key driving factors the results demonstrated that cometabolism constructed a metabolic enzymes photosynthetic machinery to improve the electron transport chain and activities of catalytic enzymes which resulted in subsequent 100 removal of tc coupling formation dynamics of the intermediates with roles of identified metabolic enzymes degradation of tc can be induced by de hydroxylation de hydrogenation bond cleavage decarboxylation and deamination evaluation of 18 antibiotics removal in reclaimed water showed cometabolism decreased the total concentrations of these antibiotics from 495 54 ng l 1 to 221 80 ng l 1 our findings not only highlight the application potential of cometabolism in increasing engineering feasibility of microalgal degradation of antibiotics from wastewaters but also provide the unique insights into unraveling the black box of cometabolisms in aerobic biodegradation graphical abstract

and antibiotic resistant genes args is one of the primary issues that substantially threatens global safety of environment and public health klein et al 2018 zhang et al 2022a the world health organization announced that args will be the priority reason for 10 million human deaths by 2050 if no corrective actions are carried out immediately antibiotics in environment has been the major driving force for the horizonal transfer of args larsson and flach 2022 currently the annual worldwide use of antibiotics ranges between 100 000 to 200 000 tons whilst the defined daily doses can be 200 more at 2030 comparing to the 42 billion at 2015 klein et al 2018 unfortunately the antibiotics used 30 70 can be discharged into environment in the form of their parent or active metabolites resulting their frequent detection in our living habitats yang et al 2022 concentration of antibiotics at ng l 1 to mg l 1 in surface water and wastewater in east and southeast asian countries the united states europe and africa has been observed danner et al 2019 however conventional activated sludge processes can not effectively remove most antibiotics ma et al 2018 there is an urgent to decrease the amount of antibiotics from our environment with environmental friendly and more efficient strategies the aerobic degradation of antibiotics using microalgae is gaining interest worldwide as it not only reduces the richness of args but also yields high value added byproducts zhang et al 2021a a previous study demonstrated that it can be applied for the large scale 8500 m³ d 1 treatment of wastewaters with removal 10 100 of different pharmaceutical contaminants villar navarro et al 2018 however a long hydraulic retention time hrt behaves one of the bottlenecks for engineering application of microalgal biotechnology for example the hrt of the abovementioned process was 144 h laboratory scale investigation showed that removal 60 100 of sulfamerazine sulfamethoxazole sulfamonomethoxine trimethoprim clarithromycin azithromycin roxithromycin lomefloxacin levofloxacin and flumequine by haematococcus pluvialis was achieved after 40 days kiki et al 2022 one potential strategy to resolve this issue is via cometabolism simultaneous degradation of persistent pollutants by presence of an easy utilization substrate which can significantly fasten the removal rate of pollutants with trace addition of carbon substrates our previous results demonstrated that cometabolic substrate increased the kinetic removal rate constant of antibiotics from 0 0121 d 1 to 0 0790 d 1 in microalgae xiong et al 2017 other studies also found that cometabolic substrates such as acetate significantly improved the degradation efficiency of certain pharmaceutical contaminants such as amoxicillin and carbamazepine by upto 76 in the same reaction time wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b potential underlying mechanisms of cometabolic degradation of antibiotics have been explained by improved microalgal growth and biochemical components and decreased antibiotics toxicity for example reduced toxicity of antibiotics on microalgae by cometabolic substrates achieved higher cell viability and biomass zhang et al 2021b vo et al 2020 explained cometabolism enhanced microalgal removal of antibiotics was due to increased extracellular polymeric substances and cellular antioxidant enzymatic activities however these are the physiological changes of microalgae the in depth molecular mechanisms still remain unknown thus the objectives of this study are to explain cometabolism enhanced degradation of a frequently found antibiotic tetracycline tc from the physiological and molecular aspects of microalgae environmentally relevant concentrations of tc in portugal hospital wastewater and pharmaceutical industrial influent were 158 µg l 1 and 11 9 mg l 1 respectively scaria et al 2021 extremely observed high concentrations of tetracycline antibiotics have been reported as 32 mg l 1 in effluent wastewater from the antibiotics production facilities oberoi et al 2019 it is necessary to investigate the removal capacities and acclimation evolution process of microalgae under such environmental conditions to understand their survival mechanisms to achieve this we screened four most frequently found microalgal species in nature namely chlamydomonas mexicana chlorella vulgaris scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella pyrenoidosa according to their tc removal capacities and c pyrenoidosa was used for further assessment the effect of tc on the growth of c pyrenoidosa was investigated to explore its tolerance capacity following experiments were conducted to study the removal efficiency of tc with without cometaboic substrate the formation dynamics of metabolic intermediates over time were analyzed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms2 to propose the potential microalgal degradation pathway further identification of key driving metabolism and detoxification genes using next generation gene sequencing technology gene network analysis and enzymatic activities were done to give mechanistical insights finally we evaluated

filtered with 0 22 µm filters pall life sciences usa for analysis of residual amount of tc which were monitored by a high performance liquid chromatography waters alliance e2695 usa 2 3 assessment of tetracycline removal and microalgal tolerance under cometabolism the tolerance and removal capacity of c pyrenoidosa was further assessed due to its higher elimination efficiency of tc compared to the other microalgal species tolerance capacity of c pyrenoidosa toward tc was investigated according to the effects of different concentrations of tc 0 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 on the microalgal growth and its half maximum effective concentrations moreover the influence of sodium acetate 30 mg l 1 on the microalgal removal of 1 and 25 mg l 1 tc was investigated to understand the potential in depth molecular mechanism of cometabolism enhanced removal the concentration of sodium acetate used in its applied amount has been referred to in a wastewater treatment plant which is located in qingdao and treats 200 000 m3 of wastewater on a daily base sodium acetate was added to enhance the efficacy of nitrification denitrification and decrease the residual nitrogen content abiotic controls without microalgae inoculum were set up to evaluate the photodegradation induced changes in antibiotics concentrations under same experimental conditions all the experiments were conducted in triplicates two milliliters of microalgae suspensions were collected at regular intervals to analyze the residual tc concentrations details for analyzing removal kinetics and mass balance bioadsorption

cells ml 1 algae and reclaimed water with 105 cells ml 1 algae and 30 mg l 1 sodium acetate all experiments have been conducted under abovementioned conditions all the samples have been filtered by 0 45 µm filters before its analyses initial concentrations of antibiotics have been detected by a waters acquity tqd lc ms2 water usa all the experiments have been conducted in triplicates 2 5 instrumental analysis of antibiotics concentrations and tetracycline intermediates samples collected for determination of tc concentrations were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and filtered through 0 22 µm filters quantification of tc was performed by a hplc waters alliance e2695 with a uv detector 2485 equipped with a xbridge c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 3 5 µm 130 å mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile hplc grade water and formic acid at a mixture ratio of 80 20 0 1 the detection wavelength of tc and column temperature was 360 nm and 30 c respectively accumulated tc and its intermediates have been identified using a lc ms2 orbitrap mass spectrometer q exactive thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa with an esi apci mixed ion source and a hypersil gold c18 column 100 2 1 mm 1 8 μm details of the settings and running information have referred to a previous paper zhao et al 2021 extraction of 18 antibiotics from the water was performed according to a previously described protocol lu et al 2020 in a brief one liter of sewage discharge was filtered through 0 45 µm glass microfiber filters and 50 ng of inner standards were added all prepared samples were passed through oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balanced spe solid phase extraction columns agilent usa which were pre washed with methanol solvents containing antibiotics were concentrated using a nitrogen stream all extracted antibiotics were dissolved in 20 methanol the conditions of lc ms2 with acquity uplc beh c18 column 50 mm 2 1 mm 1 7 µm were as follows column temperature 35 c injection of 5 µl

was analyzed to avoid the disturbance of potential target contaminants in the distilled water a second step was performed with analyzing the standard samples 0 5 1 5 10 20 50 100 and 200 µg l 1 with r2 0 999 with such running the limit of detection and limit of quantification 0 02 1 10 and 0 1 2 3 ng l 1 respectively according the amount of extracted inner standards the recovered doses of eighteen antibiotics ranged from 85 to 110 all experiments have been done in triplicates 2 6 assessment of the transcriptomics of chlorella pyrenoidosa gene network analysis and degradation enzymatic activities microalga treated with 0 1 mg l 1 tc 25 mg l 1 tc 1 mg l 1 tc 30 mg l 1 sodium acetate and 25 mg l 1 tc 30 mg l 1 sodium acetate were sampled at the end of experiments for transcriptomic analyses to unravel the mechanistical insights of cometabolism enhanced removal in brief 100 ml of the medium contaning microalgal cells was centrifuged to harvest the cell pellets which was stored at 80 c before analysis details of the information on transcriptomics have been given in supplementary materials network analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes was conducted using cytoscape according to their protein protein interaction ppi values to further confirm the role of potential driving genes the corresponding activities of encoded cytochrome 450 enzyme and glutathione s transferase gst were determined under differential experimental conditions details for analyses of enzymatic activities have been given in supplementary materials 2 7 statistical analysis significant difference with p value 0 05 among the different groups has been obtained through the analysis of variance anova with a tukey kramer multiple comparison test 3 results and discussion 3 1 tolerance capacities of chlorella pyrenoidosa toward tetracycline c pyrenoidosa was further used for investigations of tolerance and metabolic fate due to its higher removal 99 2 of tetracycline tc compared to that other microalgal species fig 1 a tolerance concentrations of c pyrenoidosa were evaluated by observing the effect of different concentrations 0 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 of tc on the cell densities and relative growth inhibition fig 1b c there was a negligible effect of 1 mg l 1 tc during 5 days of cultivation whereas the cell numbers decreased with increasing concentrations of tc the greatest growth inhibition was observed on day 2 with values of 1 49 20 55 59 27 and 86 85 at 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 tc the relative adverse effects of tc decreased with cultivation duration and final cell density of c pyrenoidosa reached 1728 1746 1509 1229 and 1053 104 cells ml 1 at day 5 the subsequent inhibition of cell densities was 12 67 28 88 and 39 06 at 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 of tc respectively indicating the recovery capacity of microalgae from tc toxicity adverse effects of tc on c pyrenoidosa can be due to dysfunction of energy metabolisms glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation and citric cycle and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum since expression of key genes including pfka petc glta hspbp1 sec63 and hspa5 in these processes were 1 75 4 4 times lower log2 foldchange comparing to the control disrupted functions of endoplasmic reticulum will reduce the synthesis and transport of fatty acids kim et al 2018 whilst inhibited energy metabolism will suppress the key processes to convert carbohydrates and fatty acids into atp for normal cellular activities xiong et al 2022 we also calculated the half maximum effective concentrations ec50 of tc using an inhibitor versus normalized response variable slope model ec50 is the one of the most widely accepted endpoints to indicate the toxicity of a compound on aquatic microalgae as shown in table s1 the lowest ec50 was 1 306 mg l 1 at day 2 which was calculated as 1 576 1 651 and 1 918 mg l 1 at day 1 3 and 4 tetracyclines have frequently been found in environment with observed concentrations from µg l 1 to mg l 1 our results indicated that c pyrenoidosa could withstand highest environment relevant concentration of tc 3 2 enhanced removal of tetracycline by chlorella pyrenoidosa by cometabolism bioremediation of antibiotics by microalgae based biotechnologies has proven to be a promising alternative approach of current conventional activated sludge since not only the levels of antibiotics and related resistant genes can be decreased but also a zero waste concept can also be constructed gao et al 2022 after 3 days of cultivation the exposed amounts of tc were 92 3 90 0 68 1 and 44 0 at 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 respectively which increased to 100 99 7 98 9 and 99 with addition of 30 mg l 1 cometabolic acetate fig 2 at day 2 the removal rate of tc by c pyrenoidosa with acetate was 86 6 89 5 which was 165 7 275 times higher than the removal percentages without cometabolic substrate kinetics analysis showed there was a significant increase in the values of the kinetic constant k which were 54 8 103 7 higher under cometabolic conditions correspondingly half life t1 2 decreased by up to 51 8 reaching a minimum value of 1 36 days fig 2e a previous study found 69 removal of 2 mg l 1 tc in algal ponds de godos et al 2012 and a 93 elimination of 0 1 mg l 1 tc after 4 days norvill et al 2017 however current study demonstrated a 98 removal of 1 50 mg l 1 tc after 2 days of treatment under cometabolic conditions such results indicate a great application potential of cometabolism in shortening the hrt of microalgae based biotechnologies to better understand the underlying enhancement mechanisms we firstly did the mass balance analysis of the removal of tc fig 3 a b obtained results indicated that biodegradation and photodegradation were the two major pathways of tc reduction under both experimental conditions in contrast bioaccumulation and adsorption were responsible for negligible reduction final bioaccumulated amounts decreased from 2 36 to 255 43 µg g 1 to 1 23 58 33 µg g 1 at 1 50 mg l 1 tc with addition of cometabolic substrates fig 3c d the bioaccumulation accounted for 0 003 0 049 and 0 003 0 015 of the total removal of tc respectively without and with cometabolic substrate out of 93 95 100 removal of tc without cometabolic substrates photodegradation accounted for 59 54 70 52 without acetate which is consistent with previous study investigating tc removal in a high rate algal pond de godos et al 2012 however biodegradation accounted for a 45 16 49 22 reduction of tc after addition of cometabolic substrates which was 20 3 86 1 higher than group without a cometabolic substrate this result indicated that biodegradation was improved for a faster removal of tc with addition of cometabolic substrate the mrna level of abcg2 encoding an abc transporter was elevated by 1 52 and 3 02 times moreover the activities of cyp450 enzymes and glutathione s transferase gst were significantly elevated with addition of cometabolic substrates fig 3e f such data may imply that cometabolism enhanced the uptake rate of tc in c pyrenoidosa and activate the intracellular metabolic enzymes for degradation of accumulated tc cyp450s are terminal oxidase enzymes present in electron transfer chains which increase the bioavailability of persistent antibiotics via hydroxylating the organic compounds with accepting two electrons from nad p h meunier et al 2004 lassen et al 2014 3 3 proposed metabolic pathways of tetracycline in chlorella pyrenoidosa and identifying the key driving genes above described results demonstrated that cometabolic substrates mainly enhanced the removal of tc via elevated biodegradation thus we attempted to propose the degradation pathway of tc with and without cometabolic substrate according to the formation dynamics of potential intermediates as shown in fig 4 a six byproducts were continuously detected during 3 days of treatment and their mass spectra have been given in table s3 we predicted two pathways for degradation of tc by c pyrenoidosa according to the reported data and detected intermediates in environment ring cleavage of tc at the c 11a position caused by hydroxylation can promise the initial step for the generation of the intermediates p1 and p2 fig 4b previous studies also demonstrated that the biodegradation of tc was a result of the initial attack at the c 11a position leng et al 2016 tan et al 2022 further deamination decarboxylation and demethylation can remove the functional groups such as nh2 n ch3 2 and cooh similar biotransformation reactions have been observed in a recent study hou et al 2022 for example hou et al 2022 also found deamination and hydroxylation of tc to form an intermediate with a m z of 211 in path 2 p2 was further transformed into p3 by hydroxylation addition of a hydrogen atom and bond cleavage p3 was dehydroxylated into p5 in path 1 p1 formed p4 from hydroxylation methylation and bond cleavage both p4 and p5 can be finally transformed into p6 which is a simpler compound without phenol rings overview of the previous reports on degradation of tc it seems difficult to achieve a complete disruption of the chemical structure of tc by aerobic degradation for example multiple degradation pathways hydroxylation demethylation and oxidation of tc were proposed during the experiments with klebsiella sp which found that only functional groups of tc were removed yin et al 2020 overreview of the microbial degradation of tc showed removal of functional groups amine carbonyl and n methyl was the major biodegradation pathway of tc ahmad et al 2021 our study showed cometabolism can complete the removal of tc with disruption of its chemical structure for a first time which can be achieved by the cometabolism constructed metabolic enzymes photosynthetic machinery these reaction steps can be carried out by the metabolic enzymes such as transferase reductase dehydrogenase lyase hydrolase de carboxylase peroxidase desaturase oxidase synthase phophastase anhydroase epimerase deaminase cyclase and pyruvate kinase since the expression of corresponding genes was significantly elevated by 1 54 11 80 times log2 fold change with addition of a cometabolic substrate fig 4c detailed functions of these genes can be found in table s4 initial hydroxylation bond cleavage deamination decarboxylation and hydrogenation can be achieved through the activities of lyase hydrolase peroxidase reductase and oxidase following enzymatic reactions have mainly achieved through hydroxylation according to the gene network analysis cyp97ca transferase lyase reductase oxidase epimerase cyclase and dehydrogenase can play central toles in tc removal fig 4d the activities of phase i cyp450 enzymes were significantly increased by 20 50 as a result of cometabolism comparing to the control as described above cyp450 enzymes show a stronger capacity for inducing diverse catalytic reactions which was also consistent with the biodegradation pathways proposed in this study 3 4 cometabolism enhanced electron transport and nitrogen metabolism pathways cometabolic substrate upregulated electron transport in photosynthesis porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism and nitrogen metabolism pathways figs 5 a b and s8 porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism pathways transform porphobilinogen into chlorophylls which act as the reaction centers for electron generation and transport and energy production kang et al 2022 key functional genes such as hemc hemf chlh chlm chle por dvr chll cao and chlg in this pathway were significantly upregulated fig s8 following promotion effects on photosystem i ii psi ii and photosynthetic electron transport were observed we found that log2 fold changes of key mediators such as psbr psbp and psbs in photosystem ii lhca2 lhca4 lhca5 lhcb1 and lhcb2 in photosynthesis antenna proteins and pete and peth in photosynthetic electron transport pathway were 1 61 2 86 1 61 5 05 and 1 5 1 56 times higher respectively compared to that in the control genes psbr psbp and psbs monitor the synthesis of psii 10 kda protein 22 kda protein and psii oxygen evolving enhancer protein 2 which can determine the production rate of electrons during water splitting in psii liang et al 2022 following increased expression of pete and peth encoding plastocyanin and ferredoxin nadp reductase promoted the electron exchange rate metabolic enzymes e g cyp450 receive electrons from the nadph and nadh in eukaryotic microorganisms for degradation of most compounds which is monitored by the electrons formed during water splitting reaction li et al 2022 this ferredoxin fastened electron transport enabled unnecessariness of nadph recycling system and a nadph cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase jensen et al 2011 the redox potential of o2 h2o redox couple is 0 82 v at ph 7 which of the nadp nadph couple is 0 32 v lassen et al 2014 indicating that the photosynthetic electron transport system is an energy consumption process the cometabolic substrate not only can serve as energy source but also can directly devote electrons for generation of reducing power nadph xiong et al 2017 moreover the cometabolism is defined as producing enzymes for utilization of growth substrate to degrade the nongrowth substrate with supporting of atp in this sight several genes involved in nitrogen metabolism including nr nira cyns and cynt encoding nitrate reductase ferredoxin nitrite reductase cyanate lyase and carbonic anhydrase were upregulated by 1 79 5 16 folds whilst expression of an atpef0b encoding atpase was increased by 7 43 folds coupling both the enhanced photosynthetic machinery and increased synthesis of degradation enzymes can improve the electron transport rate and supply more energies and catalytic factor to increase aerobic degradation of tc previous study demonstrated that the cyp79a1 mediated hydroxylation rate of l tyrosine was increased by 2 folds when the electrons in psi from hordeum vulgare directly being transferred to sorghum bicolor cyp79a1 jensen et al 2014 overall observing the data we proposed a metabolic enzymes photosynthetic machinery constructed by cometabolism to explain the significantly enhanced microalgal removal of tc 3 5 protective pathways enhanced by cometabolism in chlorella pyrenoidosa for detoxification of tetracycline addition of cometabolic acetate not only upregulated the key transporting and degradation genes but also enhanced the expression of functional genes in antioxidant systems and dna replication and repair processes the primary adverse effect of antibiotics on microalgae has been explained by the oxidative damages caused by reactive oxygen species ross because these free radicals are highly active for destruction of cellular structures and components antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase d amino acid oxidase and 2 cys peroxidase can scavenge the levels of ross acting as the defensive lines both low 1 mg l 1 and high 25 mg l 1 concentrations of tc with cometabolic substrate upregulated the mrna levels of genes sod2 dao prdx5 and xdh encoding antioxidant enzymes by 1 6 2 4 folds under cometabolic conditions fig 5c liu et al 2022 reported that trace phenolic acids stimulated the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes in microalgae to reduce oxidative damage induced by organic pollutants additionally the cometabolic substrate enhanced the expressions of genes involved in dna replication and repair processes including dna replication homologous recombination base excision repair mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair under low tc concentration details of this topic are provided in supplementary material the integrated dna replication repair process can efficiently maintain genome stability and cellular proliferation guo et al 2021 consistently the growth of c pyrenoidosa at 1 mg l 1 tc and 30 mg l 1 sodium acetate was increased by 26 6 compared to that under the control conditions after 3 days of cultivation fig 5d 3 6 yields of high value added products of chlorella pyrenoidosa under antibiotics conversion of microalgal biomass to high value added products reduces the operation costs thus we evaluated the changes in key biochemical characteristics including pigments total chlorophyll carotenoid protein and carbohydrate with and without cometabolic substrates fig s9 the total chlorophyll content reached 31 16 39 06 38 71 48 44 and 46 mg g 1 and the carotenoid content was 6 23 9 27 9 98 6 57 and 2 45 mg g 1 at 0 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 tc without the addition of acetate the protein and carbohydrate concentrations were 347 261 274 444 and 481 mg g 1 and 216 173 177 190 and 155 mg g 1 respectively under the same experimental conditions a different pattern in these biochemical contents was observed after addition of cometabolic substrates total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents decreased comparing to the control fig s9b which may be due to the disturbed synthesis of pigments in photosynthetic apparatus vidotti et al 2020 in contrasting to the decreased contents of protein and carbohydrate by exposure to tc cometabolic substrate increased these two components by up to 101 and 69 15 achieving 676 22 mg g 1 protein and 250 66 mg g 1 carbohydrate after 3 days of cultivation these data indicated that the contents of high value added byproducts were enhanced under cometabolic conditions 3 7 removal of antibiotics by microalgae from real wastewater under cometabolism to test the effect of cometabolism on the microalgal removal of antibiotics from real wastewater we monitored the changes in concentrations of 18 most frequently found antibiotics in reclaimed water with and without addition of cometabolic substrate fig 6 the total initial concentration of detected antibiotics in treated wastewater was 495 54 ng l 1 which was consisted of fluoroquinolones 420 35 ng l 1 sulfonamides 45 28 ng l 1 macrolides 18 75 ng l 1 tetracyclines 10 52 ng l 1 chloramphenicol 0 64 ng l 1 the measured concentrations were similar to those reported in previous reports for example lu et al 2022 found the concentration of 12 antibiotics ranged from 241 to 1450 ng l 1 in estuarine water after being treated with microalgae and microalgae with cometabolic substrate the total amounts decreased to 441 85 ng l 1 and 221 80 ng l 1 respectively correspondingly the removal efficiency was enhanced by 5 10 times after addition of cometabolic substrates considering the removal of individual antibiotic the removal of antibiotics such as sulfamethazine sulfamethoxydiazine sulfadiazine enrofloxacin ofloxacin norfloxacin fleroxacin and roxithromycin increased by 53 2 to 91 7 with inoculum of algae and addition of sodium acetate however the removal of these antibiotics ranged from 4 07 to 88 0 after treatment with microalgae alone without acetate addition moreover the removal rates of most persistent antibiotics such as sulfamethazine 4 7 norfloxacin 0 and roxithromycin 8 2 was increased up to 53 2 77 5 and 75 6 with addition of cometabolic substrate the chinese government has announced strict policies with regard to discharging treated wastewater into natural streams which limits 50 mg l 1 of chemical oxygen demand codcr mee 2002 there is also an increasing trend of announcing stricter principles regarding the discharge of wastewaters zhang et al 2022b however it remains unclear whether higher standards for water disposal are better for environmental homogenization and function maintenance evidences show that most of the residual contents are persistent organic pollutants such as antibiotics which can not be removed without enough amounts of bioavailable substrates causing significant ecological disturbances luo et al 2022 addition of cometabolic substrates can be soundful approach not only for decrease of antibiotic amounts but also promote the biodiversity zhang et al 2022b xiong et al 2018 all the data from this study suggests that cometabolism has great application potential to accelerate the engineering feasibility of microalgae based biotechnologies 4 conclusions in conclusion c pyrenoidosa could withstand high concentrations of tc addition of a cometabolic substrate not only enhanced the tolerance capacity of c pyrenoidesa but also increased the aerobic degradation efficiency of tc by up to 100 we hypothesized that cometabolism constructed a metabolic enzymes photosynthetic machinery to elevate metabolic enzymatic activities and gene expressions thereby accelerating the electron transport rate and supplying more energy central roles can be played by cyp97ca transferase lyase reductase oxidase epimerase cyclase and dehydrogenase which induced hydroxylation decarboxylation methylation hydrogenation and bond cleavage of tc to form simpler compounds by disrupting tc chemical structure cometabolism also enhanced the removal of different antibiotics by up to 91 3 from reclaimed water with generating high value added biomass this study tried to unravel the black box of cometabolism with a comprehensive analysis of physiological and molecular aspects obtained results can be used to develop a cometabolism based approach to improve the engineering feasibility of microalgae based biotechnologies for aerobic treatment of antibiotics from wastewaters further studies should be conducted to investigate the fate of antibiotic resistant genes under cometabolic conditions declaration of competing interest the

underlying mechanisms involved in improved microalgal performance remain unknown in this study we incorporated transcriptomics gene network analysis and enzymatic activities with cometabolic pathways of tetracycline tc by chlorella pyrenoidosa to identify the key driving factors the results demonstrated that cometabolism constructed a metabolic enzymes photosynthetic machinery to improve the electron transport chain and activities of catalytic enzymes which resulted in subsequent 100 removal of tc coupling formation dynamics of the intermediates with roles of identified metabolic enzymes degradation of tc can be induced by de hydroxylation de hydrogenation bond cleavage decarboxylation and deamination evaluation of 18 antibiotics removal in reclaimed water showed cometabolism decreased the total concentrations of these antibiotics from 495 54 ng l 1 to 221 80 ng l 1 our findings not only highlight the application potential of cometabolism in increasing engineering feasibility of microalgal degradation of antibiotics from wastewaters but also provide the unique insights into unraveling the black box of cometabolisms in aerobic biodegradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic contaminants cometabolism microalgae based biotechnologies aerobic biodegradation driving metabolic enzymes 1 introduction contamination with antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes args is one of the primary issues that substantially threatens global safety of environment and public health klein et al 2018 zhang et al 2022a the world health organization announced that args will be the priority reason for 10 million human deaths by 2050 if no corrective actions are carried out immediately antibiotics in environment has been the major driving force for the horizonal transfer of args larsson and flach 2022 currently the annual worldwide use of antibiotics ranges between 100 000 to 200 000 tons whilst the defined daily doses can be 200 more at 2030 comparing to the 42 billion at 2015 klein et al 2018 unfortunately the antibiotics used 30 70 can be discharged into environment in the form of their parent or active metabolites resulting their frequent detection in our living habitats yang et al 2022 concentration of antibiotics at ng l 1 to mg l 1 in surface water and wastewater in east and southeast asian countries the united states europe and africa has been observed danner et al 2019 however conventional activated sludge processes can not effectively remove most antibiotics ma et al 2018 there is an urgent to decrease the amount of antibiotics from our environment with environmental friendly and more efficient strategies the aerobic degradation of antibiotics using microalgae is gaining interest worldwide as it not only reduces the richness of args but also yields high value added byproducts zhang et al 2021a a previous study demonstrated that it can be applied for the large scale 8500 m³ d 1 treatment of wastewaters with removal 10 100 of different pharmaceutical contaminants villar navarro et al 2018 however a long hydraulic retention time hrt behaves one of the bottlenecks for engineering application of microalgal biotechnology for example the hrt of the abovementioned process was 144 h laboratory scale investigation showed that removal 60 100 of sulfamerazine sulfamethoxazole sulfamonomethoxine trimethoprim clarithromycin azithromycin roxithromycin lomefloxacin levofloxacin and flumequine by haematococcus pluvialis was achieved after 40 days kiki et al 2022 one potential strategy to resolve this issue is via cometabolism simultaneous degradation of persistent pollutants by presence of an easy utilization substrate which can significantly fasten the removal rate of pollutants with trace addition of carbon substrates our previous results demonstrated that cometabolic substrate increased the kinetic removal rate constant of antibiotics from 0 0121 d 1 to 0 0790 d 1 in microalgae xiong et al 2017 other studies also found that cometabolic substrates such as acetate significantly improved the degradation efficiency of certain pharmaceutical contaminants such as amoxicillin and carbamazepine by upto 76 in the same reaction time wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b potential underlying mechanisms of cometabolic degradation of antibiotics have been explained by improved microalgal growth and biochemical components and decreased antibiotics toxicity for example reduced toxicity of antibiotics on microalgae by cometabolic substrates achieved higher cell viability and biomass zhang et al 2021b vo et al 2020 explained cometabolism enhanced microalgal removal of antibiotics was due to increased extracellular polymeric substances and cellular antioxidant enzymatic activities however these are the physiological changes of microalgae the in depth molecular mechanisms still remain unknown thus the objectives of this study are to explain cometabolism enhanced degradation of a frequently found antibiotic tetracycline tc from the physiological and molecular aspects of microalgae environmentally relevant concentrations of tc in portugal hospital wastewater and pharmaceutical industrial influent were 158 µg l 1 and 11 9 mg l 1 respectively scaria et al 2021 extremely observed high concentrations of tetracycline antibiotics have been reported as 32 mg l 1 in effluent wastewater from the antibiotics production facilities oberoi et al 2019 it is necessary to investigate the removal capacities and acclimation evolution process of microalgae under such environmental conditions to understand their survival mechanisms to achieve this we screened four most frequently found microalgal species in nature namely chlamydomonas mexicana chlorella vulgaris scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella pyrenoidosa according to their tc removal capacities and c pyrenoidosa was used for further assessment the effect of tc on the growth of c pyrenoidosa was investigated to explore its tolerance capacity following experiments were conducted to study the removal efficiency of tc with without cometaboic substrate the formation dynamics of metabolic intermediates over time were analyzed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms2 to propose the potential microalgal degradation pathway further identification of key driving metabolism and detoxification genes using next generation gene sequencing technology gene network analysis and enzymatic activities were done to give mechanistical insights finally we evaluated

filtered with 0 22 µm filters pall life sciences usa for analysis of residual amount of tc which were monitored by a high performance liquid chromatography waters alliance e2695 usa 2 3 assessment of tetracycline removal and microalgal tolerance under cometabolism the tolerance and removal capacity of c pyrenoidosa was further assessed due to its higher elimination efficiency of tc compared to the other microalgal species tolerance capacity of c pyrenoidosa toward tc was investigated according to the effects of different concentrations of tc 0 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 on the microalgal growth and its half maximum effective concentrations moreover the influence of sodium acetate 30 mg l 1 on the microalgal removal of 1 and 25 mg l 1 tc was investigated to understand the potential in depth molecular mechanism of cometabolism enhanced removal the concentration of sodium acetate used in its applied amount has been referred to in a wastewater treatment plant which is located in qingdao and treats 200 000 m3 of wastewater on a daily base sodium acetate was added to enhance the efficacy of nitrification denitrification and decrease the residual nitrogen content abiotic controls without microalgae inoculum were set up to evaluate the photodegradation induced changes in antibiotics concentrations under same experimental conditions all the experiments were conducted in triplicates two milliliters of microalgae suspensions were collected at regular intervals to analyze the residual tc concentrations details for analyzing removal kinetics and mass balance bioadsorption

45 µm filters before its analyses initial concentrations of antibiotics have been detected by a waters acquity tqd lc ms2 water usa all the experiments have been conducted in triplicates 2 5 instrumental analysis of antibiotics concentrations and tetracycline intermediates samples collected for determination of tc concentrations were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and filtered

of acetonitrile hplc grade water and formic acid at a mixture ratio of 80 20 0 1 the detection wavelength of tc and column temperature was 360 nm and 30 c respectively accumulated tc and its intermediates have been identified using a lc ms2 orbitrap mass spectrometer q exactive thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa with an esi apci mixed ion source and a hypersil gold c18 column 100 2 1 mm 1 8 μm details of the settings and running information have referred to a previous paper zhao et al 2021 extraction of 18 antibiotics from the water was performed according to a previously described protocol lu et al 2020 in a brief one liter of sewage discharge was filtered through 0 45 µm glass microfiber filters and 50 ng of inner standards were added all prepared samples were passed through oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balanced spe solid phase extraction columns agilent usa which were pre washed with methanol solvents containing antibiotics were concentrated using a nitrogen

r2 0 999 with such running the limit of detection and limit of quantification 0 02 1 10 and 0 1 2 3 ng l 1 respectively according the amount of extracted inner standards the recovered doses of eighteen antibiotics ranged from 85 to 110 all experiments have been done in triplicates 2 6 assessment of the transcriptomics of chlorella pyrenoidosa gene network analysis and degradation enzymatic activities microalga treated with 0 1 mg l 1 tc 25 mg l 1 tc 1 mg l 1 tc 30 mg l 1 sodium acetate and 25 mg l 1 tc 30 mg l 1 sodium acetate were sampled at the end of experiments for transcriptomic analyses to unravel the mechanistical insights of cometabolism enhanced removal in brief 100 ml of the medium contaning microalgal cells was centrifuged to harvest the cell pellets which was stored at 80 c before analysis details of the information on transcriptomics have been given in supplementary materials network analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes was conducted using cytoscape according to their protein protein interaction ppi values to further confirm the role of potential driving genes the corresponding activities of encoded cytochrome 450 enzyme and glutathione s transferase gst were determined under differential experimental conditions details for analyses of enzymatic activities have been given in supplementary materials 2 7 statistical analysis significant difference with p value 0 05 among the different groups has been obtained through the analysis of variance anova with a tukey kramer multiple comparison test 3 results and discussion 3 1 tolerance capacities of chlorella pyrenoidosa toward tetracycline c pyrenoidosa was further used for investigations of tolerance and metabolic fate due to its higher removal 99 2 of tetracycline tc compared to that other microalgal species fig 1 a tolerance concentrations of c pyrenoidosa were evaluated by observing the effect of different concentrations 0 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 of tc on the cell densities and relative growth inhibition fig 1b c there was a negligible effect of 1 mg l 1 tc during 5 days of cultivation whereas the cell numbers decreased with increasing concentrations of tc the greatest growth inhibition was observed on day 2 with values of 1 49 20 55 59 27 and 86 85 at 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 tc the relative adverse effects of tc decreased with cultivation duration and final cell density of c pyrenoidosa reached 1728 1746 1509 1229 and 1053 104 cells ml 1 at day 5 the subsequent inhibition of cell densities was 12 67 28 88 and 39 06 at 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 of tc respectively indicating the recovery capacity of microalgae from tc toxicity adverse effects of tc on c pyrenoidosa can be due to dysfunction of energy metabolisms glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation and citric cycle and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum since expression of key genes including pfka petc glta hspbp1 sec63 and hspa5 in these processes were 1 75 4 4 times lower log2 foldchange comparing to the control disrupted functions of endoplasmic reticulum will reduce the synthesis and transport of fatty acids kim et al 2018 whilst inhibited energy metabolism will suppress the key processes to convert carbohydrates and fatty acids into atp for normal cellular activities xiong et al 2022 we also calculated the half maximum effective concentrations ec50 of tc using an inhibitor versus normalized response variable slope model ec50 is the one of the most widely accepted endpoints to indicate the toxicity of a compound on aquatic microalgae as shown in table s1 the lowest ec50 was 1 306 mg l 1 at day 2 which was calculated as 1 576 1 651 and 1 918 mg l 1 at day 1 3 and 4 tetracyclines have frequently been found in environment with observed concentrations from µg l 1 to mg l 1 our results indicated that c pyrenoidosa could withstand highest environment relevant concentration of tc 3 2 enhanced removal of tetracycline by chlorella pyrenoidosa by cometabolism bioremediation of antibiotics by microalgae based biotechnologies has proven to be a promising alternative approach of current conventional activated sludge since not only the levels of antibiotics and related resistant genes can be decreased but also a zero waste concept can also be constructed gao et al 2022 after 3 days of cultivation the exposed amounts of tc were 92 3 90 0 68 1 and 44 0 at 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 respectively which increased to 100 99 7 98 9 and 99 with addition of 30 mg l 1 cometabolic acetate fig 2 at day 2 the removal rate of tc by c pyrenoidosa with acetate was 86 6 89 5 which was 165 7 275 times higher than the removal percentages without cometabolic substrate kinetics analysis showed there was a significant increase in the values of the kinetic constant k which were 54 8 103 7 higher under cometabolic conditions correspondingly half life t1 2 decreased by up to 51 8 reaching a minimum value of 1 36 days fig 2e a previous study found 69 removal of 2 mg l 1 tc in algal ponds de godos et al 2012 and a 93 elimination of 0 1 mg l 1 tc after 4 days norvill et al 2017 however current study demonstrated a 98 removal of 1 50 mg l 1 tc after 2 days of treatment under cometabolic conditions such results indicate a great application potential of cometabolism in shortening the hrt of microalgae based biotechnologies to better understand the underlying enhancement mechanisms we firstly did the mass balance analysis of the removal of tc fig 3 a b obtained results indicated that biodegradation and photodegradation were the two major pathways of tc reduction under both experimental conditions in contrast bioaccumulation and adsorption were responsible for negligible reduction final bioaccumulated amounts decreased from 2 36 to 255 43 µg g 1 to 1 23 58 33 µg g 1 at 1 50 mg l 1 tc with addition of cometabolic substrates fig 3c d the bioaccumulation accounted for 0 003 0 049 and 0 003 0 015 of the total removal of tc respectively without and with cometabolic substrate out of 93 95 100 removal of tc without cometabolic substrates photodegradation accounted for 59 54 70 52 without acetate which is consistent with previous study investigating tc removal in a high rate algal pond de godos et al 2012 however biodegradation accounted for a 45 16 49 22 reduction of tc after addition of cometabolic substrates which was 20 3 86 1 higher than group without a cometabolic substrate this result indicated that biodegradation was improved for a faster removal of tc with addition of cometabolic substrate the mrna level of abcg2 encoding an abc transporter was elevated by 1 52 and 3 02 times moreover the activities of cyp450 enzymes and glutathione s transferase gst were significantly elevated with addition of cometabolic substrates fig 3e f such data may imply that cometabolism enhanced the uptake rate of tc in c pyrenoidosa and activate the intracellular metabolic enzymes for degradation of accumulated tc cyp450s are terminal oxidase enzymes present in electron transfer chains which increase the bioavailability of persistent antibiotics via hydroxylating the organic compounds with accepting two electrons from nad p h meunier et al 2004 lassen et al 2014 3 3 proposed metabolic pathways of tetracycline in chlorella pyrenoidosa and identifying the key driving genes above described results demonstrated that cometabolic substrates mainly enhanced the removal of tc via elevated biodegradation thus we attempted to propose the degradation pathway of tc with and without cometabolic substrate according to the formation dynamics of potential intermediates as shown in fig 4 a six byproducts were continuously detected during 3 days of treatment and their mass spectra have been given in table s3 we predicted two pathways for degradation of tc by c pyrenoidosa according to the reported data and detected intermediates in environment ring cleavage of tc at the c 11a position caused by hydroxylation can promise the initial step for the generation of the intermediates p1 and p2 fig 4b previous studies also demonstrated that the biodegradation of tc was a result of the initial attack at the c 11a position leng et al 2016 tan et al 2022 further deamination decarboxylation and demethylation can remove the functional groups such as nh2 n ch3 2 and cooh similar biotransformation reactions have been observed in a recent study hou et al 2022 for example hou et al 2022 also found deamination and hydroxylation of tc to form an intermediate with a m z of 211 in path 2 p2 was further transformed into p3 by hydroxylation addition of a hydrogen atom and bond cleavage p3 was dehydroxylated into p5 in path 1 p1 formed p4 from hydroxylation methylation and bond cleavage both p4 and p5 can be finally transformed into p6 which is a simpler compound without phenol rings overview of the previous reports on degradation of tc it seems difficult to achieve a complete disruption of the chemical structure of tc by aerobic degradation for example multiple degradation pathways hydroxylation demethylation and oxidation of tc were proposed during the experiments with klebsiella sp which found that only functional groups of tc were removed yin et al 2020 overreview of the microbial degradation of tc showed removal of functional groups amine carbonyl and n methyl was the major biodegradation pathway of tc ahmad et al 2021 our study showed cometabolism can complete the removal of tc with disruption of its chemical structure for a first time which can be achieved by the cometabolism constructed metabolic enzymes photosynthetic machinery these reaction steps can be carried out by the metabolic enzymes such as transferase reductase dehydrogenase lyase hydrolase de carboxylase peroxidase desaturase oxidase synthase phophastase anhydroase epimerase deaminase cyclase and pyruvate kinase since the expression of corresponding genes was significantly elevated by 1 54 11 80 times log2 fold change with addition of a cometabolic substrate fig 4c detailed functions of these genes can be found in table s4 initial hydroxylation bond cleavage deamination decarboxylation and hydrogenation can be achieved through the activities of lyase hydrolase peroxidase reductase and oxidase following enzymatic reactions have mainly achieved through hydroxylation according to the gene network analysis cyp97ca transferase lyase reductase oxidase epimerase cyclase and dehydrogenase can play central toles in tc removal fig 4d the activities of phase i cyp450 enzymes were significantly increased by 20 50 as a result of cometabolism comparing to the control as described above cyp450 enzymes show a stronger capacity for inducing diverse catalytic reactions which was also consistent with the biodegradation pathways proposed in this study 3 4 cometabolism enhanced electron transport and nitrogen metabolism pathways cometabolic substrate upregulated electron transport in photosynthesis porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism and nitrogen metabolism pathways figs 5 a b and s8 porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism pathways transform porphobilinogen into chlorophylls which act as the reaction centers for electron generation and transport and energy production kang et al 2022 key functional genes such as hemc hemf chlh chlm chle por dvr chll cao and chlg in this pathway were significantly upregulated fig s8 following promotion effects on photosystem i ii psi ii and photosynthetic electron transport were observed we found that log2 fold changes of key mediators such as psbr psbp and psbs in photosystem ii lhca2 lhca4 lhca5 lhcb1 and lhcb2 in photosynthesis antenna proteins and pete and peth in photosynthetic electron transport pathway were 1 61 2 86 1 61 5 05 and 1 5 1 56 times higher respectively compared to that in the control genes psbr psbp and psbs monitor the synthesis of psii 10 kda protein 22 kda protein and psii oxygen evolving enhancer protein 2 which can determine the production rate of electrons during water splitting in psii liang et al 2022 following increased expression of pete and peth encoding plastocyanin and ferredoxin nadp reductase promoted the electron exchange rate metabolic enzymes e g cyp450 receive electrons from the nadph and nadh in eukaryotic microorganisms for degradation of most compounds which is monitored by the electrons formed during water splitting reaction li et al 2022 this ferredoxin fastened electron transport enabled unnecessariness of nadph recycling system and a nadph cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase jensen et al 2011 the redox potential of o2 h2o redox couple is 0 82 v at ph 7 which of the nadp nadph couple is 0 32 v lassen et al 2014 indicating that the photosynthetic electron transport system is an energy consumption process the cometabolic substrate not only can serve as energy source but also can directly devote electrons for generation of reducing power nadph xiong et al 2017 moreover the cometabolism is defined as producing enzymes for utilization of growth substrate to degrade the nongrowth substrate with supporting of atp in this sight several genes involved in nitrogen metabolism including nr nira cyns and cynt encoding nitrate reductase ferredoxin nitrite reductase cyanate lyase and carbonic anhydrase were upregulated by 1 79 5 16 folds whilst expression of an atpef0b encoding atpase was increased by 7 43 folds coupling both the enhanced photosynthetic machinery and increased synthesis of degradation enzymes can improve the electron transport rate and supply more energies and catalytic factor to increase aerobic degradation of tc previous study demonstrated that the cyp79a1 mediated hydroxylation rate of l tyrosine was increased by 2 folds when the electrons in psi from hordeum vulgare directly being transferred to sorghum bicolor cyp79a1 jensen et al 2014 overall observing the data we proposed a metabolic enzymes photosynthetic machinery constructed by cometabolism to explain the significantly enhanced microalgal removal of tc 3 5 protective pathways enhanced by cometabolism in chlorella pyrenoidosa for detoxification of tetracycline addition of cometabolic acetate not only upregulated the key transporting and degradation genes but also enhanced the expression of functional genes in antioxidant systems and dna replication and repair processes the primary adverse effect of antibiotics on microalgae has been explained by the oxidative damages caused by reactive oxygen species ross because these free radicals are highly active for destruction of cellular structures and components antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase d amino acid oxidase and 2 cys peroxidase can scavenge the levels of ross acting as the defensive lines both low 1 mg l 1 and high 25 mg l 1 concentrations of tc with cometabolic substrate upregulated the mrna levels of genes sod2 dao prdx5 and xdh encoding antioxidant enzymes by 1 6 2 4 folds under cometabolic conditions fig 5c liu et al 2022 reported that trace phenolic acids stimulated the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes in microalgae to reduce oxidative damage induced by organic pollutants additionally the cometabolic substrate enhanced the expressions of genes involved in dna replication and repair processes including dna replication homologous recombination base excision repair mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair under low tc concentration details of this topic are provided in supplementary material the integrated dna replication repair process can efficiently maintain genome stability and cellular proliferation guo et al 2021 consistently the growth of c pyrenoidosa at 1 mg l 1 tc and 30 mg l 1 sodium acetate was increased by 26 6 compared to that under the control conditions after 3 days of cultivation fig 5d 3 6 yields of high value added products of chlorella pyrenoidosa under antibiotics conversion of microalgal biomass to high value added products reduces the operation costs thus we evaluated the changes in key biochemical characteristics including pigments total chlorophyll carotenoid protein and carbohydrate with and without cometabolic substrates fig s9 the total chlorophyll content reached 31 16 39 06 38 71 48 44 and 46 mg g 1 and the carotenoid content was 6 23 9 27 9 98 6 57 and 2 45 mg g 1 at 0 1 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 tc without the addition of acetate the protein and carbohydrate concentrations were 347 261 274 444 and 481 mg g 1 and 216 173 177 190 and 155 mg g 1 respectively under the same experimental conditions a different pattern in these biochemical contents was observed after addition of cometabolic substrates total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents decreased comparing to the control fig s9b which may be due to the disturbed synthesis of pigments in photosynthetic apparatus vidotti et al 2020 in contrasting to the decreased contents of protein and carbohydrate by exposure to tc cometabolic substrate increased these two components by up to 101 and 69 15 achieving 676 22 mg g 1 protein and 250 66 mg g 1 carbohydrate after 3 days of cultivation these data indicated that the contents of high value added byproducts were enhanced under cometabolic conditions 3 7 removal of antibiotics by microalgae from real wastewater under cometabolism to test the effect of cometabolism on the microalgal removal of antibiotics from real wastewater we monitored the changes in concentrations of 18 most frequently found antibiotics in reclaimed water with and without addition of cometabolic substrate fig 6 the total initial concentration of detected antibiotics in treated wastewater was 495 54 ng l 1 which was consisted of fluoroquinolones 420 35 ng l 1 sulfonamides 45 28 ng l 1 macrolides 18 75 ng l 1 tetracyclines 10 52 ng l 1 chloramphenicol 0 64 ng l 1 the measured concentrations were similar to those reported in previous reports for example lu et al 2022 found the concentration of 12 antibiotics ranged from 241 to 1450 ng l 1 in estuarine water after being treated with microalgae and microalgae with cometabolic substrate the total amounts decreased to 441 85 ng l 1 and 221 80 ng l 1 respectively correspondingly the removal efficiency was enhanced by 5 10 times after addition of cometabolic substrates considering the removal of individual antibiotic the removal of antibiotics such as sulfamethazine sulfamethoxydiazine sulfadiazine enrofloxacin ofloxacin norfloxacin fleroxacin and roxithromycin increased by 53 2 to 91 7 with inoculum of algae and addition of sodium acetate however the removal of these antibiotics ranged from 4 07 to 88 0 after treatment with microalgae alone without acetate addition moreover the removal rates of most persistent antibiotics such as sulfamethazine 4 7 norfloxacin 0 and roxithromycin 8 2 was increased up to 53 2 77 5 and 75 6 with addition of cometabolic substrate the chinese government has announced strict policies with regard to discharging treated wastewater into natural streams which limits 50 mg l 1 of chemical oxygen demand codcr mee 2002 there is also an increasing trend of announcing stricter principles regarding the discharge of wastewaters zhang et al 2022b however it remains unclear whether higher standards for water disposal are better for environmental homogenization and function maintenance evidences show that most of the residual contents are persistent organic pollutants such as antibiotics which can not be removed without enough amounts of bioavailable substrates causing significant ecological disturbances luo et al 2022 addition of cometabolic substrates can be soundful approach not only for decrease of antibiotic amounts but also promote the biodiversity zhang et al 2022b xiong et al 2018 all the data from this study suggests that cometabolism has great application potential to accelerate the engineering feasibility of microalgae based biotechnologies 4 conclusions in conclusion c pyrenoidosa could withstand high concentrations of tc addition of a cometabolic substrate not only enhanced the tolerance capacity of c pyrenoidesa but also increased the aerobic degradation efficiency of tc by up to 100 we hypothesized that cometabolism constructed a metabolic enzymes photosynthetic machinery to elevate metabolic enzymatic activities and gene expressions thereby accelerating the electron transport rate and supplying more energy central roles can be played by cyp97ca transferase lyase reductase oxidase epimerase cyclase and dehydrogenase which induced hydroxylation decarboxylation methylation hydrogenation and bond cleavage of tc to form simpler compounds by disrupting tc chemical structure cometabolism also enhanced the removal of different antibiotics by up to 91 3 from reclaimed water with generating high value added biomass this study tried to unravel the black box of cometabolism with a comprehensive analysis of physiological and molecular aspects obtained results can be used to develop a cometabolism based approach to improve the engineering feasibility of microalgae based biotechnologies for aerobic treatment of antibiotics from wastewaters further studies should be conducted to investigate the fate of antibiotic resistant genes under cometabolic conditions declaration of competing interest the

15396,the toxic effect of unionized ammonia nh3 on aquatic organisms is receiving increasing attention due to the excessive nitrogen discharge to various surface waters researches have suggested the scale dependence of nh3 toxicity being lower in field than under lab conditions such scale dependence of toxicity is a big challenge to water quality criteria setting as the results solely from lab tests might not apply to natural ecosystems therefore it is necessary to explore the underlying mechanism to understand the difference of toxicity across various spatial scales in this study we used the widely distributed gastropod bellamya aeruginosa as the test animal and performed two 192 h microcosm experiments each experiment included a control and an ammonia addition treatment n0 lc50 n

treatments to mimic different complexity levels of aquatic ecosystems water water food water sediment water sediment macrophytes the results showed that 1 food directly improved the survival and growth of gastropods under expected lethal concentration of ammonia 96 h concentration of nh3 n lc20 of the 96 h acute test 2 sediment and macrophyte quickly decreased the ammonia concentration mainly by sediment adsorption and macrophyte uptake to alleviate the ammonia stress to gastropods and permitted them to survive and grow under expected lethal concentration of ammonia 96 h concentration of nh3 n lc10 lc20 of the 96 h acute test 3 sediment and macrophyte also provided additional food for gastropods 4 under extremely high ammonia stress i e 96 h lc100 food was left uneaten and macrophyte died and gastropods could therefore not be released from ammonia stress our results demonstrate that under moderate ammonia stress the introduction of extra ecosystem elements food sediment and macrophytes significantly improved the survival and growth of gastropods mainly by enhancing their tolerance and by quickly decreasing the nh3 concentration and thus toxicity however these introduced elements had little effect at very high concentration of ammonia i e 96 h lc100 our findings add to the understanding of the reasons behind the previous observed scale dependent toxicity of nh3 on aquatic organisms and contribute to better decisions on the role of nh3 in relation to water quality management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia gastropods sediment

growing anthropogenic discharge from husbandry industry and domestic sewage to various surface waters galloway et al 2004 erisman et al 2007 snelder et al 2020 causing a series of environmental problems such as eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 houlton et al 2019 acidification vitousek et al 1997 and biological toxicity constable et al 2003 camargo and alonso 2006 ammonia has been reported to threaten various aquatic organisms including submersed macrophytes su et al 2012 gao et al 2019 zooplankton gersich and hopkins 1986 fish schnabel and wilcoxen 2020 zoobenthos zischke and arthur 1987 chaparro et al 2011 liu et al 2014 and microbiota anthonisen et al 1976 ammonia in water consists of ionized form nh4 and un ionized form nh3 and both forms can be toxic erickson et al 1985 armstrong 1978 but mainly in the un ionized form since the nh3 can easily diffuse across the biological cells kleiner 1981 the percentages of these two forms of ammonia depend on water temperature and ph emerson et al 1975 wood 1993 to prevent exposure to ammonia of these aquatic organisms various guidelines and criteria have been proposed worldwide to restrict the emission or discharge of ammonia to the ambient aquatic environment anzecc and armcanz 2000 ccme 2010 epa 2013 meec 2020 the various ammonia criteria used in today s water management have basically been inferred from lab tests with simplified culturing systems such standard lab tests have their advantages as they allow for comparable experiment conditions but they do not reflect the stress response situation under natural conditions guidance regarding their practical application may therefore not be adequate optimal studies comparing lab test and pond experiments however suggest a strong scale dependence of ammonia toxicity to aquatic organisms wang et al 2017 liu et al 2021 for example given the same ammonia concentration higher survival and growth rates of the common gastropod bellamya aeruginosa were found in a one month cage test performed in ponds than in 96 h acute test performed under laboratory conditions by liu et al 2021 similar findings were obtained for three common fish species silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix val bighead carp aristichthys nobilis richardson and gibel carp carassius auratus gibelio bloch wang et al 2017 where no dead fish were found in ponds after one year s exposure to ammonia to concentrations as high as 96 h lc50 of ammonia the growth rates of silver carp and bighead carp even showed significantly positive relationships with ammonia concentrations as they benefitted from the higher abundance of their preferred food source phytoplankton after ammonia addition such scale dependent toxicity effect of ammonia was also traced when comparing the tolerance of aquatic macrophytes and animals using the usepa freshwater assessment 2013 where a ten times higher ammonia tolerance level was found for macrophytes than for animals in the compiled usepa cases the tests on various aquatic animals were all performed under lab conditions 4 28 days 0 0003 0 014 m3 while those on rooted aquatic plants were mainly performed in natural enclosures or ponds 24 60 days 0 004 40 427 m3 scale dependent toxicity has also been reported for some other environmental contaminants e g influence of heavy metals on amphipods ingersoll et al 1994 dewitt et al 1999 the mechanisms underlying the scale dependence of ammonia toxicity remain unclear however under natural conditions the stress of ammonia on organisms might be alleviated by a decreasing ammonia toxicity or b increasing tolerance of organisms to ammonia exposure ammonia toxicity is highly variable in natural systems and is basically determined by ammonium concentration and also by ph and temperature as they regulate the proportional concentrations of ammonia the more toxic form emerson et al 1975 wood 1993 the variations of ammonium concentrations per se can be either diurnal or seasonal and are influenced by complex processes such as uptake by phytoplankton anderson et al 2002 shen et al 2019 and macrophytes denny 1980 short and mcroy 1984 absorption by sediment boon 1986 dennison et al 1987 and emission to the atmosphere as n2 upon nitrification and denitrification by microbiota seitzinger et al 1988 çeçen and gönenç 1994 other factors such as food supply can also enhance the tolerance of organisms to ammonia toxicity due to adequate energy and resources supply for survival colinet et al 2006 sinha et al 2012 diricx et al 2013 therefore we hypothesize that in natural systems food sediment and macrophytes may increase the survival and promote the adaptation of bellamya aeruginosa to ammonia exposure as 1 food could directly promote the activity of gastropods and thus allow it to survive ammonia stress 2 sediment and macrophyte can adsorb or take up ammonia to decrease the ammonia stress to gastropods and thus allow it to survive ammonia stress to test our hypotheses we performed a series of acute ammonia toxicity tests in microcosm experiments with various combinations of food sediment and macrophytes to mimic different levels of ecosystem complexity a domestic widespread gastropod bellamya aeruginosa has high fecundity long life span and that it is easy to cultivate under lab conditions chen and sung 1975 yan et al 1999 2001 its sediment dwelling habit also makes it possible to test the potential importance of sediment for ammonia stress in our previous study bellamya aeruginosa has shown its sensitivity to ammonia exposure at various research scales liu et al 2021 and therefore selected as the test organism 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design and sampling all experimental materials were collected from the ponds at a field station n 30 17 17 e 114 43 45 belonging to the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences located to the northeast of lake bao an surface area 48 km2 mean depth 1 9 m on the south bank of the middle yangtze river these ponds were unfertilized and tan of the pond water was below detection limit 0 05 mg l two 192 h lab tests were performed in december 2020 and in april 2021 each involving two ammonia levels coded as n0 lc50 and n lc50 lc50 bioassay and n0 lc100 and n lc100 lc100 bioassay respectively n0 lc50 and n0 lc100 no ammonia input n lc50 0 80 mg nh3 n l 96 h lc50 and n lc100 18 12 mg nh3 n l 96 h lc100 there were four treatments in each bioassay w water w f water food w s water sediment w s m water sediment macrophytes fig 1 the experiment was conducted following the guidelines of ma et al 2009 and astm 2014 bellamya aeruginosa mean shell length 10 12 mm were collected by hand from ponds at the field station sediment macrophyte vallisneria natans and pond water were also collected from these ponds after filtration to eliminate coarse particles and heating to 50 60 c to kill the phytoplankton the pond water was aerated for 24 48 h and used for culturing the gastropods and for the bioassays the gastropods were cultured in 30 l aquariums for one week to acclimate to the test conditions during the acclimation the aquariums were aerated and water was fully replaced every three days food tetra guangzhou china besser et al 2016 was supplied daily with a photoperiod of 12 h light to 12 h dark as in the formal tests the experiment was conducted in triplicate using glass aquariums 20 20 20 cm one week before the experiment thoroughly mixed sediment was introduced to the test aquariums at a thickness of 4 cm in the w s and w s m treatments followed by the planting of 10 macrophytes leaves counted and cut to 7 cm roots and individual wet weight measured in the w s m treatment adequate test water being added to both treatments for stabilization immediately before the test healthy gastropods were selected and then 10 gastropods were randomly placed into each of the test aquariums interstitial water samples were collected from the w s and w s m treatments using rhizon soil solution samplers rhizon sss eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands before introducing the gastropods four liters of test solution prepared from nh4cl nh4cl ar sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china were added per aquarium and the solution was not renewed during the test the gastropods were fed daily with 40 mg granule food per aquarium based on a pretest in the w f treatment and with 20 mg per aquarium in the remaining treatments to guarantee the daily metabolism of the gastropods the water temperature was maintained at 24 1 c with a thermostat water bath in each treatment the initial ph was adjusted to 8 3 0 1 by using 1 or 5 mol l naoh and 1 mol l hcl environmental variables including water temperature ph and do were measured daily using a ysi pro 1020 and a ysi plus ysi incorporated yellow springs oh u s a multi parameter meter water samples for ammonia determination were collected by a 5 ml syringe after 24 h 96 h and 192 h total ammonia nitrogen tan was determined with the nessler s reagent colorimetric method iso 5664 1984 iso 7150 1 1984 and the detection limit is 0 05 mg l nh3 n was calculated following the equation from wood 1993 and emerson et al 1975 at the end of the test interstitial water samples were collected in the w s and w s m treatments and the plants were also weighed as fresh the survival rate and stretch rate of the gastropods were determined daily if gastropod individuals were immobile and did not respond to stab with a dissecting needle they were presumed dead while stretch was presumed when they opened the operculum and extended their tentacles at the end of the test gastropods were counted for survival the initial and final shell length and shell width were measured by using an electronic caliper and body mass measured as wet weight by using an electronic balance sartorious bsa223s and the specific growth rate of gastropods was further calculated by eqs 1 2 and 3 since ammonia could cause significant defensive responses of organisms kosenko et al 1998 norenberg et al 2004 the antioxidant enzymes catalase cat and super oxide dismutase sod were thus commonly monitored to reflect the physiological variations of test organisms yang et al 2011 su et al 2012 hasan et al 2020 the cat and sod were also monitored for bellamya aeruginosa after the 196 h ammonia exposure three gastropods were randomly selected from each aquarium and dissected to collect the innards and instantly stored in vails under 20 c the innards were collected because the sod and cat of bellamya aeruginosa was largely produced in hepatopancreas rich in mitochondria di giulio et al 1989 before detection the frozen innards were smashed with phosphate buffer into homogenates under 4 c then centrifuged to collect the supernatant for measurement of enzymetic activities of cat and sod xu et al 1997 xiong and you 2002 the enzymic activities of cat was determined via the ultraviolet spectrophotometry method xu et al 1997 sod via the pyrogallo auto oxidation method xu et al 2006 and protein was quantified via the coomassie blue method bradford 1976 2 2 data processing and analysis for data processing and analyses microsoft excel 2010 and rstudio 3 6 3 were used anova kruskal wallis test and tukey s test were used for testing the

nitrogen concentrations and associated key factors the tan total ammonium expressed as n in the water increased with time in almost all treatments of n0 lc50 and n0 lc100 bioassays fig 2 a1 a3 while it was relatively constant in the w s m treatment by contrast a decreasing trend occurred in the n lc50 fig 2 a2 and n lc100 fig 2 a4 bioassays excepting an increase after 24 h in the w and w f treatments besides within the first 24 h the concentrations of tan decreased at obviously higher rates in treatment w s and w s m than in treatment w and w f of n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays although the fluctuating trends differed the four bioassays n0 lc50 n0 lc100 n lc50 and n lc100 exhibited similar patterns of tan concentrations among the treatments w s m w s w w f despite the higher concentration in treatment w s m than w s of n lc100 bioassay according to anova analysis the final concentrations of tan were significantly lower in the treatment w s and w s m than in treatment w

in all the n addition treatments to a different extent however fig 2 a2 and a4 their final values were generally lower in the macrophyte present treatment w s m than in the macrophyte absent w s ones excepting the n lc100 bioassay concentrations of nh3 n in the water showed increasing trends in the two controls n0 lc50 and n0 lc100 fig 2 b1 and b3 and decreasing trends in the two n addition bioassays fig 2 b2 and b4 within the first 24 h the decreasing rates of concentrations of nh3 n were higher in the treatment w s and w s m than in the w f and w of n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays during the 192 h test concentrations of nh3 n among treatments followed the similar ranking of tan and generally ordered as w s m w s w w f according to anova analysis the final nh3 n concentrations were significantly lower in the w s treatment than in the w f treatment in n lc100 p 0 01 despite that no significant differences emerged between the n lc50 treatments p 0 05 the ph in treatments of n0 lc50 n0 lc100 and n lc50 bioassays were about 7 4 or above while in n lc100 almost all treatments decreased to below 7 0 excepting the treatment w s m still holding the ph higher than 7 0 fig 2 c1 c4

relatively constant fig 2 c3 while the ph constantly and significantly decreased in all treatments of n lc100 bioassay fig 2 c4 the water temperature was relatively stable in the treatments of n0 lc50 and n lc50 bioassays without showing significant differences among treatments despite the relatively large fluctuations within the first 48 h fig 2 d1 d2 while in n0 lc100 and n lc100 bioassays water temperatures were a bit higher in treatment w and w f than in w s and w s m after 48 h the minimum values of do of all treatments were around 4 mg l or above the do in treatments of all bioassays n0

growth in the w s m treatment for n0 lc100 fig 2 e1 e3 while all plants died in the n lc100 bioassay fig 2 e4 3 2 biological variables of the tested gastropods the survival rates of gastropods were 100 in the two controls n0 lc50 and n0 lc100 and n lc50 bioassays fig 3 a1 a3 and decreased in the n lc100 bioassay after 96 h ranking as w s w s m w w f fig 3 a4 the stretch rates in treatments of n0 lc50 n0 lc100 and n lc50 bioassays were initially 100 and remained high 90 throughout the tests in n0 lc50 and n lc50 fig 3 b1 b2 while decreased slightly in n0 lc100 fig 3 b3 by contrast the stretch rates in treatments of n lc100 were initially 0 then increasing with time with final values ranking as w s w w s m w f fig 3 b4 the body sizes of gastropods demonstrated a similar increasing trend for treatments of the n0 lc50 n0 lc100 and n lc50 bioassays fig 1s a1 a3 b1 b3 c1 c3 with specific growth rates ranking as w s w s m w f w in n0 lc50 and n lc50 and w s m w s w w f in n0 lc100 fig 4 a1 b1 c1 and there were no obvious differences in treatments between n0 lc50 and n lc50 bioassays insignificant growth occurred in n lc100 fig 1s a4 b4 c4 with specific growth rates close to 0 in all treatments fig 4 a2 b2 and c2 anova analysis showed that the specific growth rate of body mass was significantly higher in the w s treatment than in w for n0 lc50 bioassay p 0 05 and significantly higher in the w s and w s m treatments than in w for n lc50 bioassay p 0 01 the enzymic activities of cat and sod of gastropods followed similar trends for the treatments in two controls n0 lc50 and n0 lc100 and n lc50 bioassays excepting the clearly lower cat in treatments of n0 lc100 than n0 lc50 bioassay generally ranking as w w s w s m w f fig 4 d1 d2 e1 e2 the enzymic activities of cat were significantly lower in treatment w f than in w for n0 lc50 and n lc50 bioassays p 0 05 4 discussion as reported by liu et al 2021 and wang et al 2017 the ammonia toxicity to aquatic organisms was generally lower in field than in lab however the underlying mechanisms were not clearly revealed despite they had discussed the possible influencing factors our study revealed an effect of several ecological variables i e food sediment and macrophyte on ammonia toxicity to gastropods and proved that the tested gastropods benefited from the higher complexity of the aquatic systems with sediment food and macrophytes under expected from lab experiments lethal concentrations of ammonia additional food supply might directly increase the tolerance of gastropods to ammonia as evidenced by the actual survival rates of gastropods were 100 both in water only and water food treatment of n lc50 bioassay while the expected survival rates were below 75 5 and 81 5 respectively fig 2s inferred from the concentrations of nh3 n at 96 h of these two treatments 0 18 and 0 13 mg l respectively this happened despite that only half the dose of food was given in the water only than in water food treatment the expected survival rates were calculated by the regression between mortality and nh3 n concentration of a previous 96 h acute test without food supply liu et al 2021 moreover the body size shell length shell width and body mass of gastropods obviously increased in the water food and water only of n lc50 bioassay and the higher growth rate in treatment water food than in water only might also indicate the promoting effects of feeding it should be noted that food supply may not exert any positive effects on gastropods when ammonia concentration is very high gastropods in n lc100 were found to stay still with its opercula tightly closed during the most exposure period and not even move for feeding the uneaten food might thus partly contribute to the increase of concentration of tan after 24 h in treatment water only and water food of n lc100 bioassay along with the high ammonia stress highest oxygen decreasing rate was also found in treatment water food of the n lc100 bioassay fig 2 d4 while gastropods should not be oxygen deficient with the do ranging between 4 5 to 8 0 mg l during the test as supported by ma et al 2010 who recommended that the low limit of do was 4 0 mg l for indoor culture of bellamya aeruginosa similar positive effects of food supply on improving the activity of stressed organisms have also often been reported for fish for example common carp cyprinus carpio showed more efficient regulation of energy and better performance of exercise in treatments with than without food supply under ammonia exposure dirix et al 2013 higher growth rates and energy stores were found for goldfish carassius auratus l when fed compared to starving conditions under ammonia stress sinha et al 2012 when stressed by ammonia organisms usually adjust their nitrogen metabolism to remove ammonia out of cells which is high energy consuming cooper and plum 1987 therefore food supply should have offered gastropods energies for ammonia detoxification despite the ammonia emission by gastropods being undetectable in our study sediment could decrease the ammonia toxicity to gastropods by adsorbing ammonia from the water column which could be evidenced by 1 in the n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays concentrations of tan and nh3 n thus of nh4 in water column generally decreased to be lower in treatments with sediment added than those without and 2 concentrations of tan in interstitial water significantly increased in treatments with sediments added in n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays after the test sediment might promote the survival of gastropods through sheltering gastropods from direct ammonia exposure concentrations of tan were much lower in interstitial water than in the water column during the most time period of the test in the water sediment treatment of n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays fig 2a2 a4 despite that the concentration of interstitial tan became even higher than the overlying water tan in the n lc50 bioassay near the ending of the test concentrations of nh3 n should also be much lower in sediment than in overlying water considering the vertical distribution of ammonia temperature and ph carefully measured in natural ponds liu et al 2021 where a difference of 2 c was found for temperature and 0 2 for ph and 1 0 mg l for nh3 n between upper and bottom layer of a pond besides sediment provided extra food for gastropods in form of organic substances or periphyton as evidenced by the fact that the growth rates of gastropods were obviously higher in treatment water sediment and water only of n0 lc50 bioassay fig 4a1 b1 c1 considering half dose food supplied for both treatments similarly gastropods in treatment water sediment of all bioassays should not be hypoxia as do were above 4 mg l in these treatments during tests excepting the final do in n lc100 bioassay being 3 66 3 76 mg l therefore the fact that gastropods in treatment water sediment gained higher growth rates than those in treatment water only in the n lc50 bioassay proved that gastropods in treatment water sediment were less stressed owing to the decrease of ammonia concentration in water column by sediment absorption and the extra food supplied by sediment as well as the shelter of sediment from direct exposure to ammonia macrophytes could also decrease the ammonia toxicity by taking up the ammonia from water column in treatment water sediment macrophyte of n lc50 the concentrations of tan and nh3 n thus of nh4 in water column and final concentration of tan of interstitial water were obviously lower than those in treatment water sediment indicating that besides of the absorption by sediment the macrophyte in treatment water sediment macrophyte should also have absorbed ammonia from the water or sediment to decrease the ammonia concentration in the system as also evidenced by the significant increase of macrophyte mass when the test ended however in treatment water sediment macrophyte of n lc100 bioassay the macrophyte died soon after the initiation of test and thus only the sediment decreased the ammonia concentration along with the death of macrophyte the do decreased largely in treatment water sediment macrophyte but gastropod should not have been hypoxia since the do remained above 4 mg l during the most time period of test despite ended with 3 59 3 78 mg l similarly gastropods in treatment water sediment macrophyte should also have been sheltered by sediment to avoid the direct exposure of ammonia in water column extra food resources should also have been supplied to gastropods in treatment water sediment macrophyte in form of organic substances or periphyton as evidenced by the higher growth rate of gastropods in treatment water sediment macrophyte than in water only of n0 lc50 bioassay besides direct absorption of ammonia the photosynthesis and respiration of macrophytes may incur daily fluctuations of do and co2 along with similar fluctuations of ph and thus change the concentration of nh3 n schutte and elsworth 1954 colt et al 2009 the diurnal vertical temperature gradient incurred by macrophytes dale and gillespie 1978 also contributes to the nh3 n fluctuation therefore the ammonia stress exerted on gastropods should be slightly released at lower ph and temperatures during the dark period in the treatment when macrophytes are present the fact that gastropods in treatment water sediment macrophyte had obviously higher growth rates than those in treatment water only in the n lc50 bioassay was thus explained by the positive effects of macrophyte on decreasing ammonia concentration and extra food supplied as organic substances or periphyton the results of the measured enzymic activities of cat and sod were not consistent with that inferred from the growth of gastropods the higher growth rate of body size of gastropods in treatment water sediment and water sediment macrophyte than in treatment water food should have explained the higher tolerance to ammonia stress in the previous two treatments than in the latter one while the fact is that enzymic activities of cat in the n0 lc50 and n lc50 bioassays showed the highest tolerance of gastropods in treatment water food than in the rest treatments and the results of sod were even more confusing similar phenomenon has also been found in other organisms for example during the 36 h exposure to paraquat the mussel geukensia demissa showed obvious dose dependent increases in the enzymic activities of sod and cat with a decrease in the highest dose treatment within the previous 12 h while during the latter 24 h the enzymic activities in paraquat added treatments were almost close to or even lower than in control wenning et al 1988 therefore moderate toxicant or pollutant exposure instant or short interval monitoring of the enzymic activities of cat and sod might be good indicators for the status of stress of organisms barabás et al 1984 wenning et al 1988 su et al 2012 while under the long term ammonia exposure adaption to the exposing condition occurs making its indicator value useless particularly under natural conditions wenning et al 1988 dimitrova et al 1994 yang et al 2011 the current criteria for ammonia management of ambient waters have been inferred solely from lab tests with simplified culturing systems and no practical tests under natural condition the scale dependent toxicity of environmental contaminants has long been discussed and most studies were qualitative this study quantitatively provides new evidence of the underlying mechanisms showing the role of ecosystem complexity on the response to ammonia our results contribute to the understanding of the impact response process of excessive loading of ammonium to aquatic ecosystems and provide scientific references for ammonia management 5 conclusion in conclusion our results showed that 1 food supply directly promoted the tolerance of gastropods to ammonia and thus allowed it to survive and grow under lethal ammonia concentration 2 sediment decreased the ammonia toxicity to gastropods by quickly adsorbing ammonia in water column also by providing additional food for gastropods and possibly by acting as a shelter for gastropods from direct exposure to high ammonia concentrations 3 macrophytes decreased the ammonia toxicity to gastropods by taking up ammonia in water column also possibly by providing extra food sources for gastropods our results further showed that the introduction of these ecological elements had little effect at very high concentration of ammonia i e 96 h lc100 moreover the physiological variables cat and sod did not satisfactorily reflect the stress of ammonia on animals or the response of tested animals to ammonia stress in this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

growing anthropogenic discharge from husbandry industry and domestic sewage to various surface waters galloway et al 2004 erisman et al 2007 snelder et al 2020 causing a series of environmental problems such as eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 houlton et al 2019 acidification vitousek et al 1997 and biological toxicity constable et al 2003 camargo and alonso 2006 ammonia has been reported to threaten various aquatic organisms including submersed macrophytes su et al 2012 gao et al 2019 zooplankton gersich and hopkins 1986 fish schnabel and wilcoxen 2020 zoobenthos zischke and arthur 1987 chaparro et al 2011 liu et al 2014 and microbiota anthonisen et al 1976 ammonia in water consists of ionized form nh4 and un ionized form nh3 and both forms can be toxic erickson et al 1985 armstrong 1978 but mainly in the un ionized form since the nh3 can easily diffuse across the biological cells kleiner 1981 the percentages of these two forms of ammonia depend on water temperature and ph emerson et al 1975 wood 1993 to prevent exposure to ammonia of these aquatic organisms various guidelines and criteria have been proposed worldwide to restrict the emission or discharge of ammonia to the ambient aquatic environment anzecc and armcanz 2000 ccme 2010 epa 2013 meec 2020 the various ammonia criteria used in today s water management have basically been inferred from lab tests with simplified culturing systems such standard lab tests have their advantages as they allow for comparable experiment conditions but they do not reflect the stress response situation under natural conditions guidance regarding their practical application may therefore not be adequate optimal studies comparing lab test and pond experiments however suggest a strong scale dependence of ammonia toxicity to aquatic organisms wang et al 2017 liu et al 2021 for example given the same ammonia concentration higher survival and growth rates of the common gastropod bellamya aeruginosa were found in a one month cage test performed in ponds than in 96 h acute test performed under laboratory conditions by liu et al 2021 similar findings were obtained for three common fish species silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix val bighead carp aristichthys nobilis richardson and gibel carp carassius auratus gibelio bloch wang et al 2017 where no dead fish were found in ponds after one year s exposure to ammonia to concentrations as high as 96 h lc50 of ammonia the growth rates of silver carp and bighead carp even showed significantly positive relationships with ammonia concentrations as they benefitted from the higher abundance of their preferred food source phytoplankton after ammonia addition such scale dependent toxicity effect of ammonia was also traced when comparing the tolerance of aquatic macrophytes and animals using the usepa freshwater assessment 2013 where a ten times higher ammonia tolerance level was found for macrophytes than for animals in the compiled usepa cases the tests on various aquatic animals were all performed under lab conditions 4 28 days 0 0003 0 014 m3 while those on rooted aquatic plants were mainly performed in natural enclosures or ponds 24 60 days 0 004 40 427 m3 scale dependent toxicity has also been reported for some other environmental contaminants e g influence of heavy metals on amphipods ingersoll et al 1994 dewitt et al 1999 the mechanisms underlying the scale dependence of ammonia toxicity remain unclear however under natural conditions the stress of ammonia on organisms might be alleviated by a decreasing ammonia toxicity or b increasing tolerance of organisms to ammonia exposure ammonia toxicity is highly variable in natural systems and is basically determined by ammonium concentration and also by ph and temperature as they regulate the proportional concentrations of ammonia the more toxic form emerson et al 1975 wood 1993 the variations of ammonium concentrations per se can be either diurnal or seasonal and are influenced by complex processes such as uptake by phytoplankton anderson et al 2002 shen et al 2019 and macrophytes denny 1980 short and mcroy 1984 absorption by sediment boon 1986 dennison et al 1987 and emission to the atmosphere as n2 upon nitrification and denitrification by microbiota seitzinger et al 1988 çeçen and gönenç 1994 other factors such as food supply can also enhance the tolerance of organisms to ammonia toxicity due to adequate energy and resources supply for survival colinet et al 2006 sinha et al 2012 diricx et al 2013 therefore we hypothesize that in natural systems food sediment and macrophytes may increase the survival and promote the adaptation of bellamya aeruginosa to ammonia exposure as 1 food could directly promote the activity of gastropods and thus allow it to survive ammonia stress 2 sediment and macrophyte can adsorb or take up ammonia to decrease the ammonia stress to gastropods and thus allow it to survive ammonia stress to test our hypotheses we performed a series of acute ammonia toxicity tests in microcosm experiments with various combinations of food sediment and macrophytes to mimic different levels of ecosystem complexity a domestic widespread gastropod bellamya aeruginosa has high fecundity long life span and that it is easy to cultivate under lab conditions chen and sung 1975 yan et al 1999 2001 its sediment dwelling habit also makes it possible to test the potential importance of sediment for ammonia stress in our previous study bellamya aeruginosa has shown its sensitivity to ammonia exposure at various research scales liu et al 2021 and therefore selected as the test organism 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design and sampling all experimental materials were collected from the ponds at a field station n 30 17 17 e 114 43 45 belonging to the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences located to the northeast of lake bao an surface area 48 km2 mean depth 1 9 m on the south bank of the middle yangtze river these ponds were unfertilized and tan of the pond water was below detection limit 0 05 mg l two 192 h lab tests were performed in december 2020 and in april 2021 each involving two ammonia levels coded as n0 lc50 and n lc50 lc50 bioassay and n0 lc100 and n lc100 lc100 bioassay respectively n0 lc50 and n0 lc100 no ammonia input n lc50 0 80 mg nh3 n l 96 h lc50 and n lc100 18 12 mg nh3 n l 96 h lc100 there were four treatments in each bioassay w water w f water food w s water sediment w s m water sediment macrophytes fig 1 the experiment was conducted following the guidelines of ma et al 2009 and astm 2014 bellamya aeruginosa mean shell length 10 12 mm were collected by hand from ponds at the field station sediment macrophyte vallisneria natans and pond water were also collected from these ponds after filtration to eliminate coarse particles and heating to 50 60 c to kill the phytoplankton the pond water was aerated for 24 48 h and used for culturing the gastropods and for the bioassays the gastropods were cultured in 30 l aquariums for one week to acclimate to the test conditions during the acclimation the aquariums were aerated and water was fully replaced every three days food tetra guangzhou china besser et al 2016 was supplied daily with a photoperiod of 12 h light to 12 h dark as in the formal tests the experiment was conducted in triplicate using glass aquariums 20 20 20 cm one week before the experiment thoroughly mixed sediment was introduced to the test aquariums at a thickness of 4 cm in the w s and w s m treatments followed by the planting of 10 macrophytes leaves counted and cut to 7 cm roots and individual wet weight measured in the w s m treatment adequate test water being added to both treatments for stabilization immediately before the test healthy gastropods were selected and then 10 gastropods were randomly placed into each of the test aquariums interstitial water samples were collected from the w s and w s m treatments using rhizon soil solution samplers rhizon sss eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands before introducing the gastropods four liters of test solution prepared from nh4cl nh4cl ar sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china were added per aquarium and the solution was not renewed during the test the gastropods were fed daily with 40 mg granule food per aquarium based on a pretest in the w f treatment and with 20 mg per aquarium in the remaining treatments to guarantee the daily metabolism of the gastropods the water temperature was maintained at 24 1 c with a thermostat water bath in each treatment the initial ph was adjusted to 8 3 0 1 by using 1 or 5 mol l naoh and 1 mol l hcl environmental variables including water temperature ph and do were measured daily using a ysi pro 1020 and a ysi plus ysi incorporated yellow springs oh u s a multi parameter meter water samples for ammonia determination were collected by a 5 ml syringe after 24 h 96 h and 192 h total ammonia nitrogen tan was determined with the nessler s reagent colorimetric method iso 5664 1984 iso 7150 1 1984 and the detection limit is 0 05 mg l nh3 n was calculated following the equation from wood 1993 and emerson et al 1975 at the end of the test interstitial water samples were collected in the w s and w s m treatments and the plants were also weighed as fresh the survival rate and stretch rate of the gastropods were determined daily if gastropod individuals were immobile and did not respond to stab with a dissecting needle they were presumed dead while stretch was presumed when they opened the operculum and extended their tentacles at the end of the test gastropods were counted for survival the initial and final shell length and shell width were measured by using an electronic caliper and body mass measured as wet weight by using an electronic balance sartorious bsa223s and the specific growth rate of gastropods was further calculated by eqs 1 2 and 3 since ammonia could cause significant defensive responses of organisms kosenko et al 1998 norenberg et al 2004 the antioxidant enzymes catalase cat and super oxide dismutase sod were thus commonly monitored to reflect the physiological variations of test organisms yang et al 2011 su et al 2012 hasan et al 2020 the cat and sod were also monitored for bellamya aeruginosa after the 196 h ammonia exposure three gastropods were randomly selected from each aquarium and dissected to collect the innards and instantly stored in vails under 20 c the innards were collected because the sod and cat of bellamya aeruginosa was largely produced in hepatopancreas rich in mitochondria di giulio et al 1989 before detection the frozen innards were smashed with phosphate buffer into homogenates under 4 c then centrifuged to collect the supernatant for measurement of enzymetic activities of cat and sod xu et al 1997 xiong and you 2002 the enzymic activities of cat was determined via the ultraviolet spectrophotometry method xu et al 1997 sod via the pyrogallo auto oxidation method xu et al 2006 and protein was quantified via the coomassie blue method bradford 1976 2 2 data processing and analysis for data processing and analyses microsoft excel 2010 and rstudio 3 6 3 were used anova kruskal wallis test and tukey s test were used for testing the

it was relatively constant in the w s m treatment by contrast a decreasing trend occurred in the n lc50 fig 2 a2 and n lc100 fig 2 a4 bioassays excepting an increase after 24 h in the w and w f treatments besides within the first 24 h the concentrations of tan decreased at obviously higher rates in treatment w s and w s m than in treatment w and w f of n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays although the fluctuating trends differed the four bioassays n0 lc50 n0 lc100 n lc50 and n lc100 exhibited similar patterns of tan concentrations among the treatments w s m w s w w f despite the higher concentration in treatment w s m than w s of n lc100 bioassay according to anova analysis the final concentrations of tan were significantly lower in the treatment w s and w s m than in treatment w and w f of n lc100 p 0 01 despite that no significant differences occurred between the treatments of n lc50 p 0 05 the tan in the interstitial water in the two treatments with sediment added increased in all the n addition treatments to a different extent however fig 2 a2 and a4 their final values were generally lower in the macrophyte present treatment w s m than in the macrophyte absent w s ones excepting the n lc100 bioassay concentrations of nh3 n in the water showed increasing trends in the two controls n0 lc50 and n0 lc100 fig 2 b1 and b3 and decreasing trends in the two n addition bioassays fig 2 b2 and b4 within the first 24 h the decreasing rates of concentrations of nh3 n were higher in the treatment w s and w s m than in the w f and w of n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays during the 192 h test concentrations of nh3 n among treatments followed the similar ranking of tan and generally ordered as w s m w s w w f according to anova analysis the final nh3 n concentrations were significantly lower in the w s treatment than in the w f treatment in n lc100 p 0 01 despite that no significant differences emerged between the n lc50 treatments p 0 05 the ph in treatments of n0 lc50 n0 lc100 and n lc50 bioassays were about 7 4 or above while in n lc100 almost all treatments decreased to below 7 0 excepting the treatment w s m still holding the ph higher than 7 0 fig 2 c1 c4 the ph in treatments of n0 lc50 and n lc50 displayed slightly increasing trends in treatment w s and w s m but decreasing trend in treatment w and w f fig 2 c1 c2 the ph in treatments of n0 lc100 were relatively constant fig 2 c3 while the ph constantly and significantly decreased in all treatments of n lc100 bioassay fig 2 c4 the water temperature was relatively stable in the treatments of n0 lc50 and n lc50 bioassays without showing significant differences among treatments despite the relatively large fluctuations within the first 48 h fig 2 d1 d2 while in n0 lc100 and n lc100 bioassays water temperatures were a bit higher in treatment w and w f than in w s and w s m after 48 h the minimum values of do of all treatments were around 4 mg l or above the do in treatments of all bioassays n0

growth in the w s m treatment for n0 lc100 fig 2 e1 e3 while all plants died in the n lc100 bioassay fig 2 e4 3 2 biological variables of the tested gastropods the survival rates of gastropods were

lc50 n0 lc100 and n lc50 bioassays were initially 100 and remained high 90 throughout the tests in n0 lc50 and n lc50 fig 3 b1 b2 while decreased slightly in n0 lc100 fig 3 b3 by contrast the stretch rates in treatments of n lc100 were initially 0 then increasing with time with final values ranking as w s w w s m w f fig 3 b4 the body sizes of gastropods demonstrated a similar increasing trend for treatments of the n0 lc50 n0 lc100 and n lc50 bioassays fig 1s a1 a3 b1 b3 c1 c3 with specific growth rates ranking as w s w s m w f w in n0 lc50 and n lc50 and w s m w s w w f in n0 lc100 fig 4 a1 b1 c1 and there were no obvious differences in treatments between n0 lc50 and n lc50 bioassays insignificant growth occurred in n lc100 fig 1s a4 b4 c4 with specific growth rates close to 0 in all treatments fig 4 a2 b2 and c2 anova analysis showed that the specific growth rate of body mass was significantly higher in the w s treatment than in w for n0 lc50 bioassay p 0 05 and significantly higher in the w s and w s m treatments than in w for n lc50 bioassay p 0 01 the enzymic activities of cat and sod of gastropods followed similar trends for the treatments in two controls n0 lc50 and n0 lc100 and n lc50 bioassays excepting the clearly lower cat in treatments of n0 lc100 than n0 lc50 bioassay generally ranking as w w s w s m w f fig 4 d1 d2 e1 e2 the enzymic activities of cat were significantly lower in treatment w f than in w for n0 lc50 and n lc50 bioassays p 0 05 4 discussion as reported by liu et al 2021 and wang et al 2017 the ammonia toxicity to aquatic organisms was generally lower in field than in lab however the underlying mechanisms were not clearly revealed despite they had discussed the possible influencing factors our study revealed an effect of several ecological variables i e food sediment and macrophyte on ammonia toxicity to gastropods and proved that the tested gastropods benefited from the higher complexity of the aquatic systems with sediment food and macrophytes under expected from lab experiments lethal concentrations of ammonia additional food supply might directly increase the tolerance of gastropods to ammonia as evidenced by the actual survival rates of gastropods were 100 both in water only and water food treatment of n lc50 bioassay while the expected survival rates were below 75 5 and 81 5 respectively fig 2s inferred from the concentrations of nh3 n at 96 h of these two treatments 0 18 and 0 13 mg l respectively this happened despite that only half the dose of food was given in the water only than in water food treatment the expected survival rates were calculated by the regression between mortality and nh3 n concentration of a previous 96 h acute test without food supply liu et al 2021 moreover the body size shell length shell width and body mass of gastropods obviously increased in the water food and water only of n lc50 bioassay and the higher growth rate in treatment water food than in water only might also indicate the promoting effects of feeding it should be noted that food supply may not exert any positive effects on gastropods when ammonia concentration is very high gastropods in n lc100 were found to stay still with its opercula tightly closed during the most exposure period and not even move for feeding the uneaten food might thus partly contribute to the increase of concentration of tan after 24 h in treatment water only and water food of n lc100 bioassay along with the high ammonia stress highest oxygen decreasing rate was also found in treatment water food of the n lc100 bioassay fig 2 d4 while gastropods should not be oxygen deficient with the do ranging between 4 5 to 8 0 mg l during the test as supported by ma et al 2010 who recommended that the low limit of do was 4 0 mg l for indoor culture of bellamya aeruginosa similar positive effects of food supply on improving the activity of stressed organisms have also often been reported for fish for example common carp cyprinus carpio showed more efficient regulation of energy and better performance of exercise in treatments with than without food supply under ammonia exposure dirix et al 2013 higher growth rates and energy stores were found for goldfish carassius auratus l when fed compared to starving conditions under ammonia stress sinha et al 2012 when stressed by ammonia organisms usually adjust their nitrogen metabolism to remove ammonia out of cells which is high energy consuming cooper and plum 1987 therefore food supply should have offered gastropods energies for ammonia detoxification despite the ammonia emission by gastropods being undetectable in our study sediment could decrease the ammonia toxicity to gastropods by adsorbing ammonia from the water column which could be evidenced by 1 in the n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays concentrations of tan and nh3 n thus of nh4 in water column generally decreased to be lower in treatments with sediment added than those without and 2 concentrations of tan in interstitial water significantly increased in treatments with sediments added in n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays after the test sediment might promote the survival of gastropods through sheltering gastropods from direct ammonia exposure concentrations of tan were much lower in interstitial water than in the water column during the most time period of the test in the water sediment treatment of n lc50 and n lc100 bioassays fig 2a2 a4 despite that the concentration of interstitial tan became even higher than the overlying water tan in the n lc50 bioassay near the ending of the test concentrations of nh3 n should also be much lower in sediment than in overlying water considering the vertical distribution of ammonia temperature and ph carefully measured in natural ponds liu et al 2021 where a difference of 2 c was found for temperature and 0 2 for ph and 1 0 mg l for nh3 n between upper and bottom layer of a pond besides sediment provided extra food for gastropods in form of organic substances or periphyton as evidenced by the fact that the growth rates of gastropods were obviously higher in treatment water sediment and water only of n0 lc50 bioassay fig 4a1 b1 c1 considering half dose food supplied for both treatments similarly gastropods in treatment water sediment of all bioassays should not be hypoxia as do were above 4 mg l in these treatments during tests excepting the final do in n lc100 bioassay being 3 66 3 76 mg l therefore the fact that gastropods in treatment water sediment gained higher growth rates than those in treatment water only in the n lc50 bioassay proved that gastropods in treatment water sediment were less stressed owing to the decrease of ammonia concentration in water column by sediment absorption and the extra food supplied by sediment as well as the shelter of sediment from direct exposure to ammonia macrophytes could also decrease the ammonia toxicity by taking up the ammonia from water column in treatment water sediment macrophyte of n lc50 the concentrations of tan and nh3 n thus of nh4 in water column and final concentration of tan of interstitial water were obviously lower than those in treatment water sediment indicating that besides of the absorption by sediment the macrophyte in treatment water sediment macrophyte should also have absorbed ammonia from the water or sediment to decrease the ammonia concentration in the system as also evidenced by the significant increase of macrophyte mass when the test ended however in treatment water sediment macrophyte of n lc100 bioassay the macrophyte died soon after the initiation of test and thus only the sediment decreased the ammonia concentration along with the death of macrophyte the do decreased largely in treatment water sediment macrophyte but gastropod should not have been hypoxia since the do remained above 4 mg l during the most time period of test despite ended with 3 59 3 78 mg l similarly gastropods in treatment water sediment macrophyte should also have been sheltered by sediment to avoid the direct exposure of ammonia in water column extra food resources should also have been supplied to gastropods in treatment water sediment macrophyte in form of organic substances or periphyton as evidenced by the higher growth rate of gastropods in treatment water sediment macrophyte than in water only of n0 lc50 bioassay besides direct absorption of ammonia the photosynthesis and respiration of macrophytes may incur daily fluctuations of do and co2 along with similar fluctuations of ph and thus change the concentration of nh3 n schutte and elsworth 1954 colt et al 2009 the diurnal vertical temperature gradient incurred by macrophytes dale and gillespie 1978 also contributes to the nh3 n fluctuation therefore the ammonia stress exerted on gastropods should be slightly released at lower ph and temperatures during the dark period in the treatment when macrophytes are present the fact that gastropods in treatment water sediment macrophyte had obviously higher growth rates than those in treatment water only in the n lc50 bioassay was thus explained by the positive effects of macrophyte on decreasing ammonia concentration and extra food supplied as organic substances or periphyton the results of the measured enzymic activities of cat and sod were not consistent with that inferred from the growth of gastropods the higher growth rate of body size of gastropods in treatment water sediment and water sediment macrophyte than in treatment water food should have explained the higher tolerance to ammonia stress in the previous two treatments than in the latter one while the fact is that enzymic activities of cat in the n0 lc50 and n lc50 bioassays showed the highest tolerance of gastropods in treatment water food than in the rest treatments and the results of sod were even more confusing similar phenomenon has also been found in other organisms for example during the 36 h exposure to paraquat the mussel geukensia demissa showed obvious dose dependent increases in the enzymic activities of sod and cat with a decrease in the highest dose treatment within the previous 12 h while during the latter 24 h the enzymic activities in paraquat added treatments were almost close to or even lower than in control wenning et al 1988 therefore moderate toxicant or pollutant exposure instant or short interval monitoring of the enzymic activities of cat and sod might be good indicators for the status of stress of organisms barabás et al 1984 wenning et al 1988 su et al 2012 while under the long term ammonia exposure adaption to the exposing condition occurs making its indicator value useless particularly under natural conditions wenning et al 1988 dimitrova et al 1994 yang et al 2011 the current criteria for ammonia management of ambient waters have been inferred solely from lab tests with simplified culturing systems and no practical tests under natural condition the scale dependent toxicity of environmental contaminants has long been discussed and most studies were qualitative this study quantitatively provides new evidence of the underlying mechanisms showing the role of ecosystem complexity on the response to ammonia our results contribute to the understanding of the impact response process of excessive loading of ammonium to aquatic ecosystems and provide scientific references for ammonia management 5 conclusion in conclusion our results showed that 1 food supply directly promoted the tolerance of gastropods to ammonia and thus allowed it to survive and grow under lethal ammonia concentration 2 sediment decreased the ammonia toxicity to gastropods by quickly adsorbing ammonia in water column also by providing additional food for gastropods and possibly by acting as a shelter for gastropods from direct exposure to high ammonia concentrations 3 macrophytes decreased the ammonia toxicity to gastropods by taking up ammonia in water column also possibly by providing extra food sources for gastropods our results further showed that the introduction of these ecological elements had little effect at very high concentration of ammonia i e 96 h lc100 moreover the physiological variables cat and sod did not satisfactorily reflect the stress of ammonia on animals or the response of tested animals to ammonia stress in this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

15397,in this study the aggregation behavior of polystyrene nanoplastics ps nps in the absence or presence of oppositely charged particulate matters is systematically investigated for a wide range of electrolyte conditions herein we used isothermal titration calorimetry combined with time resolved dynamic light scattering to provide kinetic and thermodynamic insights into the np aggregation the thermodynamic profiles of homoaggregation and heteroaggregation were fit using an independent site and two independent sites models respectively demonstrating different interaction modes of both aggregation processes we found that the contribution of solvation entropy was significant and variable in most cases and this thermodynamic parameter was a large determinant of the thermodynamics of np aggregation furthermore the stability of ps nps in natural water matrices was found to be correlated with ionic strength and the content of natural colloids e g metal oxides and clay particles these results point to the importance of considering the role of thermodynamic variables when studying the fate of nps within various environmental conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics heteroaggregation isothermal titration calorimetry ionic strength entropy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the widespread occurrence of microplastics in aquatic systems has been well documented anderson et al 2016 vivekanand et al 2021 microplastics can continually fragment into smaller particles which suggests that the mass of accumulated nanoplastics nps in the environment may be increasing over time mattsson et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 lee and fang 2022 nps pose greater risks to human and environmental health than microplastics due to their smaller size that facilitates increased environmental transport biological interaction and adsorption leaching of chemical additives ferreira et al 2019 gigault et al 2021 han et al 2022 one of the key features of nps linked to their transport and risk is size therefore to predict the fate of nps in the aqueous environment a better understanding of the aggregation process that may induce a change in np size is needed ter halle and ghiolione 2021 the aggregation of nps has been proven to be affected by ionic strength is environmental and biological macromolecules and inorganic colloids mao et al 2020 singh et al 2019 shams et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the interactions between nps and water constituents alter the surface charge and charge density of nps leading to changes in attractive and repulsive forces and ultimately the np aggregation in solution it is well established that there is a higher environmental relevance of heteroaggregation in aggregation process of engineered nanomaterials wang et al 2015 however relatively few studies have sought to understand the dynamics and mechanism of np heteroaggregation researchers have validated several techniques such as dynamic light scattering dls nanoparticle tracking analysis nta and electron microscopy for the study of aggregation of nanomaterials feng et al 2017 praetorius et al 2020 baiyasi et al 2020 although these techniques have expanded our understanding of nanoparticle aggregation kinetics in the aqueous phase they can only provide limited information on the thermodynamic features of the aggregation process given several studies demonstrating the potential roles of thermodynamic parameters in nanoparticle aggregation sokolov et al 2015 kätelhön et al 2017 it is imperative that we understand the underlying thermodynamics in those processes fortunately isothermal titration calorimetry itc allows the direct measurement of enthalpy entropy and gibbs free energy changes associated with noncovalent interactions in a single experiment freire et al 1990 a few investigations have used itc to characterize the energetics of interactions between nanoparticles and water constituents such as natural organic matter and inorganic ions loosli et al 2015 zhu et al 2021 moreover our previous work demonstrated that heteroaggregation of nanoparaticles produced different thermodynamic profiles from those observed in homoaggregation herchenova et al 2020 however no systematic research on np aggregation has been conducted using itc herein we undertook a proof of concept study using itc to explore the thermodynamic parameters arising from homo and heteroaggregation of polystyrene ps nps we examined the influence of a wide range of natural water conditions including ionic composition and presence of other particulates on the thermodynamics of np aggregation these dataset improves our current understanding of the physical origin of aggregation process in non interacting np systems finally the aggregation and deposition of nps were assessed in natural water matrices seawater river water and wastewater effluent to provide insights into the fate and

plant and seawater sw from the east sea in korea all samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm cellulose acetate membrane and stored at 4 c until use some physicochemical properties of the water samples are listed in table s1 2 2 aggregation kinetics homoaggregation and heteroaggregation kinetics was investigated by the time resolved dls measurements zetasizer nano zs malvern at 25 c all aggregation experiments were performed in triplicate homoaggregation kinetics was expressed in terms of stability ratio w k fast k where k fast is the aggregation rate constant of the reference condition the critical coagulation concentrations cccs were determined from the intersection between diffusion and reaction limited regimes the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to study the interaction energies between ps nps detailed information of the dlvo calculations is provided in the supporting information heteroaggregation rate was estimated from linear regression fitting on the variations of aggregate size up to 30 increase from initial hdds over the time 2 3 itc analysis itc quantified the heat energy released or absorbed during np aggregation at 25 c on nano itc ta instruments in triplicate all solutions were thoroughly degassed for 20 min under vacuum prior to titration to eliminate air bubbles in an itc run aliquots 7 μl of 1 5 m nacl 0 1 m cacl2 or 0 01 m lacl3 were added 20 times periodically at intervals of 200 s between injections into a 1 ml sample cell containing ps np suspension or binary suspension under stirring at 250 rpm we confirmed that the heat of dilution was negligible when separately titrating electrolytes into di water the reference cell was filled with di water the itc data were analyzed with independent or multiple site models embedded in the nanoanalyze software version 3 6 0 supplied by the manufacturer the binding enthalpy δh was derived from model dependent curve fitting and the gibbs free energy δg and entropy δs were calculated by the equations δg rt ln k a δh tδs 2 4 sedimentation experiments the sedimentation of ps np in different water matrices was measured by monitoring the optical absorbance using uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2401 pc shimadzu and the absorbance was recorded every 15 min for 5 h under quiescent conditions for the experiments in the absence of hem 3 ml of 20 mg l 1 ps np suspension was placed in a quartz cuvette and the absorbance was measured at 270 nm a standard absorbance vs concentration curve for ps np is provided in fig s2 for the experiments in the presence of hem 30 mg l 1 hem was mixed with 0 1 2 or 12 mg l 1 ps nps to make it consistent with the heteroaggregation conditions the absorbance of np hem suspension in a quartz cuvette was measured at 416 nm where the ps np had negligible absorbance 3 results and discussion 3 1 homoaggregation of ps nps in electrolytes the ps nps exhibited a negative charge in the ph range of 3 5 9 fig s1 owing to the presence of the sulfonic groups chiu et al 2015 the particles possessed a considerable negative charge 30 mv at unadjusted ph ph 6 0 0 1 at which further experiments were conducted predicting high colloidal stability first we investigated the charging feature of ps nps in mono to trivalent electrolyte and ha solutions fig 1 in general the plot shapes were identical for all electrolyte solutions regardless of the type of ions fig 1a c the ζ potentials of ps nps became less negative with increasing the electrolyte concentration due to the compression of the electrical double layers edls resulting from charge screening wu et al 2019 note that the hdds remarkably increased with increasing ionic strength is with a more pronounced increase in divalent and trivalent systems at low is fig 1 these results indicate that in comparison to monovalent ions multivalent ions have a higher destabilizing power owing to their greater contribution to is the homoaggregation rates of ps nps over a wide range of electrolytes fig s3 increased with the increase in electrolyte concentrations before reaching a maximum value at the diffusion limited regime the stability ratios of ps nps at different nacl cacl2 and lacl3 concentrations are shown in fig 2 the stability ratios decreased with increasing electrolyte concentrations and reached unity the aggregation behavior of ps nps in electrolyte solutions followed the dlvo theory with two distinct reaction and diffusion limited regimes the dlvo profiles fig s4 showed that the primary energy barrier was reduced and the secondary minimum was increased at high ionic strengths the cccs of ps nps were determined as 220 mm for nacl 20 mm for cacl2 and 1 2 mm for lacl3 respectively the ccc values decreased with increasing valence in qualitative agreement with the schulze hardy rule trefalt et al 2017 this behavior can be attributed to the higher charge screening by trivalent cations compared with that by mono or divalent cations which was confirmed by the magnitudes of ζ potentials at a given salt concentration fig 1 given the higher ccc values of ps nps compared with those of other engineered nanoparticles such as tio2 french et al 2009 ceo2 tiwari et al 2020 and graphene oxide yang et al 2016 ps nps would be stable and therefore are more likely to be ingested by organisms in freshwater environments to verify how electrolytes with different valences influence the thermodynamic parameters of np aggregation we sought to use itc the interactions between ps nps and nacl or cacl2 were exothermic while the interaction with lacl3 was endothermic fig 3a c in view of the stability ratio results the enthalpy near the ccc became zero demonstrating that aggregation of ps nps induced by its complexation with electrolyte ions occurs without any change in enthalpy the adsorption of electrolyte ions onto ps nps was spontaneous due to the strong contribution of entropy as demonstrated by the small enthalpy of binding δh compared to the entropy contribution tδs and negative gibbs free energy change fig 3d the small δh values indicated the weak interaction between nps and ions which stems from electrostatic attraction regardless of whether these interactions were exothermic or endothermic the entropy change was significant and positive theorized to be due to significant entropy gain as semi ordered water molecules surrounding the components are dispelled upon interaction herchenova et al 2020 moreover the higher δs value for la3 than that for na or ca2 may have been linked with their hydration entropies and the number of water molecules in the shell marcus 1991 given that the np framework is rigid we suspect that solvation entropy is likely the dominant contributor to the overall entropy term rather than conformational entropy these findings suggest that interfacial water molecules mediate the interaction between nps and electrolyte ions 3 2 heteroaggregation of ps nps with other particulate matters hematite commonly found in surface waters slomberg et al 2016 is employed as a model natural particle and tio2 and amidine ps are chosen as model engineered particles due to their widespread use sun et al 2017 plasticseurope association of plastics manufactures 2019 ps nps and other particles hem tio2 and a ps mp had opposite charges at ph 6 fig s1 fig 4 shows the variation of the ζ potential and hdd of heteroaggregates obtained at np particle mass concentration ratios of 0 0 16 and similar trends were determined for all cases at low np particle ratios 0 002 0 015 heteroaggregation showed slow rates as the np particle ratios increased from 0 015 to 0 04 the ζ potential gradually decreased until it approached zero at which the maximum hdd value was obtained further increases in the ps np concentration led to charge inversion because of excess ps nps a sharp drop in the hdd values above the np particle ratio of 0 04 could be explained by the settling of large heteroaggregates which in turn were not detected by dls in addition despite small values of ζ potential the system became more stable at high np particle ratios 0 05 0 15 the limited contact surface of ps nps and particles in combination with poor homoaggregation of ps nps may give rise to the stability that we observed given that a similar trend was found in the electrokinetic properties of all heteroaggregates under different electrolyte conditions fig 4 we elected to enumerate the heteroaggregation mechanism with a np hem mixture the heteroaggregation rates of np hem as a function of electrolyte concentration are presented in fig 5 the maximum heteroaggregation rate could not be determined even at high electrolyte concentrations and thus disallowed estimation of their attachment efficiencies praetorius et al 2014 in low electrolyte conditions the higher heteroaggregation rates were observed compared to homoaggregation rates which is indicative of the presence of attractive double layer forces between oppositely charged np and hem however the heteroaggregation rates did not reach plateau at higher electrolyte concentrations that is at diffusion limited regime although high ionic strengths reduced the negative charge of ps nps this continual increase in heteroaggregation rates in such conditions could be explained by the involvement of non dlvo forces e g hydration force hydrophobic force or charge correlation force in the heteroaggregation process the contribution of surface functional groups to interaction between np and hem in electrolyte solutions was examined using ftir as shown in fig s5 the most striking change in the ftir spectra of np hem aggregates was the decrease of the peak intensity at 750 cm 1 assigned to an aromatic group suggesting that the aromatic group contributed to the heteroaggregation of np and hem via cation π interactions li et al 2020 inspired by heteroaggregation between np and hem we sought to further investigate the thermodynamics of heteroaggregates in the presence of salts unlike np homoaggregates that were fit using an independent site model fig 3 two independent sites model was more appropriate for np hem heteroaggregates indicating that multiple interactions occurring between np and hem have different δh values all titration curves revealed the participation of two interaction processes with opposite heat change an exothermic event followed by an endothermic event fig 6a c this switch from exothermic to endothermic reactions occurred near electrolyte concentrations at which the aggregation rate was sharply increased fig 5 this reflects that different driving forces are involved in the heteroaggregation of np and hem the interactions of np hem with all different electrolyte ions were favorable based on the negative values of δg fig 6d however the enthalpic and entropic parameters displayed apparent variations depending on the electrolytes fig 6d nacl and cacl2 showed similar patterns while lacl3 exhibited a completely distinct pattern for nacl and cacl2 the values of δh and δs were negative in the first regime and positive in the second regime in the first regime favorable enthalpy but unfavorable entropy changes indicated that the complex formation was enthalpically driven with the prevalence of noncovalent interactions i e electrostatic interactions here additionally the formation of stable complexes was entropically disfavored conversely further interactions between np hem and nacl or cacl2 in the second regime were characterized by unfavorable enthalpy and favorable entropy the desolvation of hydrating surface and hydrating ions allows attractive non dlvo interactions such as hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding to become dominate therefore the favorable δs values of np hem heteroaggregates in the second regime could be due to the entropy gain by interplay between desolvation and non dlvo interactions on the other hand np hem lacl3 interactions in both regimes were entropy dominated compared to nacl or cacl2 in lacl3 solutions in the range of concentrations studied the charge of np is much less negative although the charge of hem is hardly affected xu et al 2015 accordingly the reduced electrostatic interaction between np and hem likely contributed to very small δh values for lacl3 the effect of multivalent ions on screening the electrostatic forces for asymmetrically charged particles has been reported in a previous study cao et al 2017 that is the screening of the electrostatic force is more effective for electrolytes with higher valences taken together dlvo and non dlvo interactions may be all operative in the salt induced np hem aggregation although their relative contributions are still unclear 3 3 sedimentation of ps nps in natural waters to gain insights into the environmental behavior of ps nps undergoing aggregation we determined the sedimentation kinetics of ps nps in the absence and presence of hem in natural waters ps nps were negatively charged at ph recorded for all the natural water samples in the absence of hem the changes in the np concentration occurred drastically in the initial 1 h and then proceeded much slower thereafter nearly reaching a stable state fig 7a ps nps were stable in rw while they underwent weak aggregation in ww and appreciable aggregation and sedimentation in sw the aggregation of ps nps in ww was slow and correspondingly the sedimentation of aggregates was negligible which implies that a considerable fraction of nps can be discharged from wastewater treatment plants into surface water conversely a significant aggregation of ps nps occurred in sw with comparatively higher is and hardness resulting in a favorable sedimentation the addition of hem accelerated the sedimentation of ps nps in all natural waters fig 7b the faster sedimentation rate of np in the presence of hem at the initial stage may be due to the formation of large aggregates resulting from the heteroaggregation between np and hem as expected the initial sedimentation rate of ps np hem mixtures was found to be highest in sw at a higher np hem ratio the particle concentration decreased more than 80 in less than 20 min further tem analysis to observe the conformation of ps hem heteroaggregates formed in natural waters revealed much bigger clusters in sw than those in rw or ww showing a low extent of aggregation fig s6 which was consistent with the sedimentation results these results imply that the mobility of ps nps in aqueous media could be greatly affected by the concentration of particulate substances and ionic strength therefore a considerable fraction of ps nps likely will remain in the water phase in river systems and will be quickly accumulated on the seafloor 4 conclusions understanding the homo and heteroaggregation of ps nps in complex aqueous systems is essential for predicting their transport and ecological behavior in natural aquatic environments combined with the data about size and zeta potential change of aggregates in electrolytes the thermodynamic profiles based on itc analysis can provide quantitative information of their interaction while the homoaggregation of ps nps was predominantly entropy driven process various enthalpic and entropic contributions were observed in the heteroaggregation of ps nps in electrolyte solutions which would be ascribed to the different charge screening effect upon electrolyte type the sedimentation behaviors of ps nps in the absence or presence of hematite in three different types of natural waters were investigated the sedimentation rate of ps nps was accelerated by adding hematite to natural waters our findings highlight the importance of aggregation into the fate of nps in aquatic environment together with the immense potential of itc measurement for investigating the mechanism of homo and heteroaggregation declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to

15397,in this study the aggregation behavior of polystyrene nanoplastics ps nps in the absence or presence of oppositely charged particulate matters is systematically investigated for a wide range of electrolyte conditions herein we used isothermal titration calorimetry combined with time resolved dynamic light scattering to provide kinetic and thermodynamic insights into the np aggregation the thermodynamic profiles of homoaggregation and heteroaggregation were fit using an independent site and two independent sites models respectively demonstrating different interaction modes of both aggregation processes we found that the contribution of solvation entropy was significant and variable in most cases and this thermodynamic parameter was a large determinant of the thermodynamics of np aggregation furthermore the stability of ps nps in natural water matrices was found to be correlated with ionic strength and the content of natural colloids e g metal oxides and clay particles these results point to the importance of considering the role of thermodynamic variables when studying the fate of nps within various environmental conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics heteroaggregation isothermal titration calorimetry ionic strength entropy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the widespread occurrence of microplastics in aquatic systems has been well documented anderson et al 2016 vivekanand et al 2021 microplastics can continually fragment into smaller particles which suggests that the mass of accumulated nanoplastics nps in the environment may be increasing over time mattsson et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 lee and fang 2022 nps pose greater risks to human and environmental health than microplastics due to their smaller size that facilitates increased environmental transport biological interaction and adsorption leaching of chemical additives ferreira et al 2019 gigault et al 2021 han et al 2022 one of the key features of nps linked to their transport and risk is size therefore to predict the fate of nps in the aqueous environment a better understanding of the aggregation process that may induce a change in np size is needed ter halle and ghiolione 2021 the aggregation of nps has been proven to be affected by ionic strength is environmental and biological macromolecules and inorganic colloids mao et al 2020 singh et al 2019 shams et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the interactions between nps and water constituents alter the surface charge and charge density of nps leading to changes in attractive and repulsive forces and ultimately the np aggregation in solution it is well established that there is a higher environmental relevance of heteroaggregation in aggregation process of engineered nanomaterials wang et al 2015 however relatively few studies have sought to understand the dynamics and mechanism of np heteroaggregation researchers have validated several techniques such as dynamic light scattering dls nanoparticle tracking analysis nta and electron microscopy for the study of aggregation of nanomaterials feng et al 2017 praetorius et al 2020 baiyasi et al 2020 although these techniques have expanded our understanding of nanoparticle aggregation kinetics in the aqueous phase they can only provide limited information on the thermodynamic features of the aggregation process given several studies demonstrating the potential roles of thermodynamic parameters in nanoparticle aggregation sokolov et al 2015 kätelhön et al 2017 it is imperative that we understand the underlying thermodynamics in those processes fortunately isothermal titration calorimetry itc allows the direct measurement of enthalpy entropy and gibbs free energy changes associated with noncovalent interactions in a single experiment freire et al 1990 a few investigations have used itc to characterize the energetics of interactions between nanoparticles and water constituents such as natural organic matter and inorganic ions loosli et al 2015 zhu et al 2021 moreover our previous work demonstrated that heteroaggregation of nanoparaticles produced different thermodynamic profiles from those observed in homoaggregation herchenova et al 2020 however no systematic research on np aggregation has been conducted using itc herein we undertook a proof of concept study using itc to explore the thermodynamic parameters arising from homo and heteroaggregation of polystyrene ps nps we examined the influence of a wide range of natural water conditions including ionic composition and presence of other particulates on the thermodynamics of np aggregation these dataset improves our current understanding of the physical origin of aggregation process in non interacting np systems finally the aggregation and deposition of nps were assessed in natural water matrices seawater river water and wastewater effluent to provide insights into the fate and

promotes selective growth and enrichment of the pha storing biomass fraction and significantly improved both pha contents and yields calcium addition resulted in pha contents of 0 60 0 03 gpha gvss and average pha yields on substrate of 0 49 0 03 gcod pha gcod hac compared to 0 35 0 01 gpha gvss and 0 19 0 01 gcod pha gcod hac without calcium addition after 48 h three times more pha was produced compared to control experiments without calcium addition higher pha content and selective biomass production is proposed to be a consequence of calcium dependent increased levels of passive acetate uptake such more efficient substrate uptake could be related to a formation of calcium acetate complexes findings lead to bioprocess methods to stimulate a short term selective growth of pha storing microorganisms and this enables improvements to the techno economic feasibility for municipal waste activated sludge to become a generic resource for industrial scale pha production graphical abstract

community engineering aims to produce energy carriers and chemicals from waste streams using microbial communities kleerebezem et al 2015 microbial community engineering relies on the use of ecological selection principles for the enrichment of microbial communities with a desired functionality an example of the use of microbial community engineering principles is the production of biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkonoates phas kourmentza et al 2017 sabapathy et al 2020 estévez alonso et al 2021b phas are naturally occurring polyesters that are produced intracellularly by bacteria to balance their growth while dealing with dynamic conditions such as changes in substrate availability van loosdrecht et al 1997 reis et al 2003 in microbial community based pha production pha storing bacteria are first enriched in a so called selection reactor by applying intermittent presence and absence of carbon sources volatile fatty acids and or uncoupling of organic carbon and growth nutrients supplies namely nitrogen and phosphorus lemos et al 2006 lorini et al 2020 subsequently the surplus biomass produced in the selection reactor is exploited in an accumulation reactor to maximize intracellular pha content of the pha storing biomass sabapathy et al 2020 kourmentza et al 2017 the maximum intracellular pha content is constrained by the fraction of pha storing bacteria and the specific storage capacity of the microbial strains present in the microbial community for instance with enrichment cultures where the whole microbial community can produce pha intracellular pha contents of up to 0 9 gpha gvss have been achieved johnson et al 2009a jiang et al 2011a notwithstanding many species of bacteria exhibit only moderate maximum storage capacity in the range from 0 5 to 0 8 gpha gvss estévez alonso et al 2021b sabapathy et al 2020 kourmentza et al 2017 when selected microbial communities have a lower fraction of pha storing bacteria and therefore not all bacteria are able to produce phas lower average pha contents are observed even if the pha storing bacteria that are present can accumulate up to 0 9 gpha gvss marang et al 2014 crognale et al 2019a an example of a microbial community that exhibits a lower fraction of pha storing bacteria with moderate storage capacity is municipal activated sludge bengtsson et al 2017 pei et al 2022a the attraction to use of waste municipal activate sludge for pha production is limited in general due to lower pha contents in combination with lower pha yields on substrate average pha contents and yields on substrate that have been typically reported for municipal activated sludge are not higher than 0 5 gpha gvss and 0 5 gcod pha gcod hac bengtsson et al 2017 kourmentza et al 2017 these values are significantly lower than those that have been obtained with specifically enriched biomass it has been recently shown that the pha storing bacteria already present in municipal activated sludge systems can accumulate up to 0 6 gpha gvss pei et al 2022a thus if strategies are developed to consistently realize such high pha contents with municipal activated sludge it could broaden the generic potential for biopolymer supply chains municipal waste activated sludge could become an ubiquitous readily available biomass source for industrial scale microbial community based pha production strategies to reach higher pha contents with municipal activated sludge are expected to rely on methods that increase the fraction of pha storing bacteria in the biomass pei et al 2022a an increase in the fraction of pha storing bacteria will consequently result in a process that reaches the biomass maximum pha accumulation potential it has been hypothesized that the fraction of pha storing bacteria can be increased directly in the pha accumulation process if conditions for robustly promoting selective growth of the pha storing biomass can be identified and applied pei et al 2022a during cell division daughter cells contain half of the cellular pha content of the mother cells pfeiffer and jendrossek 2012 consequently more pha can be formed in parallel to cell division in this way pha production and biomass growth may occur concurrently and theoretically given the right conditions indefinitely a challenge is to find those conditions where these two processes can co occur with selective growth of pha storing bacteria only in pure cultures and highly enriched open cultures examples for simultaneous growth and pha accumulation have already been reported mulders et al 2020 cavaillé et al 2016 valentino et al 2015 grousseau et al 2013 however it is unknown if a similar strategy could be applied to diverse microbial communities that have not been specifically selected for pha accumulation for activated sludge systems cavaillé et al 2013 found that different degrees of phosphorus limitation promoted simultaneous growth and accumulation of pha nonetheless this strategy required a strict phosphorus level control and resulted in lower pha yields on substrate compared to enrichment cultures the present work stemmed from unexpected observations made during the search for selective conditions promoting for simultaneous growth and pha accumulation this work concerns an investigation of effects of calcium during pha accumulation with municipal activated sludge at lab scale volatile fatty acid solutions are often used to mimic acidic fermented feedstocks such feedstocks are to be used for industrial scale pha production bengtsson et al 2017 sodium or potassium hydroxide are normally added to these feedstock solutions for ph control in preliminary experiments when calcium hydroxide was used instead to increase the ph of an acetic acid feedstock it was observed that biomass growth and pha production were positively affected the addition of calcium in the feedstock solution induced changes that apparently created favourable conditions in the reactor for selective biomass growth concurrent to pha production however since calcium addition could have influenced several water quality factors the underlying causes for observed concurrent biomass growth with pha production were not clear the aim of this study was to identify the mechanism s behind the observed increase in pha production and biomass growth due to calcium presence 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up pha accumulation tests were performed over 24 and or 48 h in a 1 l double jacketed glass bioreactor as previously described in estévez alonso et al 2022 reactor temperature was 25 0 1 c ph was monitored and air was supplied at 1 l min in some experiments the ph was controlled to 8 0 0 1 with 1 m naoh solution as indicated in table 1 2 2 sludge source and feedstock activated sludge from bath wwtp the netherlands was used as the principal pha storing biomass for the pha accumulation tests the activated sludge samples were taken after gravity belt thickening and had a total solids concentration of 55 gts l validation experiments with calcium hydroxide were also performed with activated sludge from four other different dutch wwtps leeuwarden beverwijk almere and winsum these validation experiments were compared to outcomes from a parallel study pei et al 2022a for these other experiments activated sludge samples were taken directly from the main aerobic process volume the mixed liquor suspended solids were concentrated by gravity settling for 30 60 min with decanting and had a total solids concentration of 6 to 12 gts l the concentrated mixed liquor was delivered on the same day to wetsus leeuwarden the netherlands and stored at 4 c for further analysis the accumulation feedstock with nutrients ratio 100 1 cod n by weight was prepared with tap water as follows 50 g l acetic acid and 1 91 g l nh 4 cl phosphate levels were changed by the addition of kh 2 po 4 as described in table 1 the feedstock was adjusted to ph 4 5 with 20 gca oh 2 15 5 gmg oh 2 30 gkoh or 21 5 gnaoh as described in table 1 side experiments were performed with the supplementary addition of cacl2 and kcl to the feedstock 2 3 pha accumulation experiments for each assay the concentrated activated sludge samples were diluted with tap water to nominally 2 3 gvss l and allylthiourea 50 mg l was added the mixed liquor was brought to 25 c and conditioned with constant aeration overnight to establish a baseline of endogenous microbial activity subsequently an automated acclimation was performed acclimation comprised three feast and famine cycles as previously reported morgan sagastume et al 2017 feast conditions were generated with a pulse input to reach a maximum substrate level of 150 mgcod l and the duration of the feast was determined from changes in respiration based on dissolved oxygen concentration trends the famine period was dynamically adjusted to be three times longer than each respective feast time in total the acclimation period had a duration of 4 5 h the trends in respiration were used to determine the oxygen mass transfer coefficient k l a after the third acclimation famine period the accumulation test was started automatically accumulation was driven with the same feast influent pulses and control logic but now without any famine period between pulses pulse inputs were controlled from on line monitoring of dissolved oxygen according to valentino et al 2015 2 4 analytical methods the pha accumulation process was monitored by online data logging do ph and temperature liquid and solids analyses grab samples were used for liquid and solids analyses biomass pha content and caco 3 determination suspended solids were separated from the mixed liquor by centrifugation 3250 rcf at 4 c for 20 min the supernatant after membrane filtration 0 45 μ m pore size filters was stored at 20 c pending liquid analyses acetic acid concentration was determined by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography and ammonium nitrite nitrate and phosphate concentrations were determined by ion chromatography as previously reported estévez alonso et al 2021a the harvested biomass pellet dry weight and ash contents were estimated based on standard methods and referenced to the sample volume for total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss respectively the aliquot for pha determination was directly acidified to ph 2 with 37 hcl after thorough mixing for 5 min suspended solids were collected 3250 rcf at 4 c for 20 min the biomass pellet was retained and dried at 105 c dried pellets were ground and analysed by thermogravimetric analysis as described previously chan et al 2017 similarly the aliquot for caco 3 determination was directly centrifuged 3250 rcf at 4 c for 20 min and the biomass pellet was retained and dried at 105 c dried pellets were ground and analysed by thermogravimetric analysis 5 mg of ground sub sample were introduced to the furnace at 80 c and heated to 105 c 10 c min under nitrogen atmosphere after drying at 105 c for 10 min the sample was heated to 550 c 10 c min under nitrogen atmosphere at 550 c the atmosphere was switched to air and temperature was held for 30 min after 30 min at 550 c the sample was heated to 900 c the weight loss trends in air were used to determine inorganic content and the calcium carbonate fraction with respect to the biomass dried total and volatile solids 2 5 microscopy analysis mixed liquor sludge samples were taken at selected time points during the pha accumulation process the mixed liquor was fixed with formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3 7 and preserved in a solution with ratio 1 1 of 1x pbs and pure ethanol the fixed samples were stored at 20 c until further processing fixed samples were stained with bodipy 493 503 thermo fisher scientific ma usa in combination with sypro red thermo fisher scientific ma usa and were examined with confocal laser scanning microscope with statistics from fields of view as previously described pei et al 2022b respective overlaid stained images were acquired with a 16 bit depth in separate channels and analysed by fiji image j imagej2 ver 1 52p software an average biomass volume to volume ratio of polymer to non pha storing biomass v v was estimated pei et al 2022b this ratio was used for the determination of the fraction of pha storing biomass in the microbial community 2 6 microbial community structure fresh samples were collected at selected time points from the accumulation reactor and stored at 20 c until dna extraction before extraction

archive under project accession number prjeb56263 2 7 data analysis all measured parameters were corrected for effects of sample withdrawal and feedstock addition from liquid and mass balance considerations johnson et al 2009b the biomass pha content was expressed as mass fraction of the volatile suspended solids gpha gvss active biomass x a was estimated as the total vss minus pha mass active biomass was assumed to be represented as ch 1 8 o 0 5 n 0 2 roels 1980 the trend for change in pha content f pha was represented by least squares regression to the empirical function 1 f pha a 0 a 1 1 e kt where a 0 a 1 and k are constants that allow for estimation of rates as a function of time and comparison between performances of different activated sludge samples bengtsson et al 2017 initial and average specific production consumption rates and pha yields on substrate were estimated for different times the average pha yields on substrate are reported on a cod basis and calculated from the amount of pha 1 67 gcod gphb produced and substrate 1 07 gcod ghac added as a function of time average specific production and consumption rates were calculated based on the cumulative

dissimilarity matrix using vegan oksanen et al 2020 a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was applied to test the effects of feedstock and operation time on microbial biomass composition the contributions of the 15 most dominant bacteria were depicted in the pcoa anova was used to evaluate these effects on shannon diversity 3 results 3 1 preliminary results giving rise to the work described in this paper in preliminary tests with municipal activated sludge for pha production calcium hydroxide was used to increase the ph of an acetic acid feedstock solution in these tests a distinctly different biomass response was observed compared to experiments where koh was used fig 1 this response was also observed in replicate experiments with four other types of municipal activated sludge as provided in the si the addition of calcium hydroxide in the feedstock solution induced changes in the reactor conditions that affected the calcium and salts concentrations phosphate availability and ph changes over the accumulation calcium carbonate precipitation was observed already in the first two hours of the accumulation and therefore the concentration of soluble calcium in the mixed liquor did not increase above 500 mg ca 2 l over the time of accumulation after 48 h 50 to 55 of the total dry solids in the reactor could be identified as calcium carbonate calcium balances showed that the calcium added to the reactor could be found back mainly as calcium carbonate or dissolved calcium the precipitation of calcium carbonate induced a slow but constant decrease of ph from an initial value between 8 2 and 8 4 to a final value between 7 0 and 7 5 after 48 h of accumulation similarly phosphate concentrations were below the detection limit from the start of the accumulation to elucidate the cause for the biomass response due to calcium added to the feedstock deepened investigations were performed with activated sludge from bath wwtp pha accumulation tests were performed with ca oh 2 mg oh 2 koh and naoh to evaluate if the observed biomass response was specific to calcium pha accumulations tests were also performed to evaluate the potential for influences on concurrent selective biomass growth with pha production caused by salinity phosphate concentration and ph control 3 2 pha accumulations with c a o h 2 and koh a comparison of 48 h pha accumulations tests with ca oh 2 or koh is provided in fig 1 in the presence of calcium a higher substrate consumption was observed this increased consumption was associated with much higher pha production 11 5 12 4 gcod pha compared to only 3 1 4 0 gcod pha in koh tests maximum biomass pha contents in the range of 0 56 0 64 gpha gvss were obtained with the addition of ca oh 2 compared to only 0 35 37 gpha gvss for koh cases similarly the average pha yield on substrate obtained at 48 h was higher for ca oh 2 0 44 0 52 gcod pha gcod hac compared to 0 18 0 21 gcod pha gcod hac for koh lower average oxygen yields on substrate were also observed for ca oh 2 0 29 0 46 g o 2 gcod hac compared to 0 65 0 69 g o 2 gcod hac for koh fig 3 cod mass balances closed well for ca oh 2 and koh tests 105 6 and 102 5 respectively biomass growth was slightly higher in ca oh 2 assays 3 4 4 3 gcod x compared to 2 6 3 3 gcod x in koh tests in ca oh 2 accumulations biomass growth was observed already from the beginning of the accumulation in koh experiments biomass growth only started after 4 6 h from microscope staining a higher fraction of pha storing biomass was observed at 48 h in ca oh 2 compared to koh as illustrated in fig 2 the fraction of pha storing biomass at 48 h was 0 76 0 80 v v compared to 0 29 0 51 v v in experiments with koh despite different values in the fraction of pha storing biomass the derived average pha content within just the pha storing fraction of the biomass was estimated to be similar in both cases 0 63 and 0 58 gpha gvss 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis demonstrated that the addition of ca oh 2 versus koh to the feedstock promoted differential developments of the microbial community composition as shown in fig 2 permanova interaction timepoint feedstock f2 17 8 4 p 0 002 fig 2c addition of ca oh 2 caused a rapid drop in diversity within 24 h with a shift in biomass composition that remained stable up to 48 h this ca oh 2 induced shift was associated with ferribacterium zoogloea and other dominant rhodocyclaceae genera conversely addition of koh induced a different kind of shift with retained microbial composition up to 24 h followed by a later decrease in diversity between 24 and 48 h corresponding to when most growth took place shifts induced by koh addition were associated with acinetobacter thauera hydrogenophaga and other dominant genera that in contrast to ca oh 2 continued to change in composition between 24 and 48 h 3 3 pha accumulations with m g o h 2 and naoh to investigate if the observed effect was calcium ion and or cation valence specific additional pha accumulation tests were performed with mg 2 and na as the hydroxide counterion mg oh 2 and naoh were used to raise the feedstock ph to 4 5 instead the addition of mg oh 2 and naoh resulted in similar ph profiles as in experiments with koh also the process performance in terms of pha production was very similar the koh experiments as observed in fig 3 these results pointed to a specific effect related to or created directly by the presence of calcium cations during the accumulation process 3 4 increasing calcium concentrations in koh experiments to further evaluate the effect of calcium addition accumulation experiments with koh and extra cacl 2 amounts were performed with increasing calcium concentration the pha production and biomass growth increased as observed in fig 4 the test with koh and 30 g cacl 2 l had the same dissolved calcium concentration as the feedstock with ca oh 2 and replicated the observations of tests with only ca oh 2 calcium carbonate precipitation occurred from the beginning of the experiment and similar trends of ph were observed despite these similarities in reactor profile the pha production performance was lower than in experiments with ca oh 2 but still significantly higher than in experiments with only koh an identifiable key distinction between tests with added calcium salts and experiments with only ca oh 2 was the much higher increase in salinity due to the addition of cacl 2 to the feedstock 3 5 increasing salinity levels in c a o h 2 experiments the addition of cacl 2 to experiments with koh in the feedstock resulted in higher salts concentrations in the reactor compared to experiments with ca oh 2 to evaluate the influence of salinity in ca oh 2 experiments control experiments with ca oh 2 and different kcl concentrations were performed similar trends were observed in all experiments independent of the concentration of kcl in the feedstock calcium carbonate precipitation resulted in a progressive decrease in ph to around 7 0 7 5 despite similarities to experiments with ca oh 2 higher concentrations of kcl reduced the pha production performance as observed in fig 4 experiments with ca oh 2 and 40 gkcl l were analogous to experiments with koh and 30 g cacl 2 l and similar results were obtained as it was expected 3 6 phosphate excess and limitation in accumulations with c a o h 2 and koh in experiments with ca oh 2 phosphate concentrations were not detectable 0 33 mgp l in the reactor after 2 3 h of accumulation the addition of ca oh 2 in the feedstock is anticipated to promote the precipitation of calcium phosphate making the conditions phosphate limiting during most of the pha accumulation time notwithstanding observed biomass growth to evaluate for an influence of phosphate limitation control experiments were performed to evaluate koh with phosphate limitation as well as experiments with ca oh 2 with phosphate excess in these cases no systematic differences were observed due to the imposed phosphate limitation or phosphate excess respectively 3 7 ph control in pha accumulations with c a o h 2 and koh the addition of ca oh 2 in the feedstock resulted in a distinctly different ph profile during accumulations compared to koh experiments this difference was interpreted to be mainly due to precipitation of calcium carbonate to allow for a more direct comparison between koh and ca oh 2 tests pha accumulation tests with ph controlled to 8 were performed as depicted in fig 4 ph control did not have an observable influence in the koh experiments however in the ca oh 2 tests with ph control lower pha contents pha yields on substrate and total pha and biomass mass increase were observed ph control was performed with additions from a 1 m naoh stock solution and 0 87 g of sodium were added to the reactor over 24 h 4 discussion the combination of tests performed in this work lead to the conclusion that the presence of calcium is beneficial for selective growth of pha storing bacteria and pha accumulation in waste activated sludge calcium presence resulted in pha contents of up to 0 6 gpha gvss higher than previously reported these results broaden the potential to exploit municipal waste activated sludge as a generic resource for industrial scale pha production with reference to the literature and by process of elimination results were examined to identify causal mechanisms for the observed influence of calcium one explanation that could not be ruled out was the potential for formation of calcium acetate complexes that can be more efficiently transported into the cell compared to the native acetate ion development of the consideration leading to this hypothesis follows 4 1 bacterial growth and pha production are affected by the presence of calcium in this work pha production and selective biomass growth were positively affected by the presence of calcium during accumulation calcium was provided due to the addition of ca oh 2 to the feedstock used for pha accumulation the reproducibility of the increase in pha production rates and yields was verified with more than ten pha accumulations with ca oh 2 and koh and with activated sludge samples obtained from different wwtps the increase resulted only when ca oh 2 was added to the feedstock and could not be mimicked by the addition of koh naoh or mg oh 2 as observed in fig 3 calcium caused precipitation of mineral salts that lowered reactor phosphate concentrations and promoted a decrease in ph these conditions were replicated by the addition of cacl 2 in experiments with koh as observed in fig 4 however added cacl 2 also resulted in a higher salinity a negative effect of increased salinity was verified by the addition of kcl in the feedstock of ca oh 2 tests as observed in fig 4 even though a higher salinity did negatively influence the pha production performance a salt effect alone could not explain observed differences between ca oh 2 and koh experiments a higher ph in ca oh 2 experiments 8 0 1 also resulted in lower pha production rates the addition of sodium due to ph control was not high enough to explain the decrease in performance as a consequence of salinity this outcome suggests that the observed influence that calcium may exert is ph dependent in the same line of reasoning from control experiments phosphate limitation due to mineral precipitation in cases with ca oh 2 was not found to be a cause for improved pha production the combination of tests and control experiments lead to the interpretation that it was the presence of calcium directly and not the associated changes in environment created by the addition of calcium that resulted to stimulate selective bacterial growth with concurrent pha production right from the start of accumulation 4 2 calcium addition affects the cellular energy requirements and may promote passive acetate uptake calcium ions are known to play different roles in eukaryotic cells clapham 2007 however the role of calcium in prokaryotic cells remains unclear and research is limited domínguez et al 2015 high calcium concentrations are expected to negatively affect cell activity due to creating a high osmotic pressure however calcium has also been reported to benefit the stability of cell flocs and granules gagliano et al 2020 more related to the current work calcium has been reported to provoke metabolic shifts in polyphosphate accumulating microorganisms to be involved in the formation of pha granules and in ion co transport processes in the animal colon and in plant leaflets zhang et al 2015 trinidad et al 1996 1999 borchert 1986 wolever et al 1995 in polyphosphate accumulating microorganisms a direct effect of calcium was observed an increasing calcium concentration resulted in a lower available phosphate concentration due to calcium phosphate precipitation due to lower available phosphate a metabolic shift was observed from polyphosphate to glycogen metabolism zhang et al 2015 the use of glycogen slightly increased the production of pha with a higher content of hydroxyvalerate in the present work even though phosphate limitation was observed the microbial community was not highly enriched in polyphosphate or glycogen accumulating microorganisms this hypothesis cannot be extrapolated in general for heterotrophic bacteria and thus it cannot explain the results obtained in ca oh 2 tests tian et al 2019 have suggested that calcium has a structural role in the formation of pha granules that are also used as calcium storage units calcium was found to be the most abundant cation in pha granules from c necator h16 up to 4 mg ca 2 gphb and it was proposed that calcium ions play a role in bundling the carboxyl end groups during initial stages of the polymerization this would imply that a minimum concentration of calcium is required to efficiently drive pha production in the work of tian et al 2019 this minimum concentration was around 25 mg ca 2 l in the present work the concentration of calcium was higher than 25 mg ca 2 l in all cases with and without calcium addition in the feedstock consequently this hypothesis can also not explain the results obtained in ca oh 2 tests alternatively calcium may play a role in the transport of acetate into the cell animal colon and plant research experiences have shown evidence for calcium and short chain volatile fatty acids co transport trinidad et al 1996 1999 borchert 1986 wolever et al 1995 in these reports two mechanisms were given as potential explanations the first mechanism proposes that acetate is passively transported through the cell membrane in its undissociated form once the undissociated acetate enters the cytoplasm it dissociates due to higher ph in the cytoplasm compared to in the colon the liberated proton can be excreted from the cell in exchange for an extracellular calcium ion however this first mechanism seems unfeasible as the undissociated acetate can be directly used for pha production or growth and consequently no proton can be excreted a similar mechanism to the one proposed above is normally observed in biological reactors for phosphorus removal operated at low ph values smolders et al 1994 but still it cannot explain the results observed in this work in the current work the reactor ph is higher than the intracellular ph and more energy needs to be used to overcome the electric potential difference across the cell membrane the second mechanism proposes the formation of extracellular calcium acetate complexes that diffuse through the cell membrane once the calcium acetate complex enters the cell it dissociates and the calcium ion is excreted from the cell in exchange for a proton that enters the cell through the atp ase system this second mechanism can potentially explain the results of the present work calcium acetate complexes can be formed in aqueous solutions at ph values similar to those observed in the pha accumulation tests hacht 2008 the formation of calcium acetate complexes is affected by the soluble calcium concentration which is also affected by the precipitation of calcium carbonate and ph for instance at alkaline ph hco 3 co 3 2 equilibrium shifts towards co 3 2 and calcium carbonate precipitation can occur at lower calcium concentrations at lower calcium concentrations the concentration of calcium acetate complexes may be too low to enable passive transport this interpretation can explain why experiments with ca oh 2 at ph 8 resulted in lower pha and biomass production rates compared to experiments where ph decreased to values between 7 0 and 7 5 if calcium acetate complexes are formed and diffuse over the cell membrane lower energy requirements for acetate transport should also be observed in the present work initial oxygen yields on acetate in experiments with calcium were in the range 0 16 0 18 g o 2 gcod hac in previous metabolic models for pha production at ph 7 the minimum yield of oxygen per g of acetate was 0 25 g o 2 gcod hac van aalst van leeuwen et al 1997 in this model energy is required in the production of pha from acetate in two steps 1 to actively transport the acetate through the cell membrane and 2 to convert acetate to acetyl coa at ph 7 each of these steps would require 1 atp per mol of acetate if passive transport through the cell membrane is included in this model the minimum oxygen yield on acetate would be 0 13 and not 0 25 g o 2 gcod hac as observed in fig 3 the initial oxygen yields observed in the current work suggest a potential contribution of passive acetate transport over the cell membrane similarly magnesium acetate complexes could be formed in mg oh 2 experiments however even though mg 2 was present in equimolar concentration as those of ca 2 in ca oh 2 experiments it did not result to stimulate the effect of pha accumulation with selective growth in experiments with mg oh 2 ph development and salinity were more similar to experiments with koh rather than experiments with ca oh 2 it remains unclear why or if magnesium would or should result in similar outcomes as calcium 4 3 simultaneous pha production and selective biomass growth is promoted as consequence of the lower cellular energy requirements as a consequence of the lower energy requirements higher biomass and pha production rates were observed biomass growth was identified to be the main driver to cause increased levels of pha production this growth response was selective towards the pha storing fraction of the biomass as observed by increased degree of enrichment from the microscopy with staining and 16s rrna gene analyses at 48 h 76 80 of the population was able to store pha as compared to only 29 51 when koh was used interestingly the average pha contents in just the pha storing biomass fraction of both reactors were estimated to be at similar levels 0 58 and 0 63 gpha gvss for koh and ca oh 2 respectively in ca oh 2 experiments the sequencing data suggest that the biomass increase is at least partly due to the growth of ferribacterium and zoogloea species the genus ferribacterium is composed of strictly anaerobic chemo organotrophs that oxidize organic acids with ferric iron nitrate or fumarate as electron acceptor and it is associated with the production of phb cummings et al 1999 in wwtp bath iron is added to chemically removed phosphorus and in the anoxic tank nitrate is present these conditions likely explain the presence of this genus in the activated sludge from wwtp bath but they cannot explain why species of this genus as identified would have a competitive advantage in a fully aerated pha accumulation reactor for ca oh 2 tests with four other activated sludge see supplementary information the growth response was associated with other well known phb producers from the genera pseudomonas zoogloea and thauera jiang et al 2011b stouten et al 2019 queirós et al 2015 verlinden et al 2007 thus certain species within the biomass seem to selectively benefit calcium may therefore not benefit all species of the pha storing phenotype to the same extent further research should therefore focus on optimization of nutrients dosing and finding conditions that could potentially lead to the selective growth of superior pha accumulators due to improved yields on substrate preliminary experiments with ca oh 2 have indicated that a stricter nitrogen limitation resulted in similar pha contents to koh tests data not shown and this highlights the importance of biomass growth in the results that were obtained in the present work 4 4 implications for microbial community based pha production even if the mechanism s from which calcium promotes the selective growth of the pha storing biomass fraction remains to be elucidated the outcomes have significant implications in ca oh 2 experiments a three fold increase in pha mass was obtained compared to koh naoh mg oh 2 experiments this increase in pha production allowed to reach pha contents of up to 0 64 gpha gvss which are in line with the highest pha contents reported to date with municipal activated sludge kourmentza et al 2017 sabapathy et al 2020 estévez alonso et al 2021b these high pha contents motivate to exploit municipal waste activated sludge as a generic resource for industrial scale pha production fig 5 additionally the principles are suggestive for pha production process strategies that can be applied generically for any activated sludge as was also observed in this work differences in the maximum pha content to be achieved will naturally be dependent on the fraction of pha storing biomass at the start a higher fraction of pha storing biomass in the activated sludge would likely result in a higher final pha content apart from this the results suggest that specific species of pha storing bacteria may benefit from the effects of lower yields on substrate due to presence of calcium therefore even certain enrichment cultures could produce more polymer with less substrate it would be of specific interest to explore the effect of calcium expanded to more highly enriched cultures such as a plasticicumulans acidivorans dominated culture in the present work an excess of calcium was added to the feedstock in the form of ca oh 2 however in practical scenarios with waste streams this approach is not feasible alternatively calcium may already be present in the waste stream or otherwise calcium salts can be added to optimal concentrations directly to the mixed liquor it is critical to determine the minimum criteria of soluble calcium concentration and ph that are necessary to efficiently drive the kind of simultaneous growth and accumulation response observed in this work for instance in the ca oh 2 experiments performed in the current work the concentration of calcium in the liquid did not exceeded 500 mg ca 2 l due to calcium carbonate precipitation if it is found that a high calcium concentration is necessarily required to drive simultaneous growth and accumulation response strategies to separate the precipitated calcium carbonate from the organic solids will need to be further developed in this work calcium carbonate was removed by acidification with hcl post accumulation acidification is known to be beneficial for the polymer stability for its preservation before downstream processing bengtsson et al 2017 5 conclusions the presence of calcium resulted in pha production with simultaneous selective growth of the pha storing biomass fraction in waste activated sludge as a result higher pha contents up to 0 64 gpha gvss and consistently higher pha yields on substrate 0 49 0 55 gcod pha gcod hac were obtained using a full scale waste activated sludge and within a relatively short production cycle this strategy opens a potential to apply these principles generically for any activated sludge as long as there is already sufficient enrichment of the pha storing phenotype in the activated sludge to enable for short term enrichment with concurrent pha storage declaration of competing interest

15398,activated sludge from municipal wastewater treatment processes can be used directly for the production of biodegradable polyesters from the family of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas however municipal activated sludge typically cannot accumulate phas to very high levels and often low yields of polymer produced on substrate are observed in the present work it was found that the presence of calcium promotes selective growth and enrichment of the pha storing biomass fraction and significantly improved both pha contents and yields calcium addition resulted in pha contents of 0 60 0 03 gpha gvss and average pha yields on substrate of 0 49 0 03 gcod pha gcod hac compared to 0 35 0 01 gpha gvss and 0 19 0 01 gcod pha gcod hac without calcium addition after 48 h three times more pha was produced compared to control experiments without calcium addition higher pha content and selective biomass production is proposed to be a consequence of calcium dependent increased levels of passive acetate uptake such more efficient substrate uptake could be related to a formation of calcium acetate complexes findings lead to bioprocess methods to stimulate a short term selective growth of pha storing microorganisms and this enables improvements to the techno economic feasibility for municipal waste activated sludge to become a generic resource for industrial scale pha production graphical abstract

community engineering aims to produce energy carriers and chemicals from waste streams using microbial communities kleerebezem et al 2015 microbial community engineering relies on the use of ecological selection principles for the enrichment of microbial communities with a desired functionality an example of the use of microbial community engineering principles is the production of biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkonoates phas kourmentza et al 2017 sabapathy et al 2020 estévez alonso et al 2021b phas are naturally occurring polyesters that are produced intracellularly by bacteria to balance their growth while dealing with dynamic conditions such as changes in substrate availability van loosdrecht et al 1997 reis et al 2003 in microbial community based pha production pha storing bacteria are first enriched in a so called selection reactor by applying intermittent presence and absence of carbon sources volatile fatty acids and or uncoupling of organic carbon and growth nutrients supplies namely nitrogen and phosphorus lemos et al 2006 lorini et al 2020 subsequently the surplus biomass produced in the selection reactor is exploited in an accumulation reactor to maximize intracellular pha content of the pha storing biomass sabapathy et al 2020 kourmentza et al 2017 the maximum intracellular pha content is constrained by the fraction of pha storing bacteria and the specific storage capacity of the microbial strains present in the microbial community for instance with enrichment cultures where the whole microbial community can produce pha intracellular pha contents of up to 0 9 gpha gvss have been achieved johnson et al 2009a jiang et al 2011a notwithstanding many species of bacteria exhibit only moderate maximum storage capacity in the range from 0 5 to 0 8 gpha gvss estévez alonso et al 2021b sabapathy et al 2020 kourmentza et al 2017 when selected microbial communities have a lower fraction of pha storing bacteria and therefore not all bacteria are able to produce phas lower average pha contents are observed even if the pha storing bacteria that are present can accumulate up to 0 9 gpha gvss marang et al 2014 crognale et al 2019a an example of a microbial community that exhibits a lower fraction of pha storing bacteria with moderate storage capacity is municipal activated sludge bengtsson et al 2017 pei et al 2022a the attraction to use of waste municipal activate sludge for pha production is limited in general due to lower pha contents in combination with lower pha yields on substrate average pha contents and yields on substrate that have been typically reported for municipal activated sludge are not higher than 0 5 gpha gvss and 0 5 gcod pha gcod hac bengtsson et al 2017 kourmentza et al 2017 these values are significantly lower than those that have been obtained with specifically enriched biomass it has been recently shown that the pha storing bacteria already present in municipal activated sludge systems can accumulate up to 0 6 gpha gvss pei et al 2022a thus if strategies are developed to consistently realize such high pha contents with municipal activated sludge it could broaden the generic potential for biopolymer supply chains municipal waste activated sludge could become an ubiquitous readily available biomass source for industrial scale microbial community based pha production strategies to reach higher pha contents with municipal activated sludge are expected to rely on methods that increase the fraction of pha storing bacteria in the biomass pei et al 2022a an increase in the fraction of pha storing bacteria will consequently result in a process that reaches the biomass maximum pha accumulation potential it has been hypothesized that the fraction of pha storing bacteria can be increased directly in the pha accumulation process if conditions for robustly promoting selective growth of the pha storing biomass can be identified and applied pei et al 2022a during cell division daughter cells contain half of the cellular pha content of the mother cells pfeiffer and jendrossek 2012 consequently more pha can be formed in parallel to cell division in this way pha production and biomass growth may occur concurrently and theoretically given the right conditions indefinitely a challenge is to find those conditions where these two processes can co occur with selective growth of pha storing bacteria only in pure cultures and highly enriched open cultures examples for simultaneous growth and pha accumulation have already been reported mulders et al 2020 cavaillé et al 2016 valentino et al 2015 grousseau et al 2013 however it is unknown if a similar strategy could be applied to diverse microbial communities that have not been specifically selected for pha accumulation for activated sludge systems cavaillé et al 2013 found that different degrees of phosphorus limitation promoted simultaneous growth and accumulation of pha nonetheless this strategy required a strict phosphorus level control and resulted in lower pha yields on substrate compared to enrichment cultures the present work stemmed from unexpected observations made during the search for selective conditions promoting for simultaneous growth and pha accumulation this work concerns an investigation of effects of calcium during pha accumulation with municipal activated sludge at lab scale volatile fatty acid solutions are often used to mimic acidic fermented feedstocks such feedstocks are to be used for industrial scale pha production bengtsson et al 2017 sodium or potassium hydroxide are normally added to these feedstock solutions for ph control in preliminary experiments when calcium hydroxide was used instead to increase the ph of an acetic acid feedstock it was observed that biomass growth and pha production were positively affected the addition of calcium in the feedstock solution induced changes that apparently created favourable conditions in the reactor for selective biomass growth concurrent to pha production however since calcium addition could have influenced several water quality factors the underlying causes for observed concurrent biomass growth with pha production were not clear the aim of this study was to identify the mechanism s behind the observed increase in pha production and biomass growth due to calcium presence 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up pha accumulation tests were performed over 24 and or 48 h in a 1 l double jacketed glass bioreactor as previously described in estévez alonso et al 2022 reactor temperature was 25 0 1 c ph was monitored and air was supplied at 1 l min in some experiments the ph was controlled to 8 0 0 1 with 1 m naoh solution as indicated in table 1 2 2 sludge source and feedstock activated sludge from bath wwtp the netherlands was used as the principal pha storing biomass for the pha accumulation tests the activated sludge samples were taken after gravity belt thickening and had a total solids concentration of 55 gts l validation experiments with calcium hydroxide were also performed with activated sludge from four other different dutch wwtps leeuwarden beverwijk almere and winsum these validation experiments were compared to outcomes from a parallel study pei et al 2022a for these other experiments activated sludge samples were taken directly from the main aerobic process volume the mixed liquor suspended solids were concentrated by gravity settling for 30 60 min with decanting and had a total solids concentration of 6 to 12 gts l the concentrated mixed liquor was delivered on the same day to wetsus leeuwarden the netherlands and stored at 4 c for further analysis the accumulation feedstock with nutrients ratio 100 1 cod n by weight was prepared with tap water as follows 50 g l acetic acid and 1 91 g l nh 4 cl phosphate levels were changed by the addition of kh 2 po 4 as described in table 1 the feedstock was adjusted to ph 4 5 with 20 gca oh 2 15 5 gmg oh 2 30 gkoh or 21 5 gnaoh as described in table 1 side experiments were performed with the supplementary addition of cacl2 and kcl to the feedstock 2 3 pha accumulation experiments for each assay the concentrated activated sludge samples were diluted with tap water to nominally 2 3 gvss l and allylthiourea 50 mg l was added the mixed liquor was brought to 25 c and conditioned with constant aeration overnight to establish a baseline of endogenous microbial activity subsequently an automated acclimation was performed acclimation comprised three feast and famine cycles as previously reported morgan sagastume et al 2017 feast conditions were generated with a pulse input to reach a maximum substrate level of 150 mgcod l and the duration of the feast was determined from changes in respiration based on dissolved oxygen concentration trends the famine period was dynamically adjusted to be three times longer than each respective feast time in total the acclimation period had a duration of 4 5 h the trends in respiration were used to determine the oxygen mass transfer coefficient k l a after the third acclimation famine period the accumulation test was started automatically accumulation was driven with the same feast influent pulses and control logic but now without any famine period between pulses pulse inputs were controlled from on line monitoring of dissolved oxygen according to valentino et al 2015 2 4 analytical methods the pha accumulation process was monitored by online data logging do ph and temperature liquid and solids analyses grab samples were used for liquid and solids analyses biomass pha content and caco 3 determination suspended solids were separated from the mixed liquor by centrifugation 3250 rcf at 4 c for 20 min the supernatant after membrane filtration 0 45 μ m pore size filters was stored at 20 c pending liquid analyses acetic acid concentration was determined by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography and ammonium nitrite nitrate and phosphate concentrations were determined by ion chromatography as previously reported estévez alonso et al 2021a the harvested biomass pellet dry weight and ash contents were estimated based on standard methods and referenced to the sample volume for total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss respectively the aliquot for pha determination was directly acidified to ph 2 with 37 hcl after thorough mixing for 5 min suspended solids were collected 3250 rcf at 4 c for 20 min the biomass pellet was retained and dried at 105 c dried pellets were ground and analysed by thermogravimetric analysis as described previously chan et al 2017 similarly the aliquot for caco 3 determination was directly centrifuged 3250 rcf at 4 c for 20 min and the biomass pellet was retained and dried at 105 c dried pellets were ground and analysed by thermogravimetric analysis 5 mg of ground sub sample were introduced to the furnace at 80 c and heated to 105 c 10 c min under nitrogen atmosphere after drying at 105 c for 10 min the sample was heated to 550 c 10 c min under nitrogen atmosphere at 550 c the atmosphere was switched to air and temperature was held for 30 min after 30 min at 550 c the sample was heated to 900 c the weight loss trends in air were used to determine inorganic content and the calcium carbonate fraction with respect to the biomass dried total and volatile solids 2 5 microscopy analysis mixed liquor sludge samples were taken at selected time points during the pha accumulation process the mixed liquor was fixed with formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3 7 and preserved in a solution with ratio 1 1 of 1x pbs and pure ethanol the fixed samples were stored at 20 c until further processing fixed samples were stained with bodipy 493 503 thermo fisher scientific ma usa in combination with sypro red thermo fisher scientific ma usa and were examined with confocal laser scanning microscope with statistics from fields of view as previously described pei et al 2022b respective overlaid stained images were acquired with a 16 bit depth in separate channels and analysed by fiji image j imagej2 ver 1 52p software an average biomass volume to volume ratio of polymer to non pha storing biomass v v was estimated pei et al 2022b this ratio was used for the determination of the fraction of pha storing biomass in the microbial community 2 6 microbial community structure fresh samples were collected at selected time points from the accumulation reactor and stored at 20 c until dna extraction before extraction

archive under project accession number prjeb56263 2 7 data analysis all measured parameters were corrected for effects of sample withdrawal and feedstock addition from liquid and mass balance considerations johnson et al 2009b the biomass pha content was expressed as mass fraction of the volatile suspended solids gpha gvss active biomass x a was estimated as the total vss minus pha mass active biomass was assumed to be represented as ch 1 8 o 0 5 n 0 2 roels 1980 the trend for change in pha content f pha was represented by least squares regression to the empirical function 1 f pha a 0 a 1 1 e kt where a 0 a 1 and k are constants that allow for estimation of rates as a function of time and comparison between performances of different activated sludge samples bengtsson et al 2017 initial and average specific production consumption rates and pha yields on substrate were estimated for different times the average pha yields on substrate are reported on a cod basis and calculated from the amount of pha 1 67 gcod gphb produced and substrate 1 07 gcod ghac added as a function of time average specific production and consumption rates were calculated based on the cumulative

the work described in this paper in preliminary tests with municipal activated sludge for pha production calcium hydroxide was used to increase the ph of an acetic acid feedstock solution in these tests a distinctly different biomass response was observed compared to experiments where koh was used fig 1 this response was also observed in replicate experiments with four other types of municipal activated sludge as provided in the si the addition of calcium hydroxide in the feedstock solution induced changes in the reactor conditions that affected the calcium and salts concentrations phosphate availability and ph changes over the accumulation calcium carbonate precipitation was observed already in the first two hours of the accumulation and therefore the concentration of soluble calcium in the mixed liquor did not increase above 500 mg ca 2 l over the time of accumulation after 48 h 50 to 55 of the total dry solids in the reactor could be identified as calcium carbonate calcium balances showed that the calcium added to the reactor could be found back mainly as calcium carbonate or dissolved calcium the precipitation of calcium carbonate induced a slow but constant decrease of ph from an initial value between 8 2 and 8 4 to a final value between 7 0 and 7 5 after 48 h of accumulation similarly phosphate concentrations were below the detection limit from the start of the accumulation to elucidate the cause for the biomass response due to calcium added to the feedstock deepened investigations were performed with activated sludge from bath wwtp pha accumulation tests were performed with ca oh 2 mg oh 2 koh and naoh to evaluate if the observed biomass response was specific to calcium pha accumulations tests were also performed to evaluate the potential for influences on concurrent selective biomass growth with pha production caused by salinity phosphate concentration and ph control 3 2 pha accumulations with c a o h 2 and koh a comparison of 48 h pha accumulations tests with ca oh 2 or koh is provided in fig 1 in the presence of calcium a higher substrate consumption was observed this increased consumption was associated with much higher pha production 11 5 12 4 gcod pha compared to only 3 1 4 0 gcod pha in koh tests maximum biomass pha contents in the range of 0 56 0 64 gpha gvss were obtained with the addition of ca oh 2 compared to only 0 35 37 gpha gvss for koh cases similarly the average pha yield on substrate obtained at 48 h was higher for ca oh 2 0 44 0 52 gcod pha gcod hac compared to 0 18 0 21 gcod pha gcod hac for koh lower average oxygen yields on substrate were also observed for ca oh 2 0 29 0 46 g o 2 gcod hac compared to 0 65 0 69 g o 2 gcod hac for koh fig 3 cod mass balances closed well for ca oh 2 and koh tests 105 6 and 102 5 respectively biomass growth was slightly higher in ca oh 2 assays 3 4 4 3 gcod x compared to 2 6 3 3 gcod x in koh tests in ca oh 2 accumulations biomass growth was observed already from the beginning of the accumulation in koh experiments biomass growth only started after 4 6 h from microscope staining a higher fraction of pha storing biomass was observed at 48 h in ca oh 2 compared to koh as illustrated in fig 2 the fraction of pha storing biomass at 48 h was 0 76 0 80 v v compared to 0 29 0 51 v v in experiments with koh despite different values in the fraction of pha storing biomass the derived average pha content within just the pha storing fraction of the biomass was estimated to be similar in both cases 0 63 and 0 58 gpha gvss 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis demonstrated that the addition of ca oh 2 versus koh to the feedstock promoted differential developments of the microbial community composition as shown in fig 2 permanova interaction timepoint feedstock f2 17 8 4 p 0 002 fig 2c addition of ca oh 2 caused a rapid drop in diversity within 24 h with a shift in biomass composition that remained stable up to 48 h this ca oh 2 induced shift was associated with ferribacterium zoogloea and other dominant rhodocyclaceae genera conversely addition of koh induced a different kind of shift with retained microbial composition up to 24 h followed by a later decrease in diversity between 24 and 48 h corresponding to when most growth took place shifts induced by koh addition were associated with acinetobacter thauera hydrogenophaga and other dominant genera that in contrast to ca oh 2 continued to change in composition between 24 and 48 h 3 3 pha accumulations with m g o h 2 and naoh to investigate if the observed effect was calcium ion and or cation valence specific additional pha accumulation tests were performed with mg 2 and na as the hydroxide counterion mg oh 2 and naoh were used to raise the feedstock ph to 4 5 instead the addition of mg oh 2 and naoh resulted in similar ph profiles as in experiments with koh also the process performance in terms of pha production was very similar the koh experiments as observed in fig 3 these results pointed to a specific effect related to or created directly by the presence of calcium cations during the accumulation process 3 4 increasing calcium concentrations in koh experiments to further evaluate the effect of calcium addition accumulation experiments with koh and extra cacl 2 amounts were performed with increasing calcium concentration the pha production and biomass growth increased as observed in fig 4 the test with koh and 30 g cacl 2 l had the same dissolved calcium concentration as the feedstock with ca oh 2 and replicated the observations of tests with only ca oh 2 calcium carbonate precipitation occurred from the beginning of the experiment and similar trends of ph were observed despite these similarities in reactor profile the pha production performance was lower than in experiments with ca oh 2 but still significantly higher than in experiments with only koh an identifiable key distinction between tests with added calcium salts and experiments with only ca oh 2 was the much higher increase in salinity due to the addition of cacl 2 to the feedstock 3 5 increasing salinity levels in c a o h 2 experiments the addition of cacl 2 to experiments with koh in the feedstock resulted in higher salts concentrations in the reactor compared to experiments with ca oh 2 to evaluate the influence of salinity in ca oh 2 experiments control experiments with ca oh 2 and different kcl concentrations were performed similar trends were observed in all experiments independent of the concentration of kcl in the feedstock calcium carbonate precipitation resulted in a progressive decrease in ph to around 7 0 7 5 despite similarities to experiments with ca oh 2 higher concentrations of kcl reduced the pha production performance as observed in fig 4 experiments with ca oh 2 and 40 gkcl l were analogous to experiments with koh and 30 g cacl 2 l and similar results were obtained as it was expected 3 6 phosphate excess and limitation in accumulations with c a o h 2 and koh in experiments with ca oh 2 phosphate concentrations were not detectable 0 33 mgp l in the reactor after 2 3 h of accumulation the addition of ca oh 2 in the feedstock is anticipated to promote the precipitation of calcium phosphate making the conditions phosphate limiting during most of the pha accumulation time notwithstanding observed biomass growth to evaluate for an influence of phosphate limitation control experiments were performed to evaluate koh with phosphate limitation as well as experiments with ca oh 2 with phosphate excess in these cases no systematic differences were observed due to the imposed phosphate limitation or phosphate excess respectively 3 7 ph control in pha accumulations with c a o h 2 and koh the addition of ca oh 2 in the feedstock resulted in a distinctly different ph profile during accumulations compared to koh experiments this difference was interpreted to be mainly due to precipitation of calcium carbonate to allow for a more direct comparison between koh and ca oh 2 tests pha accumulation tests with ph controlled to 8 were performed as depicted in fig 4 ph control did not have an observable influence in the koh experiments however in the ca oh 2 tests with ph control lower pha contents pha yields on substrate and total pha and biomass mass increase were observed ph control was performed with additions from a 1 m naoh stock solution and 0 87 g of sodium were added to the reactor over 24 h 4 discussion the combination of tests performed in this work lead to the conclusion that the presence of calcium is beneficial for selective growth of pha storing bacteria and pha accumulation in waste activated sludge calcium presence resulted in pha contents of up to 0 6 gpha gvss higher than previously reported these results broaden the potential to exploit municipal waste activated sludge as a generic resource for industrial scale pha production with reference to the literature and by process of elimination results were examined to identify causal mechanisms for the observed influence of calcium one explanation that could not be ruled out was the potential for formation of calcium acetate complexes that can be more efficiently transported into the cell compared to the native acetate ion development of the consideration leading to this hypothesis follows 4 1 bacterial growth and pha production are affected by the presence of calcium in this work pha production and selective biomass growth were positively affected by the presence of calcium during accumulation calcium was provided due to the addition of ca oh 2 to the feedstock used for pha accumulation the reproducibility of the increase in pha production rates and yields was verified with more than ten pha accumulations with ca oh 2 and koh and with activated sludge samples obtained from different wwtps the increase resulted only when ca oh 2 was added to the feedstock and could not be mimicked by the addition of koh naoh or mg oh 2 as observed in fig 3 calcium caused precipitation of mineral salts that lowered reactor phosphate concentrations and promoted a decrease in ph these conditions were replicated by the addition of cacl 2 in experiments with koh as observed in fig 4 however added cacl 2 also resulted in a higher salinity a negative effect of increased salinity was verified by the addition of kcl in the feedstock of ca oh 2 tests as observed in fig 4 even though a higher salinity did negatively influence the pha production performance a salt effect alone could not explain observed differences between ca oh 2 and koh experiments a higher ph in ca oh 2 experiments 8 0 1 also resulted in lower pha production rates the addition of sodium due to ph control was not high enough to explain the decrease in performance as a consequence of salinity this outcome suggests that the observed influence that calcium may exert is ph dependent in the same line of reasoning from control experiments phosphate limitation due to mineral precipitation in cases with ca oh 2 was not found to be a cause for improved pha production the combination of tests and control experiments lead to the interpretation that it was the presence of calcium directly and not the associated changes in environment created by the addition of calcium that resulted to stimulate selective bacterial growth with concurrent pha production right from the start of accumulation 4 2 calcium addition affects the cellular energy requirements and may promote passive acetate uptake calcium ions are known to play different roles in eukaryotic cells clapham 2007 however the role of calcium in prokaryotic cells remains unclear and research is limited domínguez et al 2015 high calcium concentrations are expected to negatively affect cell activity due to creating a high osmotic pressure however calcium has also been reported to benefit the stability of cell flocs and granules gagliano et al 2020 more related to the current work calcium has been reported to provoke metabolic shifts in polyphosphate accumulating microorganisms to be involved in the formation of pha granules and in ion co transport processes in the animal colon and in plant leaflets zhang et al 2015 trinidad et al 1996 1999 borchert 1986 wolever et al 1995 in polyphosphate accumulating microorganisms a direct effect of calcium was observed an increasing calcium concentration resulted in a lower available phosphate concentration due to calcium phosphate precipitation due to lower available phosphate a metabolic shift was observed from polyphosphate to glycogen metabolism zhang et al 2015 the use of glycogen slightly increased the production of pha with a higher content of hydroxyvalerate in the present work even though phosphate limitation was observed the microbial community was not highly enriched in polyphosphate or glycogen accumulating microorganisms this hypothesis cannot be extrapolated in general for heterotrophic bacteria and thus it cannot explain the results obtained in ca oh 2 tests tian et al 2019 have suggested that calcium has a structural role in the formation of pha granules that are also used as calcium storage units calcium was found to be the most abundant cation in pha granules from c necator h16 up to 4 mg ca 2 gphb and it was proposed that calcium ions play a role in bundling the carboxyl end groups during initial stages of the polymerization this would imply that a minimum concentration of calcium is required to efficiently drive pha production in the work of tian et al 2019 this minimum concentration was around 25 mg ca 2 l in the present work the concentration of calcium was higher than 25 mg ca 2 l in all cases with and without calcium addition in the feedstock consequently this hypothesis can also not explain the results obtained in ca oh 2 tests alternatively calcium may play a role in the transport of acetate into the cell animal colon and plant research experiences have shown evidence for calcium and short chain volatile fatty acids co transport trinidad et al 1996 1999 borchert 1986 wolever et al 1995 in these reports two mechanisms were given as potential explanations the first mechanism proposes that acetate is passively transported through the cell membrane in its undissociated form once the undissociated acetate enters the cytoplasm it dissociates due to higher ph in the cytoplasm compared to in the colon the liberated proton can be excreted from the cell in exchange for an extracellular calcium ion however this first mechanism seems unfeasible as the undissociated acetate can be directly used for pha production or growth and consequently no proton can be excreted a similar mechanism to the one proposed above is normally observed in biological reactors for phosphorus removal operated at low ph values smolders et al 1994 but still it cannot explain the results observed in this work in the current work the reactor ph is higher than the intracellular ph and more energy needs to be used to overcome the electric potential difference across the cell membrane the second mechanism proposes the formation of extracellular calcium acetate complexes that diffuse through the cell membrane once the calcium acetate complex enters the cell it dissociates and the calcium ion is excreted from the cell in exchange for a proton that enters the cell through the atp ase system this second mechanism can potentially explain the results of the present work calcium acetate complexes can be formed in aqueous solutions at ph values similar to those observed in the pha accumulation tests hacht 2008 the formation of calcium acetate complexes is affected by the soluble calcium concentration which is also affected by the precipitation of calcium carbonate and ph for instance at alkaline ph hco 3 co 3 2 equilibrium shifts towards co 3 2 and calcium carbonate precipitation can occur at lower calcium concentrations at lower calcium concentrations the concentration of calcium acetate complexes may be too low to enable passive transport this interpretation can explain why experiments with ca oh 2 at ph 8 resulted in lower pha and biomass production rates compared to experiments where ph decreased to values between 7 0 and 7 5 if calcium acetate complexes are formed and diffuse over the cell membrane lower energy requirements for acetate transport should also be observed in the present work initial oxygen yields on acetate in experiments with calcium were in the range 0 16 0 18 g o 2 gcod hac in previous metabolic models for pha production at ph 7 the minimum yield of oxygen per g of acetate was 0 25 g o 2 gcod hac van aalst van leeuwen et al 1997 in this model energy is required in the production of pha from acetate in two steps 1 to actively transport the acetate through the cell membrane and 2 to convert acetate to acetyl coa at ph 7 each of these steps would require 1 atp per mol of acetate if passive transport through the cell membrane is included in this model the minimum oxygen yield on acetate would be 0 13 and not 0 25 g o 2 gcod hac as observed in fig 3 the initial oxygen yields observed in the current work suggest a potential contribution of passive acetate transport over the cell membrane similarly magnesium acetate complexes could be formed in mg oh 2 experiments however even though mg 2 was present in equimolar concentration as those of ca 2 in ca oh 2 experiments it did not result to stimulate the effect of pha accumulation with selective growth in experiments with mg oh 2 ph development and salinity were more similar to experiments with koh rather than experiments with ca oh 2 it remains unclear why or if magnesium would or should result in similar outcomes as calcium 4 3 simultaneous pha production and selective biomass growth is promoted as consequence of the lower cellular energy requirements as a consequence of the lower energy requirements higher biomass and pha production rates were observed biomass growth was identified to be the main driver to cause increased levels of pha production this growth response was selective towards the pha storing fraction of the biomass as observed by increased degree of enrichment from the microscopy with staining and 16s rrna gene analyses at 48 h 76 80 of the population was able to store pha as compared to only 29 51 when koh was used interestingly the average pha contents in just the pha storing biomass fraction of both reactors were estimated to be at similar levels 0 58 and 0 63 gpha gvss for koh and ca oh 2 respectively in ca oh 2 experiments the sequencing data suggest that the biomass increase is at least partly due to the growth of ferribacterium and zoogloea species the genus ferribacterium is composed of strictly anaerobic chemo organotrophs that oxidize organic acids with ferric iron nitrate or fumarate as electron acceptor and it is associated with the production of phb cummings et al 1999 in wwtp bath iron is added to chemically removed phosphorus and in the anoxic tank nitrate is present these conditions likely explain the presence of this genus in the activated sludge from wwtp bath but they cannot explain why species of this genus as identified would have a competitive advantage in a fully aerated pha accumulation reactor for ca oh 2 tests with four other activated sludge see supplementary information the growth response was associated with other well known phb producers from the genera pseudomonas zoogloea and thauera jiang et al 2011b stouten et al 2019 queirós et al 2015 verlinden et al 2007 thus certain species within the biomass seem to selectively benefit calcium may therefore not benefit all species of the pha storing phenotype to the same extent further research should therefore focus on optimization of nutrients dosing and finding conditions that could potentially lead to the selective growth of superior pha accumulators due to improved yields on substrate preliminary experiments with ca oh 2 have indicated that a stricter nitrogen limitation resulted in similar pha contents to koh tests data not shown and this highlights the importance of biomass growth in the results that were obtained in the present work 4 4 implications for microbial community based pha production even if the mechanism s from which calcium promotes the selective growth of the pha storing biomass fraction remains to be elucidated the outcomes have significant implications in ca oh 2 experiments a three fold increase in pha mass was obtained compared to koh naoh mg oh 2 experiments this increase in pha production allowed to reach pha contents of up to 0 64 gpha gvss which are in line with the highest pha contents reported to date with municipal activated sludge kourmentza et al 2017 sabapathy et al 2020 estévez alonso et al 2021b these high pha contents motivate to exploit municipal waste activated sludge as a generic resource for industrial scale pha production fig 5 additionally the principles are suggestive for pha production process strategies that can be applied generically for any activated sludge as was also observed in this work differences in the maximum pha content to be achieved will naturally be dependent on the fraction of pha storing biomass at the start a higher fraction of pha storing biomass in the activated sludge would likely result in a higher final pha content apart from this the results suggest that specific species of pha storing bacteria may benefit from the effects of lower yields on substrate due to presence of calcium therefore even certain enrichment cultures could produce more polymer with less substrate it would be of specific interest to explore the effect of calcium expanded to more highly enriched cultures such as a plasticicumulans acidivorans dominated culture in the present work an excess of calcium was added to the feedstock in the form of ca oh 2 however in practical scenarios with waste streams this approach is not feasible alternatively calcium may already be present in the waste stream or otherwise calcium salts can be added to optimal concentrations directly to the mixed liquor it is critical to determine the minimum criteria of soluble calcium concentration and ph that are necessary to efficiently drive the kind of simultaneous growth and accumulation response observed in this work for instance in the ca oh 2 experiments performed in the current work the concentration of calcium in the liquid did not exceeded 500 mg ca 2 l due to calcium carbonate precipitation if it is found that a high calcium concentration is necessarily required to drive simultaneous growth and accumulation response strategies to separate the precipitated calcium carbonate from the organic solids will need to be further developed in this work calcium carbonate was removed by acidification with hcl post accumulation acidification is known to be beneficial for the polymer stability for its preservation before downstream processing bengtsson et al 2017 5 conclusions the presence of calcium resulted in pha production with simultaneous selective growth of the pha storing biomass fraction in waste activated sludge as a result higher pha contents up to 0 64 gpha gvss and consistently higher pha yields on substrate 0 49 0 55 gcod pha gcod hac were obtained using a full scale waste activated sludge and within a relatively short production cycle this strategy opens a potential to apply these principles generically for any activated sludge as long as there is already sufficient enrichment of the pha storing phenotype in the activated sludge to enable for short term enrichment with concurrent pha storage declaration of competing interest

15399,microplastics mps can adsorb antibiotics to form complex pollutants which seriously threatens the health of freshwater ecosystems few studies have examined the combined pollution characteristics of microplastics mps and antibiotics in restored freshwater ecosystems and their effects on the growth traits of the aquatic primary producers we studied both the ecotoxicological effects of polyethylene pe mps and the antibiotics sulfanilamide sulfa sa on the structural diversity etc and functional nutrient cycling etc properties of water plant sediment ecosystems the synergistic toxic effects of pe and sa resulted in a reduction in the chlorophyll content and chloroplast fluorescence meanwhile pe and sa single combined pollution stress inhibits the radial oxygen loss in roots and activates the antioxidant defense system in leaves the change in the growth response characteristics of vallisneria natans v natans under oxidative stress induced by single combined pollution showed a dosage effect the microbial compositions of the overlying water and sediment were significantly changed by the pollution exposure as evidenced by the increased microbial diversity and altered microbial taxa distribution an increase in the total concentrations of sulfa in the overlying water was accompanied by an increase in the relative abundances of resistance genes pe mps significantly affected the removal of total nitrogen and antibiotics from the overlying water the interaction between pe and sa affects ammonia and nitrite nitrogen exchange in water sediment systems thus this study investigated the effects of combined mp and antibiotics pollution on the growth state metabolic function microbial community structure and microbial diversity of the freshwater ecosystems the mechanism underlying of the combined polyethylene sulfanilamide pe sa effect on the v natans was revealed in addition the correlation between different environmental factors was analyzed and a structural equation model was constructed this study provides primary data for evaluating the ecological and environmental effects of combined pe sa pollution and its possible risks moreover it

natans data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastics are widely used in various fields as a new class of materials owing to their low density low thermal conductivity low electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance huang et al 2020a in 2018 the world s total plastic production was 359 million tons with china s plastic production reaching 108 million tons wagner et al 2014 low recycling rates and improper handling of plastic wastes has led to their accumulation of plastic in the environment as a new type of pollutant the global environmental problems caused by microplastics mps are becoming increasingly serious ivleva et al 2017 mps have a small particle size 5 μm therefore they are easily absorbed by plants and biologically ingested into the body thereby affecting the biological systems of living organisms in terms of morphology and metabolism characteristics huang et al 2020b in addition mps have a large specific surface area which facilitates the adsorption of pollutants from the surrounding environment and become the carrier of pollutant transmission mps can accumulate migrate and be transferred into organisms hanslik et al 2020 which directly or indirectly affects the ecosystem structure and function xu et al 2019 and changes biological growth and reproductive behaviors sharma et al 2020 mps can disrupt ecosystem services such as biogeochemical processes by altering the abiotic features of substrates such as soil permeability and interfering with important ecosystem functions such as interspecific competition prata et al 2021 antibiotics have also been considered relatively new threats to the environment they are metabolites produced by microorganisms including bacteria fungi and actinomycetes and have anti pathogenic or other activities zhu et al 2020 they can inhibit or interfere with the immune system and are used in many fields to treat various diseases caused by specific microorganisms chen et al 2019 however the overuse of antibiotics has increased their emissions into the aquatic environments posing potential pollution risks to freshwater ecosystems antibiotics are usually attenuated by abiotic actions adsorption hydrolysis photolysis or biotic actions but most types of antibiotics eg sulfanilamide sa are not susceptible to degradation yu et al 2019 more than 85 of antibiotics exist in environmental media in the form of antigens or other active metabolites causing soil and water pollution delgado et al 2010 although antibiotics are present at relatively low concentrations ng l to µg l in the natural environment long term antibiotic exposure poses significant risks to animal plant and human health milh et al 2021 for instance oxytetracycline affects duckweed based phytoremediation systems such as oxidative stress nutrient production and microorganisms metabolic activity hu et al 2021 they can also cause the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistant genes args wang et al 2022 in addition to the inherent toxicity of plastic particles the interaction of microplastics with coexisting pollutants may affect bioaccumulation bioavailability and degradation of pollutants ma et al 2016 a wide variety of contaminants are present in water so it is not enough to study one single microplastic affecting living things potential toxicological interactions are of serious concern when organisms simultaneously face environments where microplastics and other pollutants coexist microplastics high specific surface area and water transport properties facilitate the adsorption of chemicals to the plastic surface which can lead to the accumulation of contaminants on its surface including heavy metals endocrine disrupting chemicals and persistent organic pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs from the marine environment the combined toxic effect of pollutants and microplastics on aquatic organisms is a currently controversial issue some researchers pointed out that the possibility of organisms exposure to contaminants via microplastics is negligible compared with exposure to contaminants via other routes water food intake and other suspended particulate matter such as organic matter koelmans et al 2016 in addition many studies have confirmed that organisms can ingest pollutants through mps but the toxic effects are still being explored for instance some representative contaminants such as pcbs brominated flame retardants perfluorinated compounds and methylmercury have been selected to study their combined toxic effects with mps microplastics alone did not affect aquatic organisms under experimental conditions nevertheless the combined effects of microplastics and adsorbed pollutants significantly altered the homeostasis of aquatic organisms compared with the exposure to contaminants alone rainieri et al 2018 thus the impact of antibiotics on aquatic environmental organisms cannot be ignored macrophytes play a key functional role in aquatic ecosystems and provide services to humans prančl et al 2014 macrophytes can influence ecological processes such as nutrient cycling and maintain the health of aquatic ecosystems by releasing oxygen li et al 2021 studies have shown that the combined action of mps and antibiotics can pose a greater threat to the ecological environment than a single source of pollution fu et al 2022 however hitherto the toxicological effects of mps and antibiotics and their removal by freshwater micro ecosystems remain poorly elucidated therefore the main objectives of the present study were to i explore the antioxidant defense mechanisms photosynthetic systems and radial oxygen losses of submerged plants under different concentrations of polyethylene microplastics pe mps and sulfanilamide sa ii study the effects of single combined pollution on microbial community structure and resistant gene abundance and iii assess the impact of the two pollutants on nutrient cycling processes wate plant sediment in freshwater micro ecosystems the significance of this study is to clarify the effects of pe mps and sa on aquatic vascular plants and provides new opportunities to develop control strategies to reduce the toxicological effects of mps and antibiotics on freshwater ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the

v natans 3 1 1 effects of pe sa on plant photosynthesis the results showed that sa significantly affected the chlorophyll content of v natans under combined polyethylene sulfanilamide pe sa pollution stress there was an interaction between pe and sa and the total chlorophyll content differed significantly f 161 596 p 0 01 this significant difference was most apparent when the concentration combination was 0 5 pe 1 mg l sa the results showed that the autofluorescence intensity of chloroplasts exposed to 1 mg l sa 1 pe and 1 pe 1 mg l sa decreased p 0 05 fig 2 d cell damage chloroplast disorder and chloroplast damage were observed in these three systems 3 1 2 radial oxygen loss of rhizosphere in v natans po is based on the rhizosphere to the specific excitation light on the photochemical sensing film to measure the rhizosphere oxygen concentration the fluorescence intensity of po gradually decreased fig 3 indicating that rhizosphere do showed a downward trend both mps and sa inhibited do generation the effect of 0 5 pe and 1 mg l sa was the greatest it was observed that under the single stress of pe the rhizosphere fluorescence weakened under single sa stress the fluorescence was not uniform and the cells were damaged however the fluorescence change was the most obvious when the plant was in a combined pe sa environment the proportion of do during the daytime was lower on the same day than at night text si 8 fig s2 v natans was stained with the fluorescent dyes fda and pi to characterize cell survival in the rhizosphere area of the plant in applying fda pi mixed staining the fluorescent dye fluorescein diacetate fda will be decomposed by lipase once it enters the protoplast to produce a fluorescent polar substance therefore viable intact cells will produce green fluorescence whereas non viable protoplasts could not decompose fda and thus produce no fluorescence the fluorescent dye pi propidium iodide is a stain for dna and is commonly used for apoptosis detection pi releases red fluorescence upon intercalation in double stranded dna pi is often used with fda fluorescent dyes to stain both live and dead cells the plant rhizospheres were photographed with a nikon ordinary inverted fluorescence microscope the microscope image showed that when the pe concentration increased the green fluorescence of v natans gradually weakened and the red fluorescence gradually increased fig 4 a the rhizosphere system of v natans showed the most robust green fluorescence and the weakest red fluorescence in the system without pe when pe was 0 1 the green fluorescence of the central rhizosphere cells was the strongest the fluorescence of the cells near the root area weakened and red fluorescence appeared these fluorescence phenomena indicate that adding 0 1 pe to this micro ecosystem inactivates some root cells fig 4b in the 0 5 pe system the red fluorescence range increased and most of the root cells were inactivated fig 4c in the 1 pe group green fluorescence was the weakest fragmented fibrous agglomerations were observed in the root system moreover the rhizosphere system tended to rot and root cells were damaged fig 4d 3 1 3 effect on

removal was most prominent in 1 pe 1 mg l sa group fig s4 3 2 2 effect of pe sa combined pollution on sa degradation in water the sa concentration in the overlying water was highest in the 0 5 pe 1 mg l sa group the same results were observed for the sediment groups the residual sa concentration in the overlying water and sediment increased with increasing pe dosage this phenomenon indicates that sa enters the interior of v natans the migration and degradation of sa were also inhibited text si 10 fig s5 furthermore pe inhibits the degradation of sas in freshwater and affects their self repair ability huang et al 2022 zhu et al 2020 xu et al 2019 3 2 3 effect of pe sa on microbial community structure and diversity in water the 16s rrna gene profiling data from the water samples were calculated in the species composition database to identify the major species at the phylum fig 6 a and genus text si 11 fig s6 levels there were eight species proteobacteria bacteroidetes cyanobacteria verrucomicrobiota actinobacteria myxococcota deinococota and patescibacteria among them proteobacteria was the dominant flora the relative abundances of the different groups of 0 1 pe 0

sul1 and sul2 became more extensive when the combined pe sa pollution concentration increased fig 7 this result indicates that pe inhibited the adsorption and degradation of sa 3 3 impact of pe sa on sediment 3 3 1 effect on tn and npoc in sediment there was an interaction between pe and sa and the tn removal rate of sediments in different pe sa groups was significantly different f 330 619 p 0 01 the effect of combined pollution on the npoc content in sediments was also analyzed text si 12 fig s7 3 3 2 effect of pe sa on microbial community structure and diversity in sediment the phylogenetic classification of bacterial sequences from sediment samples is summarized at the phylum fig 8 and genus text si 13 fig s8 levels the results showed actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes

nitrogen f 1406 669 p 0 01 and nitrite nitrogen f 3078 652 p 0 01 in water were significantly different fig 9 a the nitrite nitrogen concentration showed an increasing trend with increasing composite pollution concentration nutrient values in sediment were also tested the ammonia nitrogen f 133 875 p 0 01 and nitrite nitrogen f 9 167 p 0 05 both had significant differences however there were no significant differences of nitrate nitrogen in sediment f 2 777 p 0 05 meanwhile there was an interaction between polyethylene and sulfanilamide the ammonia nitrogen f 4 317 p 0 05 and nitrite nitrogen f 14 109 p 0 01 in different concentration groups had significant differences fig 9b there was no significant difference in the concentration of nitrate nitrogen f 0 738 p 0 05 the nitrite nitrogen in different treatment groups had significant differences and the concentration was the lowest when the concentration was 0 5 pe 3 4 2 effects of pe sa on enzymes activity in nitrogen cycle system to explore the normal circulation process affecting nitrogen fibrous pe was added to the sediment the sa concentration in the sediment increased with increasing pe dosage and became enormous in the composite pollution the above result indicates that pe promotes the migration of sa from the overlying water to the sediment system because pe has an adsorption effect on sa text si 14 fig s9 this study further detected the related enzyme activities in the n cycle text si 15 fig s10 due to the presence of mps the nitrification process may be impeded by limited ammonia oxidation or nitrite oxidation however the denitrification rate improved mps acted as microorganism carriers hindered do absorption by sludge and formed an anaerobic atmosphere thus this process promotes denitrification

nitrogen content and sa concentration both pe 0 668 and sa 0 745 had a significant effect although the environmental factor sa had a more substantial impact than pe in conclusion pe and sa had a negative impact on the water plant sediment ecosystem in addition sa plays a critical role in the pe sa system fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 phenotypic plasticity of v natans in response to microplastics and sulfanilamide altered growth performance in disturbed habitats the current study results demonstrated that sulfanilamide could negatively affect the growth of v natans leaves are an essential organ for plant photosynthesis and when plants are under stress the photosynthesis efficiency will decrease inhibiting plant growth wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 fig 2 the main organ of v natans is the leaves and most chloroplasts are located in leaf cells previous studies indicated that mps have directly or indirectly affected the nutrients required for chlorophyll synthesis of plants by altering the nutrient cycles asselborn et al 2015 yang et al 2022b therefore the change of chlorophyll content in leaves affects the photosynthesis ability of the whole plant which plays a crucial role in the growth of v natans zhu et al 2015 less chlorophyll content will directly lead to the yellowing of leaves and it also reflects the damage to the chloroplast structure liu et al 2013 in this research under the adversity stress the photosynthetic efficiency and the chlorophyll content of v natans both showed a decreasing trend the content of pe can reflect plants growth and stress conditions wang et al 2011 this phenomenon demonstrated that sulfanilamide can reduce the synthesis of chl a chl b and total chl this was also observed in other studies they revealed that consistent with chlorophyll changes in v natans under tetracycline and organic pyrene stress liu et al 2013 sulfanilamide also have inhibitory effects on crucial enzymes in chlorophyll synthesis which maybe affect the synthesis of chlorophyll küpper et al 1996 chloroplasts emit strong autofluorescence the fluorescence intensity can be directly measured by laser confocal microscopy lscm or po the chloroplast autofluorescence intensity of different types of tobacco pollen is also different which is closely related to its growing environment and varieties juskaitis et al 1996 meyer et al 2003 reported that the ratio of its fluorescence intensity to the chloroplast fluorescence intensity could be used as a fluorescent probe to detect the leaf age of wheat plant rhizosphere s radial oxygen loss rol is a critical factor in forming a heterogeneous rhizosphere redox micro ecosystem chamberlain and adams 2006 and the rhizosphere diffusion layer forms a suitable living environment for microorganisms rol promotes the metabolic activities of microorganisms carballa et al 2007 the oxygen distribution of plant roots will change dynamically due to changes in the surrounding environment and the physiological activities of plant growth hussain et al 2012 po was used to find that the average autofluorescence intensity of rhizosphere epidermal cells reduced after v natans was grown in sa solution figs 3 4 according to the analysis of relevant data the autofluorescence detected by the experiments of v natans originates from chloroplasts boucher 2011 and its change process is closely related to the decrease of chlorophyll content the regulatory function of reactive oxygen species metabolism in plant cells is damaged in the adversity environment system under this stressful situation cells will increasingly produce free radicals prompting plants to undergo oxidative stress responses to adapt to adversity habitats o brien et al 2012 the process of oxidative stress leads to the accumulation of malondialdehyde this will eventually result in enzyme inactivation and impaired plasma membrane permeability the above process inhibits plant photosynthesis sharma et al 2012 our research demonstrated that after 21 days of pe sa stress the content of mda in leaves was significantly different from only pe groups p 0 05 fig 5 the combined pe sa pollution has a neutralizing effect on the impact of mda meyer et al 2003 the results observed that increases in mda concentrations in leaves indicate that the presence of pe triggered stress responses in v natans yang et al 2022a 2021 2020 excess reactive oxygen species ros could not be quickly reduced resulting in enhanced lipid peroxidation according to these findings 4 2 mps and sa have changed the structure and function of ecosystems on a small scale mps threaten aquatic plants health and affect the normal nitrogen cycle by colonizing microorganisms and through other means yang et al 2020 sediment is the most active site in the nitrogen cycle in wastewater the mps entering the water can settle in the sediment by colonizing microorganisms in the natural environment and then impact the structure and function of the sediment microbial community this effect can lead to the interference of mps with the nitrogen cycle fig 10 the primary ingredient limiting life on our planet is nitrogen which is a necessary component of all living organisms its accessibility depends on several processes involving nitrogen transforming microorganism this research revealed that the combined pollution stress of pe and sa could affect the removal of tn by microorganisms figs s4 and s7 moreover it affects the nitrogen cycle process of the micro ecosystem yin et al 2017 noted that thiamphenicol had an inhibitory effect on the denitrification rate and promoted n2o release in yangtze estuary sediments shan et al 2018 also demonstrated that tetracycline and sulfamethazine increased n2o release rates in rice sediments while decreasing denitrification anaerobic ammonia oxidation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium current research indicates that pe sa pollution has a positive effect on denitrification in the freshwater ecosystems enhanced denitrification can reduce the no 3 in the soil flowing into rivers and oceans owing to leaching and eliminate the toxic effect of nitric acid accumulation in organisms paul 2015 denitrification is an important process in which nitrogen returns to the atmosphere however the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen by denitrification also causes nitrogen fertilizer loss in the soil which is detrimental to agricultural production therefore in this study it influenced the nitrogen fixation ability of v natans the nitrogen cycle process includes biological nitrogen fixation nitrification ammonification denitrification and assimilation vogt et al 1995 microplastics primarily influence nitrogen transformation related bacteria enzyme activity and functional genes thereby affecting nitrification and denitrification processes microplastics can act as organic carbon substrates to promote the growth of related functional bacteria yang et al 2022a and accelerate denitrification and anammox processes in sediments microplastic can also change the structure and metabolic status of the microbial community and thereby have a significant impact on the carbon cycle in the agroecosystems zhou et al 2021 additionally mps have strong effects on key enzymes and functional genes in nitrification and thereby have a significant impact on the nitrogen cycle in the agroecosystems yang et al 2022b this confirms that mps can affect the nitrogen cycle process on earth posing a threat to ecosystem security the biofilm adhered to the surface of microplastics might increase the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen and nitrite in addition to the denitrification process according to the changing trend of enzyme activities involved in the nitrogen cycle plants need to absorb inorganic nitrogen as their nutrients to synthesize inorganic nitrogen such as plant proteins a microbial environment can be formed near the roots of plants which is conducive to the coexistence of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and provides a suitable environment for the survival of microorganisms thus the effect of microorganisms was enhanced and the removal efficiency of nitrogen from the water body was improved some studies have found that plants will absorb nitrogen in the ecosystem during the nitrogen removal process tang et al 2022 in this study after the 21 day experiment the nitrogen removal rate practically all exceeded 45 the average tn removal rates in the pe and pe sa groups reached 43 1 and 29 2 respectively sa is an antibiotic that inhibits the growth of gram positive and harmful bacteria microorganisms build intricate networks in nature that link the nitrogen transforming reactions args were enhanced by environmental stress these findings demonstrate that severe stress in sas causes a significant reduction in nucleotide bases which raises the chance of base pair mismatches during dna replication and transcription thereby increasing the frequency of mutations wang et al 2016 resistance to sa antibiotics is closely related to the presence of multiple nitrogen cycle genes this study also found firmicutes and proteobacteria in both water and sediment microbial samples figs 6 and 8 under the combined pollution stress of polyethylene and sulfanilamide the detected concentrations of sul1 and sul2 genes increasing pe concentration fig 7 this is consistent with the conclusion of huang et al 2019 that adding pvc pe and pva mps reconstructed the structure of resistant genes and increased the absolute abundance of the detection limit of resistant genes in sediments blau et al 2019 also reported that doxycycline added to manured soils and increased the abundance of genes conferring resistance to tetracyclines aminoglycosides and macrolides lincosamide streptogramin b args have inherent biological characteristics transfer and spread among different bacteria and exhibit unique environmental behaviors the transfer spread and persistent residues of resistant genes in the environment are the most harmful effects of antibiotics alekshun and levy 2007 the mechanism of bacteria resistance to sulfanilamide antibiotics is mainly based on the obtained expression products these products are mainly referring to sul1 sul2 and sul3 chen et al 2015 the detected concentrations of sul1 and sul2 detected in this study incteased with increasing pe dosages fig 7 therefore pe could inhibit the adsorption and degradation of sa in this freshwater ecosystems sul1 and sul2 can avoid the gene mutation of sulfanilamide against dihydropteroate synthase moreover they are the most common and args under the combined pollution stress of polyethylene and sulfanilamide chen et al 2015 nevertheless the effects of physicochemical properties on freshwater micro ecosystems should not be ignored this experiment also revealed that the addition of mps to the water plant sediment ecosystem decreased plant enzyme activity and nutrient turnover 5 conclusion growth traits nutrient elements radical oxygen loss and antioxidant capacity of v natans were significantly affected by the combined pe sa pollution systems this indicates that less sa entered the interior of v natans and pe inhibited the degradation of sa in this micro ecosystem the combined pe sa polluted environment inhibited the self repairing effects of v natans meanwhile the combined pe sa pollution stress will inhibited the generation of do in the rhizosphere of v natans however the combined pressure of polyethylene and sulfanilamide had no significant effect on the other indicators in the rhizospheres of v natans polyethylene and sulfanilamide affected the changes in nutrient elements in the overlying water and sediment the toxicity mechanism of sa in plants remains unclear it is recommended to study the specific mechanisms underlying the coexistence of mps and antibiotics in plants credit authorship

15399,microplastics mps can adsorb antibiotics to form complex pollutants which seriously threatens the health of freshwater ecosystems few studies have examined the combined pollution characteristics of microplastics mps and antibiotics in restored freshwater ecosystems and their effects on the growth traits of the aquatic primary producers we studied both the ecotoxicological effects of polyethylene pe mps and the antibiotics sulfanilamide sulfa sa on the structural diversity etc and functional nutrient cycling etc properties of water plant sediment ecosystems the synergistic toxic effects of pe and sa resulted in a reduction in the chlorophyll content and chloroplast fluorescence meanwhile pe and sa single combined pollution stress inhibits the radial oxygen loss in roots and activates the antioxidant defense system in leaves the change in the growth response characteristics of vallisneria natans v natans under oxidative stress induced by single combined pollution showed a dosage effect the microbial compositions of the overlying water and sediment were significantly changed by the pollution exposure as evidenced by the increased microbial diversity and altered microbial taxa distribution an increase in the total concentrations of sulfa in the overlying water was accompanied by an increase in the relative abundances of resistance genes pe mps significantly affected the removal of total nitrogen and antibiotics from the overlying water the interaction between pe and sa affects ammonia and nitrite nitrogen exchange in water sediment systems thus this study investigated the effects of combined mp and antibiotics pollution on the growth state metabolic function microbial community structure and microbial diversity of the freshwater ecosystems the mechanism underlying of the combined polyethylene sulfanilamide pe sa effect on the v natans was revealed in addition the correlation between different environmental factors was analyzed and a structural equation model was constructed this study provides primary data for evaluating the ecological and environmental effects of combined pe sa pollution and its possible risks moreover it

natans data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastics are widely used in various fields as a new class of materials owing to their low density low thermal conductivity low electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance huang et al 2020a in 2018 the world s total plastic production was 359 million tons with china s plastic production reaching 108 million tons wagner et al 2014 low recycling rates and improper handling of plastic wastes has led to their accumulation of plastic in the environment as a new type of pollutant the global environmental problems caused by microplastics mps are becoming increasingly serious ivleva et al 2017 mps have a small particle size 5 μm therefore they are easily absorbed by plants and biologically ingested into the body thereby affecting the biological systems of living organisms in terms of morphology and metabolism characteristics huang et al 2020b in addition mps have a large specific surface area which facilitates the adsorption of pollutants from the surrounding environment and become the carrier of pollutant transmission mps can accumulate migrate and be transferred into organisms hanslik et al 2020 which directly or indirectly affects the ecosystem structure and function xu et al 2019 and changes biological growth and reproductive behaviors sharma et al 2020 mps can disrupt ecosystem services such as biogeochemical processes by altering the abiotic features of substrates such as soil permeability and interfering with important ecosystem functions such as interspecific competition prata et al 2021 antibiotics have also been considered relatively new threats to the environment they are metabolites produced by microorganisms including bacteria fungi and actinomycetes and have anti pathogenic or other activities zhu et al 2020 they can inhibit or interfere with the immune system and are used in many fields to treat various diseases caused by specific microorganisms chen et al 2019 however the overuse of antibiotics has increased their emissions into the aquatic environments posing potential pollution risks to freshwater ecosystems antibiotics are usually attenuated by abiotic actions adsorption hydrolysis photolysis or biotic actions but most types of antibiotics eg sulfanilamide sa are not susceptible to degradation yu et al 2019 more than 85 of antibiotics exist in environmental media in the form of antigens or other active metabolites causing soil and water pollution delgado et al 2010 although antibiotics are present at relatively low concentrations ng l to µg l in the natural environment long term antibiotic exposure poses significant risks to animal plant and human health milh et al 2021 for instance oxytetracycline affects duckweed based phytoremediation systems such as oxidative stress nutrient production and microorganisms metabolic activity hu et al 2021 they can also cause the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistant genes args wang et al 2022 in addition to the inherent toxicity of plastic particles the interaction of microplastics with coexisting pollutants may affect bioaccumulation bioavailability and degradation of pollutants ma et al 2016 a wide variety of contaminants are present in water so it is not enough to study one single microplastic affecting living things potential toxicological interactions are of serious concern when organisms simultaneously face environments where microplastics and other pollutants coexist microplastics high specific surface area and water transport properties facilitate the adsorption of chemicals to the plastic surface which can lead to the accumulation of contaminants on its surface including heavy metals endocrine disrupting chemicals and persistent organic pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs from the marine environment the combined toxic effect of pollutants and microplastics on aquatic organisms is a currently controversial issue some researchers pointed out that the possibility of organisms exposure to contaminants via microplastics is negligible compared with exposure to contaminants via other routes water food intake and other suspended particulate matter such as organic matter koelmans et al 2016 in addition many studies have confirmed that organisms can ingest pollutants through mps but the toxic effects are still being explored for instance some representative contaminants such as pcbs brominated flame retardants perfluorinated compounds and methylmercury have been selected to study their combined toxic effects with mps microplastics alone did not affect aquatic organisms under experimental conditions nevertheless the combined effects of microplastics and adsorbed pollutants significantly altered the homeostasis of aquatic organisms compared with the exposure to contaminants alone rainieri et al 2018 thus the impact of antibiotics on aquatic environmental organisms cannot be ignored macrophytes play a key functional role in aquatic ecosystems and provide services to humans prančl et al 2014 macrophytes can influence ecological processes such as nutrient cycling and maintain the health of aquatic ecosystems by releasing oxygen li et al 2021 studies have shown that the combined action of mps and antibiotics can pose a greater threat to the ecological environment than a single source of pollution fu et al 2022 however hitherto the toxicological effects of mps and antibiotics and their removal by freshwater micro ecosystems remain poorly elucidated therefore the main objectives of the present study were to i explore the antioxidant defense mechanisms photosynthetic systems and radial oxygen losses of submerged plants under different concentrations of polyethylene microplastics pe mps and sulfanilamide sa ii study the effects of single combined pollution on microbial community structure and resistant gene abundance and iii assess the impact of the two pollutants on nutrient cycling processes wate plant sediment in freshwater micro ecosystems the significance of this study is to clarify the effects of pe mps and sa on aquatic vascular plants and provides new opportunities to develop control strategies to reduce the toxicological effects of mps and antibiotics on freshwater ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the submerged plant vallisneria natans v natans is widely distributed worldwide in various habitats such as rivers lakes and wetlands making it a good candidate for observation in this study 29 03 n 112

consumption moreover pe in the natural environment usually exists in the shape of fibers fu and wang 2019 and the characteristics of the detected microplastics showed that small size usually 2 mm and transparency were the most common features in freshwater ecosystems deng et al 2021 qian et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 kanhai et al 2020 for this study pe mps 2 mm were purchased from chemical materials

v natans 3 1 1 effects of pe sa on plant photosynthesis the results showed that sa significantly affected the chlorophyll content of v natans under combined polyethylene sulfanilamide pe sa pollution stress there was an interaction between pe and sa and the total chlorophyll content differed significantly f 161 596 p 0 01 this significant difference was most apparent when the concentration combination was 0 5 pe 1 mg l sa the results showed that the autofluorescence intensity of chloroplasts exposed to 1 mg l sa 1 pe and 1 pe 1 mg l sa decreased p 0 05 fig 2 d cell damage chloroplast disorder and chloroplast damage were observed in these three systems 3 1 2 radial oxygen loss of rhizosphere in v natans po is based on the rhizosphere to the specific excitation light on the photochemical sensing film to measure the rhizosphere oxygen concentration the fluorescence intensity of po gradually decreased fig 3 indicating that rhizosphere do showed a downward trend both mps and sa inhibited do generation the effect of 0 5 pe and 1 mg l sa was the greatest it was observed that under the single stress of pe the rhizosphere fluorescence weakened under single sa stress the fluorescence was not uniform and the cells were damaged however the fluorescence change was the most obvious when the plant was in a combined pe sa environment the proportion of do during the daytime was lower on the same day than at night text si 8 fig s2 v natans was stained with the fluorescent dyes fda and pi to characterize cell survival in the rhizosphere area of the plant in applying fda pi mixed staining the fluorescent dye fluorescein diacetate fda will be decomposed by lipase once it enters the protoplast to produce a fluorescent polar substance therefore viable intact cells will produce green fluorescence whereas non viable protoplasts could not decompose fda and thus produce no fluorescence the fluorescent dye pi propidium iodide is a stain for dna and is commonly used for apoptosis detection pi releases red fluorescence upon intercalation in double stranded dna pi is often used with fda fluorescent dyes to stain both live and dead cells the plant rhizospheres were photographed with a nikon ordinary inverted fluorescence microscope the microscope image showed that when the pe concentration increased the green fluorescence of v natans gradually weakened and the red fluorescence gradually increased fig 4 a the rhizosphere system of v natans showed the most robust green fluorescence and the weakest red fluorescence in the system without pe when pe was 0 1 the green fluorescence of the central rhizosphere cells was the strongest the fluorescence of the cells near the root area weakened and red fluorescence appeared these fluorescence phenomena indicate that adding 0 1 pe to this micro ecosystem inactivates some root cells fig 4b in the 0 5 pe system the red fluorescence range increased and most of the root cells were inactivated fig 4c in the 1 pe group green fluorescence was the weakest fragmented fibrous agglomerations were observed in the root system moreover the rhizosphere system tended to rot and root cells were damaged fig 4d 3 1 3 effect on antioxidant capacity under the combined pollution stress of pe and sa sa had a significant effect on mda f 7 534 p 0 05 two way analysis of variance anova of mda levels was not statistically significant compared to the control group mda increased but there was no significant difference between the various pollution concentration groups f 0 398 p 0 05 however there were significant differences in cat activity under different concentrations of pe sa f 6 562 p 0 01 cat activity was the lowest in the 1 pe 1 mg l sa group under pe sa combined stress the sod was significantly different between the pe f 3287 467 p 0 01 and pe sa groups f 9096 451 p 0 01 when the compound pollution was 0 1 pe and 1 mg l sa the pod activity reached its maximum fig 5 there was significant variability in the pod activity f 30 959 p 0 01 3 2 impact of pe sa on water properties 3 2 1 effect of pe sa on water properties sa had a significant effect on do electrical conductivity and ph text si 9 fig s3 and the differences were largest when the composite concentration was 1 pe 1 mg l sa f 9 905 p 0 05 f 5855 625 p 0 01 and f 253 057 p 0 01 respectively the total nitrogen removal tn f 11 066 p 0 01 and non purgeable organic carbon npoc f 126 166 p 0 01 content in different concentrations of pe and sa treatment groups were significantly different the significant difference of tn removal was most prominent in 1 pe 1 mg l sa group fig s4 3 2 2 effect of pe sa combined pollution on sa degradation in water the sa concentration in the overlying water was highest in the 0 5 pe 1 mg l sa group the same results were observed for the sediment groups the residual sa concentration in the overlying water and sediment increased with increasing pe dosage this phenomenon indicates that sa enters the interior of v natans the migration and degradation of sa were also inhibited text si 10 fig s5 furthermore pe inhibits the degradation of sas in freshwater and affects their self repair ability huang et al 2022 zhu et al 2020 xu et al 2019 3 2 3 effect of pe sa on microbial community structure and diversity in water the 16s rrna gene profiling data from the water samples were calculated in the species composition database to identify the major species at the phylum fig 6 a and genus text si 11 fig s6 levels there were eight species proteobacteria bacteroidetes cyanobacteria verrucomicrobiota actinobacteria myxococcota deinococota and patescibacteria among them proteobacteria was the dominant flora the relative abundances of the different groups of 0 1 pe 0 pe 1 mg l sa and 0 1 pe 1 mg l sa were 80 09 82 83 and 77 38 respectively the venn results revealed 82 common species in all groups fig 6b 3 2 4 effect of pe sa on args the detected concentrations of sul1 and sul2 became more extensive when the combined pe sa pollution concentration increased fig 7 this result indicates that pe inhibited the adsorption and degradation of sa 3 3 impact of pe sa on sediment 3 3 1 effect on tn and npoc in sediment there was an interaction between pe and sa and the tn removal rate of sediments in different pe sa groups was significantly different f 330 619 p 0 01 the effect of combined pollution on the npoc content in sediments was also analyzed text si 12 fig s7 3 3 2 effect of pe sa on microbial community structure and diversity in sediment the phylogenetic classification of bacterial sequences from sediment samples is summarized at the phylum fig 8 and genus text si 13 fig s8 levels the results showed actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes desulfobacterota proteobacteria myxococcota chloroflexi cyanobacteria and acidobacteriota in all samples fig 8a among these actinobacteria was the most widely represented phylum the top three relative abundances of 32 74 30 78 and 31 92 were achieved in the 0 1 pe 0 5 pe and 0 1 pe 1 mg l sa sample groups respectively 3 4 impact of pe sa on water plant sediment system 3 4 1 effect of pe sa on nutrient exchange there was no significant difference in ammonia nitrogen concentration in the water samples among the pe sa treatment groups f 1 898 p 0 05 however the concentrations of nitrate nitrogen f 1406 669 p 0 01 and nitrite nitrogen f 3078 652 p 0 01 in water were significantly different fig 9 a the nitrite nitrogen concentration showed an increasing trend with increasing composite pollution concentration nutrient values in sediment were also tested the ammonia nitrogen f 133 875 p 0 01 and nitrite nitrogen f 9 167 p 0 05 both had significant differences however there were no significant differences of nitrate nitrogen in sediment f 2 777 p 0 05 meanwhile there was an interaction between polyethylene and sulfanilamide the ammonia nitrogen f 4 317 p 0 05 and nitrite nitrogen f 14 109 p 0 01 in different concentration groups had significant differences fig 9b there was no significant difference in the concentration of nitrate nitrogen f 0 738 p 0 05 the nitrite nitrogen in different treatment groups had significant differences and the concentration was the lowest when the concentration was 0 5 pe 3 4 2 effects of pe sa on enzymes activity in nitrogen cycle system to explore the normal circulation process affecting nitrogen fibrous pe was added to the sediment the sa concentration in the sediment increased with increasing pe dosage and became enormous in the composite pollution the above result indicates that pe promotes the migration of sa from the overlying water to the sediment system because pe has an adsorption effect on sa text si 14 fig s9 this study further detected the related enzyme activities in the n cycle text si 15 fig s10 due to the presence of mps the nitrification process may be impeded by limited ammonia oxidation or nitrite oxidation however the denitrification rate improved mps acted as microorganism carriers hindered do absorption by sludge and formed an anaerobic atmosphere thus this process promotes denitrification fig 10 3 4 3 pearson correlation analysis of environmental factors under the combined pollution stress after performing a one way anova on the environmental factors a combination of indicators with

micro ecosystem a pearson correlation analysis was performed on the environmental factors and the matrix is listed in text si 16 the correlation results are presented in figures s11 and s12 3 4 4 model analysis of the structural equation in the micro ecosystem plant indicators were selected according to the degree of effect chlorophyll b rgr plant height total chlorophyll content chlorophyll a fw and dw were selected as the environmental factors the overlying water index was significantly affected by combined pe sa pollution 0 951 all overlying water indicators were selected as significant influencing factors the index content was positively affected in descending order args2 sul2 nitrite nitrogen args1 sul1 tn npoc and sa concentrations the do was negatively affected sediment indicators were significantly affected by compound pollution 0 904 the sediment indicators were all selected as significant influencing factors among which the most affected factors were ammonia nitrogen content and sa concentration both pe 0 668 and sa 0 745 had a significant effect although the environmental factor sa had a more substantial impact than pe in conclusion pe and sa had a negative impact on the water plant sediment ecosystem in addition sa plays a critical role in the pe sa system fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 phenotypic plasticity of v natans in response to microplastics and sulfanilamide altered growth performance in disturbed habitats the current study results demonstrated that sulfanilamide could negatively affect the growth of v natans leaves are an essential organ for plant photosynthesis and when plants are under stress the photosynthesis efficiency will decrease inhibiting plant growth wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 fig 2 the main organ of v natans is the leaves and most chloroplasts are located in leaf cells previous studies indicated that mps have directly or indirectly affected the nutrients required for chlorophyll synthesis of plants by altering the nutrient cycles asselborn et al 2015 yang et al 2022b therefore the change of chlorophyll content in leaves affects the photosynthesis ability of the whole plant which plays a crucial role in the growth of v natans zhu et al 2015 less chlorophyll content will directly lead to the yellowing of leaves and it also reflects the damage to the chloroplast structure liu et al 2013 in this research under the adversity stress the photosynthetic efficiency and the chlorophyll content of v natans both showed a decreasing trend the content of pe can reflect plants growth and stress conditions wang et al 2011 this phenomenon demonstrated that sulfanilamide can reduce the synthesis of chl a chl b and total chl this was also observed in other studies they revealed that consistent with chlorophyll changes in v natans under tetracycline and organic pyrene stress liu et al 2013 sulfanilamide also have inhibitory effects on crucial enzymes in chlorophyll synthesis which maybe affect the synthesis of chlorophyll küpper et al 1996 chloroplasts emit strong autofluorescence the fluorescence intensity can be directly measured by laser confocal microscopy lscm or po the chloroplast autofluorescence intensity of different types of tobacco pollen is also different which is closely related to its growing environment and varieties juskaitis et al 1996 meyer et al 2003 reported that the ratio of its fluorescence intensity to the chloroplast fluorescence intensity could be used as a fluorescent probe to detect the leaf age of wheat plant rhizosphere s radial oxygen loss rol is a critical factor in forming a heterogeneous rhizosphere redox micro ecosystem chamberlain and adams 2006 and the rhizosphere diffusion layer forms a suitable living environment for microorganisms rol promotes the metabolic activities of microorganisms carballa et al 2007 the oxygen distribution of plant roots will change dynamically due to changes in the surrounding environment and the physiological activities of plant growth hussain et al 2012 po was used to find that the average autofluorescence intensity of rhizosphere epidermal cells reduced after v natans was grown in sa solution figs 3 4 according to the analysis of relevant data the autofluorescence detected by the experiments of v natans originates from chloroplasts boucher 2011 and its change process is closely related to the decrease of chlorophyll content the regulatory function of reactive oxygen species metabolism in plant cells is damaged in the adversity environment system under this stressful situation cells will increasingly produce free radicals prompting plants to undergo oxidative stress responses to adapt to adversity habitats o brien et al 2012 the process of oxidative stress leads to the accumulation of malondialdehyde this will eventually result in enzyme inactivation and impaired plasma membrane permeability the above process inhibits plant photosynthesis sharma et al 2012 our research demonstrated that after 21 days of pe sa stress the content of mda in leaves was significantly different from only pe groups p 0 05 fig 5 the combined pe sa pollution has a neutralizing effect on the impact of mda meyer et al 2003 the results observed that increases in mda concentrations in leaves indicate that the presence of pe triggered stress responses in v natans yang et al 2022a 2021 2020 excess reactive oxygen species ros could not be quickly reduced resulting in enhanced lipid peroxidation according to these findings 4 2 mps and sa have changed the structure and function of ecosystems on a small scale mps threaten aquatic plants health and affect the normal nitrogen cycle by colonizing microorganisms and through other means yang et al 2020 sediment is the most active site in the nitrogen cycle in wastewater the mps entering the water can settle in the sediment by colonizing microorganisms in the natural environment and then impact the structure and function of the sediment microbial community this effect can lead to the interference of mps with the nitrogen cycle fig 10 the primary ingredient limiting life on our planet is nitrogen which is a necessary component of all living organisms its accessibility depends on several processes involving nitrogen transforming microorganism this research revealed that the combined pollution stress of pe and sa could affect the removal of tn by microorganisms figs s4 and s7 moreover it affects the nitrogen cycle process of the micro ecosystem yin et al 2017 noted that thiamphenicol had an inhibitory effect on the denitrification rate and promoted n2o release in yangtze estuary sediments shan et al 2018 also demonstrated that tetracycline and sulfamethazine increased n2o release rates in rice sediments while decreasing denitrification anaerobic ammonia oxidation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium current research indicates that pe sa pollution has a positive effect on denitrification in the freshwater ecosystems enhanced denitrification can reduce the no 3 in the soil flowing into rivers and oceans owing to leaching and eliminate the toxic effect of nitric acid accumulation in organisms paul 2015 denitrification is an important process in which nitrogen returns to the atmosphere however the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen by denitrification also causes nitrogen fertilizer loss in the soil which is detrimental to agricultural production therefore in this study it influenced the nitrogen fixation ability of v natans the nitrogen cycle process includes biological nitrogen fixation nitrification ammonification denitrification and assimilation vogt et al 1995 microplastics primarily influence nitrogen transformation related bacteria enzyme activity and functional genes thereby affecting nitrification and denitrification processes microplastics can act as organic carbon substrates to promote the growth of related functional bacteria yang et al 2022a and accelerate denitrification and anammox processes in sediments microplastic can also change the structure and metabolic status of the microbial community and thereby have a significant impact on the carbon cycle in the agroecosystems zhou et al 2021 additionally mps have strong effects on key enzymes and functional genes in nitrification and thereby have a significant impact on the nitrogen cycle in the agroecosystems yang et al 2022b this confirms that mps can affect the nitrogen cycle process on earth posing a threat to ecosystem security the biofilm adhered to the surface of microplastics might increase the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen and nitrite in addition to the denitrification process according to the changing trend of enzyme activities involved in the nitrogen cycle plants need to absorb inorganic nitrogen as their nutrients to synthesize inorganic nitrogen such as plant proteins a microbial environment can be formed near the roots of plants which is conducive to the coexistence of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and provides a suitable environment for the survival of microorganisms thus the effect of microorganisms was enhanced and the removal efficiency of nitrogen from the water body was improved some studies have found that plants will absorb nitrogen in the ecosystem during the nitrogen removal process tang et al 2022 in this study after the 21 day experiment the nitrogen removal rate practically all exceeded 45 the average tn removal rates in the pe and pe sa groups reached 43 1 and 29 2 respectively sa is an antibiotic that inhibits the growth of gram positive and harmful bacteria microorganisms build intricate networks in nature that link the nitrogen transforming reactions args were enhanced by environmental stress these findings demonstrate that severe stress in sas causes a significant reduction in nucleotide bases which raises the chance of base pair mismatches during dna replication and transcription thereby increasing the frequency of mutations wang et al 2016 resistance to sa antibiotics is closely related to the presence of multiple nitrogen cycle genes this study also found firmicutes and proteobacteria in both water and sediment microbial samples figs 6 and 8 under the combined pollution stress of polyethylene and sulfanilamide the detected concentrations of sul1 and sul2 genes increasing pe concentration fig 7 this is consistent with the conclusion of huang et al 2019 that adding pvc pe and pva mps reconstructed the structure of resistant genes and increased the absolute abundance of the detection limit of resistant genes in sediments blau et al 2019 also reported that doxycycline added to manured soils and increased the abundance of genes conferring resistance to tetracyclines aminoglycosides and macrolides lincosamide streptogramin b args have inherent biological characteristics transfer and spread among different bacteria and exhibit unique environmental behaviors the transfer spread and persistent residues of resistant genes in the environment are the most harmful effects of antibiotics alekshun and levy 2007 the mechanism of bacteria resistance to sulfanilamide antibiotics is mainly based on the obtained expression products these products are mainly referring to sul1 sul2 and sul3 chen et al 2015 the detected concentrations of sul1 and sul2 detected in this study incteased with increasing pe dosages fig 7 therefore pe could inhibit the adsorption and degradation of sa in this freshwater ecosystems sul1 and sul2 can avoid the gene mutation of sulfanilamide against dihydropteroate synthase moreover they are the most common and args under the combined pollution stress of polyethylene and sulfanilamide chen et al 2015 nevertheless the effects of physicochemical properties on freshwater micro ecosystems should not be ignored this experiment also revealed that the addition of mps to the water plant sediment ecosystem decreased plant enzyme activity and nutrient turnover 5 conclusion growth traits nutrient elements radical oxygen loss and antioxidant capacity of v natans were significantly affected by the combined pe sa pollution systems this indicates that less sa entered the interior of v natans and pe inhibited the degradation of sa in this micro ecosystem the combined pe sa polluted environment inhibited the self repairing effects of v natans meanwhile the combined pe sa pollution stress will inhibited the generation of do in the rhizosphere of v natans however the combined pressure of polyethylene and sulfanilamide had no significant effect on the other indicators in the rhizospheres of v natans polyethylene and sulfanilamide affected the changes in nutrient elements in the overlying water and sediment the toxicity mechanism of sa in plants remains unclear it is recommended to study the specific mechanisms underlying the coexistence of mps and antibiotics in plants credit authorship
