1610,drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting different aspects of human life and the environment due to water scarcity prediction of water quality reduction is very crucial for urban and rural communities this study contributes by applying artificial neural network and modified fuzzy clustering techniques to estimate the drops in potential drinking water quality in the gis environment in this research the probability of occurrence of adverse annual changes in the water quality of drinking water is estimated the model was tested using real instances of the southeast aquifers the regions of the central parts of the iran and especially the significant portions of the aquifers of the east area to validate the model the data adequacy test and the standardization of the drought index are used the results of the lowest available water quality and the highest drought using anns show that the qualitative stress conditions in large part of the country s aquifers are in unfavorable conditions evidence from this research shows that the aquifers in these areas are expected to have severe drought stress and poor quality class status also the computational results indicate that the modified clustering method increases the efficiency of the prediction model as against the previous research the outcomes do not show a relatively favorable state of drinking water quality for some aquifers in the country however the conditions for quantitative changes in the depth of water based on the predicted results of ann are considered critical the generated maps demonstrate that about 64 of the study area is subjected to a severe deterioration in the quality of drinking water if the current trend continues in the exploitation of aquifers as a result the main finding the present study is that the probability of groundwater quality decline is significant in many aquifers in the country keywords artificial neural network water quality prediction radial basis function link neural network fuzzy clustering 1 introduction the awareness of the future status of water resources especially in standard drinking water classes is essential for urban and rural communities eberhard and hamawand 2017 water resource managers often need to determine the uncertainty and changes in the system performance values due to any alteration in input data and the values of possible parameters that are predicted they have to modulate this level of uncertainty for the development of applied engineering designs srivastava et al 2012 among natural disasters drought has a significant impact on different aspects of human life jalalkamali et al 2015 drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting various aspects of human life and the environment drought can be categorized in numerous ways based on the nature of the water shortage different types of droughts can be defined hydrological meteorological socio economical and agricultural in the present study the drought is defined mainly based on hydrological aspects drought is a naturally recurring phenomenon in different climatic areas drought is commonly observed to be an extended period with suggestively lower rainfall relative to standard levels or amplified evaporative demand or a mixture of both conditions drought is a complex and multi dimensional natural hazard described by duration intensity magnitude of severity and the ecological or the water resource point of view during the last decades the application of artificial intelligent techniques has recognized as practical forecasting approaches of natural phenomena barzegar et al 2016 one of the solutions for developing and expanding relationships in future situations is artificial intelligence artificial neural networks anns and fuzzy clustering are the central part of this study which identifies the intricate patterns of drought in this study the decline in groundwater quality and the probability of a decline in groundwater quality based on its relationship with the occurrence of droughts reduction of water level in aquifers are predicted using anns and fuzzy clustering methods artificial neural networks generally have three steps to find solutions and solve a problem which includes training generalization and run dayhoff and deleo 2001 training is a process through which the network learns to recognize the pattern of inputs as a set of training data in this way the data entered into the nerve unit after being combined with the network weights it comes to the cell body and starts data processing or training and eventually exit from the nerve unit after the outputs calculated these values compared with target values and if there is a difference between these values new weights are set and training is repeated this process is repeated as long as the difference between the output values of the network and the high target values is not within the specified range the purpose of the present study is to extract the spatial distribution map of the probability of adverse changes in the quality index of groundwater resources based on the occurrence of drought to calculate the likelihood of underground water quality deterioration in the country s plains it was first necessary to use a digitized observation source to determine the potential quality of drinking water in the gis environment according to the schuler and world health organization who standards for this purpose by fitting the best zoning model and comparing the standard errors the raster layer was obtained from the qualitative potential assessment index the five primary input parameters including total hardness th total dissolved solids tds na cl so4 are used to calculate the groundwater quality potential these parameters are in the form of input raster layers the output of the model is a single lattice layer in which the probability values in each cell would determine the chance of occurrence for all three prediction methods to calculate the groundwater resource index gri the standard cultivars of drought classes will be obtained for all 11 383 wells of iranian aquifers the gri stands for an index that specifies water quality in aquifers used for drinkable supply and is based on primary and secondary groundwater standards or guidance levels the gri criteria are surpassed when more than 10 of wells are above a groundwater maximum contaminant limit mcl or guidance concentration limit gcl in the present study the continuous layer of gri will be obtained through the geostatistical tool the selection of the optimal zoning method is based on a comparison between the normal samples produced during the years 1994 to 2015 2 background several studies have been carried out on the use of artificial intelligence techniques e g neural networks valipour 2016 the meta heuristic algorithm hassannayebi et al 2018 and machine learning holloway et al 2018 in engineering and environment problems yang et al 2009 showed that the predictive accuracy of the artificial neural network is superior compared to the integrated time series models chandramouli et al 2007 provided a benchmark for determining the number of repetitions for the training of post propagation neural networks this study showed that training much or less than the amount could lead to passing through the appropriate amount or failing to get the optimal response to determine the relationship between input and output data banerjee et al 2009 used a predictive artificial neural network as a method for predicting groundwater levels which gave satisfactory results mohanty et al 2010 used an artificial neural network model for predicting groundwater levels and it was found that although groundwater surface prediction accuracy decreases with increasing the examination period the underground water level prediction is more acceptable for the extended period jalalkamali et al 2015 used the artificial neural network to predict drought and rainfall index for the years 1961 2002 sakizadeh 2016 have used anns for predicting the water quality index wqi over the years 2006 to 2013 banerjee et al 2011 suggested an artificial neural skeleton model as an alternative to predict the salinity of groundwater hosseini moghari et al 2015 used the fuzzy water quality index fwqi method to assess groundwater quality according to the water quality index shamsuddin et al 2017 used an ann model for predicting groundwater levels in two vertical wells in the aquifer area near the langat river according to the results of this study accurate forecasts can be made with time series one day ahead of the predictive levels of groundwater and interactions between the river and the aquifer the findings of this study can be used to assist policy makers in managing groundwater resources using the river bank infiltration rbi method supreetha et al 2015 examined the ability of a hybrid ann model and genetic algorithm ga to predict groundwater levels of several observation wells the groundwater level for a ten year period and rainfall data were used during the same period for model training the study showed that the ann ga model could successfully be used to predict groundwater levels in observation areas additionally the comparative study showed that the combined ann ga model is more effective than the traditional ann back propagation approach golchin and moghaddam 2016 conducted an assessment analysis of hydro geochemical characteristics and groundwater quality in an aquifer in iran for this purpose the chemical properties of more than twenty wells were evaluated to characterize the hydro geochemical processes in the region according to the obtained results the most dominant classes are discovered as c4 s4 c4 s3 and c3 s2 nourani 2017 implemented the emotional ann eann as a new generation of artificial intelligence based models for modeling the daily rainfall runoff r r prediction of the basin a general comparison of the results of the eann against feed forward neural networks ffnn showed that the training and productivity measures were superior up to 13 and 34 respectively ahmad et al 2017 designed a dynamic prediction method for the estimation of water quality by excluding the biological and chemical oxygen demands the outcomes show that the combination of multiple neural networks forward selection and backward elimination can further enhance the performance and accuracy of the prediction model the generated result has the higher accuracy in terms of r2 and mean squared error mse of 93 and 11 5 respectively qaderi and babanejad 2017 developed an ann based forecasting model to study the groundwater quality which results in the accurate prediction of the costs of drinking water treatment according to the obtained results the ann structured with three hidden layers and 18 neurons was the best performing model which results in cost reduction by about 150 000 dollars daily sahoo et al 2017 proposed bayesian and entropy methods for water quality assessment the aggregative index evaluation method was implemented to calculate water quality index in the brahmani river the trends in water quality indicators were predicted using bayes rule the outcomes indicated that the wqi was enhanced during dry periods than during wet periods as a result of the reduction of pollutants previous studies on the use of ann and time series in quantitative predictions of water resources have been limited to specific areas e g an aquifer in this research the aim is to predict the variation of spatial parameters of a large area using gis tools by the radial basis function link neural network rbfln probabilistic neural networks pnn and fuzzy logic clustering flc calculations besides the sensitivity of the effect of changes in water level concerning water quality changes in different areas 609 study areas of the country has been analyzed in this study as a new approach we use the classification efficiency index as well as the cumulative area posterior probability capp curve of the region for deductive validation as one of the significant achievements of this paper a continuous map of the prediction of the probability of a decline in groundwater quality can be applied to the development of integrated decision making and integrated water resource management models the article is organized as follows the description of the material and method is given in section 4 section 5 presents the methodology and data analysis approach the results of empirical experiments are provided and interpreted in section 6 conclusion and suggestions for further research are drawn in section 7 3 materials and methods the study area is about the extent of iran 25 to 40 degrees north latitude and 44 to 64 degrees east longitude and the zoning is based on 609 plains of the country with an approximate area of 567 828 km2 fig 1 the situation includes climate change in warm and dry regions in the middle to wet and overcast regions of the northern areas also the unique geological structure and type of each aquifer are enclosed to half free and fully open the natural condition simultaneously makes all aquifers impossible in areas with higher population density like the western regions of iran underground aquifers are directly affected by human factors quantitative changes followed by the quality of aquifer feeding waters while in the eastern and central regions generally surface currents so much on underground water fig 1 shows the position of iran s plains and simultaneously the position of aquifers in iran the research methods include rbfln pnn and flc besides the arcsdm extension was used as a fuzzy logic tool in a geographic information system environment and geoxplore program the probability of occurrence of adverse annual changes in different classes of drinking water quality is estimated accordingly the calculations were based on the extraction of the water quality potential layer using geographical information system and according to the schuler and who standards in brief the choice of research techniques relies on these specifics reasons recent literature reviews indicated that artificial intelligent methods specifically the ann and pnn have been successfully used for water resources variable modeling and prediction see e g dou et al 2018 rbf and pnn methods are used as complementary computational methods and for obtaining results with the least error value another primary reason is the impossibility of verifying the output of a computational model for spatial models as a result validation was done using parallel methods the fuzzy ann method provides a process for standard computing layers in the gis environment based on fuzzy functions the use of these items was entirely based on the sources mentioned in the article s text as a research method in this way the consistency of the outputs of these methods made it possible to compare the estimates 3 1 fuzzy clustering clustering a set of components by a learning system based on their characteristic vector is a powerful tool for gaining knowledge based on observations stored in data files milligan and hirtle 2003 given a collection of vector properties in a self organization process they are converted into classes with similar values of properties with a process of divisive or down to top clustering a class can also be set up under a supervised training process in which an input vector is labeled and process parameters until the output is learned for each input vector consistent with the target output suppose a set of property vectors q x q q 1 q which is converted to k clusters ck k 1 k for kth cluster ck is a sample determined by c k the dimensional of the component vector x q x1 q xn q and the centers c k c1 k cn k equals to n the feature vectors are standardized independently in each section and so the vectors are in the n dimensional cube 0 1 n hub shaped vectors do not have a uniform distribution of cluster structure milligan 1996 however if sets of vectors fall into multiple subsets these subsets are compressed around their distribution centers then they are in a strong clustering structure it will be accepted that such clustering is organized and properly disassociated the measurement of cluster validity provides the value of clustering superiority pal and bezdek 1995 xie and beni 1991 some general measures for cluster validity are partition coefficients pcs classification entropy ces and proportional exponent pe uniform distribution functional udf is another criterion pointed out by xie and beni 1991 udf is a product of compactness and separation the relative compression separation coefficient for a larger number of k is defined as 1 1 v 1 k k 1 k σ k 2 d min 2 σ k 2 q 1 q w kq x q c k 2 k 1 k where d min is at least distance between the samples center of the cluster and σ k 2 is the fuzzy variance of the weight of the k th cluster the larger d min means a lower cross reference each σ k 2 is smaller for compact clusters consequently the lower value of v means more compression and separation in measuring the xie beni fuzzy validity only the members of each cluster are changed instead of all q samples for each cluster it is also mutually k 1 v so a larger value of k represents a better clustering and k is a measure of the xie beni cluster s validity the weighted fuzzy expected value wfev is defined as a set of real values of x1 xp as a sample value representing a comprehensive representation of medium or intermediate categories schneider and craig 1992 this is done exponentially with the use of two sided reduction and dip but in this calculation instead of the tangent the shape of the gaussian function is used in eq 3 the reason is that a membership function is a conventional fuzzy set for the near center variable after calculating the arithmetic mean μ 0 of a set of real values x1 xp is used as the value of the primary center so that to obtain a new value using picard iteration 2 μ r 1 p 1 p α p r x p σ 2 r 1 p 1 p α p r x p μ r 2 3 α p r exp x p μ r 2 2 σ 2 r m 1 p exp x p μ r 2 2 σ 2 r the value μ μ means the modified convergence process with the fuzzy expectation value in spatial computing tools these outcomes are also used as an expanded and more efficient approach 3 2 radial basis function artificial neural networks a favorite type of artificial neural network can be introduced as a radial basis function rbf rbf networks which are the most used ones require a higher number of nerve units but their superiority is shorter in design time than standard back propagation networks these networks have a remarkable performance when training vectors are very large rbf networks require many nerves to train and in the same way the performance of these networks is best done by using a large number of training vectors in these networks unlike the common training networks the entire input space is not equally responsive first the center of the input space is calculated and then the inputs that are close enough to the center are analyzed as a result these networks respond locally to data rbf networks have two layers the first layer is a radial base type and the output layer is linear the training process is also conducted here using competitive learning methods k means clustering radial basis functional link nets rbfln include an input layer of n nodes a hidden layer with m nerve units and an output layer of the j nerve units the property vector x feeds the input layer the corresponding output from the mth nerve unit of the hidden layers and the jth node is the output layer for the qth input of the sample vector x q as follows 3 y m q exp x q v m 2 2 σ m 2 z j q 1 m m 1 m u mj y m q b j where m 1 m and j 1 j the umj weight is the output of the layers of the hidden layers to the final layer 3 3 probabilistic neural network pnn pnn is a kind of neural network that estimates the probability that a sample will be assigned to a class there is a kind of system that approximates probability density functions this particular type of anns provides a general solution to the problem of clustering using the probabilities obtained by the bayesian decision theory these networks are of radial base nets and their functionalities are based on the performance of radial nets these networks are made up of two layers however the second layer in these networks unlike other networks is of a competitive type and should target the outputs in the form of vectors with values between 0 and 1 in this study the contrast values are used to create fuzzy membership values that were used to generate the input layer in the model this value was obtained from the analysis of the weights of the evidence layers in this approach for example a zero contrast receives logically false membership value of 0 5 the positive and negative divergence is scaled between 0 and 1 to use the sizeable fuzzy function calculated from the contrast it is necessary to have positive numbers and to be able to deal with classes that do not contain any training points because for those classes there was no possibility to calculate contrast value in this case the contrast value is referred to an attribute of the output table of the control layer to create the fuzzy logic model the conditional operators are applied for mixing the layers as mentioned in the preceding sections the raster layer of the groundwater quality potential index is selected as the criterion for determining and locating the class points afterward the values of this layer were changed into three classes to determine the location of the two occurrence and non occurrence points that is based on the same three classifications this diagnosis takes place finally the layer has been used to determine the membership severity of each of these two classes with the criterion of the index of potential the quality of groundwater resources was nominated into three classes favorable permissions and non permissive afterward the location of the occurrence and non occurrence points is determined for this purpose the automatic combination of the fuzzy operators was used to determine the membership value of the layer s points the assistance layer expresses the expert opinion about the class or probability of occurrence of a target phenomenon according to the drinking water quality index the assistance layer corresponds to the calculation of the aquifer quality assessment this layer represented the average water quality potential in the period between 2005 and 2015 and was obtained in the gis environment 3 4 control layers the spatial distribution of the control layers is used to produce a fuzzy weighted map the control maps are constructed in the form of a raster layer with an integer class type in areas where the class value increases the corresponding higher fuzzy numerical values make the detection probability more effective one of the primary goals is to predict the decline of groundwater quality based on the drought occurrence and gri index thus in this study the raster layers are described by the th tds so4 na and cl control layers and the spatial distribution of these parameters is according to the results of gri drought index 4 development of artificial neural network model 4 1 production of unique condition layer more realistic results are obtained by the ann using fuzzy membership values as inputs creating a new integer grid is necessary for application in the neural network the geoxplore program consists of three different training systems for artificial intelligence network that each one can be used to learn and classify data in a particular format after training each of these systems can process the unknown vectors of an unknown property from a similar source as training vectors and then determine which class belongs to it the learning rate is set to 0 1 as it significantly improves the training process of ann the training process was terminated after 1000 epochs and the performance of the anns verified by calculating the mean squared error mse between the actual and predicted values 4 2 unique training file format input data there are two types of input files first training data usually relatively small up to several hundred numbers and second classification data as a default class may be extensive up to hundreds of thousands of featured vectors the input data of the classification the unknown class data to perform the classification corresponds to a training data file but the last column is not known here table 1 in the flc method the cluster center and the deviation parameter are obtained by 0 83 and 0 37 respectively which indicates the validity of the clustering method in rbfln method the maximum fitted value of the class mse and the sum of squared errors sse equal to 0 2049 0 3574 and 2 1447 respectively in the third method pnn the result was obtained with the least uncertainty in the prediction calculation method in this paper uncertainty assessment and error measurement are performed by a separate validation process in explaining this validation process the curves drawn from the learning points indicates the efficiency of the class curve or the success rate curve src if the points belong to the training set non occurrence area are used this curve represents the prediction efficiency or prediction rate curve prc the sum of the calculated digits produces the surface below the efficiency curve between 0 and 1 a more substantial value equals a more efficient value of classification or more accurate prediction of inputs with least uncertainty the minimum and maximum fitted values are 0 6 and 0 8 respectively also mse and sse criteria are equal to 0 0019 and 0 0112 5 results and discussion in this section we discuss the results of artificial neural network and fuzzy clustering methods using the arcsdm extension and fuzzy logic tool in gis the output of the results was obtained in seven classes of single layer conditions which is shown in fig 2 this diagram determines that there are predictions of water quality classes that indicate both the index value and the range of each indicator class this diagram illustrates how future water quality will be distributed among the different water quality index classes and how much each class s contribution see fig 3 the spatial distribution map of the probability of unfavorable changes in the quality index of groundwater resources was obtained as illustrated in fig 3 the prediction of the occurrence of a qualitative class called temporarily drinkable resulted in the production of spatial distribution fig 3 shows the results of the pnn and rbfln neural network methods whose computational has more similar results than those obtained by fuzzy logic moreover a sensitivity analysis is conducted for detection of qualitative changes with the help of the evidence layers according to the raster class mapping the analysis was performed using the gri index and the five parameters of schuler standard th tds cl na and so4 the reason for the selection of the 10 year computational period of this evidence from 2005 to 2015 is to produce results with the same distribution of available data as possible and close to the effects of the final drought calculation in 2015 with the forecast approach according to the obtained results shown in table 2 the rbfln and pnn methods have a more accurate and faster computing capability as against flc method and thus they have higher credibility the value of the productivity index of the classifier is about 98 8 which indicates the high level of accuracy also the area under the capp curve 50 04 confirmed the randomness of class production in the process of the artificial neural network dispersion representation of higher membership indicates that the altered conditions in large part of the country s aquifers are related to the lowest water quality and the most severe droughts the least uncertainty of the pnn s output was obtained for the 7th class the outcomes indicate that in the southeast aquifers south of fars province areas of the central parts of the country and in particular the significant portions of the khorasan aquifers are on the verge of a crisis also the aquifers in these areas are similar to drought stress and in a deplorable condition in other words with the repetition of the drought of underground water the probability of a decrease in the quality of water in areas where the highest drought was occurring has a higher membership rate at the same time the rbfln method clearly shows the difference between the responses of drought situations to probabilistic tensions thus relatively fewer regions are considered as vulnerable parts of the crisis but there is no significant difference in the output obtained by rbfln compared to the pnn method the validation process is handled by converting the calculated values of each method to the vector points and then receiving the output in the spreadsheet environment accordingly the value of the detection coefficient was obtained by the regression model this value showed the highest correlation of about 74 between the two methods of rbfln and pnn and then 72 between the pnn and flc methods and finally 39 between the rbfln and flc methods the reason behind the similarity of the results of these two superior methods is based on their radial base structure particularly the areas where the occurrence of drought can affect the adverse change in the quality of underground drinking water the range from the southwest to the northeast of the 609 study areas is more consistent with the results of flc and rbfln methods it can be concluded that in both pnn and rbfln methods despite the same initial weight in the selection of six control layers the most significant relationship between the quality class and the occurrence of drought was found therefore in aquifers that pass through the quality threshold it is expected to repeat the changes with less progress while the aquifers in the bad class of the schuler standard are most sensitive however they necessarily did not get the highest membership value of the prediction the result indicates that in some of the country s aquifers the water quality status is not relatively poor however the quantitative changes in the depth of water in these aquifers based on the results of the prediction of ann indicate that the conditions for the future are considered critical to compare three methods the standardization of the spreadsheet environment was used the output value of this function is depicted in fig 4 the graphs of these figures visually confirm the negative decline in drinking water quality in the three classes 1 4 and 7 in all three computational methods however for classes 6 5 2 and 3 the results of pnn and rbfln methods are more similar regarding the relative risk of water quality loss as shown in figs 4 63 67 of the study areas 359 640 km2 are subjected to severe deterioration in drinking water quality see fig 5 5 1 posterior probability calculation the validity of the prediction model is determined by the production of the probability layer as well as the standard deviation layers based on the weights the variance based on the missing data and the total amount of standard deviation based on generalized evidence layers using contrast ratio to illustrate the reliability schema of the results of the artificial neural network model a weighted layer of evidence is computed with the weighted tables of each raster this tool uses two data columns of weight and wstd to generate output evaluation maps the results of these calculations have been illustrated in fig 5 as outlined in these figures the reliability of the results is more evident in areas where focused trained and non trained random points are concentrated also since weights are calculated based on the control layer classes most of the values are located near the southwest of the country as the focal area of the occurrence points the confidence degree of the results of the ann model is determined by a combination of the weighted evidence layer and the calculated weights of each raster in generating assessment maps two columns of weighted information are used according to the obtained result the reliability of the response is more evident in the areas where the random training and non training points are accumulated moreover considering that weights were calculated based on the classes of control layers the above values are observed near the southwest of the country as the focus area of the occurrence points in the raster layers values of the probability layer the standard deviation of segments based on weights the variance based on missing data and the total standard deviation are between 0 1 0 0 7759 0 0 0610 0 0 7759 respectively finally the value of the numbers in the overall confidence layer is between 0 and 4 099 5 2 area frequency table the area frequency table aft creates a database file dbf for capp and productivity curves in the present study using capp the randomness of the classification process in the artificial neural network calculation process is investigated the input for this tool was from the output of the response calculation tool the capp curve is used to define the number and position of class barriers also the efficiency curve is used to validate the model if the area under the curve is 0 5 50 then the efficiency of classifying or predicting is entirely random in proportion fig 6 and fig 7 see figs 8 and 9 the data represented in fig 6 can be used to define class fractures or in other words the flat parts define the class intervals supported by the data this curve shows that capp has multiple breaks to define a class that can be modulated in a given number of its type the success rate curve made from the training points is illustrated in fig 7 this graph shows the efficiency rate of the classification method in general there are two sets of points the first category with a certainty of 100 confirms the existence of a criterion and is recognized as occurrence areas on the other hand second party locations are areas where 100 certainty is not met if non training non occurrence points are used then this curve will be the prediction efficiency curve the area below the curve is measured between 0 and 1 and it can be calculated by eqs 4 or 5 a larger value is equivalent to a more efficient value for classification or prediction result 4 area x i x i 1 y i 1 0 5 x i x i 1 y i y i 1 5 area 0 5 x i x i 1 y i y i 1 this measure was obtained at 98 8 which is an ideal value chung and fabbri 2003 the calculation results determined the value of 50 04 and 49 32 regarding eqs 4 and 5 for the capp curve to confirm the randomness of classification productivity 5 3 the result of fuzzy clustering in order to produce the final composition layer fuzzy classification tools are used for extraction of the membership values of occurrence and non occurrence training points in this method a divisor tool in gis is used to create class values for control layers in this stage the uncertain missing data class was changed to a class with moderate uncertainty the output of this section was essential for incorporation of the independent fuzzy membership into the input layers of the ann calculation when introducing occurrence and non occurrence points fig 8 in this study the contrast values are used to create fuzzy membership values that were used to generate the input layer in the model this value was obtained from the analysis of the weights of the evidence layers in this approach for example a zero contrast receives logically false membership value of 0 5 in this way the positive and negative contrast can also be scaled between 0 and 1 in order to use the large fuzzy function calculated from the contrast it is necessary to have positive numbers and to be able to deal with classes that do not contain any training points because for those classes there was no possibility to calculate contrast value in this case the contrast value is referred to an attribute of the output table of the control layer to create the fuzzy logic model as shown in fig 8 the conditional operators are applied for mixing the layers as mentioned in the preceding sections 5 4 benchmark analysis in this sub section a comparative analysis is provided to show the validity of the model azimi et al 2018 proposed a probabilistic analysis using the first order reliability method form to predict the reoccurrence of drought conditions form is a semi probabilistic reliability analysis method developed to evaluate the reliability of a system der kiureghian and dakessian 1998 this method is used to assess the transition probability from the wetness and drought sustained state in order to produce continuous layers using form calculations the three parameters including the beta index a limit state function and the failure probability are determined using geostatistical analysis method fig 9 indicate that about 1900 selected points belong to certain drought conditions and thus a large volume of other locations with a probability of more than 50 are exposed to a significant reduction in the level of water depth the spatial distribution of these variables shows a reduction in groundwater level of large parts of the eastern coastal aquifers khorasan as well as essential aquifers along the zagros range and large parts of fars province thus if the current reoccurrence trend of drought continues the main part of the study area is in hazardous condition with a probability of more than 95 moreover the visual comparison of predicted drainage quality maps suggests a high probability of reoccurrence of drought conditions with a significant reduction in drinking water quality however the central and desert parts of iran as well as a certain number of plains in the country especially on the eastern border is not under failure conditions which can be attributed to the hydrogeological conditions of reservoirs in these areas the results of this study confirm the reoccurrence conditions considered in the proposed methods for predicting an adverse change in standard drinking water quality class the spatial distribution of the values of the limit state function varies between 1 232 and 1 185 as shown in fig 3 as mentioned above in order to implement the first order reliability method on the drought index data the long term average of the years 1994 to 2015 was used in which the baseline criterion in this case was the change from 1994 to 2004 on the other hand the time series in the period 2005 to 2015 was also selected as the reoccurrence limit in prediction conditions the obtained results of the spatial distribution of the failure indicate that the failure probability is between 19 13 and 99 3 the statistical summary of the layer indicates that the average failure probability of 81 with a standard deviation of 13 8 at the country level also fig 3 shows the probability distribution in all the cells of the final raster layer by classifying the natural values jenks to compare the results of this study with azimi et al 2018 the following points are necessary extracting the groundwater drought forecast map based on the results obtained from the gri index in the first ten years the main drought conditions are related to the bordering regions of iran based on the spatial distribution of the constant percent of groundwater drought the highest water level is reduced for southern plains of khuzestan province and large areas of azerbaijan northern plains of khorasan and also aquifers in the south of the country in this period the least persistent drought of underground water has come close to the middle areas of the country the central desert plains of iran at the same time during the first ten years the maximum drought in the groundwater was not limited to a specific part of the country unlike aquifers from khuzestan province which were exposed to severe water stress during the first period southern parts of the province faced droughts also the significant parts of the northern province of khorasan in the northwest of the country the vast zagros aquifer zone from the northwest to the south of iran except for a relatively small part of the central eastern part of the country all eastern aquifers have encountered with severe drought stress it is necessary to note that the existence of drought in the central regions of iran has not been sustained in the second study period the central regions of iran are mostly devoid of broad and deep aquifers and have a much lower population density than the eastern regions especially the western regions in general it can be predicted that in an extended period droughts in groundwater will persist in most parts of the country except for parts of the central and eastern regions of the country 6 conclusion the scarcity of groundwater happens when aquifers as a vital source of supplying water are affected by long term drought given the importance of this issue in this paper intelligent forecasting models were proposed to predict the adverse annual changes in the groundwater quality in the broad area of iran the calculation was performed using gis tools under schuler standard and who guidelines also the continuous layer of the gri index was obtained through the geostatistical tool the results of ann pnn and fuzzy logic clustering methods were compared according to the obtained result the productivity index of the classifier with 98 8 level of accuracy of the calculation process as well as the level of 50 under the cumulative probability curve confirmed the randomness of class production in the result of the artificial neural network the results of the gri indices showed that the drought occurrence would increase from 3 3 during the first ten years to 70 8 in the second ten years and in the same way the regular grade of wetlands decreased from 87 1 to 27 7 in aquifers that have violated the quality threshold values the repetition of variations is expected to be lower in progress while the aquifers belong to bad class regarding schuler standard are most susceptible the findings showed that the central regions and parts of northern khorasan provinces as well as a wide range of fars province and generally southern regions of iran experienced severe drought conditions based on the evaluation of drought maps between 1994 and 2015 it can be stated that about 64 of the study areas are subjected to severe deterioration in drinking water quality the results of the lowest available water quality and the highest drought using anns show that the qualitative stress conditions in large part of the country s aquifers are in unfavorable conditions the result indicates that the possibility of dropping groundwater quality due to its cause the occurrence of drought is contemporary in many aquifers in the country the weaknesses of the proposed method in this research lies in the lack of wide dispersion in the control points due to the size of the study area the positions of occurrence are only located in part of the south west therefore in the case of smaller scale analysis the actual use of the current methodology cannot lead to accurate and reliable results also for the same reasons generating the number of classes with a lower digit by clustering leads to a low reliability output to improve the results of these studies it is suggested to use a complete set of water quality parameters in the control layer and also to calculate the shorter time intervals also increasing the number and decreasing the number of raster s cells can result in more accurate results the results of this research can be more precise in cases where the probability of distribution of output is homogeneous due to the vast extent of the study area 609 plains of the country the irregular distribution of the observation data acquisition points as well as the missing data points the distribution of the uncertainty and the accuracy of the results have been partly decreased therefore due to the vulnerability of the country s aquifers and the need for integrated water resources management to make decisions at the lowest cost it is necessary to develop and improve data collection methods and to change these methods from a traditional form to an online one it is suggested that to analyze the calculations with shorter steps more accurately we will develop methods for rebuilding incomplete data with the least error to promote of the present research the future research topics are suggested as follows 1 modeling uncertainty analysis using numerical computational methods 2 the extension of the process of predicting groundwater quality loss by analyzing the groundwater level changes in long term periods disclosure statement the authors reported no potential conflict of interests funding there is no funding

1610,drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting different aspects of human life and the environment due to water scarcity prediction of water quality reduction is very crucial for urban and rural communities this study contributes by applying artificial neural network and modified fuzzy clustering techniques to estimate the drops in potential drinking water quality in the gis environment in this research the probability of occurrence of adverse annual changes in the water quality of drinking water is estimated the model was tested using real instances of the southeast aquifers the regions of the central parts of the iran and especially the significant portions of the aquifers of the east area to validate the model the data adequacy test and the standardization of the drought index are used the results of the lowest available water quality and the highest drought using anns show that the qualitative stress conditions in large part of the country s aquifers are in unfavorable conditions evidence from this research shows that the aquifers in these areas are expected to have severe drought stress and poor quality class status also the computational results indicate that the modified clustering method increases the efficiency of the prediction model as against the previous research the outcomes do not show a relatively favorable state of drinking water quality for some aquifers in the country however the conditions for quantitative changes in the depth of water based on the predicted results of ann are considered critical the generated maps demonstrate that about 64 of the study area is subjected to a severe deterioration in the quality of drinking water if the current trend continues in the exploitation of aquifers as a result the main finding the present study is that the probability of groundwater quality decline is significant in many aquifers in the country keywords artificial neural network water quality prediction radial basis function link neural network fuzzy clustering 1 introduction the awareness of the future status of water resources especially in standard drinking water classes is essential for urban and rural communities eberhard and hamawand 2017 water resource managers often need to determine the uncertainty and changes in the system performance values due to any alteration in input data and the values of possible parameters that are predicted they have to modulate this level of uncertainty for the development of applied engineering designs srivastava et al 2012 among natural disasters drought has a significant impact on different aspects of human life jalalkamali et al 2015 drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting various aspects of human life and the environment drought can be categorized in numerous ways based on the nature of the water shortage different types of droughts can be defined hydrological meteorological socio economical and agricultural in the present study the drought is defined mainly based on hydrological aspects drought is a naturally recurring phenomenon in different climatic areas drought is commonly observed to be an extended period with suggestively lower rainfall relative to standard levels or amplified evaporative demand or a mixture of both conditions drought is a complex and multi dimensional natural hazard described by duration intensity magnitude of severity and the ecological or the water resource point of view during the last decades the application of artificial intelligent techniques has recognized as practical forecasting approaches of natural phenomena barzegar et al 2016 one of the solutions for developing and expanding relationships in future situations is artificial intelligence artificial neural networks anns and fuzzy clustering are the central part of this study which identifies the intricate patterns of drought in this study the decline in groundwater quality and the probability of a decline in groundwater quality based on its relationship with the occurrence of droughts reduction of water level in aquifers are predicted using anns and fuzzy clustering methods artificial neural networks generally have three steps to find solutions and solve a problem which includes training generalization and run dayhoff and deleo 2001 training is a process through which the network learns to recognize the pattern of inputs as a set of training data in this way the data entered into the nerve unit after being combined with the network weights it comes to the cell body and starts data processing or training and eventually exit from the nerve unit after the outputs calculated these values compared with target values and if there is a difference between these values new weights are set and training is repeated this process is repeated as long as the difference between the output values of the network and the high target values is not within the specified range the purpose of the present study is to extract the spatial distribution map of the probability of adverse changes in the quality index of groundwater resources based on the occurrence of drought to calculate the likelihood of underground water quality deterioration in the country s plains it was first necessary to use a digitized observation source to determine the potential quality of drinking water in the gis environment according to the schuler and world health organization who standards for this purpose by fitting the best zoning model and comparing the standard errors the raster layer was obtained from the qualitative potential assessment index the five primary input parameters including total hardness th total dissolved solids tds na cl so4 are used to calculate the groundwater quality potential these parameters are in the form of input raster layers the output of the model is a single lattice layer in which the probability values in each cell would determine the chance of occurrence for all three prediction methods to calculate the groundwater resource index gri the standard cultivars of drought classes will be obtained for all 11 383 wells of iranian aquifers the gri stands for an index that specifies water quality in aquifers used for drinkable supply and is based on primary and secondary groundwater standards or guidance levels the gri criteria are surpassed when more than 10 of wells are above a groundwater maximum contaminant limit mcl or guidance concentration limit gcl in the present study the continuous layer of gri will be obtained through the geostatistical tool the selection of the optimal zoning method is based on a comparison between the normal samples produced during the years 1994 to 2015 2 background several studies have been carried out on the use of artificial intelligence techniques e g neural networks valipour 2016 the meta heuristic algorithm hassannayebi et al 2018 and machine learning holloway et al 2018 in engineering and environment problems yang et al 2009 showed that the predictive accuracy of the artificial neural network is superior compared to the integrated time series models chandramouli et al 2007 provided a benchmark for determining the number of repetitions for the training of post propagation neural networks this study showed that training much or less than the amount could lead to passing through the appropriate amount or failing to get the optimal response to determine the relationship between input and output data banerjee et al 2009 used a predictive artificial neural network as a method for predicting groundwater levels which gave satisfactory results mohanty et al 2010 used an artificial neural network model for predicting groundwater levels and it was found that although groundwater surface prediction accuracy decreases with increasing the examination period the underground water level prediction is more acceptable for the extended period jalalkamali et al 2015 used the artificial neural network to predict drought and rainfall index for the years 1961 2002 sakizadeh 2016 have used anns for predicting the water quality index wqi over the years 2006 to 2013 banerjee et al 2011 suggested an artificial neural skeleton model as an alternative to predict the salinity of groundwater hosseini moghari et al 2015 used the fuzzy water quality index fwqi method to assess groundwater quality according to the water quality index shamsuddin et al 2017 used an ann model for predicting groundwater levels in two vertical wells in the aquifer area near the langat river according to the results of this study accurate forecasts can be made with time series one day ahead of the predictive levels of groundwater and interactions between the river and the aquifer the findings of this study can be used to assist policy makers in managing groundwater resources using the river bank infiltration rbi method supreetha et al 2015 examined the ability of a hybrid ann model and genetic algorithm ga to predict groundwater levels of several observation wells the groundwater level for a ten year period and rainfall data were used during the same period for model training the study showed that the ann ga model could successfully be used to predict groundwater levels in observation areas additionally the comparative study showed that the combined ann ga model is more effective than the traditional ann back propagation approach golchin and moghaddam 2016 conducted an assessment analysis of hydro geochemical characteristics and groundwater quality in an aquifer in iran for this purpose the chemical properties of more than twenty wells were evaluated to characterize the hydro geochemical processes in the region according to the obtained results the most dominant classes are discovered as c4 s4 c4 s3 and c3 s2 nourani 2017 implemented the emotional ann eann as a new generation of artificial intelligence based models for modeling the daily rainfall runoff r r prediction of the basin a general comparison of the results of the eann against feed forward neural networks ffnn showed that the training and productivity measures were superior up to 13 and 34 respectively ahmad et al 2017 designed a dynamic prediction method for the estimation of water quality by excluding the biological and chemical oxygen demands the outcomes show that the combination of multiple neural networks forward selection and backward elimination can further enhance the performance and accuracy of the prediction model the generated result has the higher accuracy in terms of r2 and mean squared error mse of 93 and 11 5 respectively qaderi and babanejad 2017 developed an ann based forecasting model to study the groundwater quality which results in the accurate prediction of the costs of drinking water treatment according to the obtained results the ann structured with three hidden layers and 18 neurons was the best performing model which results in cost reduction by about 150 000 dollars daily sahoo et al 2017 proposed bayesian and entropy methods for water quality assessment the aggregative index evaluation method was implemented to calculate water quality index in the brahmani river the trends in water quality indicators were predicted using bayes rule the outcomes indicated that the wqi was enhanced during dry periods than during wet periods as a result of the reduction of pollutants previous studies on the use of ann and time series in quantitative predictions of water resources have been limited to specific areas e g an aquifer in this research the aim is to predict the variation of spatial parameters of a large area using gis tools by the radial basis function link neural network rbfln probabilistic neural networks pnn and fuzzy logic clustering flc calculations besides the sensitivity of the effect of changes in water level concerning water quality changes in different areas 609 study areas of the country has been analyzed in this study as a new approach we use the classification efficiency index as well as the cumulative area posterior probability capp curve of the region for deductive validation as one of the significant achievements of this paper a continuous map of the prediction of the probability of a decline in groundwater quality can be applied to the development of integrated decision making and integrated water resource management models the article is organized as follows the description of the material and method is given in section 4 section 5 presents the methodology and data analysis approach the results of empirical experiments are provided and interpreted in section 6 conclusion and suggestions for further research are drawn in section 7 3 materials and methods the study area is about the extent of iran 25 to 40 degrees north latitude and 44 to 64 degrees east longitude and the zoning is based on 609 plains of the country with an approximate area of 567 828 km2 fig 1 the situation includes climate change in warm and dry regions in the middle to wet and overcast regions of the northern areas also the unique geological structure and type of each aquifer are enclosed to half free and fully open the natural condition simultaneously makes all aquifers impossible in areas with higher population density like the western regions of iran underground aquifers are directly affected by human factors quantitative changes followed by the quality of aquifer feeding waters while in the eastern and central regions generally surface currents so much on underground water fig 1 shows the position of iran s plains and simultaneously the position of aquifers in iran the research methods include rbfln pnn and flc besides the arcsdm extension was used as a fuzzy logic tool in a geographic information system environment and geoxplore program the probability of occurrence of adverse annual changes in different classes of drinking water quality is estimated accordingly the calculations were based on the extraction of the water quality potential layer using geographical information system and according to the schuler and who standards in brief the choice of research techniques relies on these specifics reasons recent literature reviews indicated that artificial intelligent methods specifically the ann and pnn have been successfully used for water resources variable modeling and prediction see e g dou et al 2018 rbf and pnn methods are used as complementary computational methods and for obtaining results with the least error value another primary reason is the impossibility of verifying the output of a computational model for spatial models as a result validation was done using parallel methods the fuzzy ann method provides a process for standard computing layers in the gis environment based on fuzzy functions the use of these items was entirely based on the sources mentioned in the article s text as a research method in this way the consistency of the outputs of these methods made it possible to compare the estimates 3 1 fuzzy clustering clustering a set of components by a learning system based on their characteristic vector is a powerful tool for gaining knowledge based on observations stored in data files milligan and hirtle 2003 given a collection of vector properties in a self organization process they are converted into classes with similar values of properties with a process of divisive or down to top clustering a class can also be set up under a supervised training process in which an input vector is labeled and process parameters until the output is learned for each input vector consistent with the target output suppose a set of property vectors q x q q 1 q which is converted to k clusters ck k 1 k for kth cluster ck is a sample determined by c k the dimensional of the component vector x q x1 q xn q and the centers c k c1 k cn k equals to n the feature vectors are standardized independently in each section and so the vectors are in the n dimensional cube 0 1 n hub shaped vectors do not have a uniform distribution of cluster structure milligan 1996 however if sets of vectors fall into multiple subsets these subsets are compressed around their distribution centers then they are in a strong clustering structure it will be accepted that such clustering is organized and properly disassociated the measurement of cluster validity provides the value of clustering superiority pal and bezdek 1995 xie and beni 1991 some general measures for cluster validity are partition coefficients pcs classification entropy ces and proportional exponent pe uniform distribution functional udf is another criterion pointed out by xie and beni 1991 udf is a product of compactness and separation the relative compression separation coefficient for a larger number of k is defined as 1 1 v 1 k k 1 k σ k 2 d min 2 σ k 2 q 1 q w kq x q c k 2 k 1 k where d min is at least distance between the samples center of the cluster and σ k 2 is the fuzzy variance of the weight of the k th cluster the larger d min means a lower cross reference each σ k 2 is smaller for compact clusters consequently the lower value of v means more compression and separation in measuring the xie beni fuzzy validity only the members of each cluster are changed instead of all q samples for each cluster it is also mutually k 1 v so a larger value of k represents a better clustering and k is a measure of the xie beni cluster s validity the weighted fuzzy expected value wfev is defined as a set of real values of x1 xp as a sample value representing a comprehensive representation of medium or intermediate categories schneider and craig 1992 this is done exponentially with the use of two sided reduction and dip but in this calculation instead of the tangent the shape of the gaussian function is used in eq 3 the reason is that a membership function is a conventional fuzzy set for the near center variable after calculating the arithmetic mean μ 0 of a set of real values x1 xp is used as the value of the primary center so that to obtain a new value using picard iteration 2 μ r 1 p 1 p α p r x p σ 2 r 1 p 1 p α p r x p μ r 2 3 α p r exp x p μ r 2 2 σ 2 r m 1 p exp x p μ r 2 2 σ 2 r the value μ μ means the modified convergence process with the fuzzy expectation value in spatial computing tools these outcomes are also used as an expanded and more efficient approach 3 2 radial basis function artificial neural networks a favorite type of artificial neural network can be introduced as a radial basis function rbf rbf networks which are the most used ones require a higher number of nerve units but their superiority is shorter in design time than standard back propagation networks these networks have a remarkable performance when training vectors are very large rbf networks require many nerves to train and in the same way the performance of these networks is best done by using a large number of training vectors in these networks unlike the common training networks the entire input space is not equally responsive first the center of the input space is calculated and then the inputs that are close enough to the center are analyzed as a result these networks respond locally to data rbf networks have two layers the first layer is a radial base type and the output layer is linear the training process is also conducted here using competitive learning methods k means clustering radial basis functional link nets rbfln include an input layer of n nodes a hidden layer with m nerve units and an output layer of the j nerve units the property vector x feeds the input layer the corresponding output from the mth nerve unit of the hidden layers and the jth node is the output layer for the qth input of the sample vector x q as follows 3 y m q exp x q v m 2 2 σ m 2 z j q 1 m m 1 m u mj y m q b j where m 1 m and j 1 j the umj weight is the output of the layers of the hidden layers to the final layer 3 3 probabilistic neural network pnn pnn is a kind of neural network that estimates the probability that a sample will be assigned to a class there is a kind of system that approximates probability density functions this particular type of anns provides a general solution to the problem of clustering using the probabilities obtained by the bayesian decision theory these networks are of radial base nets and their functionalities are based on the performance of radial nets these networks are made up of two layers however the second layer in these networks unlike other networks is of a competitive type and should target the outputs in the form of vectors with values between 0 and 1 in this study the contrast values are used to create fuzzy membership values that were used to generate the input layer in the model this value was obtained from the analysis of the weights of the evidence layers in this approach for example a zero contrast receives logically false membership value of 0 5 the positive and negative divergence is scaled between 0 and 1 to use the sizeable fuzzy function calculated from the contrast it is necessary to have positive numbers and to be able to deal with classes that do not contain any training points because for those classes there was no possibility to calculate contrast value in this case the contrast value is referred to an attribute of the output table of the control layer to create the fuzzy logic model the conditional operators are applied for mixing the layers as mentioned in the preceding sections the raster layer of the groundwater quality potential index is selected as the criterion for determining and locating the class points afterward the values of this layer were changed into three classes to determine the location of the two occurrence and non occurrence points that is based on the same three classifications this diagnosis takes place finally the layer has been used to determine the membership severity of each of these two classes with the criterion of the index of potential the quality of groundwater resources was nominated into three classes favorable permissions and non permissive afterward the location of the occurrence and non occurrence points is determined for this purpose the automatic combination of the fuzzy operators was used to determine the membership value of the layer s points the assistance layer expresses the expert opinion about the class or probability of occurrence of a target phenomenon according to the drinking water quality index the assistance layer corresponds to the calculation of the aquifer quality assessment this layer represented the average water quality potential in the period between 2005 and 2015 and was obtained in the gis environment 3 4 control layers the spatial distribution of the control layers is used to produce a fuzzy weighted map the control maps are constructed in the form of a raster layer with an integer class type in areas where the class value increases the corresponding higher fuzzy numerical values make the detection probability more effective one of the primary goals is to predict the decline of groundwater quality based on the drought occurrence and gri index thus in this study the raster layers are described by the th tds so4 na and cl control layers and the spatial distribution of these parameters is according to the results of gri drought index 4 development of artificial neural network model 4 1 production of unique condition layer more realistic results are obtained by the ann using fuzzy membership values as inputs creating a new integer grid is necessary for application in the neural network the geoxplore program consists of three different training systems for artificial intelligence network that each one can be used to learn and classify data in a particular format after training each of these systems can process the unknown vectors of an unknown property from a similar source as training vectors and then determine which class belongs to it the learning rate is set to 0 1 as it significantly improves the training process of ann the training process was terminated after 1000 epochs and the performance of the anns verified by calculating the mean squared error mse between the actual and predicted values 4 2 unique training file format input data there are two types of input files first training data usually relatively small up to several hundred numbers and second classification data as a default class may be extensive up to hundreds of thousands of featured vectors the input data of the classification the unknown class data to perform the classification corresponds to a training data file but the last column is not known here table 1 in the flc method the cluster center and the deviation parameter are obtained by 0 83 and 0 37 respectively which indicates the validity of the clustering method in rbfln method the maximum fitted value of the class mse and the sum of squared errors sse equal to 0 2049 0 3574 and 2 1447 respectively in the third method pnn the result was obtained with the least uncertainty in the prediction calculation method in this paper uncertainty assessment and error measurement are performed by a separate validation process in explaining this validation process the curves drawn from the learning points indicates the efficiency of the class curve or the success rate curve src if the points belong to the training set non occurrence area are used this curve represents the prediction efficiency or prediction rate curve prc the sum of the calculated digits produces the surface below the efficiency curve between 0 and 1 a more substantial value equals a more efficient value of classification or more accurate prediction of inputs with least uncertainty the minimum and maximum fitted values are 0 6 and 0 8 respectively also mse and sse criteria are equal to 0 0019 and 0 0112 5 results and discussion in this section we discuss the results of artificial neural network and fuzzy clustering methods using the arcsdm extension and fuzzy logic tool in gis the output of the results was obtained in seven classes of single layer conditions which is shown in fig 2 this diagram determines that there are predictions of water quality classes that indicate both the index value and the range of each indicator class this diagram illustrates how future water quality will be distributed among the different water quality index classes and how much each class s contribution see fig 3 the spatial distribution map of the probability of unfavorable changes in the quality index of groundwater resources was obtained as illustrated in fig 3 the prediction of the occurrence of a qualitative class called temporarily drinkable resulted in the production of spatial distribution fig 3 shows the results of the pnn and rbfln neural network methods whose computational has more similar results than those obtained by fuzzy logic moreover a sensitivity analysis is conducted for detection of qualitative changes with the help of the evidence layers according to the raster class mapping the analysis was performed using the gri index and the five parameters of schuler standard th tds cl na and so4 the reason for the selection of the 10 year computational period of this evidence from 2005 to 2015 is to produce results with the same distribution of available data as possible and close to the effects of the final drought calculation in 2015 with the forecast approach according to the obtained results shown in table 2 the rbfln and pnn methods have a more accurate and faster computing capability as against flc method and thus they have higher credibility the value of the productivity index of the classifier is about 98 8 which indicates the high level of accuracy also the area under the capp curve 50 04 confirmed the randomness of class production in the process of the artificial neural network dispersion representation of higher membership indicates that the altered conditions in large part of the country s aquifers are related to the lowest water quality and the most severe droughts the least uncertainty of the pnn s output was obtained for the 7th class the outcomes indicate that in the southeast aquifers south of fars province areas of the central parts of the country and in particular the significant portions of the khorasan aquifers are on the verge of a crisis also the aquifers in these areas are similar to drought stress and in a deplorable condition in other words with the repetition of the drought of underground water the probability of a decrease in the quality of water in areas where the highest drought was occurring has a higher membership rate at the same time the rbfln method clearly shows the difference between the responses of drought situations to probabilistic tensions thus relatively fewer regions are considered as vulnerable parts of the crisis but there is no significant difference in the output obtained by rbfln compared to the pnn method the validation process is handled by converting the calculated values of each method to the vector points and then receiving the output in the spreadsheet environment accordingly the value of the detection coefficient was obtained by the regression model this value showed the highest correlation of about 74 between the two methods of rbfln and pnn and then 72 between the pnn and flc methods and finally 39 between the rbfln and flc methods the reason behind the similarity of the results of these two superior methods is based on their radial base structure particularly the areas where the occurrence of drought can affect the adverse change in the quality of underground drinking water the range from the southwest to the northeast of the 609 study areas is more consistent with the results of flc and rbfln methods it can be concluded that in both pnn and rbfln methods despite the same initial weight in the selection of six control layers the most significant relationship between the quality class and the occurrence of drought was found therefore in aquifers that pass through the quality threshold it is expected to repeat the changes with less progress while the aquifers in the bad class of the schuler standard are most sensitive however they necessarily did not get the highest membership value of the prediction the result indicates that in some of the country s aquifers the water quality status is not relatively poor however the quantitative changes in the depth of water in these aquifers based on the results of the prediction of ann indicate that the conditions for the future are considered critical to compare three methods the standardization of the spreadsheet environment was used the output value of this function is depicted in fig 4 the graphs of these figures visually confirm the negative decline in drinking water quality in the three classes 1 4 and 7 in all three computational methods however for classes 6 5 2 and 3 the results of pnn and rbfln methods are more similar regarding the relative risk of water quality loss as shown in figs 4 63 67 of the study areas 359 640 km2 are subjected to severe deterioration in drinking water quality see fig 5 5 1 posterior probability calculation the validity of the prediction model is determined by the production of the probability layer as well as the standard deviation layers based on the weights the variance based on the missing data and the total amount of standard deviation based on generalized evidence layers using contrast ratio to illustrate the reliability schema of the results of the artificial neural network model a weighted layer of evidence is computed with the weighted tables of each raster this tool uses two data columns of weight and wstd to generate output evaluation maps the results of these calculations have been illustrated in fig 5 as outlined in these figures the reliability of the results is more evident in areas where focused trained and non trained random points are concentrated also since weights are calculated based on the control layer classes most of the values are located near the southwest of the country as the focal area of the occurrence points the confidence degree of the results of the ann model is determined by a combination of the weighted evidence layer and the calculated weights of each raster in generating assessment maps two columns of weighted information are used according to the obtained result the reliability of the response is more evident in the areas where the random training and non training points are accumulated moreover considering that weights were calculated based on the classes of control layers the above values are observed near the southwest of the country as the focus area of the occurrence points in the raster layers values of the probability layer the standard deviation of segments based on weights the variance based on missing data and the total standard deviation are between 0 1 0 0 7759 0 0 0610 0 0 7759 respectively finally the value of the numbers in the overall confidence layer is between 0 and 4 099 5 2 area frequency table the area frequency table aft creates a database file dbf for capp and productivity curves in the present study using capp the randomness of the classification process in the artificial neural network calculation process is investigated the input for this tool was from the output of the response calculation tool the capp curve is used to define the number and position of class barriers also the efficiency curve is used to validate the model if the area under the curve is 0 5 50 then the efficiency of classifying or predicting is entirely random in proportion fig 6 and fig 7 see figs 8 and 9 the data represented in fig 6 can be used to define class fractures or in other words the flat parts define the class intervals supported by the data this curve shows that capp has multiple breaks to define a class that can be modulated in a given number of its type the success rate curve made from the training points is illustrated in fig 7 this graph shows the efficiency rate of the classification method in general there are two sets of points the first category with a certainty of 100 confirms the existence of a criterion and is recognized as occurrence areas on the other hand second party locations are areas where 100 certainty is not met if non training non occurrence points are used then this curve will be the prediction efficiency curve the area below the curve is measured between 0 and 1 and it can be calculated by eqs 4 or 5 a larger value is equivalent to a more efficient value for classification or prediction result 4 area x i x i 1 y i 1 0 5 x i x i 1 y i y i 1 5 area 0 5 x i x i 1 y i y i 1 this measure was obtained at 98 8 which is an ideal value chung and fabbri 2003 the calculation results determined the value of 50 04 and 49 32 regarding eqs 4 and 5 for the capp curve to confirm the randomness of classification productivity 5 3 the result of fuzzy clustering in order to produce the final composition layer fuzzy classification tools are used for extraction of the membership values of occurrence and non occurrence training points in this method a divisor tool in gis is used to create class values for control layers in this stage the uncertain missing data class was changed to a class with moderate uncertainty the output of this section was essential for incorporation of the independent fuzzy membership into the input layers of the ann calculation when introducing occurrence and non occurrence points fig 8 in this study the contrast values are used to create fuzzy membership values that were used to generate the input layer in the model this value was obtained from the analysis of the weights of the evidence layers in this approach for example a zero contrast receives logically false membership value of 0 5 in this way the positive and negative contrast can also be scaled between 0 and 1 in order to use the large fuzzy function calculated from the contrast it is necessary to have positive numbers and to be able to deal with classes that do not contain any training points because for those classes there was no possibility to calculate contrast value in this case the contrast value is referred to an attribute of the output table of the control layer to create the fuzzy logic model as shown in fig 8 the conditional operators are applied for mixing the layers as mentioned in the preceding sections 5 4 benchmark analysis in this sub section a comparative analysis is provided to show the validity of the model azimi et al 2018 proposed a probabilistic analysis using the first order reliability method form to predict the reoccurrence of drought conditions form is a semi probabilistic reliability analysis method developed to evaluate the reliability of a system der kiureghian and dakessian 1998 this method is used to assess the transition probability from the wetness and drought sustained state in order to produce continuous layers using form calculations the three parameters including the beta index a limit state function and the failure probability are determined using geostatistical analysis method fig 9 indicate that about 1900 selected points belong to certain drought conditions and thus a large volume of other locations with a probability of more than 50 are exposed to a significant reduction in the level of water depth the spatial distribution of these variables shows a reduction in groundwater level of large parts of the eastern coastal aquifers khorasan as well as essential aquifers along the zagros range and large parts of fars province thus if the current reoccurrence trend of drought continues the main part of the study area is in hazardous condition with a probability of more than 95 moreover the visual comparison of predicted drainage quality maps suggests a high probability of reoccurrence of drought conditions with a significant reduction in drinking water quality however the central and desert parts of iran as well as a certain number of plains in the country especially on the eastern border is not under failure conditions which can be attributed to the hydrogeological conditions of reservoirs in these areas the results of this study confirm the reoccurrence conditions considered in the proposed methods for predicting an adverse change in standard drinking water quality class the spatial distribution of the values of the limit state function varies between 1 232 and 1 185 as shown in fig 3 as mentioned above in order to implement the first order reliability method on the drought index data the long term average of the years 1994 to 2015 was used in which the baseline criterion in this case was the change from 1994 to 2004 on the other hand the time series in the period 2005 to 2015 was also selected as the reoccurrence limit in prediction conditions the obtained results of the spatial distribution of the failure indicate that the failure probability is between 19 13 and 99 3 the statistical summary of the layer indicates that the average failure probability of 81 with a standard deviation of 13 8 at the country level also fig 3 shows the probability distribution in all the cells of the final raster layer by classifying the natural values jenks to compare the results of this study with azimi et al 2018 the following points are necessary extracting the groundwater drought forecast map based on the results obtained from the gri index in the first ten years the main drought conditions are related to the bordering regions of iran based on the spatial distribution of the constant percent of groundwater drought the highest water level is reduced for southern plains of khuzestan province and large areas of azerbaijan northern plains of khorasan and also aquifers in the south of the country in this period the least persistent drought of underground water has come close to the middle areas of the country the central desert plains of iran at the same time during the first ten years the maximum drought in the groundwater was not limited to a specific part of the country unlike aquifers from khuzestan province which were exposed to severe water stress during the first period southern parts of the province faced droughts also the significant parts of the northern province of khorasan in the northwest of the country the vast zagros aquifer zone from the northwest to the south of iran except for a relatively small part of the central eastern part of the country all eastern aquifers have encountered with severe drought stress it is necessary to note that the existence of drought in the central regions of iran has not been sustained in the second study period the central regions of iran are mostly devoid of broad and deep aquifers and have a much lower population density than the eastern regions especially the western regions in general it can be predicted that in an extended period droughts in groundwater will persist in most parts of the country except for parts of the central and eastern regions of the country 6 conclusion the scarcity of groundwater happens when aquifers as a vital source of supplying water are affected by long term drought given the importance of this issue in this paper intelligent forecasting models were proposed to predict the adverse annual changes in the groundwater quality in the broad area of iran the calculation was performed using gis tools under schuler standard and who guidelines also the continuous layer of the gri index was obtained through the geostatistical tool the results of ann pnn and fuzzy logic clustering methods were compared according to the obtained result the productivity index of the classifier with 98 8 level of accuracy of the calculation process as well as the level of 50 under the cumulative probability curve confirmed the randomness of class production in the result of the artificial neural network the results of the gri indices showed that the drought occurrence would increase from 3 3 during the first ten years to 70 8 in the second ten years and in the same way the regular grade of wetlands decreased from 87 1 to 27 7 in aquifers that have violated the quality threshold values the repetition of variations is expected to be lower in progress while the aquifers belong to bad class regarding schuler standard are most susceptible the findings showed that the central regions and parts of northern khorasan provinces as well as a wide range of fars province and generally southern regions of iran experienced severe drought conditions based on the evaluation of drought maps between 1994 and 2015 it can be stated that about 64 of the study areas are subjected to severe deterioration in drinking water quality the results of the lowest available water quality and the highest drought using anns show that the qualitative stress conditions in large part of the country s aquifers are in unfavorable conditions the result indicates that the possibility of dropping groundwater quality due to its cause the occurrence of drought is contemporary in many aquifers in the country the weaknesses of the proposed method in this research lies in the lack of wide dispersion in the control points due to the size of the study area the positions of occurrence are only located in part of the south west therefore in the case of smaller scale analysis the actual use of the current methodology cannot lead to accurate and reliable results also for the same reasons generating the number of classes with a lower digit by clustering leads to a low reliability output to improve the results of these studies it is suggested to use a complete set of water quality parameters in the control layer and also to calculate the shorter time intervals also increasing the number and decreasing the number of raster s cells can result in more accurate results the results of this research can be more precise in cases where the probability of distribution of output is homogeneous due to the vast extent of the study area 609 plains of the country the irregular distribution of the observation data acquisition points as well as the missing data points the distribution of the uncertainty and the accuracy of the results have been partly decreased therefore due to the vulnerability of the country s aquifers and the need for integrated water resources management to make decisions at the lowest cost it is necessary to develop and improve data collection methods and to change these methods from a traditional form to an online one it is suggested that to analyze the calculations with shorter steps more accurately we will develop methods for rebuilding incomplete data with the least error to promote of the present research the future research topics are suggested as follows 1 modeling uncertainty analysis using numerical computational methods 2 the extension of the process of predicting groundwater quality loss by analyzing the groundwater level changes in long term periods disclosure statement the authors reported no potential conflict of interests funding there is no funding

1611,the optimization model is presently used for the identification of pollution sources and it is based on non linear programming optimization the decision variables in this model are continuous resulting in a weak recognition of integer variables including pollution source location in addition as the number of pollution sources increase so the calculated load increases exponentially and accuracy decreases compared with previous studies this study makes a series of improvements by adopting a 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model to enable the simultaneous identification of both location integer variable and the release intensity continuous variable of the pollution source one of the constraints in the optimization model is a simulation component which requires thousands of calls during the calculation process and therefore requires considerable computational load to avoid this problem the kriging surrogate model is established in this study to reduce computational load while at the same time ensuring the accuracy of the simulation results the identification result is solved using a genetic algorithm ga and represents the real location of the pollution source while release intensities are close to actual ones with small relative errors the kriging surrogate model is based on a 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model and can simultaneously identify both the location and the release intensity of the pollution source with a high degree of accuracy and by using short computational times keywords 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming groundwater pollution source identification groundwater solute transport surrogate model 1 introduction evaluating the risks associated with groundwater contamination usually requires knowledge of the characteristics of the contamination source including the number and location of sources release history and intensity and mass of contaminant these characteristics are often not well known creating great in the groundwater pollution rehabilitation program design risk assessment and the identification of parties responsible for pollution snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 khan et al 2004 lapworth et al 2012 om and bithin 2013 identification of the groundwater pollution source is particularly important the identification of groundwater pollution sources is an inverse problem there has been a long history of research and application to the forward problem but limited in the inverse problem since its rise in the 1960s both the theory and application of this problem remain in a developmental stage li and yao 2014 and most of the problems so far addressed are non linear and ill conditioned one reason for this is that when the inverse problem is solved the amount of information known is far less than the amount of information sought and this makes the problem difficult tikhonov and arsenin 1978 yeh 1986 mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 this problem is nevertheless gaining more and more attention due to its extensive and important application and future prospects a number of applications have been shown in practice including computed tomography ct imaging for medical diagnosis several comprehensive reviews on the simultaneous identification of release intensity and pollution source positioning have been published over the last 10 years for example mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 proposed a simulation optimization method based on a hybrid genetic local search algorithm in order to identify the release intensity and the location of non point pollution source mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 in similar work mirghani et al 2012 used a simulation optimization method based on a parallel evolutionary strategy to identify both release intensity and pollution source location mirghani et al 2012 while ayvaz 2010 used a simulation optimization method based on the harmony search algorithm to synchronously identify the two variables ayvaz 2010 all of these studies used both the location and release intensity of pollution source as continuous variables while the recognition effect is acceptable when we uniformly treat two different types of variables in the process of simultaneous identification there is also a significant magnitude of difference between position coordinates and the amounts of pollution released from a source and so the reliability of results is open to question the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear optimization model can be used to address this problem as it contains both discrete integer variables i e the location of the pollution source and continuous variables i e the release intensity of the pollution source it excludes unreal sources to reduce the number of variables and it recognizes the release intensity of the real pollution source the simulation optimization method utilizes the optimization principle to solve the problem of pollution source identification and it is presently one of the most complete and widely used mathematical methods in this area this method also requires tens of thousands of iterations in order to invoke the groundwater solute transport simulation model thus because of the relatively large amount of computation and the calculation time involved in the running of the simulation model both a large calculation load and long calculation time are required to generate an iterative solution ayvaz 2010 mirghani et al 2012 thus establishing a surrogate of a simulation model is an effective way to reduce computation time singh et al 2004 kourakos and mantoglou 2013 and has a similar function in other words given the same input outputs from the surrogate model are very close to the outputs of the simulation model in the first place and also has much less computational load and takes much less time queipo et al 2005 sreekanth and datta 2010 such a model is advocated in this paper this research is important because limited research has so far been carried out on the simultaneous identification of release intensity and pollution source location using a surrogate model that is based on the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming simulation optimization approach 2 methodology 2 1 the principle of the kriging model the kriging method is an optimized interpolation approach that was invented by the french geographer and mathematician matheron and the south african mining engineer krige in early work sacks et al 1989 used the kriging method to establish surrogate models for the first time sacks et al 1989 and this approach has since been used widely in surrogate modeling ryu et al 2002 kleijnen and van beers 2005 hemker et al 2008 coetzee et al 2012 the relationship between the response value and the independent variable in the approximate expression of the kriging model can be expressed as follows 1 y x j 1 k f j x β j z x f t β z in this expression f j x f 1 x f 2 x f k x t is a deterministic function while β j β 1 β 2 β k t denotes the corresponding undetermined parameter estimated by the response value and z x denotes the statistical stochastic process with a zero mean thus the variance of z x is σ 2 as follows 2 cov z x i z x j σ z 2 r xi xj in this expression r x i x j denotes the spatial correlation function between the two sample points x i and x j that are themselves related to just the distance between x i and x j independent of its position rosenbaum and schulz 2012 thus r x i x j usually uses a gaussian function as follows 3 r x i x j k 1 n θ k x i k x j k p k in this expression n is the number of design variables x i k is the k dimensional coordinate of the i th sample point θ k and p k are undetermined coefficients θ k 0 0 p k 2 and k is the dimension of x thus the response y y 1 y n t of known n sample points x x 1 t x n t t can be predicted to be the response of any point x as follows 4 y x f t β r t x r 1 y f β in this expression r t x is the correlation vector between point x and m sample points r t x r x x 1 r x x 2 r x x m while y is the m 1 vector which contains the response value corresponding to m sample points and β can be obtained from the optimal linear unbiased estimation as follows 5 β f t r 1 f 1 f t r 1 y in this expression the estimated value of variance σ z 2 is as follows 6 σ z 2 y f β t r 1 y f β n thus the parameter θ k is given according to the maximum likelihood estimate in other words when θ k 0 the 1 2 n ln σ z 2 ln r is maximized and r is the correlation matrix between m sample points as follows 7 r r x 1 x 1 r x 1 x m r x m x 1 r x m x m 2 2 the optimization model the establishment of an optimization mathematical model is the basis for solving problems in this area in addition decision variables objective functions and constraints comprise the three basic elements of the optimization problem mathematic model yan et al 2008 huang and meng 2009 the objective function is a mathematical expression of the optimization goal expressed by the decision variable and thus the evaluation criterion for the quality of a program constraints comprise the values of the decision variable in optimization and can be applied either as equality or inequality constraints in a mathematical model if some variables are integers some are continuous and there is a nonlinear constraint or a nonlinear objective function such a problem is called mixed integer nonlinear programming this is expressed as follows 8 min f x s t g i x 0 i 1 2 m h j x 0 j 1 2 t in this expression x x 1 x 2 x n t is the decision variable including some discrete integer variables and some that are continuous while f x is the objective function g i x is the inequality constraint m is the total number of inequality constraints h j x is the equality constraint and t is the total number of equality constraints as the discrete integer variable only takes 0 or 1 this model is a 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming model 2 3 genetic algorithm ga a ga is a method for calculating an optimal solution by simulating natural biological evolution and genetic processes this algorithm starts from any population set and generates a new one via the random use of genetic operators including selection crossover and variation individuals in a population are more adaptable to the environment than the above thus through the generation of evolving reproduction the new population will gradually evolve into the search space gradually getting better and better before finally converging to the most suitable population for the environment in which the individual is the optimal solution as follows 2 3 1 coding in practical applications the solution of a problem is generally a real one and these data x are the expression of the ga thus converting real solution data into a binary form is called encoding and the ga converts data of the solution space into genotype string structure of the genetic space before searching the different combinations of these string structure data therefore constitute different points 2 3 2 initial population production in randomly generated n initial string structure data each string structural component is referred to as an individual n of which comprise a group the ga therefore starts the iteration with the n string structure datum as an initial point so the evolutionary algebra counter is t and the maximum evolutionary algebra is t a randomly generated number of m individuals are referred to as the initial population p 0 2 3 3 the self fitness evaluation test a fitness function is used to show the merits of an individual or solution thus for different problems a fitness function is defined in different ways according to the specific problem the fitness of each individual in the population p t is calculated in this step 1 selection in this step the selection operator is applied to the group 2 crossover in this step the crossover operator is applied to the group 3 variation in this step the variation operator is applied to the group the group p t is calculated to obtain the next generation group p t 1 after selection crossover and variation 4 termination condition judgment in this step t t then t becomes t 1 and we proceed to step 2 while if t t then the maximum fitness of an individual is taken as the optimal solution output obtained through the evolution of the process and then the operation is terminated 3 case study 3 1 site overview the study area used in this research is an example of a human hypothesis thus if different from the direct study of practical examples two relative processes are involved in this hypothetical example of which one is the forward process of knowing the characteristics of groundwater pollution sources which also enables prediction of the distribution of pollutant concentrations at each observation well the second comprises an inverse process that identifies the characteristics of groundwater pollution sources based on the actual monitoring data of pollutant concentrations at the observation wells the advantage of this hypothetical example is that a large amount of time is not required to study the complex conditions of the actual contaminated site eliminating the need to establish an identification process and verify the mathematical simulation model directly providing the conditions and parameters of the solution it is possible to emphasize both the key and difficult issues that need to be addressed during the process of identifying pollution sources the system studied in this research comprised a two dimensional domain discretized into 9276 grid blocks as shown in fig 1 a second type boundary condition is also assigned to the ad and bc boundaries respectively while the others are set as no flux as the terrain of the study area is high in the southeast and low in the northwest groundwater flow also occurs in this direction one pollution source and five observation wells are present in this aquifer and the entire simulation time applied was three years this area is also divided into three release periods of which each has a duration of one year the source is assumed to release pollutants during the three release periods thus table 1 and table 2 exhibits aquifer parameters as well as pollution source characteristics the flowchart summarizing the approach is shown in fig 2 3 2 the mathematical simulation model using a conceptual hydrogeological model within the study area the mathematical model of groundwater flow and groundwater solute transport was therefore established using eq 9 9 x k h z h x y k h z h y w μ h t x y d h x y t t 0 h 0 x y x y d k h n s 1 q x y t x y s 1 h n s 2 0 x y s 2 in this expression d is the area for simulation computation h is the groundwater table head m h 0 is the initial water table head m z is the elevation of target aquifer floor m k is hydraulic conductivity m d 1 μ is specific yield dimensionless w is vertical recharge including the discharge strength of the unconfined aquifer m d 1 q is the recharge and discharge quantity of aquifer per unit width m d 1 s 1 is the second type boundary condition s 2 is the no flux boundary n is the direction of outward normal on the boundary and t is the simulation period the mathematical model of groundwater solute transport can therefore be described by eq 20 as follows 10 c t x d xx c x y d yy c y cu x x cu y y i c x y t t 0 c 0 x y x y d nd xx c x cv x s 1 g x y t x y s 1 c y s 2 0 x y s 2 in this expression c is the concentration of groundwater solute mg l 1 c 0 is the initial concentration of groundwater solute mg l 1 d xx and d yy are the hydrodynamic diffusion coefficients in the x and y directions respectively m2 d 1 u x and u y are the components of the actual average flow rate in the x and y directions respectively m d 1 i is the source and sink in terms of the unit time per unit liquid volume within the amount of solute quality increase or decrease g represents the solute mass per unit time through the actual cross section of the boundary and n is the direction of the outward normal on the s 1 boundary 3 3 the kriging surrogate model of the simulation model the surrogate model is an alternative to the input output response of the mathematical simulation model it has a small computational load and takes less time to process therefore use of a surrogate model can effectively simplify the calculations inherent to most mathematical simulation models in this study the release intensities of pollution source were selected as input variables including the contaminant concentrations of observation wells as output variables in the surrogate model a training set of 100 samples and a test set of 20 samples were therefore selected in feasible regions of three input variables via the latin hypercube sampling method and corresponding output variables were obtained by running the mathematical simulation model thus based on training samples the parameters which are the key to the kriging surrogate model are estimated by using ga when fitness values converge the corresponding values of θ can be taken as the final results and each observation well corresponds to the set once a surrogate model has been established it cannot be directly used to replace the actual simulation model but also used to verify the approximate accuracy of the surrogate model with the set of 20 samples we used two evaluation indexes in this study to analyze the approximate accuracy of the kriging surrogate model as follows mean relative error mre was calculated as follows 11 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 root mean square error rmsr was calculated as follows 12 rmsr i 1 n y i y i 2 n in these expressions y i represents the output value of the i sample obtained from the solute transport simulation model while y i is the output value of the i sample derived from the kriging surrogate model in other words the smaller the mre and rmse values the higher the approximation of the surrogate model thus this surrogate model replaces the simulation model when accuracy is achieved 3 4 the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model the identification of groundwater pollution sources is based on limited data thus via the comprehensive utilization of various mathematical methods simulation models to describe groundwater pollution can be inversely solved in this case the surrogate model replaces the original simulation model to identify the relevant source information in the aquifer information about groundwater source therefore includes the number of sources locations and release intensity this information not only includes integer variables such as the number of sources locations and continuous variables such as release intensity this study uses a 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model to achieve the inverse identification of pollution source four potential locations of pollution source p1 p4 were defined randomly of which p3 is the real location of pollution source before decision variables were determined the variables that represent pollution source locations were used as 0 1 integer variables while the release intensities of the pollution source at each time are used as continuous ones seven variables were used for the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model before it was established to include the objective function and constraint conditions the objective function is expressed as the minimum error between the actual concentration and the simulated concentration of the observation while constraint conditions included the emission intensity of pollution source their number and location and the surrogate model of mathematical simulation model for groundwater solute transport the optimization model is expressed as follows 13 min z σ 1 σ 2 σ 7 t k t 1 12 k 1 5 c k t c k t 2 σ j 0 or 1 j 1 2 3 4 σ 1 σ 4 1 c k t f σ 1 σ 2 σ 7 t k 0 σ m 300 m 5 6 7 in this expression c k t and c k t denote simulated values and observations of the contaminant concentration at time t in the observation well k respectively while σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 σ 4 are variables of positions σ 5 σ 6 σ 7 are variables of release intensities and f is the kriging surrogate model of groundwater solute transport simulation model 4 results and discussion 4 1 the accuracy of the kriging surrogate model the kriging surrogate model was incorporated into a matlab ga to solve the inverse pollution source problem the ga was used to search for a release intensity that minimizes discrepancies between actual observations and model calculations before a series of coefficients of gauss functions θ were applied with determine the precision of the surrogate model table 3 to investigate the validity of the surrogate model 20 sets of test samples were introduced into the groundwater solute transport numerical simulation model and its surrogate counterpart respectively thus taking the p1 position as an example the outputs and relative error of the pollutant concentration of the simulation and surrogate model are shown in fig 3 and table 4 respectively the results of the surrogate and numerical simulation models for groundwater solute transport are compared with the evaluation indexes including mre and rmsr table 5 the data presented in fig 3 and table 4 show that the relative error of the observation wells fall between 0 0120 and 2 8684 less than 3 thus as shown in table 5 the mre of the five positions are 1 0085 0 7652 0 1547 1 2351 and 0 4862 which shows that the computed pollutant concentration based on the kriging surrogate model lie very close to the simulation model at the same time there is no significant difference according to the rmse of 20 validation samples from each observation well from table 6 we can figure out that the relative errors of the whole optimization results by using the surrogate model and the simulation model respectively are both small although the calculation accuracy of the surrogate model is lower than that of the simulation model it is not much different therefore the surrogate model can be used for iterative calculations instead of the simulation model calculating each simulation model using gms took 22 s therefore during the process of solving the optimization model of groundwater pollution source identification if the numerical simulation version is called directly then the time required for the optimization algorithm to iterate 6000 times is about 33 33 h while the kriging surrogate just required 0 84 h it is noteworthy that although a considerable amount of time has been spent on training developing and testing the kriging surrogate model less time was spent than on the simulation calls and also has clear advantages the analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the kriging surrogate model can be effectively utilized in pace of a numerical simulation version as it requires less computational and does not entail a sacrifice in accuracy 4 2 results of pollution source identification analysis a ga approach was used to solve the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model with the set main parameters including a population size of 60 fitness scaling ranked stochastic and uniform selection mutation set as constraint dependent crossover scattered and forward migration the results of this analysis are shown in table 6 and fig 4 the results presented in table 7 show that just the identification of p3 is 1 while the rest are 0 this analysis indicates that the exact location of pollution source is p3 while the intensities of the three release periods are 113 95 mg d 212 74 mg d and 157 23 mg d respectively thus as shown in fig 4 the maximum absolute error of identification result is 2 74 mg d while absolute errors between the real release intensity and the identified release intensity are small enhanced identification results show that the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model has clear applicability to identify both the location and release intensity of the pollution source 5 conclusions using the simulation optimization method this paper presents a comprehensive application of mathematical methods including the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model the kriging method and a ga to identify the location and release intensity of the pollution source several conclusions are therefore clear from this research first the results of this study show that the surrogate model established via the kriging method can be used to replace the actual groundwater solute transport simulation model this approach avoids huge computational load and it also has a high fitting accuracy based on the simulation model this method can overcome the limitations of the conventional coupling technique and greatly reduces the computational load caused by directly invoking the simulation model in the solving process of the optimization model as well as saving a great deal of time this approach also presents a clear solution to the problem presented in this study from both potential and practical aspects second a 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model contains both integer and continuous variables and it also reduces the number required to improve the accuracy of identification results therefore the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model can be used to simultaneously identify the location and release intensities of the groundwater pollution source although location identification is accurate and the errors of release intensities are small this approach effectively realizes the simultaneous identification of both location and release intensities and thus avoids a limited ability to identify integer variables inherent to former non linear optimization models including the location of pollution source acknowledgements the

i and x j independent of its position rosenbaum and schulz 2012 thus r x i x j usually uses a gaussian function as follows 3 r x i x j k 1 n θ k x i k x j k p k in this expression n is the number of design variables x i k is the k dimensional coordinate of the i th sample point θ k and p k are undetermined coefficients θ k 0 0 p k 2 and k is the dimension of x thus the response y y 1 y n t of known n sample points x x 1 t x n t t can be predicted to be the response of any point x as follows 4 y x f t β r t x r 1 y f β in this expression r t x is the correlation vector between point x and m sample points r t x r x x 1 r x x 2 r x x m while y is the m 1 vector which contains the response value corresponding to m sample points and β can be obtained from the optimal linear unbiased estimation as follows 5 β f t r 1 f 1 f t r 1 y in this expression the estimated value of variance σ z 2 is as follows 6 σ z 2 y f β t r 1 y f β n thus the parameter θ k is given according to the maximum likelihood estimate in other words when θ k 0 the 1 2 n ln σ z 2 ln r is maximized and r is the correlation matrix between m sample points as follows 7 r r x 1 x 1 r x 1 x m r x m x 1 r x m x m 2 2 the optimization model the establishment of an optimization mathematical model is the basis for solving problems in this area in addition decision variables objective functions and constraints comprise the three basic elements of the optimization problem mathematic model yan et al 2008 huang and meng 2009 the objective function is a mathematical expression of the optimization goal expressed by the decision variable and thus the evaluation criterion for the quality of a program constraints comprise the values of the decision variable in optimization and can be applied either as equality or inequality constraints in a mathematical model if some variables are integers some are continuous and there is a nonlinear constraint or a nonlinear objective function such a problem is called mixed integer nonlinear programming this is expressed as follows 8 min f x s t g i x 0 i 1 2 m h j x 0 j 1 2 t in this expression x x 1 x 2 x n t is the decision variable including some discrete integer variables and some that are continuous while f x is the objective function g i x is the inequality constraint m is the total number of inequality constraints h j x is the equality constraint and t is the total number of equality constraints as the discrete integer variable only takes 0 or 1 this model is a 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming model 2 3 genetic algorithm ga a ga is a method for calculating an optimal solution by simulating natural biological evolution and genetic processes this algorithm starts from any population set and generates a new one via the random use of genetic operators including selection crossover and variation individuals in a population are more adaptable to the environment than the above thus through the generation of evolving reproduction the new population will gradually evolve into the search space gradually getting better and better before finally converging to the most suitable population for the environment in which the individual is the optimal solution as follows 2 3 1 coding in practical applications the solution of a problem is generally a real one and these data x are the expression of the ga thus converting real solution data into a binary form is called encoding and the ga converts data of the solution space into genotype string structure of the genetic space before searching the different combinations of these string structure data therefore constitute different points 2 3 2 initial population production in randomly generated n initial string structure data each string structural component is referred to as an individual n of which comprise a group the ga therefore starts the iteration with the n string structure datum as an initial point so the evolutionary algebra counter is t and the maximum evolutionary algebra is t a randomly generated number of m individuals are referred to as the initial population p 0 2 3 3 the self fitness evaluation test a fitness function is used to show the merits of an individual or solution thus for different problems a fitness function is defined in different ways according to the specific problem the fitness of each individual in the population p t is calculated in this step 1 selection in this step the selection operator is applied to the group 2 crossover in this step the crossover operator is applied to the group 3 variation in this step the variation operator is applied to the group the group p t is calculated to obtain the next generation group p t 1 after selection crossover and variation 4 termination condition judgment in this step t t then t becomes t 1 and we proceed to step 2 while if t t then the maximum fitness of an individual is taken as the optimal solution output obtained through the evolution of the process and then the operation is terminated 3 case study 3 1 site overview the study area used in this research is an example of a human hypothesis thus if different from the direct study of practical examples two relative processes are involved in this hypothetical example of which one is the forward process of knowing the characteristics of groundwater pollution sources which also enables prediction of the distribution of pollutant concentrations at each observation well the second comprises an inverse process that identifies the characteristics of groundwater pollution sources based on the actual monitoring data of pollutant concentrations at the observation wells the advantage of this hypothetical example is that a large amount of time is not required to study the complex conditions of the actual contaminated site eliminating the need to establish an identification process and verify the mathematical simulation model directly providing the conditions and parameters of the solution it is possible to emphasize both the key and difficult issues that need to be addressed during the process of identifying pollution sources the system studied in this research comprised a two dimensional domain discretized into 9276 grid blocks as shown in fig 1 a second type boundary condition is also assigned to the ad and bc boundaries respectively while the others are set as no flux as the terrain of the study area is high in the southeast and low in the northwest groundwater flow also occurs in this direction one pollution source and five observation wells are present in this aquifer and the entire simulation time applied was three years this area is also divided into three release periods of which each has a duration of one year the source is assumed to release pollutants during the three release periods thus table 1 and table 2 exhibits aquifer parameters as well as pollution source characteristics the flowchart summarizing the approach is shown in fig 2 3 2 the mathematical simulation model using a conceptual hydrogeological model within the study area the mathematical model of groundwater flow and groundwater solute transport was therefore established using eq 9 9 x k h z h x y k h z h y w μ h t x y d h x y t t 0 h 0 x y x y d k h n s 1 q x y t x y s 1 h n s 2 0 x y s 2 in this expression d is the area for simulation computation h is the groundwater table head m h 0 is the initial water table head m z is the elevation of target aquifer floor m k is hydraulic conductivity m d 1 μ is specific yield dimensionless w is vertical recharge including the discharge strength of the unconfined aquifer m d 1 q is the recharge and discharge quantity of aquifer per unit width m d 1 s 1 is the second type boundary condition s 2 is the no flux boundary n is the direction of outward normal on the boundary and t is the simulation period the mathematical model of groundwater solute transport can therefore be described by eq 20 as follows 10 c t x d xx c x y d yy c y cu x x cu y y i c x y t t 0 c 0 x y x y d nd xx c x cv x s 1 g x y t x y s 1 c y s 2 0 x y s 2 in this expression c is the concentration of groundwater solute mg l 1 c 0 is the initial concentration of groundwater solute mg l 1 d xx and d yy are the hydrodynamic diffusion coefficients in the x and y directions respectively m2 d 1 u x and u y are the components of the actual average flow rate in the x and y directions respectively m d 1 i is the source and sink in terms of the unit time per unit liquid volume within the amount of solute quality increase or decrease g represents the solute mass per unit time through the actual cross section of the boundary and n is the direction of the outward normal on the s 1 boundary 3 3 the kriging surrogate model of the simulation model the surrogate model is an alternative to the input output response of the mathematical simulation model it has a small computational load and takes less time to process therefore use of a surrogate model can effectively simplify the calculations inherent to most mathematical simulation models in this study the release intensities of pollution source were selected as input variables including the contaminant concentrations of observation wells as output variables in the surrogate model a training set of 100 samples and a test set of 20 samples were therefore selected in feasible regions of three input variables via the latin hypercube sampling method and corresponding output variables were obtained by running the mathematical simulation model thus based on training samples the parameters which are the key to the kriging surrogate model are estimated by using ga when fitness values converge the corresponding values of θ can be taken as the final results and each observation well corresponds to the set once a surrogate model has been established it cannot be directly used to replace the actual simulation model but also used to verify the approximate accuracy of the surrogate model with the set of 20 samples we used two evaluation indexes in this study to analyze the approximate accuracy of the kriging surrogate model as follows mean relative error mre was calculated as follows 11 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 root mean square error rmsr was calculated as follows 12 rmsr i 1 n y i y i 2 n in these expressions y i represents the output value of the i sample obtained from the solute transport simulation model while y i is the output value of the i sample derived from the kriging surrogate model in other words the smaller the mre and rmse values the higher the approximation of the surrogate model thus this surrogate model replaces the simulation model when accuracy is achieved 3 4 the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model the identification of groundwater pollution sources is based on limited data thus via the comprehensive utilization of various mathematical methods simulation models to describe groundwater pollution can be inversely solved in this case the surrogate model replaces the original simulation model to identify the relevant source information in the aquifer information about groundwater source therefore includes the number of sources locations and release intensity this information not only includes integer variables such as the number of sources locations and continuous variables such as release intensity this study uses a 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model to achieve the inverse identification of pollution source four potential locations of pollution source p1 p4 were defined randomly of which p3 is the real location of pollution source before decision variables were determined the variables that represent pollution source locations were used as 0 1 integer variables while the release intensities of the pollution source at each time are used as continuous ones seven variables were used for the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model before it was established to include the objective function and constraint conditions the objective function is expressed as the minimum error between the actual concentration and the simulated concentration of the observation while constraint conditions included the emission intensity of pollution source their number and location and the surrogate model of mathematical simulation model for groundwater solute transport the optimization model is expressed as follows 13 min z σ 1 σ 2 σ 7 t k t 1 12 k 1 5 c k t c k t 2 σ j 0 or 1 j 1 2 3 4 σ 1 σ 4 1 c k t f σ 1 σ 2 σ 7 t k 0 σ m 300 m 5 6 7 in this expression c k t and c k t denote simulated values and observations of the contaminant concentration at time t in the observation well k respectively while σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 σ 4 are variables of positions σ 5 σ 6 σ 7 are variables of release intensities and f is the kriging surrogate model of groundwater solute transport simulation model 4 results and discussion 4 1 the accuracy of the kriging surrogate model the kriging surrogate model was incorporated into a matlab ga to solve the inverse pollution source problem the ga was used to search for a release intensity that minimizes discrepancies between actual observations and model calculations before a series of coefficients of gauss functions θ were applied with determine the precision of the surrogate model table 3 to investigate the validity of the surrogate model 20 sets of test samples were introduced into the groundwater solute transport numerical simulation model and its surrogate counterpart respectively thus taking the p1 position as an example the outputs and relative error of the pollutant concentration of the simulation and surrogate model are shown in fig 3 and table 4 respectively the results of the surrogate and numerical simulation models for groundwater solute transport are compared with the evaluation indexes including mre and rmsr table 5 the data presented in fig 3 and table 4 show that the relative error of the observation wells fall between 0 0120 and 2 8684 less than 3 thus as shown in table 5 the mre of the five positions are 1 0085 0 7652 0 1547 1 2351 and 0 4862 which shows that the computed pollutant concentration based on the kriging surrogate model lie very close to the simulation model at the same time there is no significant difference according to the rmse of 20 validation samples from each observation well from table 6 we can figure out that the relative errors of the whole optimization results by using the surrogate model and the simulation model respectively are both small although the calculation accuracy of the surrogate model is lower than that of the simulation model it is not much different therefore the surrogate model can be used for iterative calculations instead of the simulation model calculating each simulation model using gms took 22 s therefore during the process of solving the optimization model of groundwater pollution source identification if the numerical simulation version is called directly then the time required for the optimization algorithm to iterate 6000 times is about 33 33 h while the kriging surrogate just required 0 84 h it is noteworthy that although a considerable amount of time has been spent on training developing and testing the kriging surrogate model less time was spent than on the simulation calls and also has clear advantages the analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the kriging surrogate model can be effectively utilized in pace of a numerical simulation version as it requires less computational and does not entail a sacrifice in accuracy 4 2 results of pollution source identification analysis a ga approach was used to solve the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model with the set main parameters including a population size of 60 fitness scaling ranked stochastic and uniform selection mutation set as constraint dependent crossover scattered and forward migration the results of this analysis are shown in table 6 and fig 4 the results presented in table 7 show that just the identification of p3 is 1 while the rest are 0 this analysis indicates that the exact location of pollution source is p3 while the intensities of the three release periods are 113 95 mg d 212 74 mg d and 157 23 mg d respectively thus as shown in fig 4 the maximum absolute error of identification result is 2 74 mg d while absolute errors between the real release intensity and the identified release intensity are small enhanced identification results show that the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model has clear applicability to identify both the location and release intensity of the pollution source 5 conclusions using the simulation optimization method this paper presents a comprehensive application of mathematical methods including the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model the kriging method and a ga to identify the location and release intensity of the pollution source several conclusions are therefore clear from this research first the results of this study show that the surrogate model established via the kriging method can be used to replace the actual groundwater solute transport simulation model this approach avoids huge computational load and it also has a high fitting accuracy based on the simulation model this method can overcome the limitations of the conventional coupling technique and greatly reduces the computational load caused by directly invoking the simulation model in the solving process of the optimization model as well as saving a great deal of time this approach also presents a clear solution to the problem presented in this study from both potential and practical aspects second a 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model contains both integer and continuous variables and it also reduces the number required to improve the accuracy of identification results therefore the 0 1 mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model can be used to simultaneously identify the location and release intensities of the groundwater pollution source although location identification is accurate and the errors of release intensities are small this approach effectively realizes the simultaneous identification of both location and release intensities and thus avoids a limited ability to identify integer variables inherent to former non linear optimization models including the location of pollution source acknowledgements the

1612,in this study the natural attenuation of naphthalene during riverbank infiltration was examined using batch experiments the results indicated that as the grain size and the permeability coefficient decreased the natural attenuation rate of naphthalene increased and it was highest in loam 62 and lowest in coarse sand 20 the half life of naphthalene was longest in coarse sand 700 d and shortest in mild clay 250 d facultative anaerobes such as methylophilaceae accounted for about 70 of the total bacteria and played a major role in naphthalene degradation a high total organic carbon concentration and large specific surface area can promote natural attenuation of naphthalene moreover the adsorption to riverbank sediment in the hyporheic zone and bioremediation by indigenous microorganisms can effectively eliminate naphthalene during river water infiltration to the riverbank aquifer keywords natural attenuation naphthalene river bank infiltration liao river 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are composed of two or more fused aromatic rings and 16 pahs have been listed as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa several pahs including naphthalene nap have been classified as carcinogenic compounds by the international agency for research on cancer iarc 1987 to date numerous studies have examined the natural attenuation of nap in various media including the atmosphere lee et al 2001 surface water sediment zhou and maskaoui 2003 zhu et al 2008 rodrigo et al 2016 sarria villa et al 2015 yang et al 2016 mouton et al 2009 and shallow aquifers li et al 2009 barbara et al 2011 yang et al 2013 however few studies have focused on the natural attenuation of nap during riverbank infiltration river banks are active zones for contaminant exchange and attenuation groundwater extraction from areas adjacent to rivers complicates the mechanisms that control contaminant mobilization by increasing the recharge of river water to groundwater which promotes the transport of contaminants in river water in this case nap into aquifers the abundance and species of biota at the groundwater river water interface will also be influenced by the characteristics of sediments in this area alley et al 2002 because of differences between the physical chemical and biological characteristics of river water and groundwater physical chemical and biological gradients will develop during river bank infiltration which will influence nap transformations given the lack of studies of the transformation processes of nap along river bank infiltration zones additional studies investigating this topic are needed natural attenuation the most important transformation process can reduce the toxicity and amounts of pollutants and control pollutant migration dong et al 2015 zhang 2007 therefore studies of natural attenuation play an important role in the evaluation and remediation of environmental contamination natural attenuation includes biodegradation adsorption diffusion and volatilization in the river bank infiltration zone there is little contact of groundwater with gas thus the contribution of volatilization to natural attenuation can be ignored diffusion can reduce the concentration of nap but cannot remove nap from the groundwater biodegradation is the main destructive natural attenuation process of nap and nap can be removed from water through adsorption to soil therefore many studies have investigated the contributions of adsorption and microbial degradation to the natural attenuation of aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater kanzari et al 2014 bahr et al 2015 wang et al 2013 he et al 2014 this study was conducted to determine 1 the contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to natural attenuation of nap during river bank infiltration and 2 the functional microorganisms involved in nap degradation the results of this study will contribute to future control and remediation of pollution in river bank infiltration zones as well as in other similar nap contaminated sites 2 study area the liao river flows through the city of shenyang liaoning province northeastern china the shallow aquifer which receives recharge from river runoff fig 1 is the main groundwater source in this area several years ago the liao river was subject to severe pollution from domestic sewage and industrial and agricultural wastewater testing conducted in 2015 revealed that the concentration of 16 pahs in the liao river reached 1 6 μg l which was close to the limit set in the chinese quality standard for drinking water of 2 μg l people s republic of china ministry of environmental protection 2006 among these 16 pahs the concentration of nap was the highest at 1 4 μg l in the same year the amount of groundwater pumping was 35 280 m3 d in summer and 15 970 m3 d in winter therefore we focused on the natural attenuation of nap in summer in this study the temperature of the liao river water is 25 2 c during summer the hydrogeological conditions in the study area have been investigated in detail by ende 2016 the stratigraphic lithological and hydrogeological characteristics of the shallow aquifer which are shown in the hydrogeological profile line i i fig 2 indicate that the aquifer system includes layers of loam fine sand medium sand and coarse sand fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ranges from 69 8 to 85 9 m d and the hydraulic gradient ranges from 3 2 to 10 6 during summer 3 materials and methods 3 1 soil and riverbed sediment samples before the batch experiments we collected soil and riverbed sediment samples to characterize the lithology of the river bank infiltration area the soil samples were collected from well hjb fig 1 which was 10 m deep and 1 m from the river the soil core was extracted from hjb with an impact corer the soil samples in the core were sectioned every 50 cm with aluminum boxes and sealed with tin foil riverbed sediment samples were collected from 1 m below the riverbed surface with a polyvinyl chloride pipe that was 1 5 m long and had inner and outer diameters of 5 0 and 5 5 cm respectively following collection the pipe was sealed within a foil box the soil grain size specific surface area and total organic carbon toc of the soil and riverbed sediment samples were determined using a laser particle size analyzer bettersize 2000 a specific surface area analyzer jb 2020 and a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph cn200 respectively 3 2 batch experiments of natural attenuation of nap when the microorganisms that live in the pores of the soil samples conduct microbial degradation the soil adsorbs organic pollutants at the same time barbara et al 2011 to determine the characteristics of the microbial degradation process soil and riverbed sediment samples were divided into a sterilized and an unsterilized group and compared 3 2 1 adsorption of nap in different media before the experiments naturally dried samples 10 g of mild clay fine sand medium sand and coarse sand were sterilized in an autoclave at 121 c and a pressure of 0 15 mpa for 25 min the samples were then placed in separate 125 ml brown flasks to which 120 ml aliquots of 30 mg l nap solution at ph 7 8 were added the ph was then tested using litmus paper and adjusted by adding naoh and hcl solution the flasks were subsequently stored in an incubator at 20 c in the dark to mimic the natural environment a batch solution of 40 ml was collected from each flask after 1 2 3 5 10 15 22 30 40 50 and 60 h to ensure the reaction was complete and the residual nap content was measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms blank samples were also prepared and analyzed concurrently to account for potential evaporation of nap 3 2 2 microbial degradation of nap in different media unsterilized soil samples were dried under natural conditions after which experiments were conducted using unsterilized soil samples and the method outlined in section 3 2 1 the results of experiments 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 were then compared to determine the nature of the microbial degradation process 3 2 3 determination of functional microorganisms to determine what types of microorganisms were involved in nap degradation four groups of experiments were designed with different nap solutions and redox conditions table 1 all experimental equipment was sterilized at a temperature of 121 c and a pressure of 0 15 mpa for 25 min next 5 g of the four different media which were divided by soil grain size were placed into 125 ml brown flasks with 95 ml of sterilized distilled water each media had a nap concentration of 0 35 mg kg to collect the bacterial sources the brown flasks were stirred for 20 min after which they were allowed to stand for 60 min the supernatants named a were then stored in 125 ml sterilized erlenmeyer flasks corresponding liquid inorganic base medium 1 l was prepared and the ph was adjusted to between 6 8 and 7 2 next 100 ml of liquid medium was put into a 125 ml erlenmeyer flask and sterilized by autoclaving at 121 c and 0 15 mpa for 20 min the inorganic medium had the following composition mg l kh2po4 1000 k2hpo4 3h2o 1000 nh4 2so4 500 mgso4 7h2o 200 kno3 500 cacl2 10 agar agar 17 000 fecl2 4h2o 1 5 cocl 6h2o 0 19 mnso4 7h2o 0 1 zncl2 0 07 nicl2 6h2o 0 024 na2moo4 h2o 0 024 h3bo3 0 006 cucl 2h2o 0 002 when the water medium had cooled to 80 c 2 ml of the supernatant a was added to the flask to provide the only carbon source for microorganisms an anaerobic environment was then created by passing nitrogen through the two flasks for 30 min to ensure the microorganisms survived the solution was put into a biochemical incubator at 20 c then cultured for 5 d when the culture media were turbid 2 ml 2 inoculation amount was transferred to fresh medium this step was repeated five times to obtain stable bacteria which were named fifth generation microorganisms to observe the morphology of functional bacteria solid media was prepared the fifth generation solutions were diluted 102 times 103 times and 104 times then coated onto the solid medium with nap as the only carbon source samples were then incubated for 4 days at a temperature of 20 c details regarding the different redox condition and concentration of nap named y1 5 y2 5 h1 5 and h2 5 are given in table 1 at the end of the study period the gram stained samples were observed using a leica optical microscope the morphology and dyeing were observed with an oil immersion microscope the developmental phylogenetic trees of the nap degrading bacteria were then determined by 16s rdna sequencing of the metagenome in the laboratory by shanghai bio engineering co ltd 4 results 4 1 grain size and toc concentration of soil samples the riverbed sediments were loam and about 1 m thick table 2 the sediments which had a depth of 0 0 3 m had the largest specific surface area 32 68 m2 g and the highest toc concentrations 7 08 g kg as depth increased the specific surface area and toc concentration became smaller the specific surface area of d1 and d2 was similar but the toc concentration of d1 was larger than that of d2 4 2 natural attenuation of nap the soil and riverbed sediment samples were divided into five groups d1 d2 r1 r2 and r3 based on their properties lithology and depth table 3 according to the batch experiments described in 3 2 1 sterilized loam d1 loam d2 fine sand medium sand and coarse sand adsorbed 50 42 30 21 and 16 of the nap respectively fig 3 moreover the batch experiments described in 3 2 2 revealed that unsterilized d1 d2 r1 r2 and r3 could eliminate 11 11 8 6 and 5 of the nap by microbial degradation fig 3 respectively the loam in the study area could also remove 61 of the nap from groundwater which was comparable to the amount of pahs removed by sewage 61 in a previous study wang et al 2013 4 3 characteristics of nap degrading bacteria the biodegradation curves revealed that the fifth generation bacteria were able to degrade nap fig 4 the four curves were gentle between 0 and 10 h indicating weak degradation of nap during this period the degrading bacteria were adapting to the environment the slopes of the curves were steeper between 10 and 60 h indicating that nap degradation was enhanced by microorganisms while the degrading bacteria were in the logarithmic phase and the stable period after 60 h the slope of the curve became gentler indicating that the degrading bacteria were in the decay stage under anaerobic conditions nap was degraded faster and the degradation rate was greater the data from systems were with not sorption from the training exercise we found that the color and size of the colonies isolated from h1 5 was the same as that of colonies from h2 5 milky white round opaque shiny uneven edges raised surface moist and smooth distributed in the surface layer of solid medium additionally the characteristics of colonies isolated from y1 5 were the same as those from y2 5 milky white small flat distributed below the surface of the culture medium moreover the results showed that the concentration of nap had no effect on bacterial growth through the gram stained test and microscopic observation the bacteria was galanz negative and microbial morphology were irregular short rods dna was extracted from the h2 5 and y2 5 using an e z n a soil dna extraction kit omega and dna sequencing was performed on the target fragment after electrophoresis shanghai biotech bioengineering co ltd following sequencing the results were processed with the uclust v1 1 579 software for otu cluster analysis fig 5 methylophilaceae rhodospirillaceae and burkholderiales accounted for about 65 18 and 7 of the bacteria in the h2 5 samples respectively in the y2 5 samples methylophilaceae burkholderiales and comamonadaceae accounted for about 70 12 and 5 of the total respectively bacillus cereus was the dominant bacteria within the culture medium under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions during the experimental process 5 discussion 5 1 contributions of adsorption and microbial degradation to natural attenuation the relative contribution of adsorption to natural attenuation was 76 80 86 92 and 94 in loam d1 loam d2 fine sand medium sand and coarse sand respectively while that of biodegradation was 23 19 11 7 and 5 respectively fig 3 these findings indicate that there was still some volatile loss 1 4 when compared with the contribution of adsorption and microbial degradation to natural attenuation adsorption plays a greater role than microbial degradation in the natural attenuation of nap under natural conditions the microbial biomass is small and the quantity of the degrading bacteria is much lower thus biodegradation plays a weaker role in natural attenuation however biodegradation is still significant because it can be enhanced by bioremediation procedures such as bioaugmentation and biostimulation deary et al 2015 yu et al 2005a 2005b 5 2 expressed adsorption rate and biodegradation capacity models of adsorption and microbial degradation can bridge gaps in the available data when used to determine the spatial and temporal distributions of contaminant concentrations in various environmental media this type of mathematical model can be used as a precursor to experimental and empirical studies of exposure and health risks posed to human beings and other organisms wang et al 2012 four different models were used to show the relationship between the rate of adsorption at which the nap concentration changes and the time taken for the adsorption process 1 first order kinetics ln c 0 c t k 1 t 2 second order kinetics 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t 3 pseudo first order kinetics ln c e c t lnc e k 1 t 4 pseudo second order kinetics t c 0 c t 1 k 2 c e 2 t c e where k 1 and k 2 are the reaction rate constants for eqs 1 4 and c 0 c t and c e are the initial nap concentrations nap concentrations at time t mg l and the final concentrations of nap in soil samples mg kg respectively and t is time the pseudo second order kinetic model gave the best fit for the kinetic model of the adsorption process and had a coefficient of determination r2 greater than 0 99 table 4 and fig 6 the adsorption rate of nap in the loam was strongest followed by that of fine sand and medium sand while it was weakest for coarse sand the secondary adsorption rate constant of the clay d1 was 0 0037 and the secondary adsorption rate constant of the gravel sand r5 decreased to 0 0026 as the specific surface area of the medium decreased two different models were used to show the relationship between the rate of microbial degradation at which the nap concentration changes and the time taken for the biodegradation process first order decay kinetic model c t c o exp kt 5 6 monod model dc dt q max a c k b c where ct mg l is the nap concentration at time t c0 mg l is the initial nap concentration c mg l is the substrate concentration k d 1 is a first order degradation rate constant and t is time additionally a is the microbial density of the culture q max t 1 is the maximum use of the matrix and kd mg l is the saturation coefficient these models were only applied to the sterilized data to eliminate degradation the relationship between the concentration of nap and time in the four different media fitted the first order kinetic decay kinetic model well with r2 values between 0 66 and 0 86 table 4 the attenuation coefficient of microorganisms was greatest in the clay layer and was lowest in the coarse sand the attenuation coefficient of microorganisms decreased as the particle size of the media increased the half life data indicate that the half life of nap was lowest in loam 250 d but was more than 440 days in the other media table 5 and fig 7 the half life of nap decreased as depth increased when groundwater in the river bank area is exploited nap is degraded effectively in loam however in coarse sand microbial degradation had little effect on the migration and transformation of nap 5 3 analysis of factors affecting the natural attenuation of nap comparison of the natural attenuation rate of loam d1 with that of d2 fine sand medium sand and coarse sand revealed that the rate decreased as the specific area decreased fig 3 the large specific surface area can provide more sites to microorganisms that adsorb nap therefore soil with a large specific surface area can promote natural attenuation comparison of the contribution of adsorption and microbial degradation to natural attenuation in loam with that in fine sand medium sand and coarse sand revealed that a larger specific surface area was associated with greater biodegradation and therefore a greater contribution to natural attenuation fig 3 this is because microorganisms can obtain more nutrition from loam and degrade more nap accordingly the specific surface area in media is a significant factor influencing adsorption the natural attenuation rates and half lives of nap in loam d1 and d2 were similar but the half life of nap in d1 was smaller than that in d2 moreover the contribution of biodegradation was 23 in loam d1 and 19 in loam d2 the lithology of d1 and d2 was similar but the toc concentration of d1 was larger than that of d2 this is because the concentration of toc can only improve the rate of microbial degradation while it cannot make the amount of degradation higher this is evidence that a larger toc concentration of media was associated with a shorter half life of nap therefore the concentration of toc in media is also a significant factor influencing microbial degradation 5 4 characteristics of functional bacteria the microorganisms in loam can degrade nap well this is because the microorganisms and nap are easily attached to the small grain size of the soil particles moreover organic pollutants are more likely to remain in soil with low permeability coefficients where microorganisms can obtain more nutrient sources to grow hence microbial degradation and adsorption mainly occur in the loam layer facultative anaerobes such as methylophilaceae about 70 play a primary role in the degradation of nap with groundwater exploitation oxygen rich river water recharges the groundwater oxygen rich groundwater will inhibit facultative anaerobic growth and weaken the microbial degradation of nap bacillus sp has attracted widespread attention because of its extensive use for the removal of contaminants such as benzene toluene and xylene btx trichloroethylene crude oil and cadmium mukherjee and bordoloi 2012 obayori et al 2009 tripathi et al 2005 weyens et al 2010 indicting their potential for use in in situ remediation 6 conclusion batch natural attenuation experiments considering only adsorption and microbial degradation demonstrated that 1 riverbank sediments in the hyporheic zone can effectively eliminate nap from river water during infiltration of a riverbank aquifer 2 the relative contribution of adsorption to natural attenuation is greater than that of microbial degradation 3 the natural attenuation rate of nap increases as the particle size of the media decreases and the toc concentration of media increases 4 the functional microorganisms degrading nap were shown to mainly be methylophilaceae in the river bank infiltration zone and an anaerobic environment promotes natural attenuation of nap acknowledgments we thank the national natural science foundation of china for the financial support given

1612,in this study the natural attenuation of naphthalene during riverbank infiltration was examined using batch experiments the results indicated that as the grain size and the permeability coefficient decreased the natural attenuation rate of naphthalene increased and it was highest in loam 62 and lowest in coarse sand 20 the half life of naphthalene was longest in coarse sand 700 d and shortest in mild clay 250 d facultative anaerobes such as methylophilaceae accounted for about 70 of the total bacteria and played a major role in naphthalene degradation a high total organic carbon concentration and large specific surface area can promote natural attenuation of naphthalene moreover the adsorption to riverbank sediment in the hyporheic zone and bioremediation by indigenous microorganisms can effectively eliminate naphthalene during river water infiltration to the riverbank aquifer keywords natural attenuation naphthalene river bank infiltration liao river 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are composed of two or more fused aromatic rings and 16 pahs have been listed as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa several pahs including naphthalene nap have been classified as carcinogenic compounds by the international agency for research on cancer iarc 1987 to date numerous studies have examined the natural attenuation of nap in various media including the atmosphere lee et al 2001 surface water sediment zhou and maskaoui 2003 zhu et al 2008 rodrigo et al 2016 sarria villa et al 2015 yang et al 2016 mouton et al 2009 and shallow aquifers li et al 2009 barbara et al 2011 yang et al 2013 however few studies have focused on the natural attenuation of nap during riverbank infiltration river banks are active zones for contaminant exchange and attenuation groundwater extraction from areas adjacent to rivers complicates the mechanisms that control contaminant mobilization by increasing the recharge of river water to groundwater which promotes the transport of contaminants in river water in this case nap into aquifers the abundance and species of biota at the groundwater river water interface will also be influenced by the characteristics of sediments in this area alley et al 2002 because of differences between the physical chemical and biological characteristics of river water and groundwater physical chemical and biological gradients will develop during river bank infiltration which will influence nap transformations given the lack of studies of the transformation processes of nap along river bank infiltration zones additional studies investigating this topic are needed natural attenuation the most important transformation process can reduce the toxicity and amounts of pollutants and control pollutant migration dong et al 2015 zhang 2007 therefore studies of natural attenuation play an important role in the evaluation and remediation of environmental contamination natural attenuation includes biodegradation adsorption diffusion and volatilization in the river bank infiltration zone there is little contact of groundwater with gas thus the contribution of volatilization to natural attenuation can be ignored diffusion can reduce the concentration of nap but cannot remove nap from the groundwater biodegradation is the main destructive natural attenuation process of nap and nap can be removed from water through adsorption to soil therefore many studies have investigated the contributions of adsorption and microbial degradation to the natural attenuation of aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater kanzari et al 2014 bahr et al 2015 wang et al 2013 he et al 2014 this study was conducted to determine 1 the contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to natural attenuation of nap during river bank infiltration and 2 the functional microorganisms involved in nap degradation the results of this study will contribute to future control and remediation of pollution in river bank infiltration zones as well as in other similar nap contaminated sites 2 study area the liao river flows through the city of shenyang liaoning province northeastern china the shallow aquifer which receives recharge from river runoff fig 1 is the main groundwater source in this area several years ago the liao river was subject to severe pollution from domestic sewage and industrial and agricultural wastewater testing conducted in 2015 revealed that the concentration of 16 pahs in the liao river reached 1 6 μg l which was close to the limit set in the chinese quality standard for drinking water of 2 μg l people s republic of china ministry of environmental protection 2006 among these 16 pahs the concentration of nap was the highest at 1 4 μg l in the same year the amount of groundwater pumping was 35 280 m3 d in summer and 15 970 m3 d in winter therefore we focused on the natural attenuation of nap in summer in this study the temperature of the liao river water is 25 2 c during summer the hydrogeological conditions in the study area have been investigated in detail by ende 2016 the stratigraphic lithological and hydrogeological characteristics of the shallow aquifer which are shown in the hydrogeological profile line i i fig 2 indicate that the aquifer system includes layers of loam fine sand medium sand and coarse sand fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ranges from 69 8 to 85 9 m d and the hydraulic gradient ranges from 3 2 to 10 6 during summer 3 materials and methods 3 1 soil and riverbed sediment samples before the batch experiments we collected soil and riverbed sediment samples to characterize the lithology of the river bank infiltration area the soil samples were collected from well hjb fig 1 which was 10 m deep and 1 m from the river the soil core was extracted from hjb with an impact corer the soil samples in the core were sectioned every 50 cm with aluminum boxes and sealed with tin foil riverbed sediment samples were collected from 1 m below the riverbed surface with a polyvinyl chloride pipe that was 1 5 m long and had inner and outer diameters of 5 0 and 5 5 cm respectively following collection the pipe was sealed within a foil box the soil grain size specific surface area and total organic carbon toc of the soil and riverbed sediment samples were determined using a laser particle size analyzer bettersize 2000 a specific surface area analyzer jb 2020 and a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph cn200 respectively 3 2 batch experiments of natural attenuation of nap when the microorganisms that live in the pores of the soil samples conduct microbial degradation the soil adsorbs organic pollutants at the same time barbara et al 2011 to determine the characteristics of the microbial degradation process soil and riverbed sediment samples were divided into a sterilized and an unsterilized group and compared 3 2 1 adsorption of nap in different media before the experiments naturally dried samples 10 g of mild clay fine sand medium sand and coarse sand were sterilized in an autoclave at 121 c and a pressure of 0 15 mpa for 25 min the samples were then placed in separate 125 ml brown flasks to which 120 ml aliquots of 30 mg l nap solution at ph 7 8 were added the ph was then tested using litmus paper and adjusted by adding naoh and hcl solution the flasks were subsequently stored in an incubator at 20 c in the dark to mimic the natural environment a batch solution of 40 ml was collected from each flask after 1 2 3 5 10 15 22 30 40 50 and 60 h to ensure the reaction was complete and the residual nap content was measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms blank samples were also prepared and analyzed concurrently to account for potential evaporation of nap 3 2 2 microbial degradation of nap in different media unsterilized soil samples were dried under natural conditions after which experiments were conducted using unsterilized soil samples and the method outlined in section 3 2 1 the results of experiments 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 were then compared to determine the nature of the microbial degradation process 3 2 3 determination of functional microorganisms to determine what types of microorganisms were involved in nap degradation four groups of experiments were designed with different nap solutions and redox conditions table 1 all experimental equipment was sterilized at a temperature of 121 c and a pressure of 0 15 mpa for 25 min next 5 g of the four different media which were divided by soil grain size were placed into 125 ml brown flasks with 95 ml of sterilized distilled water each media had a nap concentration of 0 35 mg kg to collect the bacterial sources the brown flasks were stirred for 20 min after which they were allowed to stand for 60 min the supernatants named a were then stored in 125 ml sterilized erlenmeyer flasks corresponding liquid inorganic base medium 1 l was prepared and the ph was adjusted to between 6 8 and 7 2 next 100 ml of liquid medium was put into a 125 ml erlenmeyer flask and sterilized by autoclaving at 121 c and 0 15 mpa for 20 min the inorganic medium had the following composition mg l kh2po4 1000 k2hpo4 3h2o 1000 nh4 2so4 500 mgso4 7h2o 200 kno3 500 cacl2 10 agar agar 17 000 fecl2 4h2o 1 5 cocl 6h2o 0 19 mnso4 7h2o 0 1 zncl2 0 07 nicl2 6h2o 0 024 na2moo4 h2o 0 024 h3bo3 0 006 cucl 2h2o 0 002 when the water medium had cooled to 80 c 2 ml of the supernatant a was added to the flask to provide the only carbon source for microorganisms an anaerobic environment was then created by passing nitrogen through the two flasks for 30 min to ensure the microorganisms survived the solution was put into a biochemical incubator at 20 c then cultured for 5 d when the culture media were turbid 2 ml 2 inoculation amount was transferred to fresh medium this step was repeated five times to obtain stable bacteria which were named fifth generation microorganisms to observe the morphology of functional bacteria solid media was prepared the fifth generation solutions were diluted 102 times 103 times and 104 times then coated onto the solid medium with nap as the only carbon source samples were then incubated for 4 days at a temperature of 20 c details regarding the different redox condition and concentration of nap named y1 5 y2 5 h1 5 and h2 5 are given in table 1 at the end of the study period the gram stained samples were observed using a leica optical microscope the morphology and dyeing were observed with an oil immersion microscope the developmental phylogenetic trees of the nap degrading bacteria were then determined by 16s rdna sequencing of the metagenome in the laboratory by shanghai bio engineering co ltd 4 results 4 1 grain size and toc concentration of soil samples the riverbed sediments were loam and about 1 m thick table 2 the sediments which had a depth of 0 0 3 m had the largest specific surface area 32 68 m2 g and the highest toc concentrations 7 08 g kg as depth increased the specific surface area and toc concentration became smaller the specific surface area of d1 and d2 was similar but the toc concentration of d1 was larger than that of d2 4 2 natural attenuation of nap the soil and riverbed sediment samples were divided into five groups d1 d2 r1 r2 and r3 based on their properties lithology and depth table 3 according to the batch experiments described in 3 2 1 sterilized loam d1 loam d2 fine sand medium sand and coarse sand adsorbed 50 42 30 21 and 16 of the nap respectively fig 3 moreover the batch experiments described in 3 2 2 revealed that unsterilized d1 d2 r1 r2 and r3 could eliminate 11 11 8 6 and 5 of the nap by microbial degradation fig 3 respectively the loam in the study area could also remove 61 of the nap from groundwater which was comparable to the amount of pahs removed by sewage 61 in a previous study wang et al 2013 4 3 characteristics of nap degrading bacteria the biodegradation curves revealed that the fifth generation bacteria were able to degrade nap fig 4 the four curves were gentle between 0 and 10 h indicating weak degradation of nap during this period the degrading bacteria were adapting to the environment the slopes of the curves were steeper between 10 and 60 h indicating that nap degradation was enhanced by microorganisms while the degrading bacteria were in the logarithmic phase and the stable period after 60 h the slope of the curve became gentler indicating that the degrading bacteria were in the decay stage under anaerobic conditions nap was degraded faster and the degradation rate was greater the data from systems were with not sorption from the training exercise we found that the color and size of the colonies isolated from h1 5 was the same as that of colonies from h2 5 milky white round opaque shiny uneven edges raised surface moist and smooth distributed in the surface layer of solid medium additionally the characteristics of colonies isolated from y1 5 were the same as those from y2 5 milky white small flat distributed below the surface of the culture medium moreover the results showed that the concentration of nap had no effect on bacterial growth through the gram stained test and microscopic observation the bacteria was galanz negative and microbial morphology were irregular short rods dna was extracted from the h2 5 and y2 5 using an e z n a soil dna extraction kit omega and dna sequencing was performed on the target fragment after electrophoresis shanghai biotech bioengineering co ltd following sequencing the results were processed with the uclust v1 1 579 software for otu cluster analysis fig 5 methylophilaceae rhodospirillaceae and burkholderiales accounted for about 65 18 and 7 of the bacteria in the h2 5 samples respectively in the y2 5 samples methylophilaceae burkholderiales and comamonadaceae accounted for about 70 12 and 5 of the total respectively bacillus cereus was the dominant bacteria within the culture medium under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions during the experimental process 5 discussion 5 1 contributions of adsorption and microbial degradation to natural attenuation the relative contribution of adsorption to natural attenuation was 76 80 86 92 and 94 in loam d1 loam d2 fine sand medium sand and coarse sand respectively while that of biodegradation was 23 19 11 7 and 5 respectively fig 3 these findings indicate that there was still some volatile loss 1 4 when compared with the contribution of adsorption and microbial degradation to natural attenuation adsorption plays a greater role than microbial degradation in the natural attenuation of nap under natural conditions the microbial biomass is small and the quantity of the degrading bacteria is much lower thus biodegradation plays a weaker role in natural attenuation however biodegradation is still significant because it can be enhanced by bioremediation procedures such as bioaugmentation and biostimulation deary et al 2015 yu et al 2005a 2005b 5 2 expressed adsorption rate and biodegradation capacity models of adsorption and microbial degradation can bridge gaps in the available data when used to determine the spatial and temporal distributions of contaminant concentrations in various environmental media this type of mathematical model can be used as a precursor to experimental and empirical studies of exposure and health risks posed to human beings and other organisms wang et al 2012 four different models were used to show the relationship between the rate of adsorption at which the nap concentration changes and the time taken for the adsorption process 1 first order kinetics ln c 0 c t k 1 t 2 second order kinetics 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t 3 pseudo first order kinetics ln c e c t lnc e k 1 t 4 pseudo second order kinetics t c 0 c t 1 k 2 c e 2 t c e where k 1 and k 2 are the reaction rate constants for eqs 1 4 and c 0 c t and c e are the initial nap concentrations nap concentrations at time t mg l and the final concentrations of nap in soil samples mg kg respectively and t is time the pseudo second order kinetic model gave the best fit for the kinetic model of the adsorption process and had a coefficient of determination r2 greater than 0 99 table 4 and fig 6 the adsorption rate of nap in the loam was strongest followed by that of fine sand and medium sand while it was weakest for coarse sand the secondary adsorption rate constant of the clay d1 was 0 0037 and the secondary adsorption rate constant of the gravel sand r5 decreased to 0 0026 as the specific surface area of the medium decreased two different models were used to show the relationship between the rate of microbial degradation at which the nap concentration changes and the time taken for the biodegradation process first order decay kinetic model c t c o exp kt 5 6 monod model dc dt q max a c k b c where ct mg l is the nap concentration at time t c0 mg l is the initial nap concentration c mg l is the substrate concentration k d 1 is a first order degradation rate constant and t is time additionally a is the microbial density of the culture q max t 1 is the maximum use of the matrix and kd mg l is the saturation coefficient these models were only applied to the sterilized data to eliminate degradation the relationship between the concentration of nap and time in the four different media fitted the first order kinetic decay kinetic model well with r2 values between 0 66 and 0 86 table 4 the attenuation coefficient of microorganisms was greatest in the clay layer and was lowest in the coarse sand the attenuation coefficient of microorganisms decreased as the particle size of the media increased the half life data indicate that the half life of nap was lowest in loam 250 d but was more than 440 days in the other media table 5 and fig 7 the half life of nap decreased as depth increased when groundwater in the river bank area is exploited nap is degraded effectively in loam however in coarse sand microbial degradation had little effect on the migration and transformation of nap 5 3 analysis of factors affecting the natural attenuation of nap comparison of the natural attenuation rate of loam d1 with that of d2 fine sand medium sand and coarse sand revealed that the rate decreased as the specific area decreased fig 3 the large specific surface area can provide more sites to microorganisms that adsorb nap therefore soil with a large specific surface area can promote natural attenuation comparison of the contribution of adsorption and microbial degradation to natural attenuation in loam with that in fine sand medium sand and coarse sand revealed that a larger specific surface area was associated with greater biodegradation and therefore a greater contribution to natural attenuation fig 3 this is because microorganisms can obtain more nutrition from loam and degrade more nap accordingly the specific surface area in media is a significant factor influencing adsorption the natural attenuation rates and half lives of nap in loam d1 and d2 were similar but the half life of nap in d1 was smaller than that in d2 moreover the contribution of biodegradation was 23 in loam d1 and 19 in loam d2 the lithology of d1 and d2 was similar but the toc concentration of d1 was larger than that of d2 this is because the concentration of toc can only improve the rate of microbial degradation while it cannot make the amount of degradation higher this is evidence that a larger toc concentration of media was associated with a shorter half life of nap therefore the concentration of toc in media is also a significant factor influencing microbial degradation 5 4 characteristics of functional bacteria the microorganisms in loam can degrade nap well this is because the microorganisms and nap are easily attached to the small grain size of the soil particles moreover organic pollutants are more likely to remain in soil with low permeability coefficients where microorganisms can obtain more nutrient sources to grow hence microbial degradation and adsorption mainly occur in the loam layer facultative anaerobes such as methylophilaceae about 70 play a primary role in the degradation of nap with groundwater exploitation oxygen rich river water recharges the groundwater oxygen rich groundwater will inhibit facultative anaerobic growth and weaken the microbial degradation of nap bacillus sp has attracted widespread attention because of its extensive use for the removal of contaminants such as benzene toluene and xylene btx trichloroethylene crude oil and cadmium mukherjee and bordoloi 2012 obayori et al 2009 tripathi et al 2005 weyens et al 2010 indicting their potential for use in in situ remediation 6 conclusion batch natural attenuation experiments considering only adsorption and microbial degradation demonstrated that 1 riverbank sediments in the hyporheic zone can effectively eliminate nap from river water during infiltration of a riverbank aquifer 2 the relative contribution of adsorption to natural attenuation is greater than that of microbial degradation 3 the natural attenuation rate of nap increases as the particle size of the media decreases and the toc concentration of media increases 4 the functional microorganisms degrading nap were shown to mainly be methylophilaceae in the river bank infiltration zone and an anaerobic environment promotes natural attenuation of nap acknowledgments we thank the national natural science foundation of china for the financial support given

1613,a four decade dataset 1974 2013 of 107 823 nitrate samples in 25 993 wells from western and eastern parts of nebraska was used to assess long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration and decadal changes in the extent of groundwater nitrate contaminated areas no3 n 10 mg n l over the entire state spatial statistics and regressions were used to investigate the relationships between groundwater nitrate concentrations and several potential natural and anthropogenic factors including soil drainage capacities vadose zone characteristics crop production areas and irrigation systems the results of this study show that there is no statistically significant trend in groundwater nitrate concentrations in western nebraska in contrast with the increasing trend p 05 to the east the spatial extent and nitrate concentrations in contaminated groundwater in center pivot irrigated areas was less than in gravity irrigated areas areas with a thicker vadose zone and larger saturated thickness of the aquifer have relatively lower nitrate concentrations the results of a classification and regression tree cart model indicate the difference in the influence of physical factors on groundwater nitrate concentrations between western and eastern nebraska namely that groundwater nitrate concentrations correspond with vadose zone thickness effective hydraulic conductivity and saturated thickness in the west while in eastern nebraska concentrations are correlated with average percent sand in the topsoil 0 150 cm well depth and effective hydraulic conductivity keywords groundwater nitrate contamination agricultural vadose zone and climatic factors cart method nebraska 1 introduction nebraska an agriculturally intensive state in the mid western united states u s has a large number of wells with nitrate concentrations above the drinking water standard of 10 mg no3 n l ndeq 2015 the high plains ogallala aquifer hpoa is a major alluvial aquifer that extends from south dakota in the north to texas in the south and supplies tremendous amounts of water for agricultural municipal and industrial uses about two thirds of the water in the hpoa is in nebraska which also contains a number of large rivers with dams and canal diversions groundwater irrigation in nebraska has increased significantly over the past six decades with the adoption of center pivots which replaced traditional flood irrigation methods now more than 3 4 million hectares of land rely on groundwater from the hpoa to irrigate crops in nebraska usda 2014 while nitrate may occur naturally in groundwater a major cause of high nitrate occurrence in nebraska s wells is the extensive fertilizer application across the state stanton and lynne 2006 gurdak and qi 2006 gurdak et al 2009 exner et al 2014 particularly in irrigated fields consumption of water with elevated nitrate concentrations can cause health problems primarily for infants its effects are called blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia which is caused by the inability of the blood to deliver enough oxygen to the infant s body as described by comly 1945 in 1962 the u s public health service officially recommended a nitrate standard of 10 mg no3 n l for drinking water u s public health service 1962 though other countries have tighter standards the u s has retained this 10 mg no3 n l to the present day sattelmacher 1962 simon et al 1964 kross et al 1995 nas 1995 u s epa 2004 2007 2017 tiemann 2017 generally large amounts of nitrogen fertilizers and irrigation are applied annually in agricultural areas of nebraska to increase and maintain agricultural production and crop yields spalding 1975 exner and spalding 1976 adelman et al 1985 grassini et al 2012 ferguson 2015 consequently nitrate contamination in nebraska s groundwater occurs primarily from nitrate leaching in agricultural areas although these practices and risks are distributed widely across the state some parts of the hpoa are more vulnerable than others for example due to soil drainage characteristics at the land surface spalding and exner 1993 nolan et al 1997 exner et al 2010 2014 rising nitrate concentrations in groundwater has prompted nebraska s natural resources districts nrds to begin implementing groundwater management plans for quality and quantity in the mid 1980s nrd 2017 the central platte nrd cpnrd plan is representative of those adopted throughout the state of nebraska for groundwater quality management although each of the 23 nrds is free to enact regulations tailored to local conditions the cpnrd groundwater quality management program gwqmp was initiated in 1988 and involves a phased approach to nitrogen management cpnrd 2016 the cpnrd defined four classes of nitrate contamination phase i ii iii and iv these classes correspond to nitrate concentrations of 7 5 mg l phase i 7 6 15 mg l phase ii 15 mg l phase iii and areas where the rate of decline in no3 n concentrations have not been satisfactory phase iv cpnrd 2016 within these areas the timing and application rates of nitrogen fertilizer on irrigated agriculture are regulated differently as presented in supplemental information table s1 although nebraska nrds have intensively monitored the extent of nitrate contamination in groundwater as published in the nebraska groundwater quality monitoring report ndeq 2015 and many researchers and managers have made efforts to minimize the impact of irrigated crop production on the occurrence of nitrate in nebraska s groundwater it continues to be challenging to control nitrate contamination table s2 this is likely due to the complexity of the aquifer system and difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of the best management practices bmps from the gwqmp in reducing areas of nitrate contamination in groundwater previous studies by exner et al 2010 2014 have analyzed long term groundwater nitrate concentration trends in several regions of eastern nebraska but their analysis did not include the more rural semi arid west which is also extensively cultivated dappen et al 2007 additionally the agricultural areas are expanding in western nebraska dappen et al 2007 hiller et al 2009 potentially impacting the groundwater quality due to significant n fertilizer application exner and spalding 1994 usgs reports have indicated widespread nitrate contamination in both eastern and western nebraska verstraeten and ellis 1994 verstraeten et al 1994 1998 there is a significant difference in climate precipitation and irrigation practices across the state western nebraska is drier with greater temperature extremes the predominant bedrock is older gutentag et al 1984 which means the landscape is less flat soil texture is coarser than in many of the easternmost parts of the state and hydraulic conductivity is lower in the aquifer one purpose of this study is the analysis of the long term groundwater nitrate concentration trends in western nebraska which will help increase understanding the occurrence of nitrate contamination in groundwater examining the commonalities and distinctions between the eastern and western parts of the state will help in planning the policy for the protection of groundwater from nitrate contamination furthermore we employ a statistical classification method to establish the correlations among interrelated factors which may be important to nitrate concentrations in the east and west which have not been considered in previous studies such as exner et al 2014 whose landmark study of eastern nebraska demonstrated the increasing trends in nitrate over the course of three decades this assessment goes beyond nolan et al 1997 and nolan and hitt 2006 who demonstrated that many states including nebraska are threatened with nitrate contamination in groundwater several studies have attempted to identify sources of groundwater nitrate contamination based on the local analysis in various parts of the united states van der schans et al 2009 lockhart et al 2013 murgulet and tick 2013 as a supplement to these nationwide surveys the research presented here shows the spatial temporal changes of nitrate contamination in groundwater on a local to regional scale for the entire state of nebraska nitrate may be influenced by many factors some continuous e g vadose zone thickness thickness of the aquifer depth to groundwater etc and others categorical e g type of well domestic irrigation or monitoring presence of barnyard within the property older or newer wells etc for the analysis of large data sets the classification and regression tree cart is one of the most commonly used decision tree tools cart can be used to analyze complex interactions among predictors based on regression equations particularly when there is a large amount of data with many variables zhang et al 2003 qi et al 2010 for example burow et al 2010 used cart to identify the relative significance of n inputs biogeochemical processes and physical aquifer properties in explaining nitrate concentrations in groundwater in this study we evaluate additional influential factors which were not considered in burow et al 2010 such as soil drainage classes percent sand and organic matter in the topsoil and weather data in addition we develop cart models to predict groundwater nitrate concentrations based on the presence or degree of these factors as mentioned above nebraska has clear differences in hydrogeology and spatial characterizations between western and eastern parts e g rainfall amounts soil texture population growth and crop varieties thus studies of groundwater nitrate contamination should be considered in each region of nebraska in order to identify the local causes of leaching and solutions to nitrate occurrence in nebraska s groundwater the objectives of this study include i to estimate the long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentrations in western and eastern nebraska ii to examine four decades 1974 2013 of change in the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate concentrations and iii to evaluate relationships between high groundwater nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l and potential natural e g weather and soil drainage and anthropogenic e g crop production and price well type and irrigation system factors using cart this complements the work by exner et al 2014 for the years 1981 2010 in eastern nebraska in part by considering a time series that is 33 longer 40 years rather than 30 years as well as including the western part of the state this also complements the national scale analysis of nolan and hitt 2006 which contextualizes the local risk of nitrate contamination in groundwater occurring in the high plains shallower wells are likely to have higher contamination levels than deeper wells older wells typically have higher contamination than newer wells and could be linked to construction techniques spalding and exner 1993 the higher the number of screen zones and the longer the total screen length the higher the chance for the well to capture the groundwater from the aquifer from all depths high organic matter tends to preserve soil structure a higher percentage of sand and organics allows greater infiltration water to the underlying aquifer thick vadose zones attenuate the movement of chemicals a deeper aquifer may have some dilution effect on contaminants reaching the water table precipitation prior to planting and during the growing season affects recharge temperature is likely to affect plant evapotranspiration if the land applied nitrogen load is high at land surface there will likey be more nitrate available to leach to groundwater as a portion may not be utilized by plants many of these factors are not independent for example a shallow well is more likely to be installed where the water table is close to the land surface which may also co occur with sandier soils that permit more recharge monitoring wells may have higher nitrate concentrations by virtue of purposeful installation in locations known to be contaminated this study highlights the use of cart to identify the relative importance of these interdependent factors suggesting possible causal mechanisms for nitrate contamination in eastern and western nebraska that can be further investigated using process based modeling to get specific causal information for smaller areas the goal of this paper is to use three statistical techniques spatial interpolation pairwise regression and cart to identify patterns of nitrate contamination in nebraska each of these techniques can help to demonstrate the factors that are associated with nitrate contamination in both space and time 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area in western and eastern nebraska the study area is the state of nebraska representing a geographic area of 200 000 km2 between latitude 40 n to 43 n and longitude 95 19 w to 104 03 w nebraska has two

also shown in fig 1 2 2 data collection and analysis 2 2 1 groundwater nitrate data a total of 107 823 nitrate concentration measurements were obtained from 25 993 wells distributed across 6282 wells in the western part and 19 711 wells in the eastern part of nebraska for the time period from 1974 until 2013 from the quality assessed agrichemical contaminant database for nebraska groundwater http dnrdata dnr ne gov clearinghouse unl 2000 most of the samples were taken in eastern nebraska 76 of total samples during 1974 to 2013 which has a higher population and greater density of agricultural land well types are shown in table 1 irrigation wells in the dataset have the longest screened intervals with an average of 24 m compared with 7 m for domestic wells and 5 m for monitoring wells most irrigation wells are screened for their entire length in contrast with other well types which are not screened near the surface monitoring wells are commonly shallow with an average well depth of 24 m the average well depths of domestic and irrigation wells are 43 m and 69 m respectively more comparative descriptions of these well types between western and eastern nebraska such as well depths screen zones pumping capacities construction details etc are in table 2 for groundwater nitrate assessment the nrds and ndeq collect samples during july and august every year ndeq 2015 samples are usually taken from a tap near the well head wells which are not in continuous operation are pumped for at least 2 h before water is sampled schepers et al 1991 exner et al 2014 all samples are collected in polyethylene bottles and immediately put on ice until delivered for laboratory analysis samples are analyzed using the epa approved cadmium reduction method or hach epa equivalent compliant methods exner et al 2005 ndeq 2015 to evaluate groundwater nitrate trends if more than one concentration was reported in a well in a year the maximum concentration was selected because the maximum concentration is important for health the dataset of maximum concentrations for all individual wells was divided into two groups one for the western half of nebraska and the other for the eastern part the concentrations within western and eastern nebraska were then averaged for each year 2 2 2 spatial characterization data the distribution of irrigated and non irrigated row crops was available from the mirad us project under the usgs early warning and environmental monitoring program usgs 2015 and the 2005 nebraska land use map university of nebraska lincoln 2010 the data for irrigation systems in nebraska were obtained from the university of nebraska lincoln conservation and survey division school of natural resources 2015 and the center for advanced land management information technologies 2005 nebraska land use map university of nebraska lincoln 2010 the spatial map of soil drainage capacities was made in accordance with exner et al 2014 by consolidating the seven drainage classifications of the soil survey geographic database usda 2015 into three groups excessively well drained well drained and poorly drained the spatial maps of corn and soybean production years were created by stacking raster layers of annual data from the national agricultural statistics service nass cropland data layer usda nass 2015 2 2 3 weather and crop price data weather data were collected from 48 stations of the hprcc http hprcc6 unl edu cgi hpcc home cgi automated weather data network awdn and 201 noaa stations http www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datatools findstation daily data included precipitation wind speed solar radiation relative humidity maximum average and minimum temperatures and potential evapotranspiration etp across the study area during 2004 and 2013 soil nitrate which can be derived from most nitrogen materials in commercial fertilizers biomass and animal wastes is highly soluble in water and can easily be transported through soil to groundwater with recharge from agricultural land evapotranspiration et is a highly variable and yet significant driving force usgs 2000 that is a primary determinant of the amount and timing of recharge et affects nitrate concentrations in groundwater through changes to the water balance especially by decreasing recharge because most of the area where groundwater is exposed to nitrate contamination is fully irrigated and therefore unlikely to experience any long term moisture deficit the potential evapotranspiration etp is a good approximation for the actual et in this study etp is calculated on a daily time step using the penman monteith pm equation with a fixed surface resistance of 45 s m 1 and fixed plant height of 0 5 m for a reference surface of grass and alfalfa monteith 1965 assuming that n applied per acre is independent of the number of acres in production increasing crop land areas leads to more total n fertilizer application typical n application rates for corn and soybeans in nebraska are 180 kg ha based on an anticipated yield of 150 bu ac and 100 kg ha in a case of nitrogen deficiency in soil respectively shapiro et al 2008 ferguson et al 2006 a higher corn price shifts the corn soybean rotation in favor of continuous corn and encourages more fertilizer use thus trends in total n fertilizer should be considered in the context of trends in corn price historical corn prices were obtained from the department of agricultural and consumer economics of the college of agricultural consumer and environmental sciences at the university of illinois farmdoc illinois edu manage pricehistory price history html 2 3 groundwater nitrate contaminated areas to differentiate factors controlling leaching and vulnerability to contamination areas with high groundwater nitrate concentration were first identified and delineated outlined areas of nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l were created using arcgis 10 3 1 the nitrate concentration in each well during each decade 1974 1983 1984 1993 1994 2003 2004 2013 was computed across 2 km by 2 km grid cells using the point to raster conversion tool spatial analysis tools interpolation reclassify and contour were used on grid cells with average concentration 10 mg no3 n l if more than one concentration was reported in a well in a year the concentrations were averaged in contrast with the trend analysis section 2 2 1 in which the greatest measured concentration was used in a year the average concentration was more representative for spatial comparison among wells because spatial interpolations are sensitive to outliers four methods of interpolation in arcgis 10 3 1 inverse distance weighting ordinary kriging interpolation from contours and natural neighbor were compared for spatially estimating averaged values of nitrate concentrations from wells in table 1 this includes data from some multi level monitoring wells including from studies involving nitrates from point sources which are not representative of nitrates from agricultural drainage monitoring wells represented up to 30 of wells in the west 2004 2014 and up to 14 of wells in the east 1984 1993 nitrate levels from multi level monitoring wells were averaged across depths before interpolation since only one value can be used for a given location in any of the above interpolation methods the selected interpolation methods were cross validated by reserving 10 of known data points from the database for error assessment the results indicated that the natural neighbor method had the smallest error as calculated by the root mean square error fig s1 and the percent of error table s3 and so this method was used to delineate areas of high nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l our methodology is different from the previous study by exner et al 2014 which used the topo to raster contour interpolation tool for determining the areas of high nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l and excluded multi level monitoring wells 2 4 cart model for estimating groundwater nitrate concentrations 2 4 1 methodology for the cart analysis cart is a useful and popular tool in the field of data science in this study the program language r was selected to estimate the indicators for splitting nodes using the package rpart loh 2011 according to the description of breiman et al 1984 a cart model is principally built for classifying and predicting responses to covariates based on three steps including tree growing pruning and optimizing fig 2 tree growing requires two steps as described in the name of the tool classification and regression the first step uses a classification tree a recursive partitioning technique to run several variables against the or dependent variable to find the most robust and consistent method of sorting the observations into groups based on their similarity the program checks the greatest improvement of the purity score of the resultant nodes categories to identify the best splitter in the case of the categorical variable as well as alternative splitters surrogates that would create similar groups thus cart splits the samples into populations with similar attributes ensuring that the resulting populations are as similar to each other and as different from other groupings as possible for discrete inputs such as well type in this analysis the classification is evaluated using a metric known as a gini coefficient breiman et al 1984 the regression tree which is generated for continuous input variables such as screen depth and sand content has the same procedure with the classification tree except it uses the variance between groups as the indicator instead of the gini coefficient cart automatically splits the observations into a large number of small subgroups with very similar characteristics but only the first several splits are likely to be statistically significant therefore it is necessary to get rid of the smallest branches in the decision tree after generating a detailed decision tree from the combination of classification group membership and regression group values fig s2 the second step of the cart methodology is tree pruning pruning cuts the branches of the tree to reduce over fitting thereby increasing the ability of new data prediction in the decision tree mingers 1989 in cart the minimum cost complexity pruning method is used to optimize the decision tree typically the cost complexity pruning threshold of the decision tree is considered equivalent to the decision tree error the final step in cart involves evaluating the pruned trees using the split test method which is one method of examining the optimal tree dobbin and simon 2011 the observed data are divided into two groups one for training and the other for testing the groundwater nitrate concentration dataset within the contaminated area no3 n 10 mg n l during 2004 2013 was randomly separated into two subsets 80 of the data 12 880 samples as the model training observations and 20 of the data 2000 samples as the testing observations in this study the groundwater nitrate concentration was the target value whereas weather conditions well and soil characteristics and surface nitrate nitrogen loading for each well were chosen as the potential contributing factors based on a literature review tables 4 and 5 groundwater nitrate concentrations were estimated and evaluated by a cart model through the procedure of growing pruning and optimizing based on the optimal tree an overview of cart methodology is presented in fig 2 and the principal equations of the cart model are described in table 3 2 4 2 factors for cart modeling a cart model was created to identify the most significant factors affecting nitrate concentrations in nebraska s groundwater beginning with 13 potentially influential factors divided into four groups these included well attributes soil and vadose zone characteristics weather conditions and surface nitrate nitrogen load around each well see table 4 selection of these factors was also influenced by the availability of data figs 3 and 4 present box plots and trend lines of vadose zone characteristics well depth saturated thickness and vadose zone thickness with nitrate sample data for three major well types domestic irrigation and monitoring within the contaminated area 2004 2013 in western and eastern nebraska the monitoring well data used in these regressions includes data from multi level monitoring wells for studies in eastern nebraska which were not used for cart analysis although they were used for spatial interpolation wells in a large part of eastern nebraska exhibited shallower average well depth less saturated thickness of the aquifer and smaller vadose zone thickness along with a correlation of increasing nitrate concentrations with depths in wells of all types domestic irrigation and monitoring wells as shown in figs 3 and 4 the contrasting shape of the regression in nitrate concentrations in domestic irrigation and monitoring wells probably occurs from differences in well attributes such as screen depths well diameters etc the fitted correlation of median well depth saturated thickness of aquifer and vadose zone thickness with nitrate concentrations in monitoring wells presents an exponential relationship with r2 of 0 98 0 99 and 0 97 respectively comparatively a linear relationship is found only in irrigation wells with r2 of 0 77 well depth 0 66 saturated thickness and 0 94 vadose zone thickness deeper well depths and larger thicknesses of saturated and vadose zones are associated with lower nitrate concentrations in groundwater the shallow well depth and smaller thicknesses of the saturated and vadose zones in the 0 50 ft i e 0 15 m range of monitoring wells have definitively higher nitrate concentrations than in domestic and irrigation wells the well attributes e g screen depths and well diameters likely impact groundwater nitrate concentrations by affecting the part of the aquifer that the well draws from particularly in the vertical profile of nitrate based on these regressions it is a valid concern that data from monitoring irrigation and domestic wells might not be comparable in particular monitoring wells are often put into place in areas of known nitrate contamination however cart analysis explicitly shows that in western nebraska monitoring wells in areas with a thin vadose zone and high hydraulic conductivity have more in common in terms of nitrate concentrations with irrigation and domestic wells in areas with a thin vadose zone and high hydraulic conductivity than with other monitoring wells that do not share these physical and geographical characteristics no monitoring wells were included in the cart analysis for eastern nebraska in the western part of nebraska domestic and monitoring wells have lower nitrate concentrations where the vadose zone is thicker except for irrigation wells there are no obvious correlations of nitrate concentration with well depth and saturated thickness of the aquifer eastern nebraska has higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater than in the west interestingly at the same depth to water table or vadose zone thickness groundwater nitrate concentrations in the east are higher than in the west the difference in soil properties and other conditions between western and eastern nebraska as well as higher rainfall recharge and n inputs in the east likely plays a significant role in predicting nitrate concentrations in groundwater note that while trends in groundwater concentrations over time were different between domestic irrigation and monitoring wells the type of well was not a significant factor in absolute nitrate concentrations according to the cart model the type of well was included as an input factor when creating the cart model and if the mean groundwater nitrate concentration were significantly different among the types of wells cart would have identified this factor as part of the classification tree instead well type was identified in the west as a surrogate split in node 22 whereas everything beyond node 5 was considered statistically insignificant in eastern nebraska no monitoring well data was used for cart analysis the depth from the land surface to the water table referred to as vadose zone thickness was estimated from a map of the depth to water this was combined with the groundwater nitrate sample database of the university of nebraska lincoln unl between 1974 and 2013 using the extract values to points tool in arcgis 10 3 1 the depth to water map was created using the kriging interpolation tool using water depth data from 206 061 registered wells collected by the department of natural resources dnr in nebraska http www dnr ne gov groundwater data saturated thickness was estimated from the difference between the well depth and the estimated depth to water table from the estimation of the thickness of saturated zone we found that many wells do not extend to the bottom of the aquifer in nebraska while the hpoa is known for its rapid depletion due to unsustainable use scanlon et al 2012 mcguire 2017 haacker et al 2016 the depth to water in nebraska has remained much more stable than the depth to water in other areas that rely on the aquifer for irrigation such as the kansas and texas high plains average percent of sand and organic matter om in the top soil 0 150 cm were estimated from a map of a soil layer with the soil survey geography ssurgo mapunit key mukey each mukey is associated with specific soil characteristics sand silt clay organic matter etc the soil layer was downloaded from ssurgo using the web soil survey wss operated by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs wss 2017 effective hydraulic conductivity keff was calculated from soil texture layers in the test hole collected by the school of natural resources snr at the university of nebraska lincoln unl snr unl 2017 the keff was estimated based on vertical flow through soil layers the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks in each soil layer was predicted by the pedotransfer function in the rosetta database in hydrus 1d based on soil textures which were obtained from the unl csd test hole database weather data including monthly precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperature were collected from the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism climate group provided by the oregon state university prism 2017 land use nitrate export coefficients were used for determining the annual average nitrate loading around each well under each year during 2004 2013 the land use data layers 2004 2013 were collected from the u s department of agriculture usda nass 2016 the nitrate export coefficient for each land cover which can indicate the amount of nitrates available for leaching from the surface due to inputs of fertilizers crop residues and atmospheric deposition reckhow and simpson 1980 were found using literature sources such as parn et al 2012 and keeler and polasky 2014 in this study we used the nitrate export coefficients from keeler and polasky 2014 as shown in table 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration fig 5 presents long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration 1974 2013 in western and eastern nebraska average annual groundwater nitrate concentrations in eastern nebraska are increasing p 05 probably due to an increase in the intensity of crop production and the adoption of center pivots nitrate concentrations remain stable in the west despite increasing irrigation intensity many of nebraska s groundwater management programs implemented since 1988 may have reduced the loading contributing to increasing nitrate concentrations interestingly it is only after the programs started that a clear upward trend begins in eastern wells possibly a result of legacy nitrates reaching the water table 3 2 spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate contamination fig 6 shows the contaminated areas of groundwater nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l during each of the previous four decades in nebraska well depth screen depth and sampling date were obtained from the well database of the university of nebraska lincoln unl 2000 within the groundwater nitrate contaminated areas during 2004 2013 outlined in fig 6 there are a total of 40 758 available nitrate samples 36 835 samples in the eastern part and 3923 samples in the western part of nebraska these data are based on nitrate samples in the 40 year database from 1974 to 2013 which covers only part of the state another 67 065 nitrate samples were excluded from this study because their highest nitrate concentrations were under the mcl of 10 mg no3 n l based on the evaluation of average nitrate concentrations across the state the groundwater nitrate contaminated area in the west seems to be much smaller and more stable than in eastern nebraska on the other hand the contaminated area 2004 2013 in the east part of nebraska was more expansive than the previous decades which makes sense given the long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration in fig 5 3 3 the relationships between groundwater nitrate concentrations and potential natural and anthropogenic factors 3 3 1 characterization of nitrate contaminated areas as shown in fig 7a and b extensive production of corn and soybean coincides with groundwater nitrate contaminated areas currently the total area of corn production is growing both in western and eastern nebraska limited production of corn and the absence of soybean in western nebraska resulted in limited groundwater nitrate contaminated areas in western nebraska compared to eastern nebraska groundwater nitrate contaminated areas are primarily irrigated with gravity irrigation systems in the eastern central part of nebraska this contamination is likely due to more water ponding in this type of irrigation both within furrows and as tailwater contaminated areas tend not to occur in non irrigated dryland agricultural areas where less water recharges than in the irrigated areas particularly in south eastern nebraska in the west smaller groundwater nitrate contaminated areas were found in areas of dryland production and larger saturated thickness of the aquifer as shown in fig 7c and d the soil drainage capacity can be an important factor in system response to nitrate applications in the north eastern part of the state especially around the boundary between the upper elkhorn and lower elkhorn nrds fig 7e groundwater under well drained and excessively well drained soils frequently exceeds the maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mg no3 n l this is in accordance with spalding and hirsh 2012 who mention that the north eastern area of the state has faced groundwater nitrate contamination beneath intensively spray irrigated areas with coarse textured soils in fact high levels of nitrate concentration occur in some areas where there is poor soil drainage particularly in riparian areas in the central eastern part of the state such as the platte river valley in the central platte nrd fig 7e in the past gravity irrigation dominated these areas although soil drainage is low compared to sand extended ponding time within furrows could have caused greater leaching spalding et al 1978 extensive groundwater surface water connectivity may also influence nitrate concentrations and tributaries feeding the platte river may also contribute nitrate to groundwater the application rates of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer declined during the 1980 s in the central area of the state due to lower crop prices exner et al 2010 in comparison with the edges of the state more of central nebraska is well drained to excessively well drained to the extent that row crop production is not economically feasible this part of the state is known as the sand hills and is visible as the large area of low crop production in fig 7 except for a few intensively farmed areas near alliance nebraska the north central part of the state has not been threatened as intensively from high groundwater nitrate contamination despite the vulnerability of the aquifer in areas with sandy soils the depth to the water table plays a significant role in predicting groundwater nitrate concentration a deeper depth to water table reduces the probability for nitrate contamination compared with a shallower water table i e thin vadose zone this was found in both western and eastern nebraska fig 7f and is consistent with the previous studies such as spalding and hirsh 2012 and exner et al 2014 in addition the saturated thickness of the aquifer also influences groundwater nitrate concentrations likely due to dilution and mixing areas with greater saturated thickness in both western and eastern nebraska have lower nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 7g 3 3 2 assumptions of the validity of the extent of nitrate contamination in groundwater after outlining the area of high nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l in the last decade 2004 2013 factors controlling groundwater nitrate concentrations within the contaminated area were considered and compared between western and eastern nebraska these factors include depth to water table saturated thickness of the aquifer the distance from the top to the bottom of the water bearing sediment precipitation evapotranspiration cropland areas and prices of corn and soybeans fig 8 presents precipitation and potential evapotranspiration etp with groundwater nitrate data in the nitrate contaminated 10 mg no3 n l area during 2004 to 2013 by considering weekly trends in western and eastern nebraska precipitation has a statistically significant correlation p 05 with nitrate concentrations in both western and eastern nebraska fig s3 total annual precipitation in the eastern part of nebraska is higher than in the western region fig 8 the etp differs slightly between western and eastern nebraska when considering irrigated cropland etp is not significantly related with groundwater nitrate concentrations p 05 fig s3 however precipitation and etp each show a small pearson s correlation coefficient 0 27 between precipitation and nitrate concentrations in both west and east and 0 03 and 0 06 between etp and nitrate concentrations in west and east respectively fig 8 fig 9 presents high nitrate 10 mg no3 n l and lower nitrate 10 mg no3 n l areas under different irrigation systems in western and eastern nebraska based on this study center pivot irrigated areas have less risk of groundwater nitrate contamination than gravity irrigation systems in eastern nebraska 2 590 005 ha of irrigated area there is about three times more irrigated area than in the west 806 898 ha of irrigated area and the increased density of irrigated crops is directly related to high nitrate in groundwater these graphs were created by overlaying a map of center pivot and gravity irrigated land with the map of nitrate contaminated areas in 2004 2013 the total amount of land for each irrigation technology was then compared with the irrigated land from 2012 from modis mirad falling within an identified nitrate contamination zone fig 6 irrigation technology was obtained from usgs earlywarning usgs gov usirrigation commodity prices are a strong driver of crop and nutrient management and very likely play a leading role in increasing groundwater nitrate concentrations fig 10 compares corn prices area of production and groundwater nitrate concentrations in western and eastern nebraska during 2002 to 2014 corn price and production area have a correlation coefficient of 0 84 application of nitrogen fertilizer is higher when corn production areas increase but the trend of groundwater nitrate concentrations shows a smaller correlation coefficient 0 48 for eastern nebraska and 0 59 for western nebraska with corn production areas as compared to corn prices 0 61 for both east and west this implies that nitrogen is applied more intensively less crop rotation when corn prices are high which may lead to increases in nitrate leaching to groundwater 3 4 estimation of groundwater nitrate concentrations based on cart model groundwater nitrate concentrations were forecast in western and eastern nebraska through the optimized cart model we found that vadose zone thickness effective hydraulic conductivity and saturated thickness were the most significant factors influencing groundwater nitrate concentrations in western nebraska with an explanatory power of 30 16 and 12 respectively i e vadose zone thickness accounted for 30 of the total variability in nitrate concentrations in eastern nebraska the most influential factors were average percent of sand in the top 0 150 cm of soil 21 well depth 18 and effective hydraulic conductivity 14 fig 11 the explanatory power is a measure of how much of the nitrate concentration can be attributed to each of these factors the results of the model show the mean absolute error in predicting nitrate concentrations are 4 87 mg no3 n l west and 3 51 mg no3 n l east the relative errors are 32 west and 19 east as presented in table 6 this indicates that the cart model can be used to predict groundwater nitrate concentrations most accurately in eastern nebraska which is unsurprising given the larger quantity of data available in the east 4 conclusions this study confirms that nitrate contaminated areas are expanding and new areas continue to emerge beneath irrigated cropland in nebraska particularly in the east it is possible that some wells within the identified high nitrate areas are still below mcl as all existing wells were not included in the database however nitrate concentrations in additional wells can be predicted using the optimal cart model of this study with an expected accuracy of about 70 80 the trends of increasing groundwater nitrate concentrations have occurred only in eastern nebraska following an increase in the intensity of crop production and irrigation while the rate of increase of average nitrate groundwater concentration has slowed in some areas under the nebraska s gwqmp intense irrigation increases the rate of nitrate leaching to groundwater this study additionally shows that the areal extent and growth of contaminated groundwater in predominately center pivot irrigated areas is lower than beneath gravity irrigated areas converting from gravity irrigation to center pivot may help to protect against the expansion of nitrate contaminated groundwater based on this study the spatial differences in climate soil cropping irrigation and vadose zone characteristics e g precipitation et soil drainage capacities depth to water table significantly predict groundwater nitrate concentrations in western and eastern nebraska thus the investigation of soil nitrogen processes and nitrate flux through soil into groundwater under climate variability and the complexities of aquifer and vadose zone characteristics are key for analyzing the occurrence of nitrate contamination in nebraska s groundwater the cart model was used to identify the relative importance of well attributes soil and vadose zone characteristics weather conditions and nonpoint source n inputs for each well with groundwater nitrate concentrations physical characteristics geography and well construction were found to be significant irrespective of well type irrigation monitoring or domestic this supports burow et al s 2010 use of monitoring wells for predicing groundwater nitrate concentrations in cart modeling vadose zone thickness and well depth were found to be the most significant factors affecting groundwater nitrate concentrations in western nebraska with an explanatory power of 30 16 and 12 respectively the most influential factors included average percent of sand in the 0 150 cm topsoil 21 well depth 18 and effective hydraulic conductivity 14 in eastern nebraska after testing the model we conclude that the cart model can be applied to predict groundwater nitrate concentrations from those influential factors the cart model proved to be useful for both prediction of groundwater nitrate concentrations and for identifying potential factors that could place areas at greater risk for groundwater contamination acknowledgments this paper is the result of an effort between the nebraska water center nwc and the water sciences laboratory at

1613,a four decade dataset 1974 2013 of 107 823 nitrate samples in 25 993 wells from western and eastern parts of nebraska was used to assess long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration and decadal changes in the extent of groundwater nitrate contaminated areas no3 n 10 mg n l over the entire state spatial statistics and regressions were used to investigate the relationships between groundwater nitrate concentrations and several potential natural and anthropogenic factors including soil drainage capacities vadose zone characteristics crop production areas and irrigation systems the results of this study show that there is no statistically significant trend in groundwater nitrate concentrations in western nebraska in contrast with the increasing trend p 05 to the east the spatial extent and nitrate concentrations in contaminated groundwater in center pivot irrigated areas was less than in gravity irrigated areas areas with a thicker vadose zone and larger saturated thickness of the aquifer have relatively lower nitrate concentrations the results of a classification and regression tree cart model indicate the difference in the influence of physical factors on groundwater nitrate concentrations between western and eastern nebraska namely that groundwater nitrate concentrations correspond with vadose zone thickness effective hydraulic conductivity and saturated thickness in the west while in eastern nebraska concentrations are correlated with average percent sand in the topsoil 0 150 cm well depth and effective hydraulic conductivity keywords groundwater nitrate contamination agricultural vadose zone and climatic factors cart method nebraska 1 introduction nebraska an agriculturally intensive state in the mid western united states u s has a large number of wells with nitrate concentrations above the drinking water standard of 10 mg no3 n l ndeq 2015 the high plains ogallala aquifer hpoa is a major alluvial aquifer that extends from south dakota in the north to texas in the south and supplies tremendous amounts of water for agricultural municipal and industrial uses about two thirds of the water in the hpoa is in nebraska which also contains a number of large rivers with dams and canal diversions groundwater irrigation in nebraska has increased significantly over the past six decades with the adoption of center pivots which replaced traditional flood irrigation methods now more than 3 4 million hectares of land rely on groundwater from the hpoa to irrigate crops in nebraska usda 2014 while nitrate may occur naturally in groundwater a major cause of high nitrate occurrence in nebraska s wells is the extensive fertilizer application across the state stanton and lynne 2006 gurdak and qi 2006 gurdak et al 2009 exner et al 2014 particularly in irrigated fields consumption of water with elevated nitrate concentrations can cause health problems primarily for infants its effects are called blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia which is caused by the inability of the blood to deliver enough oxygen to the infant s body as described by comly 1945 in 1962 the u s public health service officially recommended a nitrate standard of 10 mg no3 n l for drinking water u s public health service 1962 though other countries have tighter standards the u s has retained this 10 mg no3 n l to the present day sattelmacher 1962 simon et al 1964 kross et al 1995 nas 1995 u s epa 2004 2007 2017 tiemann 2017 generally large amounts of nitrogen fertilizers and irrigation are applied annually in agricultural areas of nebraska to increase and maintain agricultural production and crop yields spalding 1975 exner and spalding 1976 adelman et al 1985 grassini et al 2012 ferguson 2015 consequently nitrate contamination in nebraska s groundwater occurs primarily from nitrate leaching in agricultural areas although these practices and risks are distributed widely across the state some parts of the hpoa are more vulnerable than others for example due to soil drainage characteristics at the land surface spalding and exner 1993 nolan et al 1997 exner et al 2010 2014 rising nitrate concentrations in groundwater has prompted nebraska s natural resources districts nrds to begin implementing groundwater management plans for quality and quantity in the mid 1980s nrd 2017 the central platte nrd cpnrd plan is representative of those adopted throughout the state of nebraska for groundwater quality management although each of the 23 nrds is free to enact regulations tailored to local conditions the cpnrd groundwater quality management program gwqmp was initiated in 1988 and involves a phased approach to nitrogen management cpnrd 2016 the cpnrd defined four classes of nitrate contamination phase i ii iii and iv these classes correspond to nitrate concentrations of 7 5 mg l phase i 7 6 15 mg l phase ii 15 mg l phase iii and areas where the rate of decline in no3 n concentrations have not been satisfactory phase iv cpnrd 2016 within these areas the timing and application rates of nitrogen fertilizer on irrigated agriculture are regulated differently as presented in supplemental information table s1 although nebraska nrds have intensively monitored the extent of nitrate contamination in groundwater as published in the nebraska groundwater quality monitoring report ndeq 2015 and many researchers and managers have made efforts to minimize the impact of irrigated crop production on the occurrence of nitrate in nebraska s groundwater it continues to be challenging to control nitrate contamination table s2 this is likely due to the complexity of the aquifer system and difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of the best management practices bmps from the gwqmp in reducing areas of nitrate contamination in groundwater previous studies by exner et al 2010 2014 have analyzed long term groundwater nitrate concentration trends in several regions of eastern nebraska but their analysis did not include the more rural semi arid west which is also extensively cultivated dappen et al 2007 additionally the agricultural areas are expanding in western nebraska dappen et al 2007 hiller et al 2009 potentially impacting the groundwater quality due to significant n fertilizer application exner and spalding 1994 usgs reports have indicated widespread nitrate contamination in both eastern and western nebraska verstraeten and ellis 1994 verstraeten et al 1994 1998 there is a significant difference in climate precipitation and irrigation practices across the state western nebraska is drier with greater temperature extremes the predominant bedrock is older gutentag et al 1984 which means the landscape is less flat soil texture is coarser than in many of the easternmost parts of the state and hydraulic conductivity is lower in the aquifer one purpose of this study is the analysis of the long term groundwater nitrate concentration trends in western nebraska which will help increase understanding the occurrence of nitrate contamination in groundwater examining the commonalities and distinctions between the eastern and western parts of the state will help in planning the policy for the protection of groundwater from nitrate contamination furthermore we employ a statistical classification method to establish the correlations among interrelated factors which may be important to nitrate concentrations in the east and west which have not been considered in previous studies such as exner et al 2014 whose landmark study of eastern nebraska demonstrated the increasing trends in nitrate over the course of three decades this assessment goes beyond nolan et al 1997 and nolan and hitt 2006 who demonstrated that many states including nebraska are threatened with nitrate contamination in groundwater several studies have attempted to identify sources of groundwater nitrate contamination based on the local analysis in various parts of the united states van der schans et al 2009 lockhart et al 2013 murgulet and tick 2013 as a supplement to these nationwide surveys the research presented here shows the spatial temporal changes of nitrate contamination in groundwater on a local to regional scale for the entire state of nebraska nitrate may be influenced by many factors some continuous e g vadose zone thickness thickness of the aquifer depth to groundwater etc and others categorical e g type of well domestic irrigation or monitoring presence of barnyard within the property older or newer wells etc for the analysis of large data sets the classification and regression tree cart is one of the most commonly used decision tree tools cart can be used to analyze complex interactions among predictors based on regression equations particularly when there is a large amount of data with many variables zhang et al 2003 qi et al 2010 for example burow et al 2010 used cart to identify the relative significance of n inputs biogeochemical processes and physical aquifer properties in explaining nitrate concentrations in groundwater in this study we evaluate additional influential factors which were not considered in burow et al 2010 such as soil drainage classes percent sand and organic matter in the topsoil and weather data in addition we develop cart models to predict groundwater nitrate concentrations based on the presence or degree of these factors as mentioned above nebraska has clear differences in hydrogeology and spatial characterizations between western and eastern parts e g rainfall amounts soil texture population growth and crop varieties thus studies of groundwater nitrate contamination should be considered in each region of nebraska in order to identify the local causes of leaching and solutions to nitrate occurrence in nebraska s groundwater the objectives of this study include i to estimate the long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentrations in western and eastern nebraska ii to examine four decades 1974 2013 of change in the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate concentrations and iii to evaluate relationships between high groundwater nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l and potential natural e g weather and soil drainage and anthropogenic e g crop production and price well type and irrigation system factors using cart this complements the work by exner et al 2014 for the years 1981 2010 in eastern nebraska in part by considering a time series that is 33 longer 40 years rather than 30 years as well as including the western part of the state this also complements the national scale analysis of nolan and hitt 2006 which contextualizes the local risk of nitrate contamination in groundwater occurring in the high plains shallower wells are likely to have higher contamination levels than deeper wells older wells typically have higher contamination than newer wells and could be linked to construction techniques spalding and exner 1993 the higher the number of screen zones and the longer the total screen length the higher the chance for the well to capture the groundwater from the aquifer from all depths high organic matter tends to preserve soil structure a higher percentage of sand and organics allows greater infiltration water to the underlying aquifer thick vadose zones attenuate the movement of chemicals a deeper aquifer may have some dilution effect on contaminants reaching the water table precipitation prior to planting and during the growing season affects recharge temperature is likely to affect plant evapotranspiration if the land applied nitrogen load is high at land surface there will likey be more nitrate available to leach to groundwater as a portion may not be utilized by plants many of these factors are not independent for example a shallow well is more likely to be installed where the water table is close to the land surface which may also co occur with sandier soils that permit more recharge monitoring wells may have higher nitrate concentrations by virtue of purposeful installation in locations known to be contaminated this study highlights the use of cart to identify the relative importance of these interdependent factors suggesting possible causal mechanisms for nitrate contamination in eastern and western nebraska that can be further investigated using process based modeling to get specific causal information for smaller areas the goal of this paper is to use three statistical techniques spatial interpolation pairwise regression and cart to identify patterns of nitrate contamination in nebraska each of these techniques can help to demonstrate the factors that are associated with nitrate contamination in both space and time 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area in western and eastern nebraska the study area is the state of nebraska representing a geographic area of 200 000 km2 between latitude 40 n to 43 n and longitude 95 19 w to 104 03 w nebraska has two major climatic zones a humid continental climate average annual precipitation 750 mm in the eastern part of the state and a semi arid climate average annual precipitation 350 mm in the western area of the state hprcc 2016 in this comparative analysis the state of nebraska is divided into west and east regions the western region includes 8 natural resource districts nrds and the eastern region includes 15 nrds fig 1 there are 48 weather stations in nebraska in the network of the high plains regional climate center hprcc and 201 in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa also shown in fig 1 2 2 data collection and analysis 2 2 1 groundwater nitrate data a total of 107 823 nitrate concentration measurements were obtained from 25 993 wells distributed across 6282 wells in the western part and 19 711 wells in the eastern part of nebraska for the time period from 1974 until 2013 from the quality assessed agrichemical contaminant database for nebraska groundwater http dnrdata dnr ne gov clearinghouse unl 2000 most of the samples were taken in eastern nebraska 76 of total samples during 1974 to 2013 which has a higher population and greater density of agricultural land well types are shown in table 1 irrigation wells in the dataset have the longest screened intervals with an average of 24 m compared with 7 m for domestic wells and 5 m for monitoring wells most irrigation wells are screened for their entire length in contrast with other well types which are not screened near the surface monitoring wells are commonly shallow with an average well depth of 24 m the average well depths of domestic and irrigation wells are 43 m and 69 m respectively more comparative descriptions of these well types between western and eastern nebraska such as well depths screen zones pumping capacities construction details etc are in table 2 for groundwater nitrate assessment the nrds and ndeq collect samples during july and august every year ndeq 2015 samples are usually taken from a tap near the well head wells which are not in continuous operation are pumped for at least 2 h before water is sampled schepers et al 1991 exner et al 2014 all samples are collected in polyethylene bottles and immediately put on ice until delivered for laboratory analysis samples are analyzed using the epa approved cadmium reduction method or hach epa equivalent compliant methods exner et al 2005 ndeq 2015 to evaluate groundwater nitrate trends if more than one concentration was reported in a well in a year the maximum concentration was selected because the maximum concentration is important for health the dataset of maximum concentrations for all individual wells was divided into two groups one for the western half of nebraska and the other for the eastern part the concentrations within western and eastern nebraska were then averaged for each year 2 2 2 spatial characterization data the distribution of irrigated and non irrigated row crops was available from the mirad us project under the usgs early warning and environmental monitoring program usgs 2015 and the 2005 nebraska land use map university of nebraska lincoln 2010 the data for irrigation systems in nebraska were obtained from the university of nebraska lincoln conservation and survey division school of natural resources 2015 and the center for advanced land management information technologies 2005 nebraska land use map university of nebraska lincoln 2010 the spatial map of soil drainage capacities was made in accordance with exner et al 2014 by consolidating the seven drainage classifications of the soil survey geographic database usda 2015 into three groups excessively well drained well drained and poorly drained the spatial maps of corn and soybean production years were created by stacking raster layers of annual data from the national agricultural statistics service nass cropland data layer usda nass 2015 2 2 3 weather and crop price data weather data were collected from 48 stations of the hprcc http hprcc6 unl edu cgi hpcc home cgi automated weather data network awdn and 201 noaa stations http www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datatools findstation daily data included precipitation wind speed solar radiation relative humidity maximum average and minimum temperatures and potential evapotranspiration etp across the study area during 2004 and 2013 soil nitrate which can be derived from most nitrogen materials in commercial fertilizers biomass and animal wastes is highly soluble in water and can easily be transported through soil to groundwater with recharge from agricultural land evapotranspiration et is a highly variable and yet significant driving force usgs 2000 that is a primary determinant of the amount and timing of recharge et affects nitrate concentrations in groundwater through changes to the water balance especially by decreasing recharge because most of the area where groundwater is exposed to nitrate contamination is fully irrigated and therefore unlikely to experience any long term moisture deficit the potential evapotranspiration etp is a good approximation for the actual et in this study etp is calculated on a daily time step using the penman monteith pm equation with a fixed surface resistance of 45 s m 1 and fixed plant height of 0 5 m for a reference surface of grass and alfalfa monteith 1965 assuming that n applied per acre is independent of the number of acres in production increasing crop land areas leads to more total n fertilizer application typical n application rates for corn and soybeans in nebraska are 180 kg ha based on an anticipated yield of 150 bu ac and 100 kg ha in a case of nitrogen deficiency in soil respectively shapiro et al 2008 ferguson et al 2006 a higher corn price shifts the corn soybean rotation in favor of continuous corn and encourages more fertilizer use thus trends in total n fertilizer should be considered in the context of trends in corn price historical corn prices were obtained from the department of agricultural and consumer economics of the college of agricultural consumer and environmental sciences at the university of illinois farmdoc illinois edu manage pricehistory price history html 2 3 groundwater nitrate contaminated areas to differentiate factors controlling leaching and vulnerability to contamination areas with high groundwater nitrate concentration were first identified and delineated outlined areas of nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l were created using arcgis 10 3 1 the nitrate concentration in each well during each decade 1974 1983 1984 1993 1994 2003 2004 2013 was computed across 2 km by 2 km grid cells using the point to raster conversion tool spatial analysis tools interpolation reclassify and contour were used on grid cells with average concentration 10 mg no3 n l if more than one concentration was reported in a well in a year the concentrations were averaged in contrast with the trend analysis section 2 2 1 in which the greatest measured concentration was used in a year the average concentration was more representative for spatial comparison among wells because spatial interpolations are sensitive to outliers four methods of interpolation in arcgis 10 3 1 inverse distance weighting ordinary kriging interpolation from contours and natural neighbor were compared for spatially estimating averaged values of nitrate concentrations from wells in table 1 this includes data from some multi level monitoring wells including from studies involving nitrates from point sources which are not representative of nitrates from agricultural drainage monitoring wells represented up to 30 of wells in the west 2004 2014 and up to 14 of wells in the east 1984 1993 nitrate levels from multi level monitoring wells were averaged across depths before interpolation since only one value can be used for a given location in any of the above interpolation methods the selected interpolation methods were cross validated by reserving 10 of known data points from the database for error assessment the results indicated that the natural neighbor method had the smallest error as calculated by the root mean square error fig s1 and the percent of error table s3 and so this method was used to delineate areas of high nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l our methodology is different from the previous study by exner et al 2014 which used the topo to raster contour interpolation tool for determining the areas of high nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l and excluded multi level monitoring wells 2 4 cart model for estimating groundwater nitrate concentrations 2 4 1 methodology for the cart analysis cart is a useful and popular tool in the field of data science in this study the program language r was selected to estimate the indicators for splitting nodes using the package rpart loh 2011 according to the description of breiman et al 1984 a cart model is principally built for classifying and predicting responses to covariates based on three steps including tree growing pruning and optimizing fig 2 tree growing requires two steps as described in the name of the tool classification and regression the first step uses a classification tree a recursive partitioning technique to run several variables against the or dependent variable to find the most robust and consistent method of sorting the observations into groups based on their similarity the program checks the greatest improvement of the purity score of the resultant nodes categories to identify the best splitter in the case of the categorical variable as well as alternative splitters surrogates that would create similar groups thus cart splits the samples into populations with similar attributes ensuring that the resulting populations are as similar to each other and as different from other groupings as possible for discrete inputs such as well type in this analysis the classification is evaluated using a metric known as a gini coefficient breiman et al 1984 the regression tree which is generated for continuous input variables such as screen depth and sand content has the same procedure with the classification tree except it uses the variance between groups as the indicator instead of the gini coefficient cart automatically splits the observations into a large number of small subgroups with very similar characteristics but only the first several splits are likely to be statistically significant therefore it is necessary to get rid of the smallest branches in the decision tree after generating a detailed decision tree from the combination of classification group membership and regression group values fig s2 the second step of the cart methodology is tree pruning pruning cuts the branches of the tree to reduce over fitting thereby increasing the ability of new data prediction in the decision tree mingers 1989 in cart the minimum cost complexity pruning method is used to optimize the decision tree typically the cost complexity pruning threshold of the decision tree is considered equivalent to the decision tree error the final step in cart involves evaluating the pruned trees using the split test method which is one method of examining the optimal tree dobbin and simon 2011 the observed data are divided into two groups one for training and the other for testing the groundwater nitrate concentration dataset within the contaminated area no3 n 10 mg n l during 2004 2013 was randomly separated into two subsets 80 of the data 12 880 samples as the model training observations and 20 of the data 2000 samples as the testing observations in this study the groundwater nitrate concentration was the target value whereas weather conditions well and soil characteristics and surface nitrate nitrogen loading for each well were chosen as the potential contributing factors based on a literature review tables 4 and 5 groundwater nitrate concentrations were estimated and evaluated by a cart model through the procedure of growing pruning and optimizing based on the optimal tree an overview of cart methodology is presented in fig 2 and the principal equations of the cart model are described in table 3 2 4 2 factors for cart modeling a cart model was created to identify the most significant factors affecting nitrate concentrations in nebraska s groundwater beginning with 13 potentially influential factors divided into four groups these included well attributes soil and vadose zone characteristics weather conditions and surface nitrate nitrogen load around each well see table 4 selection of these factors was also influenced by the availability of data figs 3 and 4 present box plots and trend lines of vadose zone characteristics well depth saturated thickness and vadose zone thickness with nitrate sample data for three major well types domestic irrigation and monitoring within the contaminated area 2004 2013 in western and eastern nebraska the monitoring well data used in these regressions includes data from multi level monitoring wells for studies in eastern nebraska which were not used for cart analysis although they were used for spatial interpolation wells in a large part of eastern nebraska exhibited shallower average well depth less saturated thickness of the aquifer and smaller vadose zone thickness along with a correlation of increasing nitrate concentrations with depths in wells of all types domestic irrigation and monitoring wells as shown in figs 3 and 4 the contrasting shape of the regression in nitrate concentrations in domestic irrigation and monitoring wells probably occurs from differences in well attributes such as screen depths well diameters etc the fitted correlation of median well depth saturated thickness of aquifer and vadose zone thickness with nitrate concentrations in monitoring wells presents an exponential relationship with r2 of 0 98 0 99 and 0 97 respectively comparatively a linear relationship is found only in irrigation wells with r2 of 0 77 well depth 0 66 saturated thickness and 0 94 vadose zone thickness deeper well depths and larger thicknesses of saturated and vadose zones are associated with lower nitrate concentrations in groundwater the shallow well depth and smaller thicknesses of the saturated and vadose zones in the 0 50 ft i e 0 15 m range of monitoring wells have definitively higher nitrate concentrations than in domestic and irrigation wells the well attributes e g screen depths and well diameters likely impact groundwater nitrate concentrations by affecting the part of the aquifer that the well draws from particularly in the vertical profile of nitrate based on these regressions it is a valid concern that data from monitoring irrigation and domestic wells might not be comparable in particular monitoring wells are often put into place in areas of known nitrate contamination however cart analysis explicitly shows that in western nebraska monitoring wells in areas with a thin vadose zone and high hydraulic conductivity have more in common in terms of nitrate concentrations with irrigation and domestic wells in areas with a thin vadose zone and high hydraulic conductivity than with other monitoring wells that do not share these physical and geographical characteristics no monitoring wells were included in the cart analysis for eastern nebraska in the western part of nebraska domestic and monitoring wells have lower nitrate concentrations where the vadose zone is thicker except for irrigation wells there are no obvious correlations of nitrate concentration with well depth and saturated thickness of the aquifer eastern nebraska has higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater than in the west interestingly at the same depth to water table or vadose zone thickness groundwater nitrate concentrations in the east are higher than in the west the difference in soil properties and other conditions between western and eastern nebraska as well as higher rainfall recharge and n inputs in the east likely plays a significant role in predicting nitrate concentrations in groundwater note that while trends in groundwater concentrations over time were different between domestic irrigation and monitoring wells the type of well was not a significant factor in absolute nitrate concentrations according to the cart model the type of well was included as an input factor when creating the cart model and if the mean groundwater nitrate concentration were significantly different among the types of wells cart would have identified this factor as part of the classification tree instead well type was identified in the west as a surrogate split in node 22 whereas everything beyond node 5 was considered statistically insignificant in eastern nebraska no monitoring well data was used for cart analysis the depth from the land surface to the water table referred to as vadose zone thickness was estimated from a map of the depth to water this was combined with the groundwater nitrate sample database of the university of nebraska lincoln unl between 1974 and 2013 using the extract values to points tool in arcgis 10 3 1 the depth to water map was created using the kriging interpolation tool using water depth data from 206 061 registered wells collected by the department of natural resources dnr in nebraska http www dnr ne gov groundwater data saturated thickness was estimated from the difference between the well depth and the estimated depth to water table from the estimation of the thickness of saturated zone we found that many wells do not extend to the bottom of the aquifer in nebraska while the hpoa is known for its rapid depletion due to unsustainable use scanlon et al 2012 mcguire 2017 haacker et al 2016 the depth to water in nebraska has remained much more stable than the depth to water in other areas that rely on the aquifer for irrigation such as the kansas and texas high plains average percent of sand and organic matter om in the top soil 0 150 cm were estimated from a map of a soil layer with the soil survey geography ssurgo mapunit key mukey each mukey is associated with specific soil characteristics sand silt clay organic matter etc the soil layer was downloaded from ssurgo using the web soil survey wss operated by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs wss 2017 effective hydraulic conductivity keff was calculated from soil texture layers in the test hole collected by the school of natural resources snr at the university of nebraska lincoln unl snr unl 2017 the keff was estimated based on vertical flow through soil layers the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks in each soil layer was predicted by the pedotransfer function in the rosetta database in hydrus 1d based on soil textures which were obtained from the unl csd test hole database weather data including monthly precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperature were collected from the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism climate group provided by the oregon state university prism 2017 land use nitrate export coefficients were used for determining the annual average nitrate loading around each well under each year during 2004 2013 the land use data layers 2004 2013 were collected from the u s department of agriculture usda nass 2016 the nitrate export coefficient for each land cover which can indicate the amount of nitrates available for leaching from the surface due to inputs of fertilizers crop residues and atmospheric deposition reckhow and simpson 1980 were found using literature sources such as parn et al 2012 and keeler and polasky 2014 in this study we used the nitrate export coefficients from keeler and polasky 2014 as shown in table 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration fig 5 presents long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration 1974 2013 in western and eastern nebraska average annual groundwater nitrate concentrations in eastern nebraska are increasing p 05 probably due to an increase in the intensity of crop production and the adoption of center pivots nitrate concentrations remain stable in the west despite increasing irrigation intensity many of nebraska s groundwater management programs implemented since 1988 may have reduced the loading contributing to increasing nitrate concentrations interestingly it is only after the programs started that a clear upward trend begins in eastern wells possibly a result of legacy nitrates reaching the water table 3 2 spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate contamination fig 6 shows the contaminated areas of groundwater nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l during each of the previous four decades in nebraska well depth screen depth and sampling date were obtained from the well database of the university of nebraska lincoln unl 2000 within the groundwater nitrate contaminated areas during 2004 2013 outlined in fig 6 there are a total of 40 758 available nitrate samples 36 835 samples in the eastern part and 3923 samples in the western part of nebraska these data are based on nitrate samples in the 40 year database from 1974 to 2013 which covers only part of the state another 67 065 nitrate samples were excluded from this study because their highest nitrate concentrations were under the mcl of 10 mg no3 n l based on the evaluation of average nitrate concentrations across the state the groundwater nitrate contaminated area in the west seems to be much smaller and more stable than in eastern nebraska on the other hand the contaminated area 2004 2013 in the east part of nebraska was more expansive than the previous decades which makes sense given the long term trends of groundwater nitrate concentration in fig 5 3 3 the relationships between groundwater nitrate concentrations and potential natural and anthropogenic factors 3 3 1 characterization of nitrate contaminated areas as shown in fig 7a and b extensive production of corn and soybean coincides with groundwater nitrate contaminated areas currently the total area of corn production is growing both in western and eastern nebraska limited production of corn and the absence of soybean in western nebraska resulted in limited groundwater nitrate contaminated areas in western nebraska compared to eastern nebraska groundwater nitrate contaminated areas are primarily irrigated with gravity irrigation systems in the eastern central part of nebraska this contamination is likely due to more water ponding in this type of irrigation both within furrows and as tailwater contaminated areas tend not to occur in non irrigated dryland agricultural areas where less water recharges than in the irrigated areas particularly in south eastern nebraska in the west smaller groundwater nitrate contaminated areas were found in areas of dryland production and larger saturated thickness of the aquifer as shown in fig 7c and d the soil drainage capacity can be an important factor in system response to nitrate applications in the north eastern part of the state especially around the boundary between the upper elkhorn and lower elkhorn nrds fig 7e groundwater under well drained and excessively well drained soils frequently exceeds the maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mg no3 n l this is in accordance with spalding and hirsh 2012 who mention that the north eastern area of the state has faced groundwater nitrate contamination beneath intensively spray irrigated areas with coarse textured soils in fact high levels of nitrate concentration occur in some areas where there is poor soil drainage particularly in riparian areas in the central eastern part of the state such as the platte river valley in the central platte nrd fig 7e in the past gravity irrigation dominated these areas although soil drainage is low compared to sand extended ponding time within furrows could have caused greater leaching spalding et al 1978 extensive groundwater surface water connectivity may also influence nitrate concentrations and tributaries feeding the platte river may also contribute nitrate to groundwater the application rates of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer declined during the 1980 s in the central area of the state due to lower crop prices exner et al 2010 in comparison with the edges of the state more of central nebraska is well drained to excessively well drained to the extent that row crop production is not economically feasible this part of the state is known as the sand hills and is visible as the large area of low crop production in fig 7 except for a few intensively farmed areas near alliance nebraska the north central part of the state has not been threatened as intensively from high groundwater nitrate contamination despite the vulnerability of the aquifer in areas with sandy soils the depth to the water table plays a significant role in predicting groundwater nitrate concentration a deeper depth to water table reduces the probability for nitrate contamination compared with a shallower water table i e thin vadose zone this was found in both western and eastern nebraska fig 7f and is consistent with the previous studies such as spalding and hirsh 2012 and exner et al 2014 in addition the saturated thickness of the aquifer also influences groundwater nitrate concentrations likely due to dilution and mixing areas with greater saturated thickness in both western and eastern nebraska have lower nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 7g 3 3 2 assumptions of the validity of the extent of nitrate contamination in groundwater after outlining the area of high nitrate concentrations 10 mg no3 n l in the last decade 2004 2013 factors controlling groundwater nitrate concentrations within the contaminated area were considered and compared between western and eastern nebraska these factors include depth to water table saturated thickness of the aquifer the distance from the top to the bottom of the water bearing sediment precipitation evapotranspiration cropland areas and prices of corn and soybeans fig 8 presents precipitation and potential evapotranspiration etp with groundwater nitrate data in the nitrate contaminated 10 mg no3 n l area during 2004 to 2013 by considering weekly trends in western and eastern nebraska precipitation has a statistically significant correlation p 05 with nitrate concentrations in both western and eastern nebraska fig s3 total annual precipitation in the eastern part of nebraska is higher than in the western region fig 8 the etp differs slightly between western and eastern nebraska when considering irrigated cropland etp is not significantly related with groundwater nitrate concentrations p 05 fig s3 however precipitation and etp each show a small pearson s correlation coefficient 0 27 between precipitation and nitrate concentrations in both west and east and 0 03 and 0 06 between etp and nitrate concentrations in west and east respectively fig 8 fig 9 presents high nitrate 10 mg no3 n l and lower nitrate 10 mg no3 n l areas under different irrigation systems in western and eastern nebraska based on this study center pivot irrigated areas have less risk of groundwater nitrate contamination than gravity irrigation systems in eastern nebraska 2 590 005 ha of irrigated area there is about three times more irrigated area than in the west 806 898 ha of irrigated area and the increased density of irrigated crops is directly related to high nitrate in groundwater these graphs were created by overlaying a map of center pivot and gravity irrigated land with the map of nitrate contaminated areas in 2004 2013 the total amount of land for each irrigation technology was then compared with the irrigated land from 2012 from modis mirad falling within an identified nitrate contamination zone fig 6 irrigation technology was obtained from usgs earlywarning usgs gov usirrigation commodity prices are a strong driver of crop and nutrient management and very likely play a leading role in increasing groundwater nitrate concentrations fig 10 compares corn prices area of production and groundwater nitrate concentrations in western and eastern nebraska during 2002 to 2014 corn price and production area have a correlation coefficient of 0 84 application of nitrogen fertilizer is higher when corn production areas increase but the trend of groundwater nitrate concentrations shows a smaller correlation coefficient 0 48 for eastern nebraska and 0 59 for western nebraska with corn production areas as compared to corn prices 0 61 for both east and west this implies that nitrogen is applied more intensively less crop rotation when corn prices are high which may lead to increases in nitrate leaching to groundwater 3 4 estimation of groundwater nitrate concentrations based on cart model groundwater nitrate concentrations were forecast in western and eastern nebraska through the optimized cart model we found that vadose zone thickness effective hydraulic conductivity and saturated thickness were the most significant factors influencing groundwater nitrate concentrations in western nebraska with an explanatory power of 30 16 and 12 respectively i e vadose zone thickness accounted for 30 of the total variability in nitrate concentrations in eastern nebraska the most influential factors were average percent of sand in the top 0 150 cm of soil 21 well depth 18 and effective hydraulic conductivity 14 fig 11 the explanatory power is a measure of how much of the nitrate concentration can be attributed to each of these factors the results of the model show the mean absolute error in predicting nitrate concentrations are 4 87 mg no3 n l west and 3 51 mg no3 n l east the relative errors are 32 west and 19 east as presented in table 6 this indicates that the cart model can be used to predict groundwater nitrate concentrations most accurately in eastern nebraska which is unsurprising given the larger quantity of data available in the east 4 conclusions this study confirms that nitrate contaminated areas are expanding and new areas continue to emerge beneath irrigated cropland in nebraska particularly in the east it is possible that some wells within the identified high nitrate areas are still below mcl as all existing wells were not included in the database however nitrate concentrations in additional wells can be predicted using the optimal cart model of this study with an expected accuracy of about 70 80 the trends of increasing groundwater nitrate concentrations have occurred only in eastern nebraska following an increase in the intensity of crop production and irrigation while the rate of increase of average nitrate groundwater concentration has slowed in some areas under the nebraska s gwqmp intense irrigation increases the rate of nitrate leaching to groundwater this study additionally shows that the areal extent and growth of contaminated groundwater in predominately center pivot irrigated areas is lower than beneath gravity irrigated areas converting from gravity irrigation to center pivot may help to protect against the expansion of nitrate contaminated groundwater based on this study the spatial differences in climate soil cropping irrigation and vadose zone characteristics e g precipitation et soil drainage capacities depth to water table significantly predict groundwater nitrate concentrations in western and eastern nebraska thus the investigation of soil nitrogen processes and nitrate flux through soil into groundwater under climate variability and the complexities of aquifer and vadose zone characteristics are key for analyzing the occurrence of nitrate contamination in nebraska s groundwater the cart model was used to identify the relative importance of well attributes soil and vadose zone characteristics weather conditions and nonpoint source n inputs for each well with groundwater nitrate concentrations physical characteristics geography and well construction were found to be significant irrespective of well type irrigation monitoring or domestic this supports burow et al s 2010 use of monitoring wells for predicing groundwater nitrate concentrations in cart modeling vadose zone thickness and well depth were found to be the most significant factors affecting groundwater nitrate concentrations in western nebraska with an explanatory power of 30 16 and 12 respectively the most influential factors included average percent of sand in the 0 150 cm topsoil 21 well depth 18 and effective hydraulic conductivity 14 in eastern nebraska after testing the model we conclude that the cart model can be applied to predict groundwater nitrate concentrations from those influential factors the cart model proved to be useful for both prediction of groundwater nitrate concentrations and for identifying potential factors that could place areas at greater risk for groundwater contamination acknowledgments this paper is the result of an effort between the nebraska water center nwc and the water sciences laboratory at

introduction air sparging is a popular method to clean contaminated soils through volatilization of volatile organic compounds vocs and can also help mitigate liquefaction michael and ken 2006 johnson et al 1993 marley et al 1996 air sparging however is limited by random air channel formation which creates a mass transfer zone mtz of limited size within and adjacent to each randomly formed individual air channel braida and ong 2001 therefore the current air sparging practice can take years if not decades is costly and ineffective and can lead to incomplete remediation one of the most popular methods to enhance air sparing s effectiveness is pulsating the air injection pumps benner et al 2002 pulsation is also time consuming and uncontrolled another method used to enhance several remediation technologies not discussed in this paper is the use of direct electric current dc or alternating electric current ac in saturated soils suthersan and raton 1999 in the dc method contaminant transport and the flow of oxygen can be generated or oriented along the direction of the electric current however the oxygen flow paths would still be limited to preferential paths of the electric current namely regions of high electric conductivity although the heat produced by dc or ac enhances the diffusion between air channels it may adversely affect microbial activities within the soil due to the high amount of generated heat in the dc case the ph of the medium can also be altered leading to an adverse effect on the soil and groundwater microbial organisms researchers have also studied the effect of electromagnetic waves on remediation vermeulen and mcgee 2000 studied the use of electromagnetic em heating in environmental industries they used low frequency 60 hz em waves to heat the soil in order to change the viscosity of energy fuels to promote removal of contaminants price et al 1999 studied the same phenomenon and performed in situ tests with a 25 kw radio frequency rf wave generator used in conjunction with air sparging and soil vapor extraction sve the result showed an increased removal of gasoline range organics however the possibility of reducing the generated heat and or negative environmental impacts due to overheating of organisms was never investigated farid et al 2014 azad et al 2013 the driving effect of the em waves on contaminants was not studied either this paper focuses on the major goal of using electromagnetic em stimulation to enhance air sparging while generating minimal heat the goal of this research is to theoretically and experimentally determine the effect of em waves on the formation i e shape and size of the zone of influence of air sparging in addition because the alternating electric field component of em waves oscillates water dipole molecules it can potentially enhance several transport mechanisms such as air and contaminant diffusion within saturated media fig 1 demonstrates a schematic image of a system utilizing em waves from above ground and or borehole antenna arrays to enhance air sparging based on the results of this paper to be most effective the em system needs to be turned on before the air is injected 2 background the focus of this study is on the effects of the em wave s propagation on the air sparging in the partially and fully saturated media therefore some background needed for the creation of desired radiation patterns within a controlled environment resonant cavities and dielectrophoresis concepts are discussed herein 2 1 resonant cavities and waveguides for setup preparation a waveguide is a structure made of perfectly electric conductive pec material that supports the propagation of a wave rectangular waveguides are often used in high power microwave applications circular waveguides have even higher power handling capacity than rectangular waveguides a resonant cavity is a waveguide with its two ends terminated using pec planes cavity and waveguide walls should be thick enough to provide mechanical rigidity 1 to 3 mm and the inside walls should be smoothly polished to reduce em energy loss waveguides and cavities can support transverse electric te and transverse magnetic tm modes in the te mode the electric field is only transverse to the direction of em wave propagation in the tm mode the magnetic field is only transverse to the direction of em wave propagation the order of the mode of a cavity refers to the electric or magnetic field configuration in the waveguide and is represented by m and n integer subscripts e g te mn and tm mn the first subscript m corresponds to the number of half wave variations of the field in the x direction and the second subscript n corresponds to the number of half wave variations in the y direction in conjunction with the waveguide or cavity dimensions m and n determine the cutoff frequency for a particular mode wentworth 2005 the resonant frequency of te mn z or tm mn z modes is represented by 6 f cmn te tm 1 2 π με m a 2 n b 2 where a and b are the dimensions of the rectangular waveguide in the x and y directions z is the direction of the wave propagation and c stands for cut off frequency the possible mode numbers m and n for te z and tm z can be any positive integer numbers wentworth 2005 brown et al 1973 2 2 dielectrophoretic force causing em effect on airflow the hypothesis of this paper is that dielectrophoresis is the mechanism of em induced alteration of airflow and air channel formation dielectrophoresis is a phenomenon in which particles that are not electrically charged and are placed within a background medium can experience a force created by an electric field gradient dielectrophoresis can be a possible mechanism of motion of neutral and nonpolar particles by em stimulation pohl et al 1978 an alternating electric field can induce polarization into neutral particles within the medium and the polarized particles will then be subject to a net force from an electric field gradient regardless of their charge resulting in an induced motion as a result even nonpolar particles will be subjected to an opposite motion the resulting force is also dependent on the electric properties of the medium and the particles the size of the particles and the frequency of the electric field the force exerted by dielectrophoresis is dependent on the complex dielectric permittivity of the particles ε p f m and the surrounding medium ε m the induced force f dep n can be described by 7 f dep 2 π r 3 ε m re ε p ε m ε m e 2 where e is the nonuniform electric field v m and r is the radius m of the homogeneous sphere of the neutral particle this force is proportional to the gradient of the squared magnitude of the nonuniform electric field when the dielectric permittivity of the particles is lower than that of the background medium the particles will move toward the area of lower electric field intensity in the case where the dielectric permittivity of the particles is higher than that of the background medium the particles will move against the gradient of the electric field i e toward the area of higher electric field intensity for dispersive i e where dielectric permittivity is frequency dependent particles and or background media the effect of dielectrophoresis is frequency dependent for each medium and particle combination farid et al 2014 azad et al 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 laboratory work the experimental box used in this set of experiments is a 61 5 cm 40 cm 15 cm acrylic box encased within electrically conductive transparent films that are electrically grounded the walls of the box were 0 6 cm thick it is noteworthy that the top front and back walls of the tank were covered with transparent electrically conductive films to enable visualization other walls were covered with aluminum tape with electric conductive adhesives thus the tank acts as a resonant cavity to form the electric field into a controlled standing wave pattern within the tank because of em wave reflection at the boundary the medium contains the incident and reflected waves forming standing waves a loop coupled antenna was added to the top of the box to launch em waves of different predetermined radiation patterns into the medium fig 2 illustrates a schematic view of the setup the box was filled with deaerated deionized water and then filled with glass beads using the wet pluviation method vaid and negussey 1998 in order to prepare a homogeneous saturated medium for more information see najafi 2013 water found in an actual field would have contaminants in the form of suspended neutral particles or dissolved ions charged particles where especially charged ones can interact more with em waves and affect the results for example charged particles can render the media lossier more energy absorbing and reduce the penetration depth of em waves requiring more em power increasing the cost glass beads used for this study are class a ballotini impact beads from potters company with a specific gravity of 2 46 g cm3 glass beads have a very uniform grain size distribution since their particles have a size ranging from 0 6 to 0 85 mm which is comparable to the lower bound of coarse sands coarse sands range from 0 425 mm to 2 mm sieves 40 to 10 respectively this resulted in a glass bead medium with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 39 10 4 m s after preparing the saturated glass bead medium the air was injected into the saturated glass bead medium deaerated water was used to prevent the generation of air bubbles on the boundary walls to avoid obscuring images as well as to create a controlled medium for each test air was injected through a pvc tube placed at the center of the box to simulate the air injection well the tube had a 2 15 cm outside diameter 1 6 cm inside diameter and 50 cm length four 1 6 mm diameter holes were drilled symmetrically along the lower 3 cm of the tube to allow symmetric air transfer into the glass bead medium the end of the tube was plugged an acrylic plate was placed above the tank to support the tube in its proper location within the box the tube used for air injection was placed in the middle of the top plate with its plugged bottom resting 3 cm above the bottom of the glass bead filled middle compartment 7 cm above the tank bottom the air injection system was designed to inject air in a symmetric way a ¼inch clear pvc tube was used as a connection between the source of air and the air injection tube a dwyer vfa 8 bv flowmeter proper for the pressure range of this study was added to measure the airflow rate which was located before the air injection well the scale unit of this flowmeter is scfh standard cubic feet per minute of the volumetric flow rate of gas at the set standard condition of 49 c maximum temperature and 960 kpa for pressure a pressure gauge was located right after the flowmeter to measure the air injection pressure entering the well the size of the generated air bubbles was observed to be in the submillimeter range digital imaging of the top of the tank was performed to quantitatively analyze the airflow induced into fully water saturated glass bead media and to determine the size and shape of the zoi it is again noteworthy that this paper studies the use of em waves to alter the size of the zoi and the impact of this zoi change on the remediation performance of air sparging is not the focus of this paper and needs to be investigated in the future the imaging was performed using two 18 megapixel canon rebel digital cameras a t2i and a t4i model one camera was located at the top of the box to take top view images of the zoi another camera was placed against the front side of the box to take front view images all experiments were performed in the presence and absence of em stimulation at various frequencies and power levels to evaluate the effect of em stimulation on the formation size and shape of air channels formed under different air pressure levels a signal generator was used as the source of em waves the signal generator was connected to an amplifier to amplify the power launched into the medium this amplification is used to enable examination of the effect of various em power intensities at each frequency of operation other devices include a vector network analyzer a spectrum analyzer a matching network and a dual directional coupler as mentioned the antenna used for excitation in the experiments was a loop coupled antenna the antenna was made from an rg 8 coaxial cable protruding through the top plate with the outer conductive shield stripped the remainder of the outer shield was grounded to the same ground as the cavity and the center conductor was looped back and connected to the top electrically conductive plate to share the same electric grounding a dual directional coupler was used to enable monitoring the forward into the cavity and reflected back into the amplifier powers to map the electric field a 3d translation table was used to position a monopole probe at all desired nodes on a 3d grid within the cavity 3 1 1 experiment procedure four configurations were designed and prepared and airflow patterns were observed for all four configurations with and without applying em waves it should be noted that the unstimulated experiments here are similar to the tests performed in a previous of the airflow by the authors for more information see najafi 2013 the first three configurations c1 c2 and c3 were designed to evaluate the effect of the thickness of the overburden partially saturated zone on the roi and the homogeneity of the configuration during air sparging these three configurations are different in thickness of the partially and fully saturated zones and are the same as in the above mentioned airflow study najafi 2013 setups with the exception of the addition of an antenna to the top side of the box configuration c4 was designed to evaluate the independence of results from the geometry of the box medium pore distribution i e any unforeseen heterogeneity within the medium and repeatability therefore the antenna was located on the opposite side of the top plate table 1 shows the properties of these configurations in theory the porosity of all configurations should be same but naturally due to small variations in the pluviation method and experimental work the porosities of configurations are slightly different yet reasonably similar two series of experiments were performed for this study 1 a series of experiments without applying em waves groups a and b for more information see najafi 2013 and 2 another series of experiments with em waves groups c and d explained in detail here unlike the unstimulated experiments conducted at various air injection pressure levels the em stimulated experiments were conducted at specific frequencies power levels and the same range of air injection pressure levels 14 40 45 57 and 60 kpa 3 1 2 em stimulated experiment procedure as mentioned two variations of experiments referred to as groups c and d were performed for the em stimulated series of experiments in this paper the first group referred to as group c was performed to study the effect of em waves on the initiation of air channels new channels analogous to group a where the injection pressure effect on air channel initiation was studied without em stimulation by najafi 2013 the em stimulation of this group was performed at different frequencies em powers and initial air injection pressures for all configurations c1 c2 c3 and c4 the second group referred to as group d was performed to study the effect of em waves on already formed air channels old channels analogous to group b by najafi 2013 where the injection pressure effect on already formed air channels was studied without em stimulation group d was also performed for all four configurations c1 c2 c3 and c4 at different frequencies em power levels and air injection pressure levels 3 2 simulation of em waves within cavity of experimental setup to investigate and validate dielectrophoresis as mechanism behind em effect the experimental electric field measurement could only be made at limited points within the cavity in addition these measurements were made using a vertically polarized dipole probe connected to a spectrum analyzer the measurements are hence dominated by the vertical component of the electric field at measurement points a 3d vector visualization of the electric field is however needed for the complete study of the relation between em waves and their effect on airflow the 3d vector visualization of the em field can however be provided using numerical models of the experimental setup fig 3 the numerical simulation was performed using the finite element software comsol multiphysics 4 3 the rf module of comsol multiphysics was used to model the electromagnetic field launched into the cavity via the coaxial loop antenna the choice of the applied frequency for the resonant cavity was based on the numerically simulated electric field after experimental validation in order to validate the numerical model the electric field was experimentally measured on grids on different vertical slices at various frequencies close to the resonant mode frequencies in the range of 60 200 mhz of the resonant cavity the results were used to prepare contour maps of the electric field for each slice at each frequency at the same time the numerical model was used to simulate the electric field at the same frequency and the vertical component of the electric field e z was compared with the experimentally measured field the process was repeated for different frequencies until the two contour maps referred to as experimental measurements and numerical model agreed to an acceptable level the experimental electric field matching the numerical simulation was observed at the frequency of 191 7 mhz which is the frequency that the setup and amplifier are impedance matched thus the experimental results at 191 7 mhz were used to validate the numerical simulation figs 4 and 5 show the experimentally measured and numerically simulated contour maps for two slices at this frequency after the numerical model was validated against the vertical field experimental results the total electric field values from the comsol results were imported into matlab to study dielectrophoresis forces if dielectrophoresis is the controlling mechanism the force causing flow and the flow itself should be the in the e 2 direction i e opposite direction of the gradient of the electric field squared this is over a 15 cm 15 cm square in the middle of the cavity box a finer meshing size was used for this section and the zone of influence was meshed extremely fine to provide more accurate electric field values fig 6 4 results 4 1 stimulated experiments the em stimulated series of experiments groups c and d were performed within configurations c1 c2 c3 and c4 where the medium was stimulated using em waves for group c the medium was first stimulated at different frequencies and em power levels after 15 min of em stimulation the air injection was initiated at specific initial air injection pressure levels to study the effect of em waves on the initiation of air channels the zoi was cone shaped even in the em stimulated medium on the other hand since configurations c1 and c2 had a partially saturated glass bead layer on top the zoi cannot be viewed on the top view for either the unstimulated or em stimulated hence the side view on the front of the box was used to evaluate any em effect on the zoi however there was no change in the roi i e the radius of the zoi and the shape of the zoi visible on the front face of the box even at higher magnitudes of em power for c1 and c2 this result indicates that there is either no change to the roi or not a large enough change extended to the walls of the cavity to be visible then the fully water saturated medium c3 was em stimulated and the air was injected into the medium c3 the zoi and roi for this case were observed via the top view of the box since the zoi can have a clear appearance on the top view of the saturated medium only when the medium was em stimulated at 191 7 mhz at powers of 25 w and 30 w was there a change observed on the size of the roi and the shape of the zoi in comparison with the unstimulated case the shape of the zoi on the top surface of the initially unstimulated fully water saturated sample studied three times each was observed to be circular shaped however the zoi changed from the symmetric circular shape to an asymmetric shape for the em stimulated case and was similar during all three tests fig 7 this could be due to the fact that 191 7 mhz is the first resonant mode of the cavity of this size where the dielectrophoretic field is at its maximum at the air injection well 4 1 1 quantitative study of zoi using digital image analysis enlarging the size of the zoi will increase the perimeter of the zoi based on the work by braida and ong 2001 it is not guaranteed that this can lead to an increase in the size of the surrounding mtz and better cleanup hence the following section investigates the impact of em waves on the size of the zoi however it is noteworthy that due to limitations in the air channels size spacing and lack of temporal variation merely increasing the size of the zoi may not be sufficient to enhance air sparging performance in order to quantitatively investigate the em effect on the zoi for configuration c3 a matlab code was developed to calculate the area of the zoi and other quantitative properties of the zoi due to space limits within the lab and the location of the cables connected to the loop antenna the top camera was located at an oblique angle above the box due to this oblique angle of view the dimensions in the original images would not represent the real dimensions the true dimensions of the top of the box and the perspective distortion were corrected according to the actual measured dimensions of the box in the second part of the code the boundaries of the zoi were marked on the image then in the last part of the code the width height and area of the zoi were analyzed an ellipse the perspective of the symmetric unstimulated circle was fitted to the circular zoi of the unstimulated case and the eccentricity of the ellipsoid with respect to the injection well was calculated in other words the area is exactly calculated and reported and the fitted ellipse is merely used to attribute eccentricity and larger smaller diameters to the area the original image fig 8a 1st row image was captured for the unstimulated without rf wave air sparging case for configuration c3 at the air injection pressure of 14 kpa the next image fig 8a 2nd row image was the one processed using the matlab code to correct the perspective of the image the dashed lines in this image fig 8a 2nd row image i e the processed image show the quantitatively marked boundary of the zoi the final image fig 8a 3rd row resulting from the last process of the matlab code shows an ellipsoid with the best fit to the zoi which was used to calculate all zoi quantitative characteristic factors table 2 the experiments and processing steps were performed three times for the unstimulated experiments of configuration c3 the same process was performed for the em stimulated case the top views of the zoi with rf waves applied are shown in fig 8b at a frequency of 191 7 mhz the power level at 25 w and the air injection pressure at 14 kpa the top image fig 8b 1st row image shows the original raw image the middle one fig 8b 2nd row image shows the processed image with the quantitatively marked boundary of the zoi in dashed line and the bottom image fig 8b 3rd row image shows the final image with a best fitted ellipsoid to the zoi similar to the unstimulated experiments these experiments were performed three times for configuration c3 results show that the regular circular shape of the zoi in the unstimulated experiments changed to irregular circular shapes of the zoi for the em stimulated experiments the digital images of the zoi were processed and quantitatively analyzed using the above mentioned matlab code to gain a better understanding of this change in the airflow of zoi due to em waves as shown in table 2 the area of the zoi becomes larger after applying rf waves this shows the beneficial effect of em waves to both control via controlling the eccentricity and expands the area of the zoi and mtz mass transfer zone of air sparging for complete cleanup of contaminants to investigate the effect of em power on the initiation of air channels two other sets of experiments were performed using configuration c3 these experiments were performed at the frequency of 191 7 mhz and at two power levels of 20 w and 30 w the results were compared with the results of the experiments performed at the power level of 25 w a quantitative study of the zoi at the em power of 30 w shows an increase in the area of the zoi in comparison with the case at the power level of 25 w the set of experiments performed at the power level of 20 w showed that the top view of the zoi was still a regular circular shape yet a larger one than that of the unstimulated case in other words the shape of the zoi at this power level 20 w was very similar to that of the unstimulated case em power 0 w however the quantitative study of the zoi shows an increase in the area of the circular zoi at the power level of 20 w in comparison with the circular zoi at the power level of 0 w unstimulated fig 9 shows the effect of the em power level on the area of the zoi the results show that the area of the zoi increased with increasing power level more than the increase in the area of the zoi controlling where new zois are formed can lead to a more cost effective way of enhancing the cleanup by air sparging thereafter configuration c4 was designed to confirm the results of configuration c3 i e prove em waves and not geometry are the cause of the effect on the zoi by changing only the location of the em source loop antenna for this configuration to the mirror of configuration c3 the result of experiments on configuration c4 demonstrates the independence of the effect from the geometry of the box medium pore distribution and any unforeseen heterogeneity in the box or external influences in this experiment em waves were launched at the frequency of 191 7 mhz and a power level of 25 w then the effect of em waves on the initiation of the zoi was studied for configuration c4 the results of the experiments for configuration c4 are the same as the results for configuration c3 at the same frequency and em power level but mirrored the next group of experiments group d was designed to study the effect of em waves on already formed air channels old channels for this group the air was first injected into the saturated glass bead medium and then 15 min after air channels were already formed em waves were launched into the cavity to study the effect of em waves on already formed air channels old channels the results were monitored for 30 min of em stimulation the size of the roi and the shape of the zoi visible on the top view of configurations c1 c2 and c3 were observed to be similar to the unstimulated experiments with no change even with the increase in the applied em power the size of the roi and the shape of the zoi of already formed air channels on the top view did not change the side view of the zoi also stayed cone shaped for configurations c1 and c2 where only side view images of the zoi were available because there is an unsaturated layer of glass beads on the top of the box even after em waves were applied the size of the roi did not change in comparison with the unstimulated experiments in addition the zoi stayed circular shaped for configuration c3 where the top view images of zoi were available because the saturated layer extends to the top of the box even after applying em waves the size of the roi did not change in other words already formed channels are very stable and similar to the observation that no further increase in air injection pressure could alter already formed channels for more information see najafi 2013 em power could not alter the zoi shape and the roi size of already formed air channels 4 2 dielectrophoretic force causing em effect on air sparging as mentioned in order to investigate the effect of the em power level on the alteration of the zoi the tests for configuration c3 were performed at a frequency of 191 7 mhz for various power levels dielectrophoresis could be a potential mechanism by which em waves alter the shape and size of the zoi if dielectrophoresis is the controlling mechanism for this phenomenon a force should be exerted on air bubbles in the e 2 direction i e opposite direction of the gradient of the squared electric field the larger values of the electric field occur at the top and the center of the medium at a frequency of 191 7 mhz where the air injection well is located and the magnitude of the electric field decreases from the top to the bottom figs 4 and 5 in order to better investigate whether dielectrophoresis is the controlling phenomenon the study needs to be performed over all components of the electric field for this purpose the study is performed on the full 3d electric field vectors of the numerically simulated electric field validated against the experimentally collected ones the 3d matrix of the three components of the electric field numerically simulated using comsol was exported into matlab and then e 2 vector i e the opposite of the gradient of the squared electric field was computed using code developed in matlab however because of the 2d format of the top view digital images the x and y components of this force are more relevant to the change in the top exposure area of the zoi first and second components in eq 7 according to eq 7 each of these components creates a dielectrophoretic force in that specific direction as a result the x and y components of the gradient of the squared electric field were integrated over the z axis to find the overall altering effect on the air bubble while moving from the bottom injection well tip to the surface there are dielectrophoretic forces in the z direction as well but the effect on the zoi in this direction cannot be observed in the acquired 2d top view xy plane digital images a particle with a relative dielectric permittivity dielectric constant greater than that of the background medium moves toward the positive electric field gradient and vice versa eq 7 air bubbles particle in this study have a dielectric permittivity 1 much less than that of the saturated glass bead 31 medium thus if dielectrophoretic forces are present those forces should be in the direction of the negative gradient of the squared electric field e 2 the direction of the dielectrophoretic forces can be predicted by obtaining the direction of the e 2 vector in fig 10 the contour map represents the magnitude of the x and y components of the e 2 vector and the arrows the direction of the force i e e 2 in other words where the color bar is positive the force arrow will be downward and vice versa the direction of the x component of the force is from the center of the box toward its sides and the magnitude of the force increases from the center to the sides the force tends to expand the zoi in the x direction from the center to the sides of the box because the magnitude of the force in the x direction is not constant for all nodes on this cross sectional slice the force seems to render the symmetric zoi asymmetric in the x direction on the other hand the direction of the y component of the force is also from the center to the sides of the box in the y direction fig 10 hence the force in the y direction tends to expand the zoi toward the sides of the box in the y direction similarly because the magnitude of the force in the y direction is not constant for all nodes on this cross sectional slice the force seems to render the symmetric zoi asymmetric in the y direction the total force tends to expand em stimulated zoi toward walls of the box in the y direction and sides in the x direction hence the dielectrophoretic studies agree with an increase in the area of em stimulated zoi and alteration of the zoi shape similar experiments need to be performed on natural sands to take into account the effects silt or clay particles and organic carbon have on the interactions between em waves and the soil media as shown in another work by the authors where the em waves effect on hydraulic conductivity of glass beads natural sand and clay were compared acharya and farid 2017 azad et al 2015 the experiments required an em power under 30 w more research needs to be performed to evaluate the scaleup to an actual field however as an initial estimate this work required an em power up to 30 w for the 61 5 cm 40 cm 15 cm medium and the required power and cost in an actual field can be calculated based on the ratio between the largest side of the affected region in cm and 61 5 cm the scaleup for the same frequency is expected to be linear however if a lower frequency is used in the field the wavelength would be larger by the ratio between the em frequency used in the field and the one used in this work thus the penetration in the field at the lower frequency will be deeper and the power consumption may be smaller by that frequency ratio 5 conclusions this paper investigates the effect of em waves on air channel formation during air sparging the experimental results and quantitative study of the zone of influence zoi of air sparging clearly show that em waves can be used to alter and control the shape and size of the zoi during air sparging in another research najafi 2013 the authors studied the effect of initial air injection pressure before air sparging and that of further increase in air pressure during air sparging in the absence of em waves referred to as unstimulated hence this research was needed to compare the em stimulation effect with the air pressure effect in the unstimulated case of research by najafi 2013 to investigate the effect of em waves on the zoi the goal of this paper was to study the effect of em waves on the shape and size of the zoi two configurations c3 and c4 were designed for this part a matlab code was developed to quantitatively study the zoi using processed digital images the results of both sections were processed and quantitatively studied using the matlab code and compared to the effect of em waves on characteristics of the zoi the results show that already formed air channels are very stable hence similar to the observation that no further increase in air pressure can alter the zoi see najafi 2013 em waves do not have any effect on already formed air channels old channels for all attempted frequencies and power levels in other words neither further increase in air injection pressure nor em waves can alter the shape and size of already formed zois for all configurations c1 c2 c3 and c4 the em waves effect on the initiation of air channels new channels cannot be observed for configurations c1 and c2 no available top view of the zoi due to the presence of the unsaturated layer of glass beads on the top of the box em waves however visibly affect the initiation of air channels new channels for configuration c3 where the top view of the zoi is visible because the saturated layer of glass beads extends to the top of the box in other words the shape and size of the zoi are altered under em stimulation at a frequency of 191 7 mhz and power levels of 25 w and 30 w in comparison with the unstimulated medium according to the quantitative study of processed digital images the area of the zoi in the fully saturated configuration c3 increased in the em stimulated medium in comparison with the unstimulated medium by 16 in addition the shape of the zoi on the top view of the zoi changed from a regular circle in the unstimulated medium to an irregular asymmetric shape in the em stimulated medium for configuration c3 at the frequency of 191 7 mhz and power levels of 20 25 and 30 w em waves have the same effect on the initiation of air channels for configuration c4 as configuration c3 which proves the independence of the results of configuration c3 from the geometry of the experimental box and heterogeneity of the glass bead medium according to the study of the dielectrophoretic forces in all configurations the force behaves dielectrophoretically and tends to expand the zoi in the x and y directions from the center to the sides of the box the results of the dielectrophoretic studies are in agreement with the experimental results as a result dielectrophoretic forces could be the dominant factor behind the em stimulation affecting the zoi it is noteworthy that similar research needs to be performed on natural sands and water to account for the effects silt or clay particles as well as organic carbon within soil or contaminated water may have on the interactions of em waves with soil media and air sparging through

1614,air sparging is a popular yet slow remediation technology for soil and groundwater contaminated with volatile organic compounds vocs this paper theoretically and experimentally studies the effect of electromagnetic em waves on air channel formation within a glass bead medium used as an analogy to soil during air sparging experiments the impact of em waves on cleanup is not the focus of this paper and the impact on airflow may or may not positively impact resulting cleanup process using air sparging to remove vocs through volatilization the hypothesis is that dielectrophoretic forces by em waves can be used to alter airflow air injection was performed at different pressures in the presence of em waves referred to as em stimulated of various power and frequencies and the absence of em waves referred to as unstimulated digital images of the airflow patterns were collected processed and analyzed for all tests the shape of the zone of influence zoi was observed and the radius of the zone of influence roi was measured which showed a 16 increase in roi due to em stimulation an experimentally validated numerical simulation of the electric field component of em waves was developed the correlation between em wave and air sparging characteristics were then studied using the numerical simulation and acquired digital images of the airflow to investigate and validate that the dielectrophoretic mechanism is behind the em effect on airflow keywords air sparging electromagnetic standing wave resonant cavity dielectrophoresis zone of influence radius of influence 1 introduction air sparging is a popular method to clean contaminated soils through volatilization of volatile organic compounds vocs and can also help mitigate liquefaction michael and ken 2006 johnson et al 1993 marley et al 1996 air sparging however is limited by random air channel formation which creates a mass transfer zone mtz of limited size within and adjacent to each randomly formed individual air channel braida and ong 2001 therefore the current air sparging practice can take years if not decades is costly and ineffective and can lead to incomplete remediation one of the most popular methods to enhance air sparing s effectiveness is pulsating the air injection pumps benner et al 2002 pulsation is also time consuming and uncontrolled another method used to enhance several remediation technologies not discussed in this paper is the use of direct electric current dc or alternating electric current ac in saturated soils suthersan and raton 1999 in the dc method contaminant transport and the flow of oxygen can be generated or oriented along the direction of the electric current however the oxygen flow paths would still be limited to preferential paths of the electric current namely regions of high electric conductivity although the heat produced by dc or ac enhances the diffusion between air channels it may adversely affect microbial activities within the soil due to the high amount of generated heat in the dc case the ph of the medium can also be altered leading to an adverse effect on the soil and groundwater microbial organisms researchers have also studied the effect of electromagnetic waves on remediation vermeulen and mcgee 2000 studied the use of electromagnetic em heating in environmental industries they used low frequency 60 hz em waves to heat the soil in order to change the viscosity of energy fuels to promote removal of contaminants price et al 1999 studied the same phenomenon and performed in situ tests with a 25 kw radio frequency rf wave generator used in conjunction with air sparging and soil vapor extraction sve the result showed an increased removal of gasoline range organics however the possibility of reducing the generated heat and or negative environmental impacts due to overheating of organisms was never investigated farid et al 2014 azad et al 2013 the driving effect of the em waves on contaminants was not studied either this paper focuses on the major goal of using electromagnetic em stimulation to enhance air sparging while generating minimal heat the goal of this research is to theoretically and experimentally determine the effect of em waves on the formation i e shape and size of the zone of influence of air sparging in addition because the alternating electric field component of em waves oscillates water dipole molecules it can potentially enhance several transport mechanisms such as air and contaminant diffusion within saturated media fig 1 demonstrates a schematic image of a system utilizing em waves from above ground and or borehole antenna arrays to enhance air sparging based on the results of this paper to be most effective the em system needs to be turned on before the air is injected 2 background the focus of this study is on the effects of the em wave s propagation on the air sparging in the partially and fully saturated media therefore some background needed for the creation of desired radiation patterns within a controlled environment resonant cavities and dielectrophoresis concepts are discussed herein 2 1 resonant cavities and waveguides for setup preparation a waveguide is a structure made of perfectly electric conductive pec material that supports the propagation of a wave rectangular waveguides are often used in high power microwave applications circular waveguides have even higher power handling capacity than rectangular waveguides a resonant cavity is a waveguide with its two ends terminated using pec planes cavity and waveguide walls should be thick enough to provide mechanical rigidity 1 to 3 mm and the inside walls should be smoothly polished to reduce em energy loss waveguides and cavities can support transverse electric te and transverse magnetic tm modes in the te mode the electric field is only transverse to the direction of em wave propagation in the tm mode the magnetic field is only transverse to the direction of em wave propagation the order of the mode of a cavity refers to the electric or magnetic field configuration in the waveguide and is represented by m and n integer subscripts e g te mn and tm mn the first subscript m corresponds to the number of half wave variations of the field in the x direction and the second subscript n corresponds to the number of half wave variations in the y direction in conjunction with the waveguide or cavity dimensions m and n determine the cutoff frequency for a particular mode wentworth 2005 the resonant frequency of te mn z or tm mn z modes is represented by 6 f cmn te tm 1 2 π με m a 2 n b 2 where a and b are the dimensions of the rectangular waveguide in the x and y directions z is the direction of the wave propagation and c stands for cut off frequency the possible mode numbers m and n for te z and tm z can be any positive integer numbers wentworth 2005 brown et al 1973 2 2 dielectrophoretic force causing em effect on airflow the hypothesis of this paper is that dielectrophoresis is the mechanism of em induced alteration of airflow and air channel formation dielectrophoresis is a phenomenon in which particles that are not electrically charged and are placed within a background medium can experience a force created by an electric field gradient dielectrophoresis can be a possible mechanism of motion of neutral and nonpolar particles by em stimulation pohl et al 1978 an alternating electric field can induce polarization into neutral particles within the medium and the polarized particles will then be subject to a net force from an electric field gradient regardless of their charge resulting in an induced motion as a result even nonpolar particles will be subjected to an opposite motion the resulting force is also dependent on the electric properties of the medium and the particles the size of the particles and the frequency of the electric field the force exerted by dielectrophoresis is dependent on the complex dielectric permittivity of the particles ε p f m and the surrounding medium ε m the induced force f dep n can be described by 7 f dep 2 π r 3 ε m re ε p ε m ε m e 2 where e is the nonuniform electric field v m and r is the radius m of the homogeneous sphere of the neutral particle this force is proportional to the gradient of the squared magnitude of the nonuniform electric field when the dielectric permittivity of the particles is lower than that of the background medium the particles will move toward the area of lower electric field intensity in the case where the dielectric permittivity of the particles is higher than that of the background medium the particles will move against the gradient of the electric field i e toward the area of higher electric field intensity for dispersive i e where dielectric permittivity is frequency dependent particles and or background media the effect of dielectrophoresis is frequency dependent for each medium and particle combination farid et al 2014 azad et al 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 laboratory work the experimental box used in this set of experiments is a 61 5 cm 40 cm 15 cm acrylic box encased within electrically conductive transparent films that are electrically grounded the walls of the box were 0 6 cm thick it is noteworthy that the top front and back walls of the tank were covered with transparent electrically conductive films to enable visualization other walls were covered with aluminum tape with electric conductive adhesives thus the tank acts as a resonant cavity to form the electric field into a controlled standing wave pattern within the tank because of em wave reflection at the boundary the medium contains the incident and reflected waves forming standing waves a loop coupled antenna was added to the top of the box to launch em waves of different predetermined radiation patterns into the medium fig 2 illustrates a schematic view of the setup the box was filled with deaerated deionized water and then filled with glass beads using the wet pluviation method vaid and negussey 1998 in order to prepare a homogeneous saturated medium for more information see najafi 2013 water found in an actual field would have contaminants in the form of suspended neutral particles or dissolved ions charged particles where especially charged ones can interact more with em waves and affect the results for example charged particles can render the media lossier more energy absorbing and reduce the penetration depth of em waves requiring more em power increasing the cost glass beads used for this study are class a ballotini impact beads from potters company with a specific gravity of 2 46 g cm3 glass beads have a very uniform grain size distribution since their particles have a size ranging from 0 6 to 0 85 mm which is comparable to the lower bound of coarse sands coarse sands range from 0 425 mm to 2 mm sieves 40 to 10 respectively this resulted in a glass bead medium with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 39 10 4 m s after preparing the saturated glass bead medium the air was injected into the saturated glass bead medium deaerated water was used to prevent the generation of air bubbles on the boundary walls to avoid obscuring images as well as to create a controlled medium for each test air was injected through a pvc tube placed at the center of the box to simulate the air injection well the tube had a 2 15 cm outside diameter 1 6 cm inside diameter and 50 cm length four 1 6 mm diameter holes were drilled symmetrically along the lower 3 cm of the tube to allow symmetric air transfer into the glass bead medium the end of the tube was plugged an acrylic plate was placed above the tank to support the tube in its proper location within the box the tube used for air injection was placed in the middle of the top plate with its plugged bottom resting 3 cm above the bottom of the glass bead filled middle compartment 7 cm above the tank bottom the air injection system was designed to inject air in a symmetric way a ¼inch clear pvc tube was used as a connection between the source of air and the air injection tube a dwyer vfa 8 bv flowmeter proper for the pressure range of this study was added to measure the airflow rate which was located before the air injection well the scale unit of this flowmeter is scfh standard cubic feet per minute of the volumetric flow rate of gas at the set standard condition of 49 c maximum temperature and 960 kpa for pressure a pressure gauge was located right after the flowmeter to measure the air injection pressure entering the well the size of the generated air bubbles was observed to be in the submillimeter range digital imaging of the top of the tank was performed to quantitatively analyze the airflow induced into fully water saturated glass bead media and to determine the size and shape of the zoi it is again noteworthy that this paper studies the use of em waves to alter the size of the zoi and the impact of this zoi change on the remediation performance of air sparging is not the focus of this paper and needs to be investigated in the future the imaging was performed using two 18 megapixel canon rebel digital cameras a t2i and a t4i model one camera was located at the top of the box to take top view images of the zoi another camera was placed against the front side of the box to take front view images all experiments were performed in the presence and absence of em stimulation at various frequencies and power levels to evaluate the effect of em stimulation on the formation size and shape of air channels formed under different air pressure levels a signal generator was used as the source of em waves the signal generator was connected to an amplifier to amplify the power launched into the medium this amplification is used to enable examination of the effect of various em power intensities at each frequency of operation other devices include a vector network analyzer a spectrum analyzer a matching network and a dual directional coupler as mentioned the antenna used for excitation in the experiments was a loop coupled antenna the antenna was made from an rg 8 coaxial cable protruding through the top plate with the outer conductive shield stripped the remainder of the outer shield was grounded to the same ground as the cavity and the center conductor was looped back and connected to the top electrically conductive plate to share the same electric grounding a dual directional coupler was used to enable monitoring the forward into the cavity and reflected back into the amplifier powers to map the electric field a 3d translation table was used to position a monopole probe at all desired nodes on a 3d grid within the cavity 3 1 1 experiment procedure four configurations were designed and prepared and airflow patterns were observed for all four configurations with and without applying em waves it should be noted that the unstimulated experiments here are similar to the tests performed in a previous of the airflow by the authors for more information see najafi 2013 the first three configurations c1 c2 and c3 were designed to evaluate the effect of the thickness of the overburden partially saturated zone on the roi and the homogeneity of the configuration during air sparging these three configurations are different in thickness of the partially and fully saturated zones and are the same as in the above mentioned airflow study najafi 2013 setups with the exception of the addition of an antenna to the top side of the box configuration c4 was designed to evaluate the independence of results from the geometry of the box medium pore distribution i e any unforeseen heterogeneity within the medium and repeatability therefore the antenna was located on the opposite side of the top plate table 1 shows the properties of these configurations in theory the porosity of all configurations should be same but naturally due to small variations in the pluviation method and experimental work the porosities of configurations are slightly different yet reasonably similar two series of experiments were performed for this study 1 a series of experiments without applying em waves groups a and b for more information see najafi 2013 and 2 another series of experiments with em waves groups c and d explained in detail here unlike the unstimulated experiments conducted at various air injection pressure levels the em stimulated experiments were conducted at specific frequencies power levels and the same range of air injection pressure levels 14 40 45 57 and 60 kpa 3 1 2 em stimulated experiment procedure as mentioned two variations of experiments referred to as groups c and d were performed for the em stimulated series of experiments in this paper the first group referred to as group c was performed to study the effect of em waves on the initiation of air channels new channels analogous to group a where the injection pressure effect on air channel initiation was studied without em stimulation by najafi 2013 the em stimulation of this group was performed at different frequencies em powers and initial air injection pressures for all configurations c1 c2 c3 and c4 the second group referred to as group d was performed to study the effect of em waves on already formed air channels old channels analogous to group b by najafi 2013 where the injection pressure effect on already formed air channels was studied without em stimulation group d was also performed for all four configurations c1 c2 c3 and c4 at different frequencies em power levels and air injection pressure levels 3 2 simulation of em waves within cavity of experimental setup to investigate and validate dielectrophoresis as mechanism behind em effect the experimental electric field measurement could only be made at limited points within the cavity in addition these measurements were made using a vertically polarized dipole probe connected to a spectrum analyzer the measurements are hence dominated by the vertical component of the electric field at measurement points a 3d vector visualization of the electric field is however needed for the complete study of the relation between em waves and their effect on airflow the 3d vector visualization of the em field can however be provided using numerical models of the experimental setup fig 3 the numerical simulation was performed using the finite element software comsol multiphysics 4 3 the rf module of comsol multiphysics was used to model the electromagnetic field launched into the cavity via the coaxial loop antenna the choice of the applied frequency for the resonant cavity was based on the numerically simulated electric field after experimental validation in order to validate the numerical model the electric field was experimentally measured on grids on different vertical slices at various frequencies close to the resonant mode frequencies in the range of 60 200 mhz of the resonant cavity the results were used to prepare contour maps of the electric field for each slice at each frequency at the same time the numerical model was used to simulate the electric field at the same frequency and the vertical component of the electric field e z was compared with the experimentally measured field the process was repeated for different frequencies until the two contour maps referred to as experimental measurements and numerical model agreed to an acceptable level the experimental electric field matching the numerical simulation was observed at the frequency of 191 7 mhz which is the frequency that the setup and amplifier are impedance matched thus the experimental results at 191 7 mhz were used to validate the numerical simulation figs 4 and 5 show the experimentally measured and numerically simulated contour maps for two slices at this frequency after the numerical model was validated against the vertical field experimental results the total electric field values from the comsol results were imported into matlab to study dielectrophoresis forces if dielectrophoresis is the controlling mechanism the force causing flow and the flow itself should be the in the e 2 direction i e opposite direction of the gradient of the electric field squared this is over a 15 cm 15 cm square in the middle of the cavity box a finer meshing size was used for this section and the zone of influence was meshed extremely fine to provide more accurate electric field values fig 6 4 results 4 1 stimulated experiments the em stimulated series of experiments groups c and d were performed within configurations c1 c2 c3 and c4 where the medium was stimulated using em waves for group c the medium was first stimulated at different frequencies and em power levels after 15 min of em stimulation the air injection was initiated at specific initial air injection pressure levels to study the effect of em waves on the initiation of air channels the zoi was cone shaped even in the em stimulated medium on the other hand since configurations c1 and c2 had a partially saturated glass bead layer on top the zoi cannot be viewed on the top view for either the unstimulated or em stimulated hence the side view on the front of the box was used to evaluate any em effect on the zoi however there was no change in the roi i e the radius of the zoi and the shape of the zoi visible on the front face of the box even at higher magnitudes of em power for c1 and c2 this result indicates that there is either no change to the roi or not a large enough change extended to the walls of the cavity to be visible then the fully water saturated medium c3 was em stimulated and the air was injected into the medium c3 the zoi and roi for this case were observed via the top view of the box since the zoi can have a clear appearance on the top view of the saturated medium only when the medium was em stimulated at 191 7 mhz at powers of 25 w and 30 w was there a change observed on the size of the roi and the shape of the zoi in comparison with the unstimulated case the shape of the zoi on the top surface of the initially unstimulated fully water saturated sample studied three times each was observed to be circular shaped however the zoi changed from the symmetric circular shape to an asymmetric shape for the em stimulated case and was similar during all three tests fig 7 this could be due to the fact that 191 7 mhz is the first resonant mode of the cavity of this size where the dielectrophoretic field is at its maximum at the air injection well 4 1 1 quantitative study of zoi using digital image analysis enlarging the size of the zoi will increase the perimeter of the zoi based on the work by braida and ong 2001 it is not guaranteed that this can lead to an increase in the size of the surrounding mtz and better cleanup hence the following section investigates the impact of em waves on the size of the zoi however it is noteworthy that due to limitations in the air channels size spacing and lack of temporal variation merely increasing the size of the zoi may not be sufficient to enhance air sparging performance in order to quantitatively investigate the em effect on the zoi for configuration c3 a matlab code was developed to calculate the area of the zoi and other quantitative properties of the zoi due to space limits within the lab and the location of the cables connected to the loop antenna the top camera was located at an oblique angle above the box due to this oblique angle of view the dimensions in the original images would not represent the real dimensions the true dimensions of the top of the box and the perspective distortion were corrected according to the actual measured dimensions of the box in the second part of the code the boundaries of the zoi were marked on the image then in the last part of the code the width height and area of the zoi were analyzed an ellipse the perspective of the symmetric unstimulated circle was fitted to the circular zoi of the unstimulated case and the eccentricity of the ellipsoid with respect to the injection well was calculated in other words the area is exactly calculated and reported and the fitted ellipse is merely used to attribute eccentricity and larger smaller diameters to the area the original image fig 8a 1st row image was captured for the unstimulated without rf wave air sparging case for configuration c3 at the air injection pressure of 14 kpa the next image fig 8a 2nd row image was the one processed using the matlab code to correct the perspective of the image the dashed lines in this image fig 8a 2nd row image i e the processed image show the quantitatively marked boundary of the zoi the final image fig 8a 3rd row resulting from the last process of the matlab code shows an ellipsoid with the best fit to the zoi which was used to calculate all zoi quantitative characteristic factors table 2 the experiments and processing steps were performed three times for the unstimulated experiments of configuration c3 the same process was performed for the em stimulated case the top views of the zoi with rf waves applied are shown in fig 8b at a frequency of 191 7 mhz the power level at 25 w and the air injection pressure at 14 kpa the top image fig 8b 1st row image shows the original raw image the middle one fig 8b 2nd row image shows the processed image with the quantitatively marked boundary of the zoi in dashed line and the bottom image fig 8b 3rd row image shows the final image with a best fitted ellipsoid to the zoi similar to the unstimulated experiments these experiments were performed three times for configuration c3 results show that the regular circular shape of the zoi in the unstimulated experiments changed to irregular circular shapes of the zoi for the em stimulated experiments the digital images of the zoi were processed and quantitatively analyzed using the above mentioned matlab code to gain a better understanding of this change in the airflow of zoi due to em waves as shown in table 2 the area of the zoi becomes larger after applying rf waves this shows the beneficial effect of em waves to both control via controlling the eccentricity and expands the area of the zoi and mtz mass transfer zone of air sparging for complete cleanup of contaminants to investigate the effect of em power on the initiation of air channels two other sets of experiments were performed using configuration c3 these experiments were performed at the frequency of 191 7 mhz and at two power levels of 20 w and 30 w the results were compared with the results of the experiments performed at the power level of 25 w a quantitative study of the zoi at the em power of 30 w shows an increase in the area of the zoi in comparison with the case at the power level of 25 w the set of experiments performed at the power level of 20 w showed that the top view of the zoi was still a regular circular shape yet a larger one than that of the unstimulated case in other words the shape of the zoi at this power level 20 w was very similar to that of the unstimulated case em power 0 w however the quantitative study of the zoi shows an increase in the area of the circular zoi at the power level of 20 w in comparison with the circular zoi at the power level of 0 w unstimulated fig 9 shows the effect of the em power level on the area of the zoi the results show that the area of the zoi increased with increasing power level more than the increase in the area of the zoi controlling where new zois are formed can lead to a more cost effective way of enhancing the cleanup by air sparging thereafter configuration c4 was designed to confirm the results of configuration c3 i e prove em waves and not geometry are the cause of the effect on the zoi by changing only the location of the em source loop antenna for this configuration to the mirror of configuration c3 the result of experiments on configuration c4 demonstrates the independence of the effect from the geometry of the box medium pore distribution and any unforeseen heterogeneity in the box or external influences in this experiment em waves were launched at the frequency of 191 7 mhz and a power level of 25 w then the effect of em waves on the initiation of the zoi was studied for configuration c4 the results of the experiments for configuration c4 are the same as the results for configuration c3 at the same frequency and em power level but mirrored the next group of experiments group d was designed to study the effect of em waves on already formed air channels old channels for this group the air was first injected into the saturated glass bead medium and then 15 min after air channels were already formed em waves were launched into the cavity to study the effect of em waves on already formed air channels old channels the results were monitored for 30 min of em stimulation the size of the roi and the shape of the zoi visible on the top view of configurations c1 c2 and c3 were observed to be similar to the unstimulated experiments with no change even with the increase in the applied em power the size of the roi and the shape of the zoi of already formed air channels on the top view did not change the side view of the zoi also stayed cone shaped for configurations c1 and c2 where only side view images of the zoi were available because there is an unsaturated layer of glass beads on the top of the box even after em waves were applied the size of the roi did not change in comparison with the unstimulated experiments in addition the zoi stayed circular shaped for configuration c3 where the top view images of zoi were available because the saturated layer extends to the top of the box even after applying em waves the size of the roi did not change in other words already formed channels are very stable and similar to the observation that no further increase in air injection pressure could alter already formed channels for more information see najafi 2013 em power could not alter the zoi shape and the roi size of already formed air channels 4 2 dielectrophoretic force causing em effect on air sparging as mentioned in order to investigate the effect of the em power level on the alteration of the zoi the tests for configuration c3 were performed at a frequency of 191 7 mhz for various power levels dielectrophoresis could be a potential mechanism by which em waves alter the shape and size of the zoi if dielectrophoresis is the controlling mechanism for this phenomenon a force should be exerted on air bubbles in the e 2 direction i e opposite direction of the gradient of the squared electric field the larger values of the electric field occur at the top and the center of the medium at a frequency of 191 7 mhz where the air injection well is located and the magnitude of the electric field decreases from the top to the bottom figs 4 and 5 in order to better investigate whether dielectrophoresis is the controlling phenomenon the study needs to be performed over all components of the electric field for this purpose the study is performed on the full 3d electric field vectors of the numerically simulated electric field validated against the experimentally collected ones the 3d matrix of the three components of the electric field numerically simulated using comsol was exported into matlab and then e 2 vector i e the opposite of the gradient of the squared electric field was computed using code developed in matlab however because of the 2d format of the top view digital images the x and y components of this force are more relevant to the change in the top exposure area of the zoi first and second components in eq 7 according to eq 7 each of these components creates a dielectrophoretic force in that specific direction as a result the x and y components of the gradient of the squared electric field were integrated over the z axis to find the overall altering effect on the air bubble while moving from the bottom injection well tip to the surface there are dielectrophoretic forces in the z direction as well but the effect on the zoi in this direction cannot be observed in the acquired 2d top view xy plane digital images a particle with a relative dielectric permittivity dielectric constant greater than that of the background medium moves toward the positive electric field gradient and vice versa eq 7 air bubbles particle in this study have a dielectric permittivity 1 much less than that of the saturated glass bead 31 medium thus if dielectrophoretic forces are present those forces should be in the direction of the negative gradient of the squared electric field e 2 the direction of the dielectrophoretic forces can be predicted by obtaining the direction of the e 2 vector in fig 10 the contour map represents the magnitude of the x and y components of the e 2 vector and the arrows the direction of the force i e e 2 in other words where the color bar is positive the force arrow will be downward and vice versa the direction of the x component of the force is from the center of the box toward its sides and the magnitude of the force increases from the center to the sides the force tends to expand the zoi in the x direction from the center to the sides of the box because the magnitude of the force in the x direction is not constant for all nodes on this cross sectional slice the force seems to render the symmetric zoi asymmetric in the x direction on the other hand the direction of the y component of the force is also from the center to the sides of the box in the y direction fig 10 hence the force in the y direction tends to expand the zoi toward the sides of the box in the y direction similarly because the magnitude of the force in the y direction is not constant for all nodes on this cross sectional slice the force seems to render the symmetric zoi asymmetric in the y direction the total force tends to expand em stimulated zoi toward walls of the box in the y direction and sides in the x direction hence the dielectrophoretic studies agree with an increase in the area of em stimulated zoi and alteration of the zoi shape similar experiments need to be performed on natural sands to take into account the effects silt or clay particles and organic carbon have on the interactions between em waves and the soil media as shown in another work by the authors where the em waves effect on hydraulic conductivity of glass beads natural sand and clay were compared acharya and farid 2017 azad et al 2015 the experiments required an em power under 30 w more research needs to be performed to evaluate the scaleup to an actual field however as an initial estimate this work required an em power up to 30 w for the 61 5 cm 40 cm 15 cm medium and the required power and cost in an actual field can be calculated based on the ratio between the largest side of the affected region in cm and 61 5 cm the scaleup for the same frequency is expected to be linear however if a lower frequency is used in the field the wavelength would be larger by the ratio between the em frequency used in the field and the one used in this work thus the penetration in the field at the lower frequency will be deeper and the power consumption may be smaller by that frequency ratio 5 conclusions this paper investigates the effect of em waves on air channel formation during air sparging the experimental results and quantitative study of the zone of influence zoi of air sparging clearly show that em waves can be used to alter and control the shape and size of the zoi during air sparging in another research najafi 2013 the authors studied the effect of initial air injection pressure before air sparging and that of further increase in air pressure during air sparging in the absence of em waves referred to as unstimulated hence this research was needed to compare the em stimulation effect with the air pressure effect in the unstimulated case of research by najafi 2013 to investigate the effect of em waves on the zoi the goal of this paper was to study the effect of em waves on the shape and size of the zoi two configurations c3 and c4 were designed for this part a matlab code was developed to quantitatively study the zoi using processed digital images the results of both sections were processed and quantitatively studied using the matlab code and compared to the effect of em waves on characteristics of the zoi the results show that already formed air channels are very stable hence similar to the observation that no further increase in air pressure can alter the zoi see najafi 2013 em waves do not have any effect on already formed air channels old channels for all attempted frequencies and power levels in other words neither further increase in air injection pressure nor em waves can alter the shape and size of already formed zois for all configurations c1 c2 c3 and c4 the em waves effect on the initiation of air channels new channels cannot be observed for configurations c1 and c2 no available top view of the zoi due to the presence of the unsaturated layer of glass beads on the top of the box em waves however visibly affect the initiation of air channels new channels for configuration c3 where the top view of the zoi is visible because the saturated layer of glass beads extends to the top of the box in other words the shape and size of the zoi are altered under em stimulation at a frequency of 191 7 mhz and power levels of 25 w and 30 w in comparison with the unstimulated medium according to the quantitative study of processed digital images the area of the zoi in the fully saturated configuration c3 increased in the em stimulated medium in comparison with the unstimulated medium by 16 in addition the shape of the zoi on the top view of the zoi changed from a regular circle in the unstimulated medium to an irregular asymmetric shape in the em stimulated medium for configuration c3 at the frequency of 191 7 mhz and power levels of 20 25 and 30 w em waves have the same effect on the initiation of air channels for configuration c4 as configuration c3 which proves the independence of the results of configuration c3 from the geometry of the experimental box and heterogeneity of the glass bead medium according to the study of the dielectrophoretic forces in all configurations the force behaves dielectrophoretically and tends to expand the zoi in the x and y directions from the center to the sides of the box the results of the dielectrophoretic studies are in agreement with the experimental results as a result dielectrophoretic forces could be the dominant factor behind the em stimulation affecting the zoi it is noteworthy that similar research needs to be performed on natural sands and water to account for the effects silt or clay particles as well as organic carbon within soil or contaminated water may have on the interactions of em waves with soil media and air sparging through
