15325,in response to the growing global resource scarcity wastewater is increasingly seen as a valuable resource to recover and valorise for the benefit of the society rather than another waste that needs treatment before disposal conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps oxidise most of the organic matter present in wastewater instead of recovering it as a feedstock for biomaterials or to produce energy in the form of biogas in contrast an a stage is capable of producing a concentrated stream of organic matter ready for valorisation ideally suited to retrofit existing large plants this technology is based on the principle of high rate activated sludge process that favours biosorption and storage over oxidation in this paper we summarize peer reviewed research of both pilot scale and full scale studies of a stage process under real conditions highlighting key operational parameters in the majority of published studies the sludge retention time srt was identified as a key operational parameter an optimal srt of 0 3 days seems to maximize the redirection of influent cod up to 50 to the sludge flux while simultaneously keeping mineralization under 25 of total influent cod other key optimal parameters are a hydraulic residence time of 30 min and dissolved oxygen levels of 0 5 mg l 1 in addition nutrient removal efficiencies of 15 27 for total nitrogen and 13 38 for total phosphorus are observed influence of mixing on settling efficiencies remain largely underexplored as well as impact of wet weather flow and temperature on overall recovery efficiencies which hinders to provide recommendations on these aspects evolution of modelling efforts of a stage process are also critically reviewed the role of extracellular polymeric substances remain unclear and measures differ greatly according to the different studies and protocols better understanding the settling processes by adding limit of stokesian and threshold of flocculation measures to sludge volume index could help to reach a better understanding of the a stage process reliable modelling can help new unit processes find their place in the whole treatment chain and help the transition from

less is the new paradigm of the international water association in order to fulfil the sustainable development goal 6 clean water and sanitation by 2030 iwa 2016 for municipal wastewater treatment this paradigm requires a transition from wastewater treatment plants wwtps to water resource recovery facilities wrrfs there is a growing societal need expressed by stakeholders such as companies operating wwtps and local water authorities who are looking for sustainable solutions for treatment requirements organic matter present in raw wastewater is a source of chemical energy and can hence be considered as a resource approximately 6 9 kj of free energy is contained in 1 l of wastewater with an average concentration of 500 mg cod l 1 mccarty et al 2011 traditionally primary sedimentation tanks psts redirect some of the influent organics to produce primary sludge which is then anaerobically digested to generate biogas to offset the energy needs of the wwtp however psts have high space requirements and are quite inefficient in recovering this resource without chemical addition recovering organic matter prior to its oxidation is doubly advantageous as it minimizes aeration energy demand and simultaneously increases the methane produced wan et al 2016 amongst the best available process technologies that maximise recovery potential is a process based on high rate activated sludge hras also called a stage which is the focus of this review main advantage of a stage over other technologies for recovery such as chemically enhanced primary treatment cept is relatively lower operational costs as usually no reagent is utilised wan et al 2016 the a stage is part of the a b adsorption belebung process that has originally been developed in the 1970s and 1980s in the technical university of aachen böhnke 1977 to maintain nitrification process stability the a b process is a two stage process consisting of two activated sludge processes in series each with its own reactor clarifier and independent sludge recirculation loops as shown in fig 1 essentially a pst is replaced by the a stage process and can hence be considered a biologically enhanced primary treatment at the time of its development the b stage was operated only for ammonia removal as a low rate activated sludge process a stage is characterised by its high organic loading rate f m ratio coupled with low sludge age and short hydraulic residence times there is no universally accepted definition of operating parameters of a stage however most authors use a limit solid residence time srt of two days a comparison of some key process parameters between the a stage and conventional processes is presented in table 1 the a b process did not establish itself as a widely used process configuration because full mineralisation of nitrogen became an additional treatment requirement in the beginning of the 1990s the increased carbon removal in the a stage hinders heterotrophic denitrification in the b stage due to lack of sufficient organic carbon and most a b plants have been converted to conventional activated sludge cas processes compared to cas the extended aeration process variant applies very long sludge ages in order to achieve high organic matter removal and aerobic stabilisation of the sludge however two driving forces inspire the renewed interest in the a b process in recent years firstly the development in autotrophic n removal in the last two decades led to new approaches in coupling a stage and autotrophic n removal strategies such as partial nitritation anammox pna dai et al 2018 gu et al 2020 2018 secondly the impacts of climate change mata et al 2021 incites all sectors of human activity to minimize its contribution to the greenhouse effect developing waste valorisation technologies that can offset fossil fuel use has clear environmental benefits modin et al 2016 recent reviews from sancho et al 2019 and guven et al 2019 compiled the relevant technologies for recovering influent organic carbon focussing on a comparison of the main available carbon redirection technologies highlighting the importance of a stage process the review proposed by rahman et al 2020 gives an interesting evaluation of a stage and high rate contact stabilisation processes for carbon capture and highlights the interest of such processes to remove a significant amount of n and p in waste activated sludge was however a detailed analysis of peer reviewed studies on a stage discussing its mechanisms as well as its challenges and drawbacks is lacking this study aims to fill this gap and additionally summarises the experience of full scale implementations as well as attempts to model and simulate this process specific combinations of keywords were chosen for a search on webofknowledge com and sciencedirect com for studies on hras or a stage processes the results of which are succinctly summarized in table s1 supplementary material the search was continuously updated the most recent update was performed end of december 2021 only original research articles were included in addition to be considered the experimental conditions of the studies had to be clearly described e g the size of the treatment units duration and analytical procedures the keyword search yielded in a total of 116 publications the titles of studies were then screened according to their relevance to the topic and in case of a positive outcome the abstract and full text were consulted additional screening was conducted to select only papers related to the scope of our investigations thirty eight publications dealt with hras or a stage processes two studies had to be excluded from further evaluation since crucial information was lacking e g size of the experimental setups in the end 36 publications met the defined criteria of which nine described investigations of classical a stage setups the remaining articles were either hras variants such as high rate contact stabilization hics and high rate sequencing batch reactors hrsbr investigations conducted under static conditions focusing on specific parameters e g eps or in very small pilot scale a stage reactor volume smaller than 1 l or review articles without any experimental data 2 a stage process current knowledge during the initial development of a b process technology no particular attention was given to a stage technology and the focus was mainly on nitrogen removal in b stage as maintaining nitrification process stability was seen as a prime advantage versprille et al 1984 as this technology is being revisited in view of its ability to redirect influent cod to a sludge stream a better understanding of the mechanisms will be useful in design and operation the current knowledge on the a stage process starting with the driving mechanisms are summarized in the following sections then a section presenting results from laboratory scale and demonstration scale experiments is proposed including major influencing factors on carbon and nutrient capture finally a section presenting most of the a stage or hras full scale experiments published will be proposed before the discussion with the aim of highlighting the main challenges associated to the implementation of a b process into wrrfs 2 1 mechanisms of organic matter capture interactions organic matter present in the influent wastewater interacts with the return sludge in the a stage reactor in many complex mechanisms return sludge contains activated sludge flocs which are loosely bound amorphous structures that contain microorganisms embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps ni and yu 2012 the major mechanisms of interaction are assimilation biosorption and settling which are conceptually represented in fig 2 these mechanisms are a function of the properties of influent organic matter fractions as well as the nature of the flocs of the return sludge assimilation is a biological mechanism that removes part of the soluble biodegradable fraction biodegradable sc org of the organic carbon molecules that are small enough to pass through the cell membrane this fraction of biodegradable organic carbon serves both as carbon source and electron donor for the microorganisms for cell growth storage of polymers or production of extracellular polymeric substances eps and for cell maintenance hence a fraction of biodegradable sc org is oxidised to carbon dioxide and water by aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms the ratio of microbial growth rate and oxidation rate is called yield y von sperling 2015 microorganisms can store soluble biodegradable organic compounds in the form of intracellular inclusions the soluble compounds after penetrating the cell walls are converted to insoluble polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha triacylglycerides tag wax esters etc to avoid build up of high osmotic pressure across the cell membrane volatile fatty acids vfas such as acetate will result in storage of phas whereas carbohydrates such as glucose will result in storage of glycogen the bacteria are capable of reutilising the stored carbon for cell functions when no external carbon source is available i e during a famine phase dynamic process configurations such as sequencing batch reactors sbrs in which the activated sludge is exposed to periods of feast and famine induce storage behaviour coats et al 2011 biosorption is a combination of physico chemical interactions that bind colloidal and particulate fraction collc org and pc org biodegradable or not of organic matter to activated sludge flocs by weak adhesive forces there is no universally accepted definition of biosorption and various other terms are used to refer to this phenomenon such as sorption enmeshment bioflocculation agglomeration extra cellular adsorption etc eps may assist with this agglomeration depending on their quantity composition and surface properties kinyua et al 2017a in the sense of this article biosorption describes an extra cellular phenomenon distinguished from storage which is an intra cellular phenomenon biosorption has been recognized as the key mechanism contributing to carbon capture and driving the interest in a stage systems finally settling is a physical phenomenon where agglomerates form in the a stage reactor and sufficiently large organic matter pc org settle to the bottom of the separation unit typically a surface clarifier the settled sludge is either removed from the system or recirculated back to the reactor 2 2 overall a stage performances pilot and demonstration scale investigations from the identified papers nine articles at pilot and demonstration scale performed with real wastewater were selected information on experimental conditions of the reactor and influent effluent characteristics are summarized in table 2 there is a diversity in the scale of studies from laboratory scale to demonstration scale but most common hrt was set to 30 min and srt varied from 0 3 days to up to 2 days dissolved oxygen do level in the reactor was set to 0 5 mg l 1 in all studies except two where do set point was of 2 mg l 1 information on the influent and effluent cod was compiled when available all considered studies used raw wastewater with total cod ranging from a low 300 mg l 1 to more than 600 mg l 1 likewise information on fractions was compiled with colloidal fractions being measured following the protocol of mamais et al 1993 when available this protocol of cod fractionation yields three fractions of cod namely particulate cod pcod colloidal cod ccod and flocculated filtered cod ffcod some studies followed an older and simpler fractionation that involves direct filtration at 0 45 µm resulting in only two fractions particulate cod and filtered cod fcod it can be seen that all studies achieved a tcod removal of 50 with one study reaching up to 90 taboada santos et al 2020 which can be considered an outlier examining the cod fractions of the effluent most cod removal is due to the removal of pcod followed by ffcod and lastly ccod 2 2 1 influence of srt on cod mass balance cod mass balance is visually represented in fig 3 it shows three possible transformations of influent cod upon leaving the a stage system it can be calculated based on daily performance data of the process in steady conditions from the following equation considering no accumulation in the reactor 1 cod in cod eff cod min cod valo where cod in is the cod of influent cod eff is the cod of the a stage effluent cod min is the portion of cod that is lost as co2 cod valo is the cod embedded in the waste sludge an optimized a stage process maximizes the portion of cod in that is diverted to the sludge matrix cod valo while simultaneously minimizing the mineralized fraction cod min which is lost as co2 to the atmosphere table 3 presents the mineralization rate reported in literature on a stage the ratio of cod valo to cod in is the measure of the efficiency of the a stage process which is referred to as carbon recovery efficiency cao et al 2020 or carbon harvesting efficiency rahman et al 2016 cod eff is the fraction of influent cod that leaves a stage to the next unit treatment process typically cod min is calculated using this equation i e to close the mass balance whereas the rest of the parameters are measured all studies that reported mineralization rates are presented in table 3 jimenez et al 2015 concluded that the operational parameter with the highest influence on mineralization is the srt as longer srt resulted in more mineralisation of cod however even under comparable srts there is a substantial variation across different studies of the influent cod lost to the atmosphere as co2 these variations are possibly due to varying composition of influent cod mlss concentration temperature in the reactor and other uncontrolled process operational parameters kinyua et al 2017a influent cod fractions can play a major role on carbon redirection if we consider that 1 the particulate cod fraction is mostly removed by primary settling linked to the efficiency of the settling system in the a stage process 2 the soluble fraction is mostly linked to the bacterial assimilation and growth and 3 the colloidal matter fraction is removed by biosorption on bacterial material and eps therefore the carbon redirection of an influent rich in particulate cod will be limited by the settling capacity a effluent rich in colloidal cod will be limited by eps production and collision probability with biomass and an effluent rich in soluble cod by the bacterial growing conditions table 3 presents also the recovery rate of the sludge reported in the original research studies on classical a stage jimenez et al 2015 reported a trend of decreasing recovery as srt increased from 0 3 days to 2 days which is in contradiction with the study of kinyua et al 2017a much like for the opposing trends between the two studies observed for mineralisation rates in the majority of published studies srt of 0 3 days seems to be the optimal srt to maximise the capture of influent cod as sludge even though it is largely variable and most likely dependant on other operational parameters and nature of organic matter present in influent wastewater the optimal recovery value reaches 50 of the influent cod by considering the different pathway of cod in a stage several studies concluded that there is a threshold with an srt ranging between 0 2 and 0 4 enabling to maximize carbon capture jimenez et al 2015 rahman et al 2020 2 2 2 influence of do and hrt on cod mass balance do has a key role in bacterial metabolism and settling efficiency with regard to carbon mineralisation several studies have shown that a balance has to be found between low do level 0 5 mg l 1 where bacterial growth eps production and settling efficiency are limited and high do conditions 1 5 2 mg l 1 where mineralisation level and energy consumption are too high kinyua et al 2017a 2017b jimenez et al 2015 far fewer studies reported the impact of hrt on the cod recovery potential of a stage processes jimenez et al 2015 investigating hrts from 10 min to 60 min concluded that a hrt of 30 min as optimal beyond which negligible increase in tcod and scod removal were observed a similar conclusion was reached by de graaff et al 2016 carrying out aerated jar tests on a stage sludge from full scale plants the authors observed that 15 min contact time including the return stream is sufficient for most scod removal guven et al 2017 measured the impact of hrts of 130 95 and 60 min and found that the shortest hrt resulted in highest tcod recovery in the sludge and lowest effluent tss the effect of hrt on cod recovery is considerable if too short less than 30 min the contact time between the biomass and the substrate reduces the production of eps and the overall cod removal decreases if too long generally larger than 1 1 5 h the carbon capture is not maximized and mineralisation becomes too high 2 2 3 nutrients removal in a stage capturing nutrients represents another benefit of an a stage process and is mostly linked to assimilation during bacterial growth combined with capture into was average removal rate ranging from 15 to 27 tn and 13 38 tp have been reported rahman et al 2020 this could represent an interesting energy reduction in the downstream nutrient removal system the srt was observed to be a major factor influencing n removal with an increase of tn removal going from 22 at 0 5 d up to 49 at a 3 d ge et al 2017 the same pattern was observed for tp removal going from 15 at srt 1d up to 34 at 3 d srt ge et al 2017 increasing the srt improves the yield and therefore assimilation of nutrients but at the same time increases the mineralisation of cod 60 at a 3 d srt therefore the overall mass balance has to be considered to target the treatment strategy by either favouring carbon capture or nutrients removal typically full scale plants add metal salts in a stage to achieve additional tp removal see section 2 3 2 2 4 role of eps eps are microbial secretions and products of cellular lysis or hydrolysis they are negatively charged and make up 50 80 of organic fraction in activated sludge proteins pn and polysaccharides ps or carbohydrates are its main constituents making up 78 80 of eps with the rest being other organic fractions such as humics nucleic acids lipids etc dignac et al 1998 the eps concentration present in the sludge is naturally a function of various operating parameters including srt and do levels as well as influent characteristics faust et al 2014 it is hypothesized that both quantity and nature of eps can play an important role in biosorption of colloidal and particulate matter into the activated sludge floc matrix in a stage systems table 4 presents the quantity of total eps reported in different a stage systems as a function of srt at comparable do levels two studies jimenez et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 used the cation exchange resin frølund et al 1996 method for eps extraction whereas the rest of the studies which are more recent used the heat extraction method li and yang 2007 as of yet no standard method or protocol for eps measurement in activated sludge exists making it challenging to compare and interpret the results meaningfully table 4 presents eps measured in the mixed liquor in a stage in addition to the large heterogeneity in the total eps found across the studies their trend with respect to varying srts is also different depending on studies jimenez et al 2015 observed increasing eps concentrations with increasing srts which concurs with rahman et al 2016 however kinyua et al 2017a and rahman et al 2019 observed the opposite trend studying two srts of 0 28 and 0 56 days as well as 0 16 and 0 3 days respectively apparent differences in the reported values may be linked to measurement protocols as well as influent characteristics mlss concentrations f m ratio and other uncontrolled parameters with regards to the capture of pcod and ccod jimenez et al 2015 reported increasing eps concentration increased their capture whereas kinyua et al 2017a found no correlation more research is therefore needed to establish the part played by eps their total quantity and their nature in aiding organic matter capture through biosorption eps production is believed to improve carbon capture through colloidal cod capture mostly although contradictory results have been published maybe the following hypothesis can be formulated tightly bound tb fraction to the biological material can favour colloidal matter biosorption and settling whereas loosely bound lb fraction eps in suspension are more difficult to settle and can decrease the overall cod removal efficiency 2 2 5 settling characteristics settling is most commonly characterized by a measurement of sludge volume index svi following apha 2005 which considers settling over 30 min table 5 presents the svi reported in various a stage studies most studies report good svi 150 ml g tss 1 settling of a stage sludge with svi values between 30 and 80 ml g tss 1 even across varying srts from 0 3 days to 1 5 days comparing svis across a large range of srts ngo and massoudieh 2021 show a sharp peak svi of around 550 mg l 1 for an srt of approx 3 days with svis below 100 mg l 1 for srts below 2 days however a low svi alone is not a sufficient criterion to judge the clarifier performance in an a stage the tss concentrations of the supernatant can still be unusually high as observed by guven et al 2020 who reported an svi 50 ml g tss 1 but effluent tss concentrations higher than 150 mg l 1 this represents particulate and colloidal cod that could have been redirected to the waste sludge but is instead lost in the effluent this might be a consequence of the characteristics of the a stage mixed liquor where very small flocs are formed and sometimes not settling leading to high tss concentration in the supernatant the settled sludge could be made of particulate cod mostly studying the impact of hrt guven et al 2017 concluded that in addition to improving the cod recovered as sludge the svi also improved from hrt of 60 min compared to that of 130 min similarly rahman et al 2019 van winckel et al 2019 and wett et al 2020 all reported svi between 50 and 90 ml g tss 1 which is lower than that of conventional activated sludge where svis lower than 150 mg l 1 is considered a fair value von sperling 2015 this contrasts with the findings of the review of sancho et al 2019 where poor settling of a stage sludge is mentioned as the drawback that prevented a wider adaptation of a b processes worldwide in kinyua et al 2017a overall lower svi values at shorter srt 0 3 days could be due to the washout of filamentous organisms the impact of do was pronounced at higher srt presumably due to differences in types of filamentous organisms research on conventional activated sludge indicated links between the composition of eps of the sludge and its settling characteristics li and yang 2007 this method further characterizes eps as lb fraction and tb fraction by stepwise extraction the fractions are then analysed for their cod protein content pn and polysaccharide content ps two studies kinyua et al 2017a van winckel et al 2019 adopting this method for eps extraction and characterization explored a relation between settling and various a stage systems but did not find a conclusive relation between settling performance and eps neither total quantity nor its quality such as pn ps ratio this could be intrinsically linked to the role of eps in the capture of colloidal and particulate matter in the a stage reactor as discussed in 2 2 4 new metrics to characterize settling such as limit of stokesian settling loss mancell egala et al 2016 and threshold of flocculation tof mancell egala et al 2017 were developed to overcome the limits of established solids flux theory loss is the solids concentration of the sludge at which flocculent settling stokesian transitions into hindered non stokesian settling while tof is the concentration limit to induce floc formation and consequently transition from discrete to flocculent settling tof is hence a measure of particle collision efficiency it is hypothesized that if the mixed liquor solids concentration is between loss and tof the clarifier performance is optimized with minimal ts loss in the effluent developing on this approach very recent research ngo et al 2021 ngo and massoudieh 2021 proposes a relation between tof and effluent suspended solids via flocculent settling coefficient rp and a second relation between eps and tof this marks a first attempt in describing a relation between eps content and effluent suspended solids albeit indirectly as these parameters and approaches were only recently introduced little information is available in literature to validate the hypotheses in conclusion it is challenging to predict the settling properties and effluent quality of a stage and certainly more research is needed to explore the links between quantity and properties of eps and settling characteristics apart from tof loss and eps measurement other investigations could be performed to evaluate sludge settleability including microscopic ones measure of floc resistance to shear stress and measure of zeta potential of the flocs to our knowledge these investigations have never been applied to a stage mixed liquor 2 2 6 valorisation potential of a stage sludge the most common valorisation pathway of the produced sludge is via anaerobic digestion to produce biogas which is mainly a mixture of ch4 and co2 the produced energy can offset the plant s own energy requirement or it can be sold biochemical methane potential bmp is a measure of cumulative methane produced as the organic matter in the sample degrades under anaerobic conditions it is crucial in getting an insight into design parameters for anaerobic digesters holliger et al 2016 table 6 presents the bmp from various a stage studies expressed as produced volume of methane under normal conditions of temperature and pressure normalized to the amount of volatile solids introduced nml ch4 g vs 1 choo kun 2015 compared the bmp of sludge from primary settling a stage and a long sludge age process and found that a stage sludge had the higher bmp of 335 nml ch4 g vs compared to 290 nml ch4 g vs 1 and 220 nml ch4 g vs 1 for primary sludge and secondary sludge from extended aeration respectively hence the bmp of a stage sludge is not so different from primary sludge other studies have reported bmp values in the same range but comparison between studies is difficult as the influent wastewater characteristics both quantity and quality of organic matter can vary widely the wide range reported by trzcinski et al 2016 shows the influence of intraday variations and high oil and grease content in the influent few energy recovery indices were proposed such as methane recovery index and energy recovery index rey martínez et al 2021 these indices are useful in comparing the overall recovery potential of different a stage systems however not enough information is available to calculate these indices for studies summarized in table 6 another emerging valorisation pathway of the concentrated organics stream is the production of high value biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha that can be used to produce bioplastics however regulatory barriers and public acceptance of such products are of concern further research is required to make biopolymer production from waste sludge economically viable compared to plastics produced from fossil fuels gherghel et al 2019 2 3 full scale performance in the 1970s and 1980s a b process has been successfully implemented in full scale plants in some european countries especially in the netherlands germany and austria as mentioned in introduction the emergence of more stringent effluent requirements on nitrogen led to a decline in a b systems with some of them being reconfigured to cas due to lack of organic carbon for achieving the required denitrification the information that was found on existing full scale a stage hras implementation is summarized in table 7 it can be noted that a stage has been implemented in large to very large treatment plants in the case of the nieuwveer plant which was originally built in 1976 and refurbished to a b process in 1992 its original primary settlers were used as a stage settlers the vienna wwtp was undergoing an upgrade at the time of publication of kroiss and klager 2018 however the existing psts were retained in the process scheme and a stage treats pst effluent the vienna strategy is not a conventional a b process as defined in our review but presents an interesting strategy by using a two stage activated sludge with an hras receiving nitrates likewise the blue plains plant also utilises a stage hras technology after a primary treatment step in this case a cept process all full scale plants dose metal salts for phosphorus precipitation in the aeration tank but concentrations used are not provided for any of them in the available literature without the concentrations of metal salts used it is difficult to evaluate the effect of metal salt addition on cod valorisation efficiency and on settling wett et al 2020 observed no improvement in cod removal or settling performance up to a molar ratio of metal p of 0 5 most of the publications presenting full scale investigations focus on a stage and carbon removal strategy few elements are provided on the b stage the strategy presented at the vienna plant rely on a full nitrification denitrification process and an optimisation of carbon capture enabling enough redirection to perform full denitrification few options are available and rely on either full nitrification in case no restriction are applied or pna processes recent reviews have shown that pna processes are not completely mature for mainstream application to our knowledge no full scale success stories have been reported challenges remain at several levels including implementing an intelligent control of partial nitrification exploring the molecular biological mechanism of nob selective inhibition and strengthening of pre treatment process for partial nitrification wang et al 2021 energy consumption data on a stage is not available for most plants but it was reported as 0 17 and 0 10 kwh kg codremoved 1 for dokhaven and utrecht respectively de graaff et al 2016 it is higher than the 0 08 kwh kg codremoved 1 calculated reported by wett et al 2020 little knowledge is available on the dynamic performance of the a stage process and how the drop in performance during rain events or even sludge washout can be mitigated which is a major drawback of a stage processes diamantis et al 2014 3 discussion 3 1 knowledge synthetized in models numerical models are made for representing reality in a more or less simplified way and are very useful when comparing different treatment configurations in addition they embed the current knowledge associated to a specific process as far as short residence time processes such as a stage are concerned modifications to historical activated sludge models asm were required widely used models like asm1 are not suitable for systems with short residence times 2 days as first recognized by haider et al 2003 since the biodegradable fractions of organic matter was modelled as a single substrate and by a single removal kinetic one monod term which is a valid assumption for sludge ages longer than 5 days moreover these early models do not explicitly account for neither eps production nor biosorption mechanisms which play a key role in a stage process these physico chemical mechanisms were indeed not considered in the original asms as they were not limiting for the considered sludge ages 3 days in asm1 to model high rate processes without increasing the complexity of the model smitshuijzen et al 2016 modified asm1 by introducing a factor fsettler that accounts for the fraction of biodegradable particulate matter that is captured by the a stage system this factor accounts for both the efficiency of biosorption and the efficiency of separation in the settler in one term it was estimated from data from the full scale plant dokhaven rotterdam the netherlands including daily and seasonal variations to investigate the impact of rain events and changes in water temperature the results show that the model was able to predict effluent total cod with a 10 error under steady state conditions the model was also able to describe the drop in cod removal in a stage during winter months temperatures of 10 12 c via dynamic simulations which according to smitshuijzen et al 2016 is due to the decrease in heterotrophic activity at low temperatures rather than decrease in the efficiency of biosorption examining the data from another full scale a stage plant wett et al 2020 found the same relation of decreasing cod removal efficiency with decreasing temperatures contrarily they argue that it cannot be explained by the arrhenius effect on microbial growth and instead is rather by temperature sensitivity of biosorption reactions it is clear that more research effort is needed to fully understand this relation it can be however hypothesized that the decrease of temperature might reduce the frequency of collision between the colloidal matter and the floc tightly bound eps thus reducing biosorption lastly it was reported that the dokhaven plant uses iron salts for p removal in a stage reactor de graaff et al 2016 which was not mentioned in the context of the model development this simplified yet effective a stage model of smitshuijzen et al 2016 was further integrated into whole plant modelling by jia et al 2020 in order to study the benefits and drawbacks of a coupled a stage pna partial nitritation anammox system compared to a cas system the simulation results showed a trade off between maximising cod capture for energy recovery and minimizing residual cod entering the autotrophic pna reactor with operating conditions being an srt of 0 3 to 0 5 days and do of 0 3 to 0 5 mg l 1 the study also found the a stage pna configuration led to an increase of 50 of cod recovery as sludge compared to a cas plant and 60 lower overall aeration energy all the while meeting the eu discharge limits eu urban wastewater directive 91 271 eec of 21 may 1991 in a stage pna configuration the cod recovery is mostly linked to the a stage sludge contribution of b stage sludge has been estimated as to a maximum of 10 12 of cod redirection wan et al 2016 nogaj et al 2015 developed a more mechanistic approach to model high rate processes by introducing additional state variables to asm1 model on a single biomass population two substrates were considered fast and slow biodegradable organic matter with fast biodegradable fraction being considered as vfa concentration in the influent influent cod was split into three subparts with colloidal cod being considered explicitly as an additional state variable which is an upgrade compared to asm1 eps was also added as a state variable along with storage products and sorption of colloidal substrate hauduc et al 2019 built upon this model by adding a new fast growing biomass and a further fractionation of fast biodegradable organic matter into vfas and other organic compounds flocculation of colloidal particles is a rate limiting process in a stage systems and thus was modelled explicitly as a function of eps present in the biomass furthermore as flocculation is sensitive to temperature and mixing intensities an empirical factor range 0 1 on flocculation rate was introduced to account for deflocculation processes finally storage products are modelled to reflect lower mineralization rates observed in a stage and it is supported by experimental observations by kinyua et al 2017b this study measured pha production yields at different srts 0 28 day and 0 56 day and do concentrations 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg l 1 without a dynamic feast famine configuration a maximum pha concentration of 42 mg cod gvss 1 was found in the aerobic reactors at srt of 0 28 days and do of 1 0 mg l 1 with a corresponding pha yield of 1 20 g pha cod gvfa 1 pha concentrations were always higher at the lower srt in this study literature on storage product formation in a stage is scarce and more research is perhaps needed to further understand the contribution of storage and its influence on other operating parameters the new plant wide model has the advantage of being valid in other biological process units with different operating conditions without employing interface equations it predicted low mineralization rates found in a stage systems colloidal concentrations in the effluent were also predicted thanks to explicit modelling of flocculation as a function of eps content the greater the quantity of eps the higher is the portion of captured colloids to form particulates however the bio kinetic model can be quite sensitive to influent characterization as it demands many fractions that are generally not measured such as vfa and biomass concentration moreover in all the models settling is still considered as an empirical process whereas due to the weakness of a stage flocs floc disturbance at the inlet structure of a stage clarifier might have a big impact on its efficiency solon et al 2019 recent research by ngo et al 2021 attempts at predicting effluent concentrations by means of an empirical function using experimentally determined tof value they further developed this approach to link eps characteristics and tof ngo and massoudieh 2021 as eps had already been included in the model as a function of operating parameters the authors were able to predict effluent solids concentrations as a function of process conditions since this approach is very recent there are no comparable studies in literature overall more effort is needed to gain a clearer insight into floc formation processes their dependence on temperature and mixing intensity within a stage systems and finally settling phenomena of a stage sludge implementing a strategy to improve floc densification in a stage could represent an interesting research topic such as hydrocyclone based wasting to achieve svi improvements regmi et al 2022 and or use of bio sourced polymeric substances 3 2 design recommendations based on the present review optimal ranges for operating parameters of an a stage system are presented in table 8 the parameters suggested may need to be adjusted based on the influent conditions reactor configurations and other site specific conditions but provide a starting point based on consensus values in the available literature optimal operating parameters ultimately depend on the objective of a stage which is most often to maximise cod valo but depending on the downstream processes it could have an additional constraint on cod n ratios of a stage effluent miller et al 2016 to maintain the do at 0 5 mg l 1 most often aeration is provided by compressed air through diffusers at the bottom of the reactor the ratio of oxygen transfer efficiency under process conditions compared to fresh water is referred to as α factor which is an important design parameter based on long term studies α factor of a stage was determined to be 0 45 schwarz et al 2021 under dry weather flow which is similar to the factor suggested by kroiss and klager 2018 or for non nitrifying cas systems gillot and héduit 2008 typical reported α factor for cas is in the range 0 60 to 0 75 for nitrifying systems higher α factor of 0 8 was found for b stage schwarz et al 2021 which is attributed to the removal of surfactants and other inhibitors in the a stage in high loaded systems such as a stage reactors constituents that hamper oxygen transfer surfactants in particular are indeed less degraded than in cas thus reducing oxygen transfer efficiency gillot and heduit 2008 bencsik et al 2022 a sludge extraction control based on maintaining a constant mlss concentration in the reactor was found to be optimal to buffer diurnal variations in influent cod concentrations miller et al 2017 in the matter of separation unit design or sizing little to no information is available in the literature the clarifier to reactor volume ratio varies widely from 0 5 to 7 in the studies reviewed see table s2 supplementary material 4 conclusions and need for further research the growing interest in recovering resources in municipal wastewater led to a resurgence in the interest in the a stage process technology owing to its capacity to recover influent organic carbon and ease of integration into existing wwtps recent research summarized in this review recognised eps production and biosorption including intracellular storage as the dominant bio chemical mechanisms involved in this technology key operational parameters that drive the process efficiency were also pointed out as well as the observed limitations to maximise the redirection of influent cod to the sludge flux srt was found to be the key parameter with an optimal value of 0 3 days hrt and do levels are also important operational parameters with target values of 30 min and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively optimal performances show a redirection of up to 50 of the influent cod to the sludge flux while the mineralization can be kept below 25 of the influent cod published full scale applications show a great variability in the observed performance that cannot be explained through the current knowledge on bio chemical mechanisms being a short retention time biological process a stage is quite sensitive to fluctuating concentrations of cod in the influent especially in the case of a municipal plant receiving influent from a combined or a semi separative sewer system rain induced dilution can destabilize the process that leads to a drop in performance and can even lead to sludge washout challenges remain over the wide spread adoption of a stage technology despite its natural advantage over other similar processes such as cept that require expensive chemicals to operate the following have been principally identified a better understanding of a stage performances requires further research on the operating parameters affecting them especially temperature and mixing that are overlooked in the literature continuing the effort to better understand liquid solid separation efficiency is also mandatory starting with a better description of separation units in a stage related publications the relationship between biosorption and settling phenomena should be further investigated in a holistic manner conceptualisation of biosorption mechanism in numerical models can help accelerate research in this domain this necessitates the characterization of new state variables and a finer influent fractionation observed impact on influent dilution calls for mitigation or avoidance strategies that might be useful to define the operating range of the system and

15325,in response to the growing global resource scarcity wastewater is increasingly seen as a valuable resource to recover and valorise for the benefit of the society rather than another waste that needs treatment before disposal conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps oxidise most of the organic matter present in wastewater instead of recovering it as a feedstock for biomaterials or to produce energy in the form of biogas in contrast an a stage is capable of producing a concentrated stream of organic matter ready for valorisation ideally suited to retrofit existing large plants this technology is based on the principle of high rate activated sludge process that favours biosorption and storage over oxidation in this paper we summarize peer reviewed research of both pilot scale and full scale studies of a stage process under real conditions highlighting key operational parameters in the majority of published studies the sludge retention time srt was identified as a key operational parameter an optimal srt of 0 3 days seems to maximize the redirection of influent cod up to 50 to the sludge flux while simultaneously keeping mineralization under 25 of total influent cod other key optimal parameters are a hydraulic residence time of 30 min and dissolved oxygen levels of 0 5 mg l 1 in addition nutrient removal efficiencies of 15 27 for total nitrogen and 13 38 for total phosphorus are observed influence of mixing on settling efficiencies remain largely underexplored as well as impact of wet weather flow and temperature on overall recovery efficiencies which hinders to provide recommendations on these aspects evolution of modelling efforts of a stage process are also critically reviewed the role of extracellular polymeric substances remain unclear and measures differ greatly according to the different studies and protocols better understanding the settling processes by adding limit of stokesian and threshold of flocculation measures to sludge volume index could help to reach a better understanding of the a stage process reliable modelling can help new unit processes find their place in the whole treatment chain and help the transition from

less is the new paradigm of the international water association in order to fulfil the sustainable development goal 6 clean water and sanitation by 2030 iwa 2016 for municipal wastewater treatment this paradigm requires a transition from wastewater treatment plants wwtps to water resource recovery facilities wrrfs there is a growing societal need expressed by stakeholders such as companies operating wwtps and local water authorities who are looking for sustainable solutions for treatment requirements organic matter present in raw wastewater is a source of chemical energy and can hence be considered as a resource approximately 6 9 kj of free energy is contained in 1 l of wastewater with an average concentration of 500 mg cod l 1 mccarty et al 2011 traditionally primary sedimentation tanks psts redirect some of the influent organics to produce primary sludge which is then anaerobically digested to generate biogas to offset the energy needs of the wwtp however psts have high space requirements and are quite inefficient in recovering this resource without chemical addition recovering organic matter prior to its oxidation is doubly advantageous as it minimizes aeration energy demand and simultaneously increases the methane produced wan et al 2016 amongst the best available process technologies that maximise recovery potential is a process based on high rate activated sludge hras also called a stage which is the focus of this review main advantage of a stage over other technologies for recovery such as chemically enhanced primary treatment cept is relatively lower operational costs as usually no reagent is utilised wan et al 2016 the a stage is part of the a b adsorption belebung process that has originally been developed in the 1970s and 1980s in the technical university of aachen böhnke 1977 to maintain nitrification process stability the a b process is a two stage process consisting of two activated sludge processes in series each with its own reactor clarifier and independent sludge recirculation loops as shown in fig 1 essentially a pst is replaced by the a stage process and can hence be considered a biologically enhanced primary treatment at the time of its development the b stage was operated only for ammonia removal as a low rate activated sludge process a stage is characterised by its high organic loading rate f m ratio coupled with low sludge age and short hydraulic residence times there is no universally accepted definition of operating parameters of a stage however most authors use a limit solid residence time srt of two days a comparison of some key process parameters between the a stage and conventional processes is presented in table 1 the a b process did not establish itself as a widely used process configuration because full mineralisation of nitrogen became an additional treatment requirement in the beginning of the 1990s the increased carbon removal in the a stage hinders heterotrophic denitrification in the b stage due to lack of sufficient organic carbon and most a b plants have been converted to conventional activated sludge cas processes compared to cas the extended aeration process variant applies very long sludge ages in order to achieve high organic matter removal and aerobic stabilisation of the sludge however two driving forces inspire the renewed interest in the a b process in recent years firstly the development in autotrophic n removal in the last two decades led to new approaches in coupling a stage and autotrophic n removal strategies such as partial nitritation anammox pna dai et al 2018 gu et al 2020 2018 secondly the impacts of climate change mata et al 2021 incites all sectors of human activity to minimize its contribution to the greenhouse effect developing waste valorisation technologies that can offset fossil fuel use has clear environmental benefits modin et al 2016 recent reviews from sancho et al 2019 and guven et al 2019 compiled the relevant technologies for recovering influent organic carbon focussing on a comparison of the main available carbon redirection technologies highlighting the importance of a stage process the review proposed by rahman et al 2020 gives an interesting evaluation of a stage and high rate contact stabilisation processes for carbon capture and highlights the interest of such processes to remove a significant amount of n and p in waste activated sludge was however a detailed analysis of peer reviewed studies on a stage discussing its mechanisms as well as its challenges and drawbacks is lacking this study aims to fill this gap and additionally summarises the experience of full scale implementations as well as attempts to model and simulate this process specific combinations of keywords were chosen for a search on webofknowledge com and sciencedirect com for studies on hras or a stage processes the results of which are succinctly summarized in table s1 supplementary material the search was continuously updated the most recent update was performed end of december 2021 only original research articles were included in addition to be considered the experimental conditions of the studies had to be clearly described e g the size of the treatment units duration and analytical procedures the keyword search yielded in a total of 116 publications the titles of studies were then screened according to their relevance to the topic and in case of a positive outcome the abstract and full text were consulted additional screening was conducted to select only papers related to the scope of our investigations thirty eight publications dealt with hras or a stage processes two studies had to be excluded from further evaluation since crucial information was lacking e g size of the experimental setups in the end 36 publications met the defined criteria of which nine described investigations of classical a stage setups the remaining articles were either hras variants such as high rate contact stabilization hics and high rate sequencing batch reactors hrsbr investigations conducted under static conditions focusing on specific parameters e g eps or in very small pilot scale a stage reactor volume smaller than 1 l or review articles without any experimental data 2 a stage process current knowledge during the initial development of a b process technology no particular attention was given to a stage technology and the focus was mainly on nitrogen removal in b stage as maintaining nitrification process stability was seen as a prime advantage versprille et al 1984 as this technology is being revisited in view of its ability to redirect influent cod to a sludge stream a better understanding of the mechanisms will be useful in design and operation the current knowledge on the a stage process starting with the driving mechanisms are summarized in the following sections then a section presenting results from laboratory scale and demonstration scale experiments is proposed including major influencing factors on carbon and nutrient capture finally a section presenting most of the a stage or hras full scale experiments published will be proposed before the discussion with the aim of highlighting the main challenges associated to the implementation of a b process into wrrfs 2 1 mechanisms of organic matter capture interactions organic matter present in the influent wastewater interacts with the return sludge in the a stage reactor in many complex mechanisms return sludge contains activated sludge flocs which are loosely bound amorphous structures that contain microorganisms embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps ni and yu 2012 the major mechanisms of interaction are assimilation biosorption and settling which are conceptually represented in fig 2 these mechanisms are a function of the properties of influent organic matter fractions as well as the nature of the flocs of the return sludge assimilation is a biological mechanism that removes part of the soluble biodegradable fraction biodegradable sc org of the organic carbon molecules that are small enough to pass through the cell membrane this fraction of biodegradable organic carbon serves both as carbon source and electron donor for the microorganisms for cell growth storage of polymers or production of extracellular polymeric substances eps and for cell maintenance hence a fraction of biodegradable sc org is oxidised to carbon dioxide and water by aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms the ratio of microbial growth rate and oxidation rate is called yield y von sperling 2015 microorganisms can store soluble biodegradable organic compounds in the form of intracellular inclusions the soluble compounds after penetrating the cell walls are converted to insoluble polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha triacylglycerides tag wax esters etc to avoid build up of high osmotic pressure across the cell membrane volatile fatty acids vfas such as acetate will result in storage of phas whereas carbohydrates such as glucose will result in storage of glycogen the bacteria are capable of reutilising the stored carbon for cell functions when no external carbon source is available i e during a famine phase dynamic process configurations such as sequencing batch reactors sbrs in which the activated sludge is exposed to periods of feast and famine induce storage behaviour coats et al 2011 biosorption is a combination of physico chemical interactions that bind colloidal and particulate fraction collc org and pc org biodegradable or not of organic matter to activated sludge flocs by weak adhesive forces there is no universally accepted definition of biosorption and various other terms are used to refer to this phenomenon such as sorption enmeshment bioflocculation agglomeration extra cellular adsorption etc eps may assist with this agglomeration depending on their quantity composition and surface properties kinyua et al 2017a in the sense of this article biosorption describes an extra cellular phenomenon distinguished from storage which is an intra cellular phenomenon biosorption has been recognized as the key mechanism contributing to carbon capture and driving the interest in a stage systems finally settling is a physical phenomenon where agglomerates form in the a stage reactor and sufficiently large organic matter pc org settle to the bottom of the separation unit typically a surface clarifier the settled sludge is either removed from the system or recirculated back to the reactor 2 2 overall a stage performances pilot and demonstration scale investigations from the identified papers nine articles at pilot and demonstration scale performed with real wastewater were selected information on experimental conditions of the reactor and influent effluent characteristics are summarized in table 2 there is a diversity in the scale of studies from laboratory scale to demonstration scale but most common hrt was set to 30 min and srt varied from 0 3 days to up to 2 days dissolved oxygen do level in the reactor was set to 0 5 mg l 1 in all studies except two where do set point was of 2 mg l 1 information on the influent and effluent cod was compiled when available all considered studies used raw wastewater with total cod ranging from a low 300 mg l 1 to more than 600 mg l 1 likewise information on fractions was compiled with colloidal fractions being measured following the protocol of mamais et al 1993 when available this protocol of cod fractionation yields three fractions of cod namely particulate cod pcod colloidal cod ccod and flocculated filtered cod ffcod some studies followed an older and simpler fractionation that involves direct filtration at 0 45 µm resulting in only two fractions particulate cod and filtered cod fcod it can be seen that all studies achieved a tcod removal of 50 with one study reaching up to 90 taboada santos et al 2020 which can be considered an outlier examining the cod fractions of the effluent most cod removal is due to the removal of pcod followed by ffcod and lastly ccod 2 2 1 influence of srt on cod mass balance cod mass balance is visually represented in fig 3 it shows three possible transformations of influent cod upon leaving the a stage system it can be calculated based on daily performance data of the process in steady conditions from the following equation considering no accumulation in the reactor 1 cod in cod eff cod min cod valo where cod in is the cod of influent cod eff is the cod of the a stage effluent cod min is the portion of cod that is lost as co2 cod valo is the cod embedded in the waste sludge an optimized a stage process maximizes the portion of cod in that is diverted to the sludge matrix cod valo while simultaneously minimizing the mineralized fraction cod min which is lost as co2 to the atmosphere table 3 presents the mineralization rate reported in literature on a stage the ratio of cod valo to cod in is the measure of the efficiency of the a stage process which is referred to as carbon recovery efficiency cao et al 2020 or carbon harvesting efficiency rahman et al 2016 cod eff is the fraction of influent cod that leaves a stage to the next unit treatment process typically cod min is calculated using this equation i e to close the mass balance whereas the rest of the parameters are measured all studies that reported mineralization rates are presented in table 3 jimenez et al 2015 concluded that the operational parameter with the highest influence on mineralization is the srt as longer srt resulted in more mineralisation of cod however even under comparable srts there is a substantial variation across different studies of the influent cod lost to the atmosphere as co2 these variations are possibly due to varying composition of influent cod mlss concentration temperature in the reactor and other uncontrolled process operational parameters kinyua et al 2017a influent cod fractions can play a major role on carbon redirection if we consider that 1 the particulate cod fraction is mostly removed by primary settling linked to the efficiency of the settling system in the a stage process 2 the soluble fraction is mostly linked to the bacterial assimilation and growth and 3 the colloidal matter fraction is removed by biosorption on bacterial material and eps therefore the carbon redirection of an influent rich in particulate cod will be limited by the settling capacity a effluent rich in colloidal cod will be limited by eps production and collision probability with biomass and an effluent rich in soluble cod by the bacterial growing conditions table 3 presents also the recovery rate of the sludge reported in the original research studies on classical a stage jimenez et al 2015 reported a trend of decreasing recovery as srt increased from 0 3 days to 2 days which is in contradiction with the study of kinyua et al 2017a much like for the opposing trends between the two studies observed for mineralisation rates in the majority of published studies srt of 0 3 days seems to be the optimal srt to maximise the capture of influent cod as sludge even though it is largely variable and most likely dependant on other operational parameters and nature of organic matter present in influent wastewater the optimal recovery value reaches 50 of the influent cod by considering the different pathway of cod in a stage several studies concluded that there is a threshold with an srt ranging between 0 2 and 0 4 enabling to maximize carbon capture jimenez et al 2015 rahman et al 2020 2 2 2 influence of do and hrt on cod mass balance do has a key role in bacterial metabolism and settling efficiency with regard to carbon mineralisation several studies have shown that a balance has to be found between low do level 0 5 mg l 1 where bacterial growth eps production and settling efficiency are limited and high do conditions 1 5 2 mg l 1 where mineralisation level and energy consumption are too high kinyua et al 2017a 2017b jimenez et al 2015 far fewer studies reported the impact of hrt on the cod recovery potential of a stage processes jimenez et al 2015 investigating hrts from 10 min to 60 min concluded that a hrt of 30 min as optimal beyond which negligible increase in tcod and scod removal were observed a similar conclusion was reached by de graaff et al 2016 carrying out aerated jar tests on a stage sludge from full scale plants the authors observed that 15 min contact time including the return stream is sufficient for most scod removal guven et al 2017 measured the impact of hrts of 130 95 and 60 min and found that the shortest hrt resulted in highest tcod recovery in the sludge and lowest effluent tss the effect of hrt on cod recovery is considerable if too short less than 30 min the contact time between the biomass and the substrate reduces the production of eps and the overall cod removal decreases if too long generally larger than 1 1 5 h the carbon capture is not maximized and mineralisation becomes too high 2 2 3 nutrients removal in a stage capturing nutrients represents another benefit of an a stage process and is mostly linked to assimilation during bacterial growth combined with capture into was average removal rate ranging from 15 to 27 tn and 13 38 tp have been reported rahman et al 2020 this could represent an interesting energy reduction in the downstream nutrient removal system the srt was observed to be a major factor influencing n removal with an increase of tn removal going from 22 at 0 5 d up to 49 at a 3 d ge et al 2017 the same pattern was observed for tp removal going from 15 at srt 1d up to 34 at 3 d srt ge et al 2017 increasing the srt improves the yield and therefore assimilation of nutrients but at the same time increases the mineralisation of cod 60 at a 3 d srt therefore the overall mass balance has to be considered to target the treatment strategy by either favouring carbon capture or nutrients removal typically full scale plants add metal salts in a stage to achieve additional tp removal see section 2 3 2 2 4 role of eps eps are microbial secretions and products of cellular lysis or hydrolysis they are negatively charged and make up 50 80 of organic fraction in activated sludge proteins pn and polysaccharides ps or carbohydrates are its main constituents making up 78 80 of eps with the rest being other organic fractions such as humics nucleic acids lipids etc dignac et al 1998 the eps concentration present in the sludge is naturally a function of various operating parameters including srt and do levels as well as influent characteristics faust et al 2014 it is hypothesized that both quantity and nature of eps can play an important role in biosorption of colloidal and particulate matter into the activated sludge floc matrix in a stage systems table 4 presents the quantity of total eps reported in different a stage systems as a function of srt at comparable do levels two studies jimenez et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 used the cation exchange resin frølund et al 1996 method for eps extraction whereas the rest of the studies which are more recent used the heat extraction method li and yang 2007 as of yet no standard method or protocol for eps measurement in activated sludge exists making it challenging to compare and interpret the results meaningfully table 4 presents eps measured in the mixed liquor in a stage in addition to the large heterogeneity in the total eps found across the studies their trend with respect to varying srts is also different depending on studies jimenez et al 2015 observed increasing eps concentrations with increasing srts which concurs with rahman et al 2016 however kinyua et al 2017a and rahman et al 2019 observed the opposite trend studying two srts of 0 28 and 0 56 days as well as 0 16 and 0 3 days respectively apparent differences in the reported values may be linked to measurement protocols as well as influent characteristics mlss concentrations f m ratio and other uncontrolled parameters with regards to the capture of pcod and ccod jimenez et al 2015 reported increasing eps concentration increased their capture whereas kinyua et al 2017a found no correlation more research is therefore needed to establish the part played by eps their total quantity and their nature in aiding organic matter capture through biosorption eps production is believed to improve carbon capture through colloidal cod capture mostly although contradictory results have been published maybe the following hypothesis can be formulated tightly bound tb fraction to the biological material can favour colloidal matter biosorption and settling whereas loosely bound lb fraction eps in suspension are more difficult to settle and can decrease the overall cod removal efficiency 2 2 5 settling characteristics settling is most commonly characterized by a measurement of sludge volume index svi following apha 2005 which considers settling over 30 min table 5 presents the svi reported in various a stage studies most studies report good svi 150 ml g tss 1 settling of a stage sludge with svi values between 30 and 80 ml g tss 1 even across varying srts from 0 3 days to 1 5 days comparing svis across a large range of srts ngo and massoudieh 2021 show a sharp peak svi of around 550 mg l 1 for an srt of approx 3 days with svis below 100 mg l 1 for srts below 2 days however a low svi alone is not a sufficient criterion to judge the clarifier performance in an a stage the tss concentrations of the supernatant can still be unusually high as observed by guven et al 2020 who reported an svi 50 ml g tss 1 but effluent tss concentrations higher than 150 mg l 1 this represents particulate and colloidal cod that could have been redirected to the waste sludge but is instead lost in the effluent this might be a consequence of the characteristics of the a stage mixed liquor where very small flocs are formed and sometimes not settling leading to high tss concentration in the supernatant the settled sludge could be made of particulate cod mostly studying the impact of hrt guven et al 2017 concluded that in addition to improving the cod recovered as sludge the svi also improved from hrt of 60 min compared to that of 130 min similarly rahman et al 2019 van winckel et al 2019 and wett et al 2020 all reported svi between 50 and 90 ml g tss 1 which is lower than that of conventional activated sludge where svis lower than 150 mg l 1 is considered a fair value von sperling 2015 this contrasts with the findings of the review of sancho et al 2019 where poor settling of a stage sludge is mentioned as the drawback that prevented a wider adaptation of a b processes worldwide in kinyua et al 2017a overall lower svi values at shorter srt 0 3 days could be due to the washout of filamentous organisms the impact of do was pronounced at higher srt presumably due to differences in types of filamentous organisms research on conventional activated sludge indicated links between the composition of eps of the sludge and its settling characteristics li and yang 2007 this method further characterizes eps as lb fraction and tb fraction by stepwise extraction the fractions are then analysed for their cod protein content pn and polysaccharide content ps two studies kinyua et al 2017a van winckel et al 2019 adopting this method for eps extraction and characterization explored a relation between settling and various a stage systems but did not find a conclusive relation between settling performance and eps neither total quantity nor its quality such as pn ps ratio this could be intrinsically linked to the role of eps in the capture of colloidal and particulate matter in the a stage reactor as discussed in 2 2 4 new metrics to characterize settling such as limit of stokesian settling loss mancell egala et al 2016 and threshold of flocculation tof mancell egala et al 2017 were developed to overcome the limits of established solids flux theory loss is the solids concentration of the sludge at which flocculent settling stokesian transitions into hindered non stokesian settling while tof is the concentration limit to induce floc formation and consequently transition from discrete to flocculent settling tof is hence a measure of particle collision efficiency it is hypothesized that if the mixed liquor solids concentration is between loss and tof the clarifier performance is optimized with minimal ts loss in the effluent developing on this approach very recent research ngo et al 2021 ngo and massoudieh 2021 proposes a relation between tof and effluent suspended solids via flocculent settling coefficient rp and a second relation between eps and tof this marks a first attempt in describing a relation between eps content and effluent suspended solids albeit indirectly as these parameters and approaches were only recently introduced little information is available in literature to validate the hypotheses in conclusion it is challenging to predict the settling properties and effluent quality of a stage and certainly more research is needed to explore the links between quantity and properties of eps and settling characteristics apart from tof loss and eps measurement other investigations could be performed to evaluate sludge settleability including microscopic ones measure of floc resistance to shear stress and measure of zeta potential of the flocs to our knowledge these investigations have never been applied to a stage mixed liquor 2 2 6 valorisation potential of a stage sludge the most common valorisation pathway of the produced sludge is via anaerobic digestion to produce biogas which is mainly a mixture of ch4 and co2 the produced energy can offset the plant s own energy requirement or it can be sold biochemical methane potential bmp is a measure of cumulative methane produced as the organic matter in the sample degrades under anaerobic conditions it is crucial in getting an insight into design parameters for anaerobic digesters holliger et al 2016 table 6 presents the bmp from various a stage studies expressed as produced volume of methane under normal conditions of temperature and pressure normalized to the amount of volatile solids introduced nml ch4 g vs 1 choo kun 2015 compared the bmp of sludge from primary settling a stage and a long sludge age process and found that a stage sludge had the higher bmp of 335 nml ch4 g vs compared to 290 nml ch4 g vs 1 and 220 nml ch4 g vs 1 for primary sludge and secondary sludge from extended aeration respectively hence the bmp of a stage sludge is not so different from primary sludge other studies have reported bmp values in the same range but comparison between studies is difficult as the influent wastewater characteristics both quantity and quality of organic matter can vary widely the wide range reported by trzcinski et al 2016 shows the influence of intraday variations and high oil and grease content in the influent few energy recovery indices were proposed such as methane recovery index and energy recovery index rey martínez et al 2021 these indices are useful in comparing the overall recovery potential of different a stage systems however not enough information is available to calculate these indices for studies summarized in table 6 another emerging valorisation pathway of the concentrated organics stream is the production of high value biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha that can be used to produce bioplastics however regulatory barriers and public acceptance of such products are of concern further research is required to make biopolymer production from waste sludge economically viable compared to plastics produced from fossil fuels gherghel et al 2019 2 3 full scale performance in the 1970s and 1980s a b process has been successfully implemented in full scale plants in some european countries especially in the netherlands germany and austria as mentioned in introduction the emergence of more stringent effluent requirements on nitrogen led to a decline in a b systems with some of them being reconfigured to cas due to lack of organic carbon for achieving the required denitrification the information that was found on existing full scale a stage hras implementation is summarized in table 7 it can be noted that a stage has been implemented in large to very large treatment plants in the case of the nieuwveer plant which was originally built in 1976 and refurbished to a b process in 1992 its original primary settlers were used as a stage settlers the vienna wwtp was undergoing an upgrade at the time of publication of kroiss and klager 2018 however the existing psts were retained in the process scheme and a stage treats pst effluent the vienna strategy is not a conventional a b process as defined in our review but presents an interesting strategy by using a two stage activated sludge with an hras receiving nitrates likewise the blue plains plant also utilises a stage hras technology after a primary treatment step in this case a cept process all full scale plants dose metal salts for phosphorus precipitation in the aeration tank but concentrations used are not provided for any of them in the available literature without the concentrations of metal salts used it is difficult to evaluate the effect of metal salt addition on cod valorisation efficiency and on settling wett et al 2020 observed no improvement in cod removal or settling performance up to a molar ratio of metal p of 0 5 most of the publications presenting full scale investigations focus on a stage and carbon removal strategy few elements are provided on the b stage the strategy presented at the vienna plant rely on a full nitrification denitrification process and an optimisation of carbon capture enabling enough redirection to perform full denitrification few options are available and rely on either full nitrification in case no restriction are applied or pna processes recent reviews have shown that pna processes are not completely mature for mainstream application to our knowledge no full scale success stories have been reported challenges remain at several levels including implementing an intelligent control of partial nitrification exploring the molecular biological mechanism of nob selective inhibition and strengthening of pre treatment process for partial nitrification wang et al 2021 energy consumption data on a stage is not available for most plants but it was reported as 0 17 and 0 10 kwh kg codremoved 1 for dokhaven and utrecht respectively de graaff et al 2016 it is higher than the 0 08 kwh kg codremoved 1 calculated reported by wett et al 2020 little knowledge is available on the dynamic performance of the a stage process and how the drop in performance during rain events or even sludge washout can be mitigated which is a major drawback of a stage processes diamantis et al 2014 3 discussion 3 1 knowledge synthetized in models numerical models are made for representing reality in a more or less simplified way and are very useful when comparing different treatment configurations in addition they embed the current knowledge associated to a specific process as far as short residence time processes such as a stage are concerned modifications to historical activated sludge models asm were required widely used models like asm1 are not suitable for systems with short residence times 2 days as first recognized by haider et al 2003 since the biodegradable fractions of organic matter was modelled as a single substrate and by a single removal kinetic one monod term which is a valid assumption for sludge ages longer than 5 days moreover these early models do not explicitly account for neither eps production nor biosorption mechanisms which play a key role in a stage process these physico chemical mechanisms were indeed not considered in the original asms as they were not limiting for the considered sludge ages 3 days in asm1 to model high rate processes without increasing the complexity of the model smitshuijzen et al 2016 modified asm1 by introducing a factor fsettler that accounts for the fraction of biodegradable particulate matter that is captured by the a stage system this factor accounts for both the efficiency of biosorption and the efficiency of separation in the settler in one term it was estimated from data from the full scale plant dokhaven rotterdam the netherlands including daily and seasonal variations to investigate the impact of rain events and changes in water temperature the results show that the model was able to predict effluent total cod with a 10 error under steady state conditions the model was also able to describe the drop in cod removal in a stage during winter months temperatures of 10 12 c via dynamic simulations which according to smitshuijzen et al 2016 is due to the decrease in heterotrophic activity at low temperatures rather than decrease in the efficiency of biosorption examining the data from another full scale a stage plant wett et al 2020 found the same relation of decreasing cod removal efficiency with decreasing temperatures contrarily they argue that it cannot be explained by the arrhenius effect on microbial growth and instead is rather by temperature sensitivity of biosorption reactions it is clear that more research effort is needed to fully understand this relation it can be however hypothesized that the decrease of temperature might reduce the frequency of collision between the colloidal matter and the floc tightly bound eps thus reducing biosorption lastly it was reported that the dokhaven plant uses iron salts for p removal in a stage reactor de graaff et al 2016 which was not mentioned in the context of the model development this simplified yet effective a stage model of smitshuijzen et al 2016 was further integrated into whole plant modelling by jia et al 2020 in order to study the benefits and drawbacks of a coupled a stage pna partial nitritation anammox system compared to a cas system the simulation results showed a trade off between maximising cod capture for energy recovery and minimizing residual cod entering the autotrophic pna reactor with operating conditions being an srt of 0 3 to 0 5 days and do of 0 3 to 0 5 mg l 1 the study also found the a stage pna configuration led to an increase of 50 of cod recovery as sludge compared to a cas plant and 60 lower overall aeration energy all the while meeting the eu discharge limits eu urban wastewater directive 91 271 eec of 21 may 1991 in a stage pna configuration the cod recovery is mostly linked to the a stage sludge contribution of b stage sludge has been estimated as to a maximum of 10 12 of cod redirection wan et al 2016 nogaj et al 2015 developed a more mechanistic approach to model high rate processes by introducing additional state variables to asm1 model on a single biomass population two substrates were considered fast and slow biodegradable organic matter with fast biodegradable fraction being considered as vfa concentration in the influent influent cod was split into three subparts with colloidal cod being considered explicitly as an additional state variable which is an upgrade compared to asm1 eps was also added as a state variable along with storage products and sorption of colloidal substrate hauduc et al 2019 built upon this model by adding a new fast growing biomass and a further fractionation of fast biodegradable organic matter into vfas and other organic compounds flocculation of colloidal particles is a rate limiting process in a stage systems and thus was modelled explicitly as a function of eps present in the biomass furthermore as flocculation is sensitive to temperature and mixing intensities an empirical factor range 0 1 on flocculation rate was introduced to account for deflocculation processes finally storage products are modelled to reflect lower mineralization rates observed in a stage and it is supported by experimental observations by kinyua et al 2017b this study measured pha production yields at different srts 0 28 day and 0 56 day and do concentrations 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg l 1 without a dynamic feast famine configuration a maximum pha concentration of 42 mg cod gvss 1 was found in the aerobic reactors at srt of 0 28 days and do of 1 0 mg l 1 with a corresponding pha yield of 1 20 g pha cod gvfa 1 pha concentrations were always higher at the lower srt in this study literature on storage product formation in a stage is scarce and more research is perhaps needed to further understand the contribution of storage and its influence on other operating parameters the new plant wide model has the advantage of being valid in other biological process units with different operating conditions without employing interface equations it predicted low mineralization rates found in a stage systems colloidal concentrations in the effluent were also predicted thanks to explicit modelling of flocculation as a function of eps content the greater the quantity of eps the higher is the portion of captured colloids to form particulates however the bio kinetic model can be quite sensitive to influent characterization as it demands many fractions that are generally not measured such as vfa and biomass concentration moreover in all the models settling is still considered as an empirical process whereas due to the weakness of a stage flocs floc disturbance at the inlet structure of a stage clarifier might have a big impact on its efficiency solon et al 2019 recent research by ngo et al 2021 attempts at predicting effluent concentrations by means of an empirical function using experimentally determined tof value they further developed this approach to link eps characteristics and tof ngo and massoudieh 2021 as eps had already been included in the model as a function of operating parameters the authors were able to predict effluent solids concentrations as a function of process conditions since this approach is very recent there are no comparable studies in literature overall more effort is needed to gain a clearer insight into floc formation processes their dependence on temperature and mixing intensity within a stage systems and finally settling phenomena of a stage sludge implementing a strategy to improve floc densification in a stage could represent an interesting research topic such as hydrocyclone based wasting to achieve svi improvements regmi et al 2022 and or use of bio sourced polymeric substances 3 2 design recommendations based on the present review optimal ranges for operating parameters of an a stage system are presented in table 8 the parameters suggested may need to be adjusted based on the influent conditions reactor configurations and other site specific conditions but provide a starting point based on consensus values in the available literature optimal operating parameters ultimately depend on the objective of a stage which is most often to maximise cod valo but depending on the downstream processes it could have an additional constraint on cod n ratios of a stage effluent miller et al 2016 to maintain the do at 0 5 mg l 1 most often aeration is provided by compressed air through diffusers at the bottom of the reactor the ratio of oxygen transfer efficiency under process conditions compared to fresh water is referred to as α factor which is an important design parameter based on long term studies α factor of a stage was determined to be 0 45 schwarz et al 2021 under dry weather flow which is similar to the factor suggested by kroiss and klager 2018 or for non nitrifying cas systems gillot and héduit 2008 typical reported α factor for cas is in the range 0 60 to 0 75 for nitrifying systems higher α factor of 0 8 was found for b stage schwarz et al 2021 which is attributed to the removal of surfactants and other inhibitors in the a stage in high loaded systems such as a stage reactors constituents that hamper oxygen transfer surfactants in particular are indeed less degraded than in cas thus reducing oxygen transfer efficiency gillot and heduit 2008 bencsik et al 2022 a sludge extraction control based on maintaining a constant mlss concentration in the reactor was found to be optimal to buffer diurnal variations in influent cod concentrations miller et al 2017 in the matter of separation unit design or sizing little to no information is available in the literature the clarifier to reactor volume ratio varies widely from 0 5 to 7 in the studies reviewed see table s2 supplementary material 4 conclusions and need for further research the growing interest in recovering resources in municipal wastewater led to a resurgence in the interest in the a stage process technology owing to its capacity to recover influent organic carbon and ease of integration into existing wwtps recent research summarized in this review recognised eps production and biosorption including intracellular storage as the dominant bio chemical mechanisms involved in this technology key operational parameters that drive the process efficiency were also pointed out as well as the observed limitations to maximise the redirection of influent cod to the sludge flux srt was found to be the key parameter with an optimal value of 0 3 days hrt and do levels are also important operational parameters with target values of 30 min and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively optimal performances show a redirection of up to 50 of the influent cod to the sludge flux while the mineralization can be kept below 25 of the influent cod published full scale applications show a great variability in the observed performance that cannot be explained through the current knowledge on bio chemical mechanisms being a short retention time biological process a stage is quite sensitive to fluctuating concentrations of cod in the influent especially in the case of a municipal plant receiving influent from a combined or a semi separative sewer system rain induced dilution can destabilize the process that leads to a drop in performance and can even lead to sludge washout challenges remain over the wide spread adoption of a stage technology despite its natural advantage over other similar processes such as cept that require expensive chemicals to operate the following have been principally identified a better understanding of a stage performances requires further research on the operating parameters affecting them especially temperature and mixing that are overlooked in the literature continuing the effort to better understand liquid solid separation efficiency is also mandatory starting with a better description of separation units in a stage related publications the relationship between biosorption and settling phenomena should be further investigated in a holistic manner conceptualisation of biosorption mechanism in numerical models can help accelerate research in this domain this necessitates the characterization of new state variables and a finer influent fractionation observed impact on influent dilution calls for mitigation or avoidance strategies that might be useful to define the operating range of the system and

15326,studies that promote chemical oxidation by permanganate mno4 mn vii as a viable technology for water treatment and environmental purification have been quickly accumulating over the past decades various methods to activate mn vii have been proposed and their efficacy in destructing a wide range of emerging organic contaminants has been demonstrated this article aims to present a state of art review on the development of mn vii activation methods including photoactivation electrical activation the addition of redox mediators carbonaceous materials and other chemical agents with a particular focus on the potential activation mechanism and critical influencing factors different reaction mechanisms are involved in activated mn vii oxidation processes including the generation of reactive intermediates derived from mn vii e g mn iii mn v and mn vi or activators e g intermediates of redox mediators and ru catalysts reactive oxygen species ros e g oh o2 and 1o2 as well as electron transfer from organics to mn vii via catalysts as the electron mediator except oh that is generated as one of co oxidants in uv mn vii process other reactive species are relatively mild oxidants which are more selective toward organic substrates and highly tolerant toward various water matrices e g inorganic ions and natural organic matter compared to strongly oxidizing radical species therefore activated mn vii oxidation processes show a good prospect for efficient removal of target contaminants in natural and complex environmental matrices however there are some disputes about the dominant reactive species generated in these processes and their identification methods may be not appropriate causing serious confusion in the mechanistic understanding so further efforts are still needed to fill the knowledge gap and also to address the application challenges of these technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate activation methods

occurrence of emerging contaminants e g endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pharmaceutic and personal care products ppcps and disinfection byproducts dbps in aquatic environments due to their potential threat to human beings and ecosystems cizmas et al 2015 petrie et al 2015 sauvé and desrosiers 2014 chemical oxidation by permanganate mno4 mn vii is a promising technology for removal of organic contaminants because of its unique merits such as the comparative stability effectiveness over a broad ph range relatively low cost ease of storage and delivery and environmentally benign reduction products i e manganese dioxide mno2 li et al 2021 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 nevertheless mn vii is a mild and selective oxidant which prefers to react with contaminants containing electron rich moieties e g phenols anilines olefins and thiols but exhibits low reactivity toward some recalcitrant organics hu et al 2010 2011 jiang et al 2009 2012 therefore effective strategies are needed to improve mn vii oxidation capacity for eliminating a wider range of organic contaminants in water among the currently studied methods for mn vii activation the combined application of mn vii and bisulfite hso3 so3 2 a widely used reducing agent has attracted the most attention since it was first reported in 2015 sun et al 2015 the mn vii bisulfite system shows extremely high reactivity toward many organic contaminants even including some pollutants resistant to mn vii e g benzene nitrobenzene nb and caffeine which thus has been developed as a novel advanced oxidation technology in water treatment chen et al 2020 gao et al 2019 sun et al 2015 2016 however disputes over the predominant reactive species involved in the mn vii bisulfite system remain for a long period due to the fairly complex chemistry of manganese and sulfur recently we have published a review article to summarize the theoretical development of the mn vii bisulfite system and to clarify the roles of various reactive species guan et al 2022 in general both reactive manganese species rmns i e soluble mn iii mn v and mn vi and radical species primarily sulfate radicals so4 are generated during reaction of mn vii with bisulfite which are much more reactive compared to mn vii and thus considerably accelerate the degradation of organic pollutants bisulfite plays a dual role of being an activating agent for reactive intermediates formation and acting as a complexing agent to stabilize rmns the formation of rmns and radicals as well as their relative contributions are highly dependent on solution chemistry e g the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph the type of contaminants and water matrix components which thus influences the degradation kinetics and pathways of organics for instance the mn vii bisulfite system destructs contaminants more rapidly under acidic and neutral conditions than that under alkaline condition moreover dissolved oxygen do plays a key role in organics degradation because it greatly impacts the evolution of reactive oxysulfur radicals as well as their subsequent reaction with rmns on the whole the mn vii bisulfite system can be a promising strategy for treatment of organic contaminants in water and wastewater especially slightly acid industrial sewage in addition to the activation by bisulfite other methods such as photoactivation guo et al 2018 wei et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a electrical activation zhu et al 2019a 2019c the use of redox mediators shi et al 2020 song et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b and carbonaceous materials peng et al 2021 tian et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 have also been investigated to enhance the removal of emerging contaminants during mn vii oxidation these methods show good activation efficiencies for mn vii but the reaction mechanisms and dominant reactive species involved in these activated mn vii oxidation systems are quite different in addition there are some controversial observations and interpretations around these systems which causes serious confusion in the mechanistic understanding of mn vii activation and also impedes the scientific progress of these technologies toward practical application therefore it is important to clearly understand the chemistry behind mn vii activation with various methods and to further assess the roles of various reactive species this article aims to provide a systematic overview of the recently published studies on methods for enhancing mn vii oxidation toward organic contaminants in aqueous environments excluding the case with bisulfite this work is a continuation of our previous review and will further improve the knowledge of mn vii based oxidation technologies various activation methods for mn vii are summarized and the underlying mechanisms are elaborated disputes over the generation of main reactive species and their roles in organics oxidation are discussed kinetics information regarding contaminants oxidation is presented along with a discussion on some critical influencing factors furthermore the potential of these activated mn vii oxidation processes for practical implementation in water treatment is analyzed and future research needs are proposed to address the application challenges 2 activation methods of mn vii 2 1 photoactivation 2 1 1 mechanism ultraviolet uv irradiation as a clean approach is widely applied for disinfection and oxidation in water and wastewater treatment pereira et al 2007 it is also used in combination with various oxidants e g persulfates hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and chlorine to improve their decontamination performance via generating highly reactive radicals such as so4 hydroxyl radical oh and reactive chlorine species e g cl cl2 and clo gao et al 2012 he et al 2013 jin et al 2011 wu et al 2016 recently guo and his co workers innovatively proposed the uv mn vii combined process as a promising technology for abatement of organic contaminants in water treatment guo et al 2018 their study displayed that the uv irradiation of mn vii at 254 nm resulted in fast degradation of many organic compounds e g nb benzoic acid ba terephthalic acid tpa p chlorobenzoic acid pcba nalidixic acid and gemfibrozil which were resistant to mn vii oxidation and partially decomposed by uv photolysis the presence of tert butanol tba a common scavenger of oh showed different degrees of inhibitory effect on degradation of these compounds by uv mn vii process electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy was used to directly determine the formation of oh and the observation of a typical 1 2 2 1 quartet signal of the adduct of oh with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo further confirmed the existence of oh noticeably tba did not completely terminate the oxidation of organic compounds especially the degradation rate of nalidixic acid was decreased by only 0 8 in the presence of 2 mm tba this indicated the involvement of other reactive species i e reactive manganese intermediates after excluding the possible contribution of mn vi mn iv and mn iii the authors suggested that mn v species in the form of metastable mn v peroxo complex mno2 η2 o2 might be formed contributing together with oh to the fast oxidation of organic compounds this was consistent with the previous studies on photochemistry of mn vii hu et al 2016 thornley and bitterwolf 2015 zimmerman 1955 it was demonstrated that uv photolysis of mn vii could lead to the generation of an excited state mno2 η2 o2 which either reverted to the parent mn vii or quickly converted to mn v peroxo complex mno2 η2 o2 via o o formation from two mn o bonds of mn vii eqs 1 2 crandell et al 2017 lee et al 1987 thornley and bitterwolf 2015 the resulting mno2 η2 o2 underwent further decomposition to form mno2 mn iii and o2 or mno2 and oh as depicted by eqs 3 4 ye et al 2021 also reported that the good degradation performance of ba in uv mn vii process was due to the involvement of oh and mn v species and they further explored how oh was generated during photolysis of mn vii their results displayed that the presence of 4 hydroxytetramethyl piperidine 1 oxyl tempol a scavenger of superoxide radical o2 had a comparable inhibitory effect 28 7 to that of tba 25 9 revealing that oh might arise from o2 conversion in addition the esr spectra exhibited a 14 line spin signal corresponding to an adduct of dmpo with o2 along with the signal of dmpo oh adduct based on these the authors speculated that o2 was generated from decomposition of mno2 η2 o2 eq 5 and acted as the precursor of oh eqs 6 7 however the contribution of o2 itself to ba degradation was very minor given its low reactivity toward ba 1 m n o 4 h v m n o 2 η 2 o 2 2 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 3 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 hv m n o 2 o h 4 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 h v m n o 2 o 2 5 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 h v m n o 2 o 2 6 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h it is well known that mn v is highly unstable and its spontaneous disproportionation results in its unlikely contribution to oxidation of contaminants unless under certain conditions e g in extremely acid solution or with specific complexing ligand song et al 2017 for instance gao et al 2019 proposed that in mn vii bisulfite system bisulfite served as a complexing ligand for mn v stabilization in addition to a reducing agent for mn v generation and thus the stabilized mn v species could contribute to the oxidation of organic substrate methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso at different solution ph recently some researchers reported that mn ii chelated by ligands e g ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and nitrilotriacetate nta could trigger the fast degradation of contaminants by peroxymonosulfate pms gao et al 2021 yu et al 2020 and periodate pi yu et al 2022 this was attributed to the generation of complexed mn v from mn ii complex oxidation where mn iii complex was verified as the requisite intermediate however mn ii without these ligands was inefficient for pms or pi activation due to the absence of stabilizing agents for rmns as for the uv mn vii process the mn v peroxo complex mno2 η2 o2 may be stabilized due to the formation of o o from two mn o bonds of mn vii fig 1 resulting in its stabilization with a long lifetime enough for reacting with organics guo et al 2022a further investigated the role of oh and various rmns i e mn iii mn iv and mn v in degradation of 26 structurally diverse micropollutants by uv mn vii process tba was used to distinguish the relative contribution of oh and rmns to micropollutants oxidation because tba could fast scavenge oh while it was resistant to rmns most micropollutants degradation was inhibited significantly with the exception of flumequine naproxen and nalidixic acid which shared similar structures of quinoline naphthalene with carboxylic groups this indicated that oh was highly reactive toward all micropollutants while mn v was selective toward aromatics containing carboxylic groups moreover mno2 was identified as the final product in uv mn vii process and mn iii was an intermediate that was unstable against disproportionation to mno2 and mn2 simultaneously both mn iii and mno2 were not important for micropollutants oxidation under neutral conditions while under acidic conditions in situ formed mno2 contributed to the abatement of phenolics anilines and propranolol as a catalyst of mn vii in other words the catalyzing effect of mno2 is highly related to the type of target pollutants and solution conditions zhang et al 2021a and yang et al 2021 investigated the oxidation efficiency and mechanism of organic pollutants by mn vii under visible light vl and simulated solar ss irradiation respectively interestingly different reactive species were identified in vl mn vii and ss mn vii processes from uv mn vii process it was reported that o2 and mn iii species were generated as the primary oxidants in vl mn vii process whereas ss irradiation of mn vii induced the rapid formation of rmns mainly mn iii and mn v without radicals the mechanistic discrepancy among these photo activated mn vii processes might be related to different experimental conditions such as the excitation wavelength and light intensity the detailed reaction conditions used for organics oxidation in various photo activated mn vii processes were summarized and compared in table 1 zimmerman 1955 previously reported that the quantum yield for the photodecomposition of aqueous mn vii increased monotonically from 10 5 to 0 05 with decreasing the wavelength from vl 579 nm to uv 254 nm this suggested that there was a higher probability of mn vii dissociation at shorter wavelengths probably because the molecule had available more energy and a longer time interval for dissociation so the change of wavelength would influence the formation of metastable intermediate mno2 η2 o2 as well as its subsequent transformation into other reactive species or back to the parent mn vii moreover haggag et al 2020 demonstrated that tuning excitation from vl to uv showed increasing formation of the metastable intermediate which had a longer lifetime 1 ns than that observed in vl condition in addition light intensity that determines the energy input may also be an important influencing factor on the photodecomposition of mn vii nevertheless studies on the mechanistic difference of mn vii photoactivation under different conditions are very scarce which points out a key direction of future research the main discrepancy of reactive species generated in these photo activated mn vii processes lies in the role of radicals oh and o2 and mn iii which will be discussed separately as follows on the one hand it was interestingly found that ba that was a probe compound for oh was resistant to ss mn vii oxidation whereas the uv mn vii process caused fast decomposition of ba in the light of tba quenching experiments the degradation of target compounds was negligibly influenced by tba in ss mn vii process and was slightly enhanced by tba in vl mn vii process in contrast to the marked inhibitory effect observed in uv mn vii process these discrepancies revealed that oh played distinctly different roles in these processes in addition benzoquinone bq used as the scavenger of o2 sharply hindered the degradation of sulfamethazine smt in vl mn vii process and esr analysis with dmpo confirmed the formation of o2 accordingly o2 was suggested as the primary reactive oxygen radical generated in vl mn vii process on the other hand for the identification of mn iii species in photo activated mn vii processes two main methods were employed including i examining the effect of pyrophosphate pp a commonly used ligand on organics degradation since pp could compete with target compounds to form the mn iii pp complex and it had a lower reactivity toward contaminants oxidation compared to soluble free mn iii not complexing with ligands but h2o or oh and ii detection of the characteristic peak of mn iii at 258 nm in the presence of pp by uv visible spectrophotometer it was noted that pp showed different influences on organics transformation in different photo activated mn vii processes in uv mn vii process the degradation of nb and ba was hardly impacted by the presence of pp and the featured peak of mn iii was not recorded this indicated the negligible role of mn iii in organics degradation as for vl mn vii process pp exerted a significant inhibitory effect on smt oxidation meanwhile the characteristic peak of mn iii at 258 nm was observed in uv visible spectra so zhang et al 2021a suggested that mn iii played an important role in vl mn vii process similarly based on the uv visible observation and the inhibitory effect of pp on 4 cholorphenol 4cp degradation yang et al 2021 proposed that mn iii was generated in ss mn vii system and involved in organics oxidation interestingly they did not observe the pp induced inhibition in the case of p hydroxybenzoic acid phba or enrofloxacin enr oxidation this was explained by the reason that pp stabilized mn v and thereby increased mn v exposure the resulting mn v pp complex was more reactive than mn iii pp complex thus mitigating the decreased reactivity of mn iii hence both mn iii and mn v species contributed to organics degradation by ss mn vii process the generation of mn v was further verified by using pmso as a probe since pmso could be oxidized by high valent metal oxo e g mn oxo and fe oxo species to produce the corresponding sulfones i e methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via an oxygen atom transfer pathway chellamani et al 1999 ka et al 2016 pestovsky and bakac 2006 this was substantially different from the radical dominating oxidation where polymeric and or hydroxylated products were produced from pmso transformation wang et al 2018 moreover mn iii showed sluggish reactivity toward pmso gao et al 2019 thus the complete conversion from pmso to pmso2 observed in ss mn vii process confirmed the involvement of mn v and also ruled out the contribution of radical species notably like mn v soluble free mn iii undergoes the spontaneous disproportionation resulting in its unlikely contribution to the oxidation of contaminants unless in the presence of stabilizing agents or under extremely acidic conditions davies 1969 gao et al 2017 klewicki and morgan 1998 in these photo activated mn vii processes mn v exists in the form of the peroxo complex mno2 η2 o2 as discussed above but mn iii seems not to be stabilized due to the absence of complexing agents since mn iii is one of the photolysis products of mn vii eq 4 it is not surprising to observe the absorbance peak of mn iii when pp is present to stabilize mn iii however in the absence of pp mn iii is rapidly transformed into other valent mn species e g mn ii and mn iv rather than stable existence to react with organics so the uv visible spectrophotometer method may be unable to confirm the involvement of mn iii in organics oxidation in photo activated mn vii processes in addition the inhibitory effect of pp may be related to its competition with the target compounds for mn v therefore evidence for the contribution of mn iii to pollutants oxidation by photo activated mn vii processes may be not convincing and further verification is needed except organic pollutants the uv mn vii process was also demonstrated to have a good performance in removing organic heavy metals from water wei et al 2021 reported that the organoarsenic compound roxarsone was first destabilized to release heavy metal ions via oxidation by reactive species i e oh and mn v and then the released ions were simultaneously removed via adsorption by mno2 in situ formed in uv mn vii process the possibility of mno2 acting as an co oxidant or catalyst photocatalyst to enhance roxarsone oxidation was excluded based on the negligible degradation of roxarsone by mno2 alone and mno2 mn vii at ph 3 0 9 0 as well as by uv mno2 at ph 7 0 2 1 2 influencing factors varying solution conditions could alter the quantum yield of radicals as well as the reactivity of various oxidizing species thus influencing the degradation efficiency of pollutants in photo activated mn vii processes in uv mn vii process a gradual downward trend of organics oxidation rate with ph increasing was observed guo et al 2018 ye et al 2021 it was reported that with the increase of ph from 4 0 to 9 0 the quantum yield of oh was decreased by 50 in uv mn vii process probably due to the involvement of h in formation of oh guo et al 2018 note that the molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm ε254 of mn vii was stable with an increase of ph the redox potential of mn vii under acidic conditions 1 51 v eq 8 is higher than that under neutral conditions 0 58 v eq 9 and alkaline conditions 0 56 v eq 10 hu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a also rmns had higher oxidation abilities at acidic ph yang et al 2021 all these aspects accounted for the decrease of organics degradation efficiency at higher ph the similar ph dependency was obtained during organics oxidation by vl mn vii process zhang et al 2021a interestingly the effect of ph on the ss mn vii process where oh was not involved and only rmns existed as the reactive oxidant was variable with the target contaminant yang et al 2021 with the increase of ph from 4 0 to 9 0 the removal efficiency of 4cp gradually rose from 37 1 to 95 8 while both efficiencies of phba and enr degradation decreased significantly on the one hand the increase of solution ph stimulated the dissociation of organics and the dissociated compounds had higher electron densities and thus were more susceptible to oxidation than the nondissociated ones on the other hand the reactivity of mn vii mn iii and mn v was higher at acidic condition than that at alkaline condition leading to favorable degradation of organics in the former case thus the counterbalance of two opposite effects resulted in the observed different ph influences on different organics degradation in ss mn vii process 8 m n o 4 8 h 5 e m n 2 4 h 2 o 9 m n o 4 2 h 2 o 3 e m n o 2 4 o h 10 m n o 4 e m n o 4 2 raising mn vii dosage resulted in the increase of organics oxidation rates in uv mn vii vl mn vii and ss mn vii processes guo et al 2018 yang et al 2021 ye et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a this could be explained by the fact that higher mn vii dosages could speed up the formation of reactive oxidizing species thus leading to a higher degradation efficiency of pollutants guo et al 2018 found that the quantum yield of oh decreased by 42 8 with an increase of mn vii dosage from 20 to 100 μm mainly due to the stronger filter effect of uv light at higher mn vii dosages in addition excess oxidant could cause an unnecessary consumption of mn vii and also induced chromaticity in the treated water so a moderate mn vii dosage may be suitable for application of photo activated mn vii processes in water decontamination inorganic anions such as so4 2 cl and no3 exerted negligible effects on organics abatement in photo activated mn vii processes while organics degradation rates were differently impacted by the presence of hco3 for instance guo et al 2022a reported that the degradation rates of half of their investigated 26 micropollutants were suppressed in the presence of hco3 while those of the others containing anilines e g trimethoprim sulfamerazine and diclofenac naphthalene rings e g propranolol and naproxen and phenolics e g bisphenol and salbutamol were enhanced by hco3 in uv mn vii process the negative effect of hco3 was also observed in vl mn vii process for smt oxidation zhang et al 2021a in contrast the addition of hco3 led to an enhanced abatement of 4cp and phba in ss mn vii process yang et al 2021 the effects of hco3 might be attributed to the following aspects that i hco3 scavenged oh to produce co3 that had different reactivity toward structurally diverse micropollutants ii hco3 induced the increase of solution ph value due to its buffering capacity which thus influenced the generation of reactive species and their reaction with organics and iii hco3 as a ligand stabilized rmns and prevented their disproportionation which increased the exposure of rmns to react with target compounds luo et al 2019 reported an enhancing effect of hco3 on pollutants oxidation by ferrate feo4 2 fe vi where the stabilization of reactive high valent iron intermediates by hco3 was suggested as a main reason effects of natural organic matter nom on photo activated mn vii processes were associated with the concentration of nom and type of target contaminants for instance guo et al 2022a found that the degradation rates of flumequine naproxen and nalidixic acid by uv mn vii process were decreased by 37 5 77 7 due to the presence of 1 mg l nom while those of propranolol and phenolics were increased significantly the substrate dependent influence of nom was also reported in ss mn vii oxidation yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a suggested that nom at a low concentration level e g 5 mg l showed a minor effect on smt oxidation by vl mn vii process and higher levels of nom e g 5 10 mg l resulted in the inhibition of smt abatement on the one hand the electron donating moieties of nom could compete with target compounds to consume reactive species i e radicals and rmns besides the competitive absorption of light between nom vs mn vii could weaken the photolysis of mn vii to reduce the formation of reactive species the two aspects were responsible for the negative effect of nom on the other hand nom enhanced the generation of rmns from mn vii due to its reducibility and meanwhile might stabilize rmns through forming the rmns nom complexes this increased the exposure of rmns for reacting with target contaminants and thus enhanced their removal notably effects of metal ions that are ubiquitous background matrices in environmental water are lacking in existing research which should be supplemented in future work moreover the photo activated mn vii processes were verified to be very effective in degrading organic contaminants in various real waters e g groundwater surface water and secondary effluent of wastewater although the treatment efficiency was slightly lower than that in ultrapure water due to the presence of competing constituents yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a wei et al 2021 calculated the electrical energy per order ee o for 90 roxarsone removal by uv mn vii process at ph 7 0 and 100 μm mn vii dosage 2 676 kw h m 3 which was comparable to that obtained by uv h2o2 process 0 048 4 53 kw h m 3 similarly guo et al 2022a suggested that the ee o for 90 transformation of 26 micropollutants by uv mn vii process in the presence of 1 mg l nom varied in the range of 0 23 3 11 kw h m 3 close to the ee o obtained in uv h2o2 process in the range of 0 17 2 38 kw h m 3 however ye et al 2021 reported that the ee o value for 90 ba removal by uv mn vii process was 6 96 kw h m 3 around 10 times higher than that of uv h2o2 process 0 67 kw h m 3 based on the above findings the uv mn vii process that involves both selective rmns and non selective oh is more advantageous in treating complicated waters as compared to ss mn vii and vl mn vii processes which just generate relatively mild oxidants the uv mn vii and vl mn vii processes destruct contaminants more effectively under acidic conditions while the ss mn vii process may be a alternative for removing certain contaminants in neutral and alkaline solutions the dosage of mn vii applied in photoactivation should be preliminarily determined according to the actual situation of sewage e g the type and concentration of contaminants and water matrix components the light intensity is also a key parameter influencing the efficiency of photochemical reaction although its effects are not examined in current studies which should be carefully considered the selection of mn vii dosage and light intensity directly influence the treatment efficiency and economic cost so the tradeoff between the two should be made in practical application of photo activated mn vii processes 2 2 electrical activation 2 2 1 mechanism electrochemical technologies have attracted growing interests in water treatment owing to their high reliability easy operation and good adaptability the combination of electrolysis with chemical oxidants such as chlorine cho et al 2014 persulfates liu et al 2018 zhi et al 2020 and ozone zhang et al 2016 is demonstrated to be quite effective in destruction of organic contaminants through the formation of various reactive species e g oh so4 and free chlorine oxidants recently zhu and his co workers reported that the combination of electrolysis and mn vii e mn vii process showed a synergetic effect on organics degradation zhu et al 2019a c particularly the addition of mn2 or using activated carbon fiber acf instead of pt electrode at the cathode further enhanced the kinetics of organics oxidation during the electrochemical activation of mn vii in the presence of mn2 e mn vii mn2 process the degradation of target compound diclofenac dcf was negligibly impacted by radical scavengers i e tba and methanol meoh this result indicated that neither oh nor so4 were generated during electrolysis of mn vii and thus nonradical oxidizing agents such as rmns were proposed to be responsible for enhanced degradation of dcf no characteristic absorbance peaks of mn vi and mn v at wavelengths of 610 and 660 nm respectively were recorded on the uv visible spectra of the e mn vii mn2 process while the absorbance peak at 258 nm corresponding to the formation of mn iii pp was very obvious in the presence of pp in addition the abatement of dcf was decreased significantly due to the addition of pp this was attributed to the reason that the complexation of mn iii with pp outstripped its reaction with dcf and the resulting mn iii pp complex had lower reactivity compared to soluble free mn iii accordingly the authors suggested that mn iii was the primary oxidizing species for fast oxidation of organics in e mn vii process which was mainly produced on cathode rather than in aqueous solution or on anode mn2 considerably promoted the generation of mn iii because mn2 not only acted as a promoter for mn iii eq 11 but also as a stabilizer of mn iii by inhibiting its disproportionation eq 12 when the electrochemical activation of mn vii was performed with an acf cathode e acf mn vii process acf as a reductant reacted with mn vii to produce mn2 first which exerted an activating effect for mn iii generation 11 3 m n 2 2 m n o 4 16 h 5 e 5 m n i i i 8 h 2 o 12 2 m n 3 2 h 2 o m n o 2 m n 2 4 h e 0 0 53 v moreover wang et al 2021a used microbial fuel cells that could turn chemical energy into electrical energy bio electricity via the metabolism of microorganisms in an anode chamber to activate mn vii mfc mn vii process for degradation of dcf in urine therein multiple rmns including mn iii mn v and mn vi were proposed as the reactive species responsible for dcf degradation based on the density functional theory dft calculation and several experimental evidences one important piece of evidence for mn v and mn vi was that pmso was transformed into pmso2 with a yield approaching 100 in mfc mn vii process the authors held that the conversion of pmso2 from pmso could only be achieved by mn vi and mn v but not by other oxidants in mfc mn vii process however this was in contrast to the acknowledged fact that sulfoxide compounds e g pmso and methyl p tolyl sulfone tmso had a high reactivity toward mn vii and corresponding sulfone products e g pmso2 and methyl p methyl sulfone tmso2 were generated via oxygen transfer pathway for instance yang et al 2021 observed the 100 conversion from pmso to pmso2 during mn vii alone oxidation for the identification of mn iii the pp induced inhibition of dcf degradation and the observation of mn iii pp absorbance peak were used as the main evidence in above e mn vii processes it is consistently agreed that rmns are the dominant oxidizing agents for effective degradation of organics however one question worth considering is how rmns are stabilized against their spontaneous disproportionation in the absence of complexing agents on the other hand the vital role of mno2 that is a stable product in situ generated from mn vii reduction in e mn vii processes has been ignored in these studies mainly because the combination of electrolysis with mno2 e mno2 process resulted in significantly lower degradation rate of organics as compared to that of e mn vii process however this result only ruled out the role of mno2 as an oxidant while the possibility of mno2 serving as a catalyst for mn vii was not verified jiang et al 2015 2009 have done a great quantity of work to explore the reason for the enhancing effect of mno2 on mn vii oxidation and they concluded that mno2 might not serve as a co oxidant but as an important catalyst to facilitate the removal of organic pollutants regardless of their susceptibility to oxidation by mno2 recently zhu et al 2022 reported that the combination of e mn vii and peroxydisulfate pds e mn vii pds process led to a significant synergy in the degradation of organic contaminants in their study the generation of amorphous mno2 from mn vii reduction was confirmed by means of various characterizations e g fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and x ray diffraction xrd mechanism studies suggested that in situ generated amorphous mno2 bound with pds via the surface oh groups to form reactive pds mno2 complexes which then activated pds to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 and also oxidized organics through direct electron transfer in turn pds could promote the valence state transformation of mn thereby facilitating the formation of mno2 song et al 2021 also demonstrated that mno2 was in situ generated in e mn vii process with low additive ozone and it played an important role in promoting the formation of reactive species through heterogeneous catalysis of ozone and or mn vii in addition it was noted that acidic conditions were more conducive to organics degradation in e mn vii processes in accordance with the fact that the catalytic activity of mno2 strengthened significantly at lower ph from these respects it seems likely that the applied electric field enhances mn vii reduction to mno2 which catalyzes the degradation of organic pollutants by mn vii in a word the mechanism involved in enhanced organics degradation by e mn vii processes is still not completely clear and further investigations are needed for identifying the role of various manganese intermediates especially mno2 2 2 2 influencing factors as mentioned above a lower ph value was favorable for organics degradation in e mn vii processes for instance the reaction rate of dcf in e mn vii mn2 process decreased approximately 120 fold with the initial ph increasing from 3 0 to 11 0 zhu et al 2019a and the rate obtained in e acf mn vii process decreased about 50 fold as ph increased from 3 0 to 10 0 zhu et al 2019c this might be associated with the decrease of mn vii oxidation potential with increasing ph eqs 8 10 resulting in slower formation of reactive manganese intermediates in addition wang et al 2021a suggested that in mfc mn vii process the cathodic potential and current density decreased with increasing ph which also affected the removal of dcf the degradation of dcf was enhanced at higher mn vii concentrations and stronger current densities probably due to the accelerated decomposition of mn vii to form reactive manganese intermediates wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2019a c common water matrices showed different effects on dcf degradation in e mn vii processes the presence of inorganic anions such as h2po4 hco3 no3 and a lower concentration of cl inhibited the degradation of dcf while humic acid ha a principal component of nom and a higher concentration of cl exhibited a promoting effect on dcf abatement zhu et al 2019a c the complicated influences of nom on mn vii based oxidation processes have been elaborated in section 2 1 2 which are not repeatedly discussed herein the inhibitory effect caused by inorganic anions might be due to their competition with mn vii for electrons on the cathode as exemplified by no3 eqs 13 14 which resulted in the reduction of manganese intermediates formation wang et al 2021a in addition the presence of h2po4 or hco3 raised solution ph during reaction due to its buffering effect which was not favorable for dcf removal however cl at a higher concentration might react with reactive species in e mn vii processes to form reactive chlorine radicals e g cl and cl2 which were likely to participate in transformation of dcf furthermore the degradation efficiency of dcf by e mn vii processes in real waters e g tap water and surface water was close to that in ultrapure water primarily attributed to the complex influences of different water matrices wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2019a c 13 n o 3 2 h 2 e n o 2 h 2 o 14 n o 2 3 h 3 e o h h 2 o 0 5 n 2 2 3 activation by redox mediators redox mediators first described by bourbonnais and paice 1990 allow laccases to oxidize nonphenolic compounds thereby immensely expanding the range of substrates that can be degraded by these enzymes redox mediators are the compounds that quicken the reaction rate by shuttling electrons from the biological oxidation of primary electron donors or from bulk electron donors to the electron acceptors husain and husain 2007 the application of redox mediators in enzymatic catalysis has been widely investigated and well reviewed in previous literature husain and husain 2007 morozova et al 2007 strong and claus 2011 interestingly several recent studies report that redox mediators can also act as the catalyst of mn vii to enhance the oxidation of organic pollutants shi et al 2020 song et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b this enhancing effect is similar to that of enzymatic catalysis mechanism where the redox mediators are converted to active intermediates that are capable of degrading organic compounds more readily it is noted that the mechanism of redox mediators triggered mn vii activation is rather different from other mn vii activation processes since the intermediates derived from redox mediators rather than rmns are predominant oxidizing species for organics the currently reported redox mediators that are effective for mn vii activation include both natural e g syringaldehyde syd vanillin van 4 hydroxycoumarin 4hc and p coumaric acid pca and synthetic compounds e g 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts 1 hydroxybenzotriazole hbt n hydroxyphthalimide hpi violuric acid vla and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempo the detailed reactions between these redox mediators with mn vii as well as the enhanced efficiency of contaminants removal are discussed below reaction scheme of mn vii redox mediator systems for abatement of organic pollutants is illustrated in fig 2 2 3 1 abts song et al 2015 first found that abts could greatly accelerate the oxidation of substituted phenols by mn vii over a wide ph range 5 0 9 0 this was attributed to the fact that abts was rapidly oxidized by mn vii into a stable radical cation i e abts which had a higher reactivity toward substituted phenols than mn vii with the rapid oxidation of organics abts was simultaneously reduced back to abts thus the cycling of abts and abts pair played a vital catalytic role in enhanced organics degradation by mn vii as a mild oxidant analogous to mn vii fe vi reacted with abts via a similar pathway to generate abts so the enhancing effect of abts on contaminants abatement by fe vi was also observed dong et al 2017 degradation kinetics of substituted phenols in mn vii abts system were significantly influenced by solution parameters for instance the pseudo first order rate constant kobs for the reaction of phenol with mn vii abts system increased from 0 0077 to 0 1696 min 1 22 times with increasing abts concentration from 0 to 3 μm at ph 5 this was due to the accelerated formation of abts at higher abts levels in addition the enhancing effect of abts weakened with solution ph increasing the reaction rate of phenol just increased about twice as abts concentration increased from 0 to 3 μm at ph 8 or 9 at alkaline ph the higher reaction rate of abts with phenol than that of abts with mn vii resulted in a high ratio of unreacted abts abtsu to abts it was demonstrated that abtsu could retard the reaction of abts with phenol due to its competition for abts via a fast inner electron exchange process 4 1 107 m 1 s 1 scott et al 1993 2 3 2 hbt shi et al 2020 reported that a series of natural e g syd van 4hc and pca and synthetic e g hbt hpi and vla redox mediators were capable of accelerating mn vii reaction with bisphenol a bpa in general the synthetic redox mediators containing n oh groups exhibited a greater enhancement on bpa degradation than natural redox mediators among them the largest enhancing effects were observed for hbt which was also effective for catalytic oxidation of a broad spectrum of organic pollutants e g bisphenol af bpaf sulfamethoxazole smx estrone and butylparaben bp the authors suggested that benzotriazole nitroxyl radicals hbt are generated from one electron transfer reaction between hbt and mn vii acting as the reactive species for enhanced degradation of pollutants evidence for the in situ formation of hbt mainly included that i butylated hydroxytoluene used as a scavenger for hbt had an inhibitory effect on bpa oxidation and ii 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr spectra for the mixture of hbt mn vii and 5 diisopropoxy phosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo used as the trapping agent showed significant signal peaks of the hbt dippmpo adduct directly confirming the occurrence of hbt moreover the possible involvement of high valent manganese intermediates e g mn v and mn vi in mn vii hbt oxidation system was ruled out based on the observation that the degradation rate of pmso was increased in mn vii hbt system as compared to that by mn vii alone oxidation but the yield of pmso2 decreased meanwhile a new transformation product of pmso was detected indicating the involvement of other reactive species rather than rmns higher hbt concentrations were conducive to organic pollutants removal in mn vii hbt system due to higher amounts of reactive intermediates generation however excessive hbt could not further increase the removal rate of pollutants probably because the production of excessive reactive intermediates stimulated their self quenching and thus reduced the accessibility of organics to reactive intermediates the enhancing effect of hbt dropped largely with increasing ph from 4 0 to 7 0 becoming negligible at ph 8 0 and 9 0 at lower ph mn vii with a higher redox potential transformed hbt into its reactive intermediate faster thus causing a greater degradation of organics the presence of either inorganic anions cl no3 co3 2 and so4 2 or metal ions ca2 mg2 fe3 and cu2 had an ignorable influence on the oxidation performance of mn vii hbt system lower concentrations of ha 1 10 mgc l promoted the degradation of organic substrates bpa and bpaf by mn vii hbt system meanwhile the presence of ha accelerated the transformation of hbt by mn vii two possible reasons were given to explain the effect of ha firstly rmns formation was promoted by ha which then was stabilized by ha through forming the rmns nom complexes as discussed in section 2 1 2 otherwise they could not exist stably in mn vii hbt system they played a critical role in both degrading organics and accelerating the conversion of hbt to hbt secondly the abundant phenolic moieties in ha molecules might work as the redox mediators to react with mn vii forming ha associated radicals which was reported to accelerate the degradation of substrates in enzymatic systems considering the complex properties of ha further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism for ha promoting organics transformation by mn vii hbt system and other mn vii redox mediator systems furthermore the mn vii hbt system showed an excellent decontamination efficiency in natural water matrices e g river water or wastewater treatment plant effluent even higher than that in deionized water 2 3 3 tempo similar to abts and hbt tempo was also an effective redox mediator for enhancing mn vii oxidation toward many contaminants and the mn vii tempo system exhibited a high reactivity over a wide ph range of 4 0 11 0 zhang et al 2021b explored the reaction mechanism of mn vii tempo system and proposed that tempo was oxidized preferentially by mn vii through one electron transfer route with formation of tempo the oxoammonium cation of tempo which then reacted with organics rapidly with itself being reduced to tempo or tempoh tempo hydroxylamine the subsequent oxidation of tempoh led to the re generation of tempo which completed a cycle the degradation kinetics of bpa by mn vii tempo system kept almost unchanged in three continuous runs where bpa and mn vii were re dosed after complete removal of bpa to keep their concentrations the same in each run but tempo was not supplemented this result proved the cycle of tempo and tempo in mn vii tempo system with little loss of tempo which played a critical role in enhanced pollutants degradation the oxidizing role of tempo was also verified by using a commercial salt of tempo 4 acetylamino tempo bf4 containing the same strong oxidizing moiety of n o as tempo which could degrade bpa at a high rate comparable to that observed in mn vii tempo system moreover it was interestingly found that the addition of tempo inhibited the oxidation of pmso by mn vii and concomitant pmso2 formation primarily because tempo was not reactive toward pmso and tempo only acted as a competitor for mn vii with pmso to lower the degradation of pmso this result indicated the selectivity of tempo toward organics and also excluded the possible involvement of rmns which were highly reactive toward pmso it was noted that the degradation of pmso by mn vii was enhanced in the presence of hbt shi et al 2020 differing from the case of tempo more recently these authors further investigated the abatement of organic contaminants by mn vii in the presence of tempo or its para substituted analogues i e 4 oxo tempo 4 hydroxyl tempo 4 acetylamino tempo 4 amino tempo and 4 carboxyl tempo zhang et al 2022a it was found that the presence of substituents at para to the n o moiety greatly influenced the degradation kinetics of organics by changing the reduction potentials of tempos and thus impacting the generation of their corresponding oxoammonium cations tempos which were the dominant oxidizing species in addition to tempos mn vii per se made great contributions to organics abatement especially under alkaline conditions e g ph 9 0 and in situ formed mno2 also played a role under acidic conditions e g ph 4 0 and 5 0 their relative contributions to bpa degradation in mn vii tempos systems were quantified based on a simplistic kinetic model the degradation rate of organics increased with the increase of tempo concentration but further raising tempo dosage led to a plateau probably due to the self quenching of excessive reactive intermediates in contrast to the low enhancing effect of abts and hbt at alkaline ph tempo was still effective for promoting mn vii oxidation at solution ph up to 11 the kobs for bpa degradation increased with increasing ph in mn vii tempo system in addition different organic contaminants e g bpa phenol aniline sulfisoxazole and phenylbutazone oxidation by mn vii 4 acetylamino tempo system showed different ph dependency probably due to the comprehensive effect of multiple factors including organic contaminant speciation the change of mn vii reduction potential ph dependent contribution of mno2 the discrepancies among these mn vii redox mediator systems suggested that their respective reactive intermediates had significantly different oxidation properties e g ph dependent reactivity and substrate selectivity common anions in water matrices e g co3 2 cl so4 2 and no3 and metal ions e g ca2 mg2 and cu2 slightly influenced the removal of bpa in mn vii tempo system consistent with the finding obtained in mn vii hbt system effect of ha on the mn vii tempo system was dependent on solution ph for instance the abatement of bpa in mn vii tempo system was greatly sped up at ph 5 0 but was inhibited at ph 8 0 due to the presence of ha 0 4 10 0 mgc l zhang et al 2021b attributed this to the reason that the addition of ha facilitated the formation of mno2 via mn vii reduction which served as a co oxidant or catalyst to promote mn vii oxidation toward contaminants at acidic conditions but was relatively ineffective at alkaline conditions the formation of mno2 along with mn vii decomposition during bpa oxidation in mn vii tempo system was confirmed using uv visible spectrophotometer nevertheless other possible roles of ha in mn vii tempo system should be explored as mentioned in section 2 3 2 like mn vii hbt system mn vii tempo system showed an excellent decontamination performance in real waters where the removal of bpa was slightly higher or comparable to that in pure water these indicate that mn vii redox mediator systems have a good potential for eliminating emerging pollutants in natural and complex environmental matrices 2 4 activation by carbonaceous materials in recent decades carbonaceous materials such as graphite graphene oxide biochar and carbon nanotubes cnts have gained increasing attention as promising candidates for heterogeneous catalysis in water treatment and environmental remediation owing to their green metal free nature abundance on the earth as well as their excellent properties e g large specific surface areas ultrahigh pore volumes unique electrical features chemical and thermal stability chen et al 2018 oh et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 a large number of investigations have been carried out on carbon triggered activation of persulfates for oxidation of recalcitrant organics inspired by these a few researchers have recently examined the feasibility of using carbonaceous materials to activate mn vii for removing organic contaminants in water it is demonstrated that many carbonaceous materials such as biochar tian et al 2019 graphite peng et al 2021 cnts wang et al 2021b zhao et al 2016 and reduced graphene oxide rgo zhang et al 2022b can effectively improve the oxidation ability of mn vii however different reaction mechanisms involved in mn vii carbonaceous materials systems have been proposed strongly depending on the applied carbonaceous materials 2 4 1 cnts zhao et al 2016 first reported the catalytic effect of carbonaceous materials on mn vii by using cnts they found that the addition of cnts resulted in a significant enhancement of phenols and anilines removal by mn vii mn vii decomposition and total manganese concentration decrease in the presence of cnts were observed indicating the formation of mno2 on carbon surface the cnts enhanced organics degradation was more favorable at lower ph consistent with the fact that mno2 catalyzed mn vii oxidation was more significant under acid condition and became negligible under alkaline condition thus the authors suggested that mno2 generated by the reaction between mn vii and cnts promoted organics oxidation by mn vii wang et al 2021b also observed the enhancing effect of cnts on degradation of organic pollutants e g ciprofloxacin cip dcf and smx by mn vii however they put forward a different point of view from zhao s to explain this phenomenon they hold that cnts acted as an electronic platform for the electron transfer from organics to mn vii which directly degraded organics and meanwhile produced rmns probably mn iii to further contribute to organics abatement this was verified based on dft calculation spectrum analysis and chronoamperometry as mentioned above the enhancing effect of cnts on mn vii oxidation was much stronger at lower ph however the ph dependency of organics oxidation in mn vii cnts system varied with the type of organic substrates in general phenols and anilines degradation kinetics in mn vii cnts system followed a similar trend to those observed in mn vii alone oxidation zhao et al 2016 wang et al 2021b observed the gradually decreased removal of cip with initial solution ph increasing from 3 0 to 11 0 2 4 2 biochar tian et al 2019 reported that the addition of biochar greatly enhanced the degradation of smx by mn vii they suggested that the reductive sites of biochar e g c h c c and c o groups reacted with mn vii to produce biochar complexed manganese intermediates which were more reactive than mn vii and readily oxidized smx it was observed that preoxidized biochar ozonized for an hour almost completely lost the activating effect for mn vii indicating the important role of reduction property of biochar characterization e g ft ir xps and elemental composition analyses of the spent biochar supported the hypothesis of manganese intermediates combining on the surface of biochar in mn vii biochar system in addition pp showed an inhibiting effect on smx degradation in mn vii biochar system implying the involvement of rmns however the mn valence of biochar complexed rmns was not determined in their study furthermore the specific carbon sites for complexing with rmns were not identified which deserves further study increasing the dosage of biochar or mn vii in mn vii biochar system facilitated the removal of smx the repetitive use of biochar resulted in a decrease of smx oxidation efficiency mainly due to the consumption of reductive sites of biochar during mn vii oxidation compared with that conducted in deionized water the oxidation rate of smx was higher in groundwater but was lower in surface water this was due to the complex effects of water background constituents e g nom and inorganic ions which interacted with mn vii or surface sites of biochar to impact the oxidation of smx 2 4 3 graphite peng et al 2021 also observed the activating effect of carbonaceous materials on mn vii by using graphite they claimed that graphite as a good electron mediator stimulated the direct electron transfer from organics e g smx to mn vii rather than induced rmns generation via the interaction of mn vii with reductive sites on carbon surface in their study the degradation of smx by mn vii with the preoxidized graphite ozonized for 2 h was comparable to that with raw graphite indicating that the electron donating reductive sites of graphite were not mainly responsible for its activating effect alternatively they proposed an electron transfer mechanism for the mn vii graphite system which was verified by a galvanic oxidation process gop in brief organic contaminants and mn vii were separately present in two half cells and graphite sheets were used as the electrodes a high current value was detected as mn vii was added into the half cell and smx oxidation efficiency in the gop reached 61 which clearly confirmed the direct electron transfer between smx and mn vii via graphite sheets in addition graphite was unable to enhance the transformation of pmso by mn vii indicating the negligible contribution of rmns in mn vii graphite system the mechanistic discrepancy between mn vii graphite and mn vii biochar system was attributed to the difference of carbonaceous materials nature the conductivity of biochar 6 8 10 5 s cm 1 was much lower than that of graphite 170 8 s cm 1 indicating that biochar was not conducive to direct electron transfer however biochar had a higher electron donating ability than graphite so the redox reaction between mn vii and biochar was more apt to occur than that between mn vii and graphite the degradation rate of smx in mn vii graphite system increased with increasing mn vii concentration and then kept constant after reaching the maximum a lower solution ph was favorable for smx oxidation the presence of ha inhibited smx oxidation and the inhibiting effect increased as ha concentration increased results of repetitive experiments showed that the smx oxidation efficiency was obviously decreased with an increased cycle time of graphite this was attributed to the adsorption of mno2 in situ formed during reaction on the surface of graphite which impeded electron transfer from smx to mn vii via graphite ultrasonic treatment is a simple and effective way to remove the adsorbed mno2 from graphite without changing the physiochemical properties of graphite compared with other activated mn vii oxidation processes e g mn vii biochar and mn vii bisulfite system the mn vii graphite system via the electron transfer mechanism exhibited higher mn vii utilization efficiency 2 4 4 rgo more recently zhang et al 2022b used rgo with tuned defective degree and quantity of oxygen groups as a model carbocatalyst to probe the active sites for enhancing mn vii oxidation experimental results revealed that the activation performance and pathway of mn vii by carbonaceous materials were closely related to their surface chemistry oxygen containing groups e g hydroxyl group c oh carboxyl group cooh and carbonyl group c o could act as electron donors to induce the decomposition of mn vii into rmns mainly mn v and mn vi while structural defects e g vacancy and edge defects mediated the electron transfer from pollutants to mn vii these were further verified by dft calculations it was noted that an appropriate low oxygen content of rgo was conductive to boost mn vii oxidation but excessive oxygen content was adverse because excessive surface oxygen groups not only occupied the active sites through the stereo hindrance effect but also did damage to the conductivity of carbon in a word both rmns and electron transfer might occur in mn vii rgo system devoting to organics degradation and their contributions strongly depended on the type and content of active sites on carbon surface therefore the oxidation pathway of the mn vii rgo system could be controlled by regulating oxygen functional groups and structural defects the increase of rgo or mn vii dosage was beneficial for organics oxidation in mn vii rgo system the removal efficiency of dcf by mn vii rgo system was similar at ph 4 0 8 0 while it significantly decreased as ph increased from 8 0 to 10 0 the mn vii rgo system enhanced a variety of organic contaminants oxidation compared to mn vii alone but it exhibited a selective reactivity for instance the mn vii rgo system showed superior removal performances for phenol bpa carbamazepine cbz and rhodamine b rhb while the performances for smx ba and diethyl phthalate dep removal were much inferior moreover the mn vii rgo system was also fairly efficient in abatement of pollutants in real waters e g tap water and lake water 2 5 other activation methods 2 5 1 activation by benzoquinone bq quinone groups as an important fraction of humic substance are abundant in aquatic environments which play an important role in biological and chemical processes pat espadas et al 2014 zhu et al 2019b interestingly recent studies reported that quinone compounds such as bq could activate mn vii to enhance the oxidative removal of levofloxacin lev one widely used fluoroquinolone antibiotic under acid and neutral conditions in a study by xu et al 2018 mn iii and 1o2 were proposed as the dominant reactive species for enhanced degradation of lev they assumed that the reduction of mn vii by bq generated mn ii eq 15 which reacted with bq to yield mn iii and semiquinone radical sq in the presence of do mn iii further reacted with sq to produce 1o2 and o2 eq 16 in addition mn vii could react with mn ii to produce mn iii which then interacted with sq to form mn iii sq complexes in turn promoting generation of 1o2 eq 17 15 m n v i i b q m n i i b q b y p r o d u c t s 16 m n i i b q h 2 o m n i i i s q o 2 m n i i b q 1 o 2 o 2 17 m n v i i 4 m n i i l 5 m n i i i l l ligand sq however zhou et al 2021 found that sodium azide nan3 an efficient scavenger for 1o2 at a comparable or one order of magnitude higher concentration 2 50 μm than that of lev 5 μm exhibited a negligible effect on the degradation of lev in mn vii bq system suggesting that 1o2 was not the dominant oxidizing species generated in this process if 1o2 was otherwise produced as the primary oxidant the degradation of lev should be substantially inhibited according to the extremely high reaction rate of nan3 with 1o2 109 m 1 s 1 gsponer et al 1987 moreover the ex situ prepared complexes of mn iii with ligands mn iii l showed a sluggish reactivity toward lev also ruling out the possible contribution of mn iii l in mn vii bq system alternatively zhou et al 2021 proposed that bq and the co present hydroquinone hq resulting from self condensation or decomposition of bq might promote the reduction of mn vii to in situ form mno2 which efficiently catalyzed mn vii to oxidize lev therein several lines of evidence were provided including that i bq activated mn vii oxidation showed a similar ph dependent trend to that of mno2 catalytic oxidation of mn vii i e the activating effect strengthened with ph decreasing ii elevating bq concentration resulted in a marked increase of uv visible absorbance 500 nm corresponding to mno2 confirming the promoted reduction of mn vii by bq and iii other reducing agents including inorganic as iii and mnso4 as well as organic resorcinol noting that it could not be oxidized to quinonoid intermediates also accelerated the oxidation of lev by mn vii owing to the promoted formation of mno2 via mn vii reduction in this regard mno2 in situ formed might play a key role in enhanced degradation of organics in mn vii bq system dong et al 2022 further explored the potential mechanism involved in mn vii bq system and suggested that multiple components including 1o2 mn iii and in situ formed mno2 together contributed to the accelerated degradation of bpa in mn vii bq system among them the catalytic effect of in situ formed mno2 on mn vii oxidation was important under acidic conditions while the bq induced enhancement of mn vii oxidation ability under alkaline conditions e g ph 8 0 10 0 might be associated with generation of other reactive species the role of 1o2 was confirmed by the results of i the inhibitory effect of furfuryl alcohol ffa a scavenger of 1o2 on bpa degradation and ii the negative impact induced by purging with nitrogen it was generally believed that do was involved in 1o2 generation these observations were consistent with those reported in xu s study xu et al 2018 lee et al 2020 have published a review to assess the role of 1o2 in persulfate based advanced oxidation therein they suggest that 1o2 is a highly selective oxidant with a low oxidation potential e0 1o2 o2 0 81 vnhe the reaction kinetics of 1o2 with most organic compounds are too slow to be practical in water treatment applications quenching experiments with scavengers may not be an appropriate way to investigate the role of 1o2 because scavengers not only quench the target 1o2 but also can change the whole reaction process e g enhancing the consumption of oxidants to interfere the generation of reactive species guo et al 2022b wang et al 2022 so further solid evidence for 1o2 contribution in mn vii bq system should be provided in addition the main evidence for mn iii involving in organics transformation was that the addition of pp greatly improved the degradation efficiency of bpa due to its stabilizing effect for mn iii interestingly xu et al 2018 reported a significant inhibition of lev degradation in the presence of pp the completely opposite effects of pp observed in mn vii bq system might be related to the selective reactivity of mn iii l toward organics namely mn iii l was highly reactive toward phenolic compounds but was inert to lev as demonstrated in zhou s study zhou et al 2021 nevertheless since mn iii is one of intermediate products from mn vii transformation the presence of pp leading to the generation of mn iii l to impact organics degradation in mn vii based oxidation processes seems not difficult to understand but this might not be a reliable evidence for the stable occurrence of mn iii and its participating in reactions in mn vii bq system the role of sq as a complexing ligand for mn iii stabilization in mn vii bq system should be further verified for better understanding of the potential mechanism the enhancement of bq on mn vii oxidation was influenced by solution ph and also related to target compounds xu et al 2018 and zhou et al 2021 reported a more significant enhancement of bq on mn vii oxidation toward lev under acid condition compared to that under alkaline condition however dong et al 2022 found that the extent of bq enhancing the degradation of bpa by mn vii was similar within a wide ph range of 4 0 10 0 in general a higher bq concentration was conducive to accelerating organics abatement in mn vii bq system while excessive bq could cause a negative impact because of the competitive consumption of bq toward oxidizing species dong et al 2022 xu et al 2018 the degradation efficiency of organics increased in mn vii bq system as a low concentration of ha e g 0 2 0 mgc l was present dong et al 2022 moreover the mn vii bq system exhibited a higher degradation efficiency of organics in real waters than that in pure water 2 5 2 activation by heterogeneous ru catalysts in early literature ruthenium iii ru iii is reported as an efficient catalyst for mn vii oxidation toward many organic compounds such as amino acids atenolol d panthenol and amitriptyline under strong alkaline oh 0 05 m or strong acidic h 0 03 m conditions abbar et al 2011 halligudi et al 2001 hiremath et al 2004 kini et al 2002 afterwards zhang et al zhang and guan 2014 zhang et al 2014b demonstrated that ru iii could also enhance the degradation of pollutants e g aniline and bpa by mn vii at environmentally relevant ph however most studies focus on the soluble ru iii which is far from practical application due to its expensive price and difficulty in removal recovery from the effluents further zhang and his co workers investigated the catalytic performance of heterogeneous ru loaded catalysts such as ceria or titania supported ru ru ceo2 or ru tio2 on mn vii zhang et al 2013 2014a based on their findings the presence of ru loaded catalysts significantly promoted the removal of organic pollutants by mn vii the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes analysis revealed that ru iii deposited on the surface of supports was oxidized by mn vii to its higher oxidation state ru vi and ru vii which acted as the active co oxidants participating in organics transformation zhang et al 2013 meanwhile ru vi and ru vii were reduced by organics to the initial state of ru iii in other words ru loaded catalysts acted as an electron shuttle in catalytic oxidation of mn vii which was a little similar to the mechanism of mn vii activation by redox mediators reactive intermediates derived from the catalyst rather than from mn vii accounted for enhanced degradation of organics ru loaded catalysts were effective in catalyzing mn vii oxidation over a wide ph range for instance the degradation rate of bp by mn vii was accelerated by 3 4 95 7 times at ph 4 0 8 0 with the most significant enhancement occurring at ph 5 0 due to the presence of ru tio2 zhang et al 2013 the increase of either mn vii or catalysts dosage was beneficial to organics degradation the enhancing effect of ru loaded catalysts was closely related to the type of organic pollutants for instance the second order rate constant of cip degradation by mn vii increased from 0 60 to 8 40 m 1 s 1 14 fold due to the presence of 1 0 g l ru tio2 while the oxidation of caffeine was negligibly affected by ru tio2 zhang et al 2014a these catalysts maintained the excellent catalytic activity during multiple successive runs moreover the removal efficiency of organic pollutants in real waters was comparable or even slightly higher than that in deionized water zhang et al 2013 2014a 3 conclusions and outlooks the extensive review of recently published results confirms activated mn vii oxidation processes are a viable strategy for destruction of emerging contaminants in water many methods including photoactivation electrical activation the addition of redox mediators carbonaceous materials and other chemical agents show excellent performances in mn vii activation different oxidation mechanisms are involved in these processes including the generation of reactive intermediates derived from mn vii e g mn iii mn v and mn vi or activators e g intermediates of redox mediators and ru catalysts reactive oxygen species ros e g oh o2 and 1o2 as well as electron transfer from organics to mn vii via catalysts as the electron mediator notably except oh that is generated as one of co oxidants in uv mn vii process other reactive species involved in activated mn vii oxidation processes are relatively mild oxidants they exhibit more selective reactivity toward organic pollutants and higher tolerance to water matrixes e g inorganic ions and nom compared to highly active radical species thus high pollutants removal efficiencies can be achieved in complex environmental matrices making these mn vii based oxidation technologies have a good application prospect in practical engineering processes however the potential applications of these technologies deserve further efforts firstly energy based activation methods e g uv irradiation and electrochemical technologies require high energy consumption and complicated reactors thus hampering their applications on a large scale by contrast the use of relatively cheap and green carbonaceous materials for mn vii activation may be a good option in water treatment nevertheless the cost effectiveness of mn vii carbonaceous materials systems should be evaluated comprehensively by considering the synthetic cost of carbonaceous materials and mn vii dosage moreover the activation efficiency and mechanism of mn vii by carbonaceous materials are greatly dependent on their nature and properties both oxygen containing groups and structural defects have been identified as the main active sites for mn vii activation via different pathways which can give guidance to the rational design of carbonaceous materials with high catalytic activities in addition the economic cost of other mn vii activation methods is also unavailable in current studies which should be calculated to assess the practical application potential of these technologies secondly the mechanistic understanding for activated mn vii oxidation processes should be further advanced the claims that are questioned throughout this article should be scrutinized for instance soluble free mn iii has been proposed as the main oxidant in many activated mn vii oxidation processes e g e mn vii vl mn vii and mn vii bq systems however a big question is how mn iii can exist stably against disproportionation in the absence of complexing agents the influence of pp on organics degradation kinetics may not be a reliable evidence for mn iii occurrence since it can scavenge instantaneous mn iii generated during mn vii transformation in addition the roles of ros such as o2 and 1o2 identified in vl mn vii and mn vii bq systems also need clarification since they are highly selective oxidants and have a limited reactivity toward most organic pollutants in practical water treatment lee et al 2020 min et al 2022 the commonly used quenching experiments may not be appropriate for their identification due to the complex influences induced by quenchers addition in addition the mechanistic discrepancy among different photo activated mn vii processes is worthy of further investigation thirdly mno2 is usually in situ formed as a stable product from mn vii transformation and it exhibits an excellent catalytic capacity for mn vii especially under acidic conditions however the vital role of mno2 in some activated mn vii oxidation processes e g e mn vii system has been overlooked which should be re evaluated furthermore the accurate catalytic mechanism of mno2 for mn vii is still unclear which is worth deep exploration earlier studies suggest that organic compounds first adsorb on mno2 surface to form active complexes which are more reactive and thus quickly oxidized by mn vii perez benito 2009 2011 recently it is reported that mno2 can promote the degradation of pollutants by fe vi luo et al 2022 and periodate io4 du et al 2020 that are both oxyanions analogous to mn vii the enhancing mechanism of mno2 involves the first formation of metastable mno2 fe vi and mn iv o io3 complexes through the interaction of mno2 and oxidants which are able to rapidly react with organics and meanwhile result in other reactive species formation fourthly since multiple reaction pathways usually co exist in activated mn vii oxidation processes it is necessary to precisely and quantitatively estimate the contribution of each pathway to total organics oxidation for better guiding the application of these technologies this however is still challenging due to the lack of analytical methods on the other hand dft calculation may provide some useful information about the preferable reaction pathway thus developing new and effective research techniques assisted with theoretical calculation for distinguishing the role of various reactive species should be a future research direction finally the decontamination performance of these mn vii based oxidation technologies should be tested at a pilot and field scale for assessing their feasibility in practical water treatment the applicable conditions of these technologies should be carefully considered and the operating parameters should be further optimized in terms of specific water quality conditions e g the type and level of organic contaminants and water matrix components moreover the addition of chemicals such as synthetic redox mediators bq and ru catalysts can bring about some environmental risks e g n containing organic byproducts formation and ru leaching the inadvertent release of carbonaceous materials into the effluents after treatment process may also cause environmental concerns so environmental risk assessment of these technologies should be conducted in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

15326,studies that promote chemical oxidation by permanganate mno4 mn vii as a viable technology for water treatment and environmental purification have been quickly accumulating over the past decades various methods to activate mn vii have been proposed and their efficacy in destructing a wide range of emerging organic contaminants has been demonstrated this article aims to present a state of art review on the development of mn vii activation methods including photoactivation electrical activation the addition of redox mediators carbonaceous materials and other chemical agents with a particular focus on the potential activation mechanism and critical influencing factors different reaction mechanisms are involved in activated mn vii oxidation processes including the generation of reactive intermediates derived from mn vii e g mn iii mn v and mn vi or activators e g intermediates of redox mediators and ru catalysts reactive oxygen species ros e g oh o2 and 1o2 as well as electron transfer from organics to mn vii via catalysts as the electron mediator except oh that is generated as one of co oxidants in uv mn vii process other reactive species are relatively mild oxidants which are more selective toward organic substrates and highly tolerant toward various water matrices e g inorganic ions and natural organic matter compared to strongly oxidizing radical species therefore activated mn vii oxidation processes show a good prospect for efficient removal of target contaminants in natural and complex environmental matrices however there are some disputes about the dominant reactive species generated in these processes and their identification methods may be not appropriate causing serious confusion in the mechanistic understanding so further efforts are still needed to fill the knowledge gap and also to address the application challenges of these technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate activation methods mechanism influencing factors organic contaminants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays concerns are being increasingly raised about the widespread occurrence of emerging contaminants e g endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pharmaceutic and personal care products ppcps and disinfection byproducts dbps in aquatic environments due to their potential threat to human beings and ecosystems cizmas et al 2015 petrie et al 2015 sauvé and desrosiers 2014 chemical oxidation by permanganate mno4 mn vii is a promising technology for removal of organic contaminants because of its unique merits such as the comparative stability effectiveness over a broad ph range relatively low cost ease of storage and delivery and environmentally benign reduction products i e manganese dioxide mno2 li et al 2021 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 nevertheless mn vii is a mild and selective oxidant which prefers to react with contaminants containing electron rich moieties e g phenols anilines olefins and thiols but exhibits low reactivity toward some recalcitrant organics hu et al 2010 2011 jiang et al 2009 2012 therefore effective strategies are needed to improve mn vii oxidation capacity for eliminating a wider range of organic contaminants in water among the currently studied methods for mn vii activation the combined application of mn vii and bisulfite hso3 so3 2 a widely used reducing agent has attracted the most attention since it was first reported in 2015 sun et al 2015 the mn vii bisulfite system shows extremely high reactivity toward many organic contaminants even including some pollutants resistant to mn vii e g benzene nitrobenzene nb and caffeine which thus has been developed as a novel advanced oxidation technology in water treatment chen et al 2020 gao et al 2019 sun et al 2015 2016 however disputes over the predominant reactive species involved in the mn vii bisulfite system remain for a long period due to the fairly complex chemistry of manganese and sulfur recently we have published a review article to summarize the theoretical development of the mn vii bisulfite system and to clarify the roles of various reactive species guan et al 2022 in general both reactive manganese species rmns i e soluble mn iii mn v and mn vi and radical species primarily sulfate radicals so4 are generated during reaction of mn vii with bisulfite which are much more reactive compared to mn vii and thus considerably accelerate the degradation of organic pollutants bisulfite plays a dual role of being an activating agent for reactive intermediates formation and acting as a complexing agent to stabilize rmns the formation of rmns and radicals as well as their relative contributions are highly dependent on solution chemistry e g the mn vii bisulfite molar ratio solution ph the type of contaminants and water matrix components which thus influences the degradation kinetics and pathways of organics for instance the mn vii bisulfite system destructs contaminants more rapidly under acidic and neutral conditions than that under alkaline condition moreover dissolved oxygen do plays a key role in organics degradation because it greatly impacts the evolution of reactive oxysulfur radicals as well as their subsequent reaction with rmns on the whole the mn vii bisulfite system can be a promising strategy for treatment of organic contaminants in water and wastewater especially slightly acid industrial sewage in addition to the activation by bisulfite other methods such as photoactivation guo et al 2018 wei et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a electrical activation zhu et al 2019a 2019c the use of redox mediators shi et al 2020 song et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b and carbonaceous materials peng et al 2021 tian et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 have also been investigated to enhance the removal of emerging contaminants during mn vii oxidation these methods show good activation efficiencies for mn vii but the reaction mechanisms and dominant reactive species involved in these activated mn vii oxidation systems are quite different in addition there are some controversial observations and interpretations around these systems which causes serious confusion in the mechanistic understanding of mn vii activation and also impedes the scientific progress of these technologies toward practical application therefore it is important to clearly understand the chemistry behind mn vii activation with various methods and to further assess the roles of various reactive species this article aims to provide a systematic overview of the recently published studies on methods for enhancing mn vii oxidation toward organic contaminants in aqueous environments excluding the case with bisulfite this work is a continuation of our previous review and will further improve the knowledge of mn vii based oxidation technologies various activation methods for mn vii are summarized and the underlying mechanisms are elaborated disputes over the generation of main reactive species and their roles in organics oxidation are discussed kinetics information regarding contaminants oxidation is presented along with a discussion on some critical influencing factors furthermore the potential of these activated mn vii oxidation processes for practical implementation in water treatment is analyzed and future research needs are proposed to address the application challenges 2 activation methods of mn vii 2 1 photoactivation 2 1 1 mechanism ultraviolet uv irradiation as a clean approach is widely applied for disinfection and oxidation in water and wastewater treatment pereira et al 2007 it is also used in combination with various oxidants e g persulfates hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and chlorine to improve their decontamination performance via generating highly reactive radicals such as so4 hydroxyl radical oh and reactive chlorine species e g cl cl2 and clo gao et al 2012 he et al 2013 jin et al 2011 wu et al 2016 recently guo and his co workers innovatively proposed the uv mn vii combined process as a promising technology for abatement of organic contaminants in water treatment guo et al 2018 their study displayed that the uv irradiation of mn vii at 254 nm resulted in fast degradation of many organic compounds e g nb benzoic acid ba terephthalic acid tpa p chlorobenzoic acid pcba nalidixic acid and gemfibrozil which were resistant to mn vii oxidation and partially decomposed by uv photolysis the presence of tert butanol tba a common scavenger of oh showed different degrees of inhibitory effect on degradation of these compounds by uv mn vii process electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy was used to directly determine the formation of oh and the observation of a typical 1 2 2 1 quartet signal of the adduct of oh with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo further confirmed the existence of oh noticeably tba did not completely terminate the oxidation of organic compounds especially the degradation rate of nalidixic acid was decreased by only 0 8 in the presence of 2 mm tba this indicated the involvement of other reactive species i e reactive manganese intermediates after excluding the possible contribution of mn vi mn iv and mn iii the authors suggested that mn v species in the form of metastable mn v peroxo complex mno2 η2 o2 might be formed contributing together with oh to the fast oxidation of organic compounds this was consistent with the previous studies on photochemistry of mn vii hu et al 2016 thornley and bitterwolf 2015 zimmerman 1955 it was demonstrated that uv photolysis of mn vii could lead to the generation of an excited state mno2 η2 o2 which either reverted to the parent mn vii or quickly converted to mn v peroxo complex mno2 η2 o2 via o o formation from two mn o bonds of mn vii eqs 1 2 crandell et al 2017 lee et al 1987 thornley and bitterwolf 2015 the resulting mno2 η2 o2 underwent further decomposition to form mno2 mn iii and o2 or mno2 and oh as depicted by eqs 3 4 ye et al 2021 also reported that the good degradation performance of ba in uv mn vii process was due to the involvement of oh and mn v species and they further explored how oh was generated during photolysis of mn vii their results displayed that the presence of 4 hydroxytetramethyl piperidine 1 oxyl tempol a scavenger of superoxide radical o2 had a comparable inhibitory effect 28 7 to that of tba 25 9 revealing that oh might arise from o2 conversion in addition the esr spectra exhibited a 14 line spin signal corresponding to an adduct of dmpo with o2 along with the signal of dmpo oh adduct based on these the authors speculated that o2 was generated from decomposition of mno2 η2 o2 eq 5 and acted as the precursor of oh eqs 6 7 however the contribution of o2 itself to ba degradation was very minor given its low reactivity toward ba 1 m n o 4 h v m n o 2 η 2 o 2 2 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 3 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 hv m n o 2 o h 4 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 h v m n o 2 o 2 5 m n o 2 η 2 o 2 h v m n o 2 o 2 6 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h it is well known that mn v is highly unstable and its spontaneous disproportionation results in its unlikely contribution to oxidation of contaminants unless under certain conditions e g in extremely acid solution or with specific complexing ligand song et al 2017 for instance gao et al 2019 proposed that in mn vii bisulfite system bisulfite served as a complexing ligand for mn v stabilization in addition to a reducing agent for mn v generation and thus the stabilized mn v species could contribute to the oxidation of organic substrate methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso at different solution ph recently some researchers reported that mn ii chelated by ligands e g ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and nitrilotriacetate nta could trigger the fast degradation of contaminants by peroxymonosulfate pms gao et al 2021 yu et al 2020 and periodate pi yu et al 2022 this was attributed to the generation of complexed mn v from mn ii complex oxidation where mn iii complex was verified as the requisite intermediate however mn ii without these ligands was inefficient for pms or pi activation due to the absence of stabilizing agents for rmns as for the uv mn vii process the mn v peroxo complex mno2 η2 o2 may be stabilized due to the formation of o o from two mn o bonds of mn vii fig 1 resulting in its stabilization with a long lifetime enough for reacting with organics guo et al 2022a further investigated the role of oh and various rmns i e mn iii mn iv and mn v in degradation of 26 structurally diverse micropollutants by uv mn vii process tba was used to distinguish the relative contribution of oh and rmns to micropollutants oxidation because tba could fast scavenge oh while it was resistant to rmns most micropollutants degradation was inhibited significantly with the exception of flumequine naproxen and nalidixic acid which shared similar structures of quinoline naphthalene with carboxylic groups this indicated that oh was highly reactive toward all micropollutants while mn v was selective toward aromatics containing carboxylic groups moreover mno2 was identified as the final product in uv mn vii process and mn iii was an intermediate that was unstable against disproportionation to mno2 and mn2 simultaneously both mn iii and mno2 were not important for micropollutants oxidation under neutral conditions while under acidic conditions in situ formed mno2 contributed to the abatement of phenolics anilines and propranolol as a catalyst of mn vii in other words the catalyzing effect of mno2 is highly related to the type of target pollutants and solution conditions zhang et al 2021a and yang et al 2021 investigated the oxidation efficiency and mechanism of organic pollutants by mn vii under visible light vl and simulated solar ss irradiation respectively interestingly different reactive species were identified in vl mn vii and ss mn vii processes from uv mn vii process it was reported that o2 and mn iii species were generated as the primary oxidants in vl mn vii process whereas ss irradiation of mn vii induced the rapid formation of rmns mainly mn iii and mn v without radicals the mechanistic discrepancy among these photo activated mn vii processes might be related to different experimental conditions such as the excitation wavelength and light intensity the detailed reaction conditions used for organics oxidation in various photo activated mn vii processes were summarized and compared in table 1 zimmerman 1955 previously reported that the quantum yield for the photodecomposition of aqueous mn vii increased monotonically from 10 5 to 0 05 with decreasing the wavelength from vl 579 nm to uv 254 nm this suggested that there was a higher probability of mn vii dissociation at shorter wavelengths probably because the molecule had available more energy and a longer time interval for dissociation so the change of wavelength would influence the formation of metastable intermediate mno2 η2 o2 as well as its subsequent transformation into other reactive species or back to the parent mn vii moreover haggag et al 2020 demonstrated that tuning excitation from vl to uv showed increasing formation of the metastable intermediate which had a longer lifetime 1 ns than that observed in vl condition in addition light intensity that determines the energy input may also be an important influencing factor on the photodecomposition of mn vii nevertheless studies on the mechanistic difference of mn vii photoactivation under different conditions are very scarce which points out a key direction of future research the main discrepancy of reactive species generated in these photo activated mn vii processes lies in the role of radicals oh and o2 and mn iii which will be discussed separately as follows on the one hand it was interestingly found that ba that was a probe compound for oh was resistant to ss mn vii oxidation whereas the uv mn vii process caused fast decomposition of ba in the light of tba quenching experiments the degradation of target compounds was negligibly influenced by tba in ss mn vii process and was slightly enhanced by tba in vl mn vii process in contrast to the marked inhibitory effect observed in uv mn vii process these discrepancies revealed that oh played distinctly different roles in these processes in addition benzoquinone bq used as the scavenger of o2 sharply hindered the degradation of sulfamethazine smt in vl mn vii process and esr analysis with dmpo confirmed the formation of o2 accordingly o2 was suggested as the primary reactive oxygen radical generated in vl mn vii process on the other hand for the identification of mn iii species in photo activated mn vii processes two main methods were employed including i examining the effect of pyrophosphate pp a commonly used ligand on organics degradation since pp could compete with target compounds to form the mn iii pp complex and it had a lower reactivity toward contaminants oxidation compared to soluble free mn iii not complexing with ligands but h2o or oh and ii detection of the characteristic peak of mn iii at 258 nm in the presence of pp by uv visible spectrophotometer it was noted that pp showed different influences on organics transformation in different photo activated mn vii processes in uv mn vii process the degradation of nb and ba was hardly impacted by the presence of pp and the featured peak of mn iii was not recorded this indicated the negligible role of mn iii in organics degradation as for vl mn vii process pp exerted a significant inhibitory effect on smt oxidation meanwhile the characteristic peak of mn iii at 258 nm was observed in uv visible spectra so zhang et al 2021a suggested that mn iii played an important role in vl mn vii process similarly based on the uv visible observation and the inhibitory effect of pp on 4 cholorphenol 4cp degradation yang et al 2021 proposed that mn iii was generated in ss mn vii system and involved in organics oxidation interestingly they did not observe the pp induced inhibition in the case of p hydroxybenzoic acid phba or enrofloxacin enr oxidation this was explained by the reason that pp stabilized mn v and thereby increased mn v exposure the resulting mn v pp complex was more reactive than mn iii pp complex thus mitigating the decreased reactivity of mn iii hence both mn iii and mn v species contributed to organics degradation by ss mn vii process the generation of mn v was further verified by using pmso as a probe since pmso could be oxidized by high valent metal oxo e g mn oxo and fe oxo species to produce the corresponding sulfones i e methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via an oxygen atom transfer pathway chellamani et al 1999 ka et al 2016 pestovsky and bakac 2006 this was substantially different from the radical dominating oxidation where polymeric and or hydroxylated products were produced from pmso transformation wang et al 2018 moreover mn iii showed sluggish reactivity toward pmso gao et al 2019 thus the complete conversion from pmso to pmso2 observed in ss mn vii process confirmed the involvement of mn v and also ruled out the contribution of radical species notably like mn v soluble free mn iii undergoes the spontaneous disproportionation resulting in its unlikely contribution to the oxidation of contaminants unless in the presence of stabilizing agents or under extremely acidic conditions davies 1969 gao et al 2017 klewicki and morgan 1998 in these photo activated mn vii processes mn v exists in the form of the peroxo complex mno2 η2 o2 as discussed above but mn iii seems not to be stabilized due to the absence of complexing agents since mn iii is one of the photolysis products of mn vii eq 4 it is not surprising to observe the absorbance peak of mn iii when pp is present to stabilize mn iii however in the absence of pp mn iii is rapidly transformed into other valent mn species e g mn ii and mn iv rather than stable existence to react with organics so the uv visible spectrophotometer method may be unable to confirm the involvement of mn iii in organics oxidation in photo activated mn vii processes in addition the inhibitory effect of pp may be related to its competition with the target compounds for mn v therefore evidence for the contribution of mn iii to pollutants oxidation by photo activated mn vii processes may be not convincing and further verification is needed except organic pollutants the uv mn vii process was also demonstrated to have a good performance in removing organic heavy metals from water wei et al 2021 reported that the organoarsenic compound roxarsone was first destabilized to release heavy metal ions via oxidation by reactive species i e oh and mn v and then the released ions were simultaneously removed via adsorption by mno2 in situ formed in uv mn vii process the possibility of mno2 acting as an co oxidant or catalyst photocatalyst to enhance roxarsone oxidation was excluded based on the negligible degradation of roxarsone by mno2 alone and mno2 mn vii at ph 3 0 9 0 as well as by uv mno2 at ph 7 0 2 1 2 influencing factors varying solution conditions could alter the quantum yield of radicals as well as the reactivity of various oxidizing species thus influencing the degradation efficiency of pollutants in photo activated mn vii processes in uv mn vii process a gradual downward trend of organics oxidation rate with ph increasing was observed guo et al 2018 ye et al 2021 it was reported that with the increase of ph from 4 0 to 9 0 the quantum yield of oh was decreased by 50 in uv mn vii process probably due to the involvement of h in formation of oh guo et al 2018 note that the molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm ε254 of mn vii was stable with an increase of ph the redox potential of mn vii under acidic conditions 1 51 v eq 8 is higher than that under neutral conditions 0 58 v eq 9 and alkaline conditions 0 56 v eq 10 hu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a also rmns had higher oxidation abilities at acidic ph yang et al 2021 all these aspects accounted for the decrease of organics degradation efficiency at higher ph the similar ph dependency was obtained during organics oxidation by vl mn vii process zhang et al 2021a interestingly the effect of ph on the ss mn vii process where oh was not involved and only rmns existed as the reactive oxidant was variable with the target contaminant yang et al 2021 with the increase of ph from 4 0 to 9 0 the removal efficiency of 4cp gradually rose from 37 1 to 95 8 while both efficiencies of phba and enr degradation decreased significantly on the one hand the increase of solution ph stimulated the dissociation of organics and the dissociated compounds had higher electron densities and thus were more susceptible to oxidation than the nondissociated ones on the other hand the reactivity of mn vii mn iii and mn v was higher at acidic condition than that at alkaline condition leading to favorable degradation of organics in the former case thus the counterbalance of two opposite effects resulted in the observed different ph influences on different organics degradation in ss mn vii process 8 m n o 4 8 h 5 e m n 2 4 h 2 o 9 m n o 4 2 h 2 o 3 e m n o 2 4 o h 10 m n o 4 e m n o 4 2 raising mn vii dosage resulted in the increase of organics oxidation rates in uv mn vii vl mn vii and ss mn vii processes guo et al 2018 yang et al 2021 ye et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a this could be explained by the fact that higher mn vii dosages could speed up the formation of reactive oxidizing species thus leading to a higher degradation efficiency of pollutants guo et al 2018 found that the quantum yield of oh decreased by 42 8 with an increase of mn vii dosage from 20 to 100 μm mainly due to the stronger filter effect of uv light at higher mn vii dosages in addition excess oxidant could cause an unnecessary consumption of mn vii and also induced chromaticity in the treated water so a moderate mn vii dosage may be suitable for application of photo activated mn vii processes in water decontamination inorganic anions such as so4 2 cl and no3 exerted negligible effects on organics abatement in photo activated mn vii processes while organics degradation rates were differently impacted by the presence of hco3 for instance guo et al 2022a reported that the degradation rates of half of their investigated 26 micropollutants were suppressed in the presence of hco3 while those of the others containing anilines e g trimethoprim sulfamerazine and diclofenac naphthalene rings e g propranolol and naproxen and phenolics e g bisphenol and salbutamol were enhanced by hco3 in uv mn vii process the negative effect of hco3 was also observed in vl mn vii process for smt oxidation zhang et al 2021a in contrast the addition of hco3 led to an enhanced abatement of 4cp and phba in ss mn vii process yang et al 2021 the effects of hco3 might be attributed to the following aspects that i hco3 scavenged oh to produce co3 that had different reactivity toward structurally diverse micropollutants ii hco3 induced the increase of solution ph value due to its buffering capacity which thus influenced the generation of reactive species and their reaction with organics and iii hco3 as a ligand stabilized rmns and prevented their disproportionation which increased the exposure of rmns to react with target compounds luo et al 2019 reported an enhancing effect of hco3 on pollutants oxidation by ferrate feo4 2 fe vi where the stabilization of reactive high valent iron intermediates by hco3 was suggested as a main reason effects of natural organic matter nom on photo activated mn vii processes were associated with the concentration of nom and type of target contaminants for instance guo et al 2022a found that the degradation rates of flumequine naproxen and nalidixic acid by uv mn vii process were decreased by 37 5 77 7 due to the presence of 1 mg l nom while those of propranolol and phenolics were increased significantly the substrate dependent influence of nom was also reported in ss mn vii oxidation yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a suggested that nom at a low concentration level e g 5 mg l showed a minor effect on smt oxidation by vl mn vii process and higher levels of nom e g 5 10 mg l resulted in the inhibition of smt abatement on the one hand the electron donating moieties of nom could compete with target compounds to consume reactive species i e radicals and rmns besides the competitive absorption of light between nom vs mn vii could weaken the photolysis of mn vii to reduce the formation of reactive species the two aspects were responsible for the negative effect of nom on the other hand nom enhanced the generation of rmns from mn vii due to its reducibility and meanwhile might stabilize rmns through forming the rmns nom complexes this increased the exposure of rmns for reacting with target contaminants and thus enhanced their removal notably effects of metal ions that are ubiquitous background matrices in environmental water are lacking in existing research which should be supplemented in future work moreover the photo activated mn vii processes were verified to be very effective in degrading organic contaminants in various real waters e g groundwater surface water and secondary effluent of wastewater although the treatment efficiency was slightly lower than that in ultrapure water due to the presence of competing constituents yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a wei et al 2021 calculated the electrical energy per order ee o for 90 roxarsone removal by uv mn vii process at ph 7 0 and 100 μm mn vii dosage 2 676 kw h m 3 which was comparable to that obtained by uv h2o2 process 0 048 4 53 kw h m 3 similarly guo et al 2022a suggested that the ee o for 90 transformation of 26 micropollutants by uv mn vii process in the presence of 1 mg l nom varied in the range of 0 23 3 11 kw h m 3 close to the ee o obtained in uv h2o2 process in the range of 0 17 2 38 kw h m 3 however ye et al 2021 reported that the ee o value for 90 ba removal by uv mn vii process was 6 96 kw h m 3 around 10 times higher than that of uv h2o2 process 0 67 kw h m 3 based on the above findings the uv mn vii process that involves both selective rmns and non selective oh is more advantageous in treating complicated waters as compared to ss mn vii and vl mn vii processes which just generate relatively mild oxidants the uv mn vii and vl mn vii processes destruct contaminants more effectively under acidic conditions while the ss mn vii process may be a alternative for removing certain contaminants in neutral and alkaline solutions the dosage of mn vii applied in photoactivation should be preliminarily determined according to the actual situation of sewage e g the type and concentration of contaminants and water matrix components the light intensity is also a key parameter influencing the efficiency of photochemical reaction although its effects are not examined in current studies which should be carefully considered the selection of mn vii dosage and light intensity directly influence the treatment efficiency and economic cost so the tradeoff between the two should be made in practical application of photo activated mn vii processes 2 2 electrical activation 2 2 1 mechanism electrochemical technologies have attracted growing interests in water treatment owing to their high reliability easy operation and good adaptability the combination of electrolysis with chemical oxidants such as chlorine cho et al 2014 persulfates liu et al 2018 zhi et al 2020 and ozone zhang et al 2016 is demonstrated to be quite effective in destruction of organic contaminants through the formation of various reactive species e g oh so4 and free chlorine oxidants recently zhu and his co workers reported that the combination of electrolysis and mn vii e mn vii process showed a synergetic effect on organics degradation zhu et al 2019a c particularly the addition of mn2 or using activated carbon fiber acf instead of pt electrode at the cathode further enhanced the kinetics of organics oxidation during the electrochemical activation of mn vii in the presence of mn2 e mn vii mn2 process the degradation of target compound diclofenac dcf was negligibly impacted by radical scavengers i e tba and methanol meoh this result indicated that neither oh nor so4 were generated during electrolysis of mn vii and thus nonradical oxidizing agents such as rmns were proposed to be responsible for enhanced degradation of dcf no characteristic absorbance peaks of mn vi and mn v at wavelengths of 610 and 660 nm respectively were recorded on the uv visible spectra of the e mn vii mn2 process while the absorbance peak at 258 nm corresponding to the formation of mn iii pp was very obvious in the presence of pp in addition the abatement of dcf was decreased significantly due to the addition of pp this was attributed to the reason that the complexation of mn iii with pp outstripped its reaction with dcf and the resulting mn iii pp complex had lower reactivity compared to soluble free mn iii accordingly the authors suggested that mn iii was the primary oxidizing species for fast oxidation of organics in e mn vii process which was mainly produced on cathode rather than in aqueous solution or on anode mn2 considerably promoted the generation of mn iii because mn2 not only acted as a promoter for mn iii eq 11 but also as a stabilizer of mn iii by inhibiting its disproportionation eq 12 when the electrochemical activation of mn vii was performed with an acf cathode e acf mn vii process acf as a reductant reacted with mn vii to produce mn2 first which exerted an activating effect for mn iii generation 11 3 m n 2 2 m n o 4 16 h 5 e 5 m n i i i 8 h 2 o 12 2 m n 3 2 h 2 o m n o 2 m n 2 4 h e 0 0 53 v moreover wang et al 2021a used microbial fuel cells that could turn chemical energy into electrical energy bio electricity via the metabolism of microorganisms in an anode chamber to activate mn vii mfc mn vii process for degradation of dcf in urine therein multiple rmns including mn iii mn v and mn vi were proposed as the reactive species responsible for dcf degradation based on the density functional theory dft calculation and several experimental evidences one important piece of evidence for mn v and mn vi was that pmso was transformed into pmso2 with a yield approaching 100 in mfc mn vii process the authors held that the conversion of pmso2 from pmso could only be achieved by mn vi and mn v but not by other oxidants in mfc mn vii process however this was in contrast to the acknowledged fact that sulfoxide compounds e g pmso and methyl p tolyl sulfone tmso had a high reactivity toward mn vii and corresponding sulfone products e g pmso2 and methyl p methyl sulfone tmso2 were generated via oxygen transfer pathway for instance yang et al 2021 observed the 100 conversion from pmso to pmso2 during mn vii alone oxidation for the identification of mn iii the pp induced inhibition of dcf degradation and the observation of mn iii pp absorbance peak were used as the main evidence in above e mn vii processes it is consistently agreed that rmns are the dominant oxidizing agents for effective degradation of organics however one question worth considering is how rmns are stabilized against their spontaneous disproportionation in the absence of complexing agents on the other hand the vital role of mno2 that is a stable product in situ generated from mn vii reduction in e mn vii processes has been ignored in these studies mainly because the combination of electrolysis with mno2 e mno2 process resulted in significantly lower degradation rate of organics as compared to that of e mn vii process however this result only ruled out the role of mno2 as an oxidant while the possibility of mno2 serving as a catalyst for mn vii was not verified jiang et al 2015 2009 have done a great quantity of work to explore the reason for the enhancing effect of mno2 on mn vii oxidation and they concluded that mno2 might not serve as a co oxidant but as an important catalyst to facilitate the removal of organic pollutants regardless of their susceptibility to oxidation by mno2 recently zhu et al 2022 reported that the combination of e mn vii and peroxydisulfate pds e mn vii pds process led to a significant synergy in the degradation of organic contaminants in their study the generation of amorphous mno2 from mn vii reduction was confirmed by means of various characterizations e g fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and x ray diffraction xrd mechanism studies suggested that in situ generated amorphous mno2 bound with pds via the surface oh groups to form reactive pds mno2 complexes which then activated pds to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 and also oxidized organics through direct electron transfer in turn pds could promote the valence state transformation of mn thereby facilitating the formation of mno2 song et al 2021 also demonstrated that mno2 was in situ generated in e mn vii process with low additive ozone and it played an important role in promoting the formation of reactive species through heterogeneous catalysis of ozone and or mn vii in addition it was noted that acidic conditions were more conducive to organics degradation in e mn vii processes in accordance with the fact that the catalytic activity of mno2 strengthened significantly at lower ph from these respects it seems likely that the applied electric field enhances mn vii reduction to mno2 which catalyzes the degradation of organic pollutants by mn vii in a word the mechanism involved in enhanced organics degradation by e mn vii processes is still not completely clear and further investigations are needed for identifying the role of various manganese intermediates especially mno2 2 2 2 influencing factors as mentioned above a lower ph value was favorable for organics degradation in e mn vii processes for instance the reaction rate of dcf in e mn vii mn2 process decreased approximately 120 fold with the initial ph increasing from 3 0 to 11 0 zhu et al 2019a and the rate obtained in e acf mn vii process decreased about 50 fold as ph increased from 3 0 to 10 0 zhu et al 2019c this might be associated with the decrease of mn vii oxidation potential with increasing ph eqs 8 10 resulting in slower formation of reactive manganese intermediates in addition wang et al 2021a suggested that in mfc mn vii process the cathodic potential and current density decreased with increasing ph which also affected the removal of dcf the degradation of dcf was enhanced at higher mn vii concentrations and stronger current densities probably due to the accelerated decomposition of mn vii to form reactive manganese intermediates wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2019a c common water matrices showed different effects on dcf degradation in e mn vii processes the presence of inorganic anions such as h2po4 hco3 no3 and a lower concentration of cl inhibited the degradation of dcf while humic acid ha a principal component of nom and a higher concentration of cl exhibited a promoting effect on dcf abatement zhu et al 2019a c the complicated influences of nom on mn vii based oxidation processes have been elaborated in section 2 1 2 which are not repeatedly discussed herein the inhibitory effect caused by inorganic anions might be due to their competition with mn vii for electrons on the cathode as exemplified by no3 eqs 13 14 which resulted in the reduction of manganese intermediates formation wang et al 2021a in addition the presence of h2po4 or hco3 raised solution ph during reaction due to its buffering effect which was not favorable for dcf removal however cl at a higher concentration might react with reactive species in e mn vii processes to form reactive chlorine radicals e g cl and cl2 which were likely to participate in transformation of dcf furthermore the degradation efficiency of dcf by e mn vii processes in real waters e g tap water and surface water was close to that in ultrapure water primarily attributed to the complex influences of different water matrices wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2019a c 13 n o 3 2 h 2 e n o 2 h 2 o 14 n o 2 3 h 3 e o h h 2 o 0 5 n 2 2 3 activation by redox mediators redox mediators first described by bourbonnais and paice 1990 allow laccases to oxidize nonphenolic compounds thereby immensely expanding the range of substrates that can be degraded by these enzymes redox mediators are the compounds that quicken the reaction rate by shuttling electrons from the biological oxidation of primary electron donors or from bulk electron donors to the electron acceptors husain and husain 2007 the application of redox mediators in enzymatic catalysis has been widely investigated and well reviewed in previous literature husain and husain 2007 morozova et al 2007 strong and claus 2011 interestingly several recent studies report that redox mediators can also act as the catalyst of mn vii to enhance the oxidation of organic pollutants shi et al 2020 song et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b this enhancing effect is similar to that of enzymatic catalysis mechanism where the redox mediators are converted to active intermediates that are capable of degrading organic compounds more readily it is noted that the mechanism of redox mediators triggered mn vii activation is rather different from other mn vii activation processes since the intermediates derived from redox mediators rather than rmns are predominant oxidizing species for organics the currently reported redox mediators that are effective for mn vii activation include both natural e g syringaldehyde syd vanillin van 4 hydroxycoumarin 4hc and p coumaric acid pca and synthetic compounds e g 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts 1 hydroxybenzotriazole hbt n hydroxyphthalimide hpi violuric acid vla and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempo the detailed reactions between these redox mediators with mn vii as well as the enhanced efficiency of contaminants removal are discussed below reaction scheme of mn vii redox mediator systems for abatement of organic pollutants is illustrated in fig 2 2 3 1 abts song et al 2015 first found that abts could greatly accelerate the oxidation of substituted phenols by mn vii over a wide ph range 5 0 9 0 this was attributed to the fact that abts was rapidly oxidized by mn vii into a stable radical cation i e abts which had a higher reactivity toward substituted phenols than mn vii with the rapid oxidation of organics abts was simultaneously reduced back to abts thus the cycling of abts and abts pair played a vital catalytic role in enhanced organics degradation by mn vii as a mild oxidant analogous to mn vii fe vi reacted with abts via a similar pathway to generate abts so the enhancing effect of abts on contaminants abatement by fe vi was also observed dong et al 2017 degradation kinetics of substituted phenols in mn vii abts system were significantly influenced by solution parameters for instance the pseudo first order rate constant kobs for the reaction of phenol with mn vii abts system increased from 0 0077 to 0 1696 min 1 22 times with increasing abts concentration from 0 to 3 μm at ph 5 this was due to the accelerated formation of abts at higher abts levels in addition the enhancing effect of abts weakened with solution ph increasing the reaction rate of phenol just increased about twice as abts concentration increased from 0 to 3 μm at ph 8 or 9 at alkaline ph the higher reaction rate of abts with phenol than that of abts with mn vii resulted in a high ratio of unreacted abts abtsu to abts it was demonstrated that abtsu could retard the reaction of abts with phenol due to its competition for abts via a fast inner electron exchange process 4 1 107 m 1 s 1 scott et al 1993 2 3 2 hbt shi et al 2020 reported that a series of natural e g syd van 4hc and pca and synthetic e g hbt hpi and vla redox mediators were capable of accelerating mn vii reaction with bisphenol a bpa in general the synthetic redox mediators containing n oh groups exhibited a greater enhancement on bpa degradation than natural redox mediators among them the largest enhancing effects were observed for hbt which was also effective for catalytic oxidation of a broad spectrum of organic pollutants e g bisphenol af bpaf sulfamethoxazole smx estrone and butylparaben bp the authors suggested that benzotriazole nitroxyl radicals hbt are generated from one electron transfer reaction between hbt and mn vii acting as the reactive species for enhanced degradation of pollutants evidence for the in situ formation of hbt mainly included that i butylated hydroxytoluene used as a scavenger for hbt had an inhibitory effect on bpa oxidation and ii 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr spectra for the mixture of hbt mn vii and 5 diisopropoxy phosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo used as the trapping agent showed significant signal peaks of the hbt dippmpo adduct directly confirming the occurrence of hbt moreover the possible involvement of high valent manganese intermediates e g mn v and mn vi in mn vii hbt oxidation system was ruled out based on the observation that the degradation rate of pmso was increased in mn vii hbt system as compared to that by mn vii alone oxidation but the yield of pmso2 decreased meanwhile a new transformation product of pmso was detected indicating the involvement of other reactive species rather than rmns higher hbt concentrations were conducive to organic pollutants removal in mn vii hbt system due to higher amounts of reactive intermediates generation however excessive hbt could not further increase the removal rate of pollutants probably because the production of excessive reactive intermediates stimulated their self quenching and thus reduced the accessibility of organics to reactive intermediates the enhancing effect of hbt dropped largely with increasing ph from 4 0 to 7 0 becoming negligible at ph 8 0 and 9 0 at lower ph mn vii with a higher redox potential transformed hbt into its reactive intermediate faster thus causing a greater degradation of organics the presence of either inorganic anions cl no3 co3 2 and so4 2 or metal ions ca2 mg2 fe3 and cu2 had an ignorable influence on the oxidation performance of mn vii hbt system lower concentrations of ha 1 10 mgc l promoted the degradation of organic substrates bpa and bpaf by mn vii hbt system meanwhile the presence of ha accelerated the transformation of hbt by mn vii two possible reasons were given to explain the effect of ha firstly rmns formation was promoted by ha which then was stabilized by ha through forming the rmns nom complexes as discussed in section 2 1 2 otherwise they could not exist stably in mn vii hbt system they played a critical role in both degrading organics and accelerating the conversion of hbt to hbt secondly the abundant phenolic moieties in ha molecules might work as the redox mediators to react with mn vii forming ha associated radicals which was reported to accelerate the degradation of substrates in enzymatic systems considering the complex properties of ha further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism for ha promoting organics transformation by mn vii hbt system and other mn vii redox mediator systems furthermore the mn vii hbt system showed an excellent decontamination efficiency in natural water matrices e g river water or wastewater treatment plant effluent even higher than that in deionized water 2 3 3 tempo similar to abts and hbt tempo was also an effective redox mediator for enhancing mn vii oxidation toward many contaminants and the mn vii tempo system exhibited a high reactivity over a wide ph range of 4 0 11 0 zhang et al 2021b explored the reaction mechanism of mn vii tempo system and proposed that tempo was oxidized preferentially by mn vii through one electron transfer route with formation of tempo the oxoammonium cation of tempo which then reacted with organics rapidly with itself being reduced to tempo or tempoh tempo hydroxylamine the subsequent oxidation of tempoh led to the re generation of tempo which completed a cycle the degradation kinetics of bpa by mn vii tempo system kept almost unchanged in three continuous runs where bpa and mn vii were re dosed after complete removal of bpa to keep their concentrations the same in each run but tempo was not supplemented this result proved the cycle of tempo and tempo in mn vii tempo system with little loss of tempo which played a critical role in enhanced pollutants degradation the oxidizing role of tempo was also verified by using a commercial salt of tempo 4 acetylamino tempo bf4 containing the same strong oxidizing moiety of n o as tempo which could degrade bpa at a high rate comparable to that observed in mn vii tempo system moreover it was interestingly found that the addition of tempo inhibited the oxidation of pmso by mn vii and concomitant pmso2 formation primarily because tempo was not reactive toward pmso and tempo only acted as a competitor for mn vii with pmso to lower the degradation of pmso this result indicated the selectivity of tempo toward organics and also excluded the possible involvement of rmns which were highly reactive toward pmso it was noted that the degradation of pmso by mn vii was enhanced in the presence of hbt shi et al 2020 differing from the case of tempo more recently these authors further investigated the abatement of organic contaminants by mn vii in the presence of tempo or its para substituted analogues i e 4 oxo tempo 4 hydroxyl tempo 4 acetylamino tempo 4 amino tempo and 4 carboxyl tempo zhang et al 2022a it was found that the presence of substituents at para to the n o moiety greatly influenced the degradation kinetics of organics by changing the reduction potentials of tempos and thus impacting the generation of their corresponding oxoammonium cations tempos which were the dominant oxidizing species in addition to tempos mn vii per se made great contributions to organics abatement especially under alkaline conditions e g ph 9 0 and in situ formed mno2 also played a role under acidic conditions e g ph 4 0 and 5 0 their relative contributions to bpa degradation in mn vii tempos systems were quantified based on a simplistic kinetic model the degradation rate of organics increased with the increase of tempo concentration but further raising tempo dosage led to a plateau probably due to the self quenching of excessive reactive intermediates in contrast to the low enhancing effect of abts and hbt at alkaline ph tempo was still effective for promoting mn vii oxidation at solution ph up to 11 the kobs for bpa degradation increased with increasing ph in mn vii tempo system in addition different organic contaminants e g bpa phenol aniline sulfisoxazole and phenylbutazone oxidation by mn vii 4 acetylamino tempo system showed different ph dependency probably due to the comprehensive effect of multiple factors including organic contaminant speciation the change of mn vii reduction potential ph dependent contribution of mno2 the discrepancies among these mn vii redox mediator systems suggested that their respective reactive intermediates had significantly different oxidation properties e g ph dependent reactivity and substrate selectivity common anions in water matrices e g co3 2 cl so4 2 and no3 and metal ions e g ca2 mg2 and cu2 slightly influenced the removal of bpa in mn vii tempo system consistent with the finding obtained in mn vii hbt system effect of ha on the mn vii tempo system was dependent on solution ph for instance the abatement of bpa in mn vii tempo system was greatly sped up at ph 5 0 but was inhibited at ph 8 0 due to the presence of ha 0 4 10 0 mgc l zhang et al 2021b attributed this to the reason that the addition of ha facilitated the formation of mno2 via mn vii reduction which served as a co oxidant or catalyst to promote mn vii oxidation toward contaminants at acidic conditions but was relatively ineffective at alkaline conditions the formation of mno2 along with mn vii decomposition during bpa oxidation in mn vii tempo system was confirmed using uv visible spectrophotometer nevertheless other possible roles of ha in mn vii tempo system should be explored as mentioned in section 2 3 2 like mn vii hbt system mn vii tempo system showed an excellent decontamination performance in real waters where the removal of bpa was slightly higher or comparable to that in pure water these indicate that mn vii redox mediator systems have a good potential for eliminating emerging pollutants in natural and complex environmental matrices 2 4 activation by carbonaceous materials in recent decades carbonaceous materials such as graphite graphene oxide biochar and carbon nanotubes cnts have gained increasing attention as promising candidates for heterogeneous catalysis in water treatment and environmental remediation owing to their green metal free nature abundance on the earth as well as their excellent properties e g large specific surface areas ultrahigh pore volumes unique electrical features chemical and thermal stability chen et al 2018 oh et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 a large number of investigations have been carried out on carbon triggered activation of persulfates for oxidation of recalcitrant organics inspired by these a few researchers have recently examined the feasibility of using carbonaceous materials to activate mn vii for removing organic contaminants in water it is demonstrated that many carbonaceous materials such as biochar tian et al 2019 graphite peng et al 2021 cnts wang et al 2021b zhao et al 2016 and reduced graphene oxide rgo zhang et al 2022b can effectively improve the oxidation ability of mn vii however different reaction mechanisms involved in mn vii carbonaceous materials systems have been proposed strongly depending on the applied carbonaceous materials 2 4 1 cnts zhao et al 2016 first reported the catalytic effect of carbonaceous materials on mn vii by using cnts they found that the addition of cnts resulted in a significant enhancement of phenols and anilines removal by mn vii mn vii decomposition and total manganese concentration decrease in the presence of cnts were observed indicating the formation of mno2 on carbon surface the cnts enhanced organics degradation was more favorable at lower ph consistent with the fact that mno2 catalyzed mn vii oxidation was more significant under acid condition and became negligible under alkaline condition thus the authors suggested that mno2 generated by the reaction between mn vii and cnts promoted organics oxidation by mn vii wang et al 2021b also observed the enhancing effect of cnts on degradation of organic pollutants e g ciprofloxacin cip dcf and smx by mn vii however they put forward a different point of view from zhao s to explain this phenomenon they hold that cnts acted as an electronic platform for the electron transfer from organics to mn vii which directly degraded organics and meanwhile produced rmns probably mn iii to further contribute to organics abatement this was verified based on dft calculation spectrum analysis and chronoamperometry as mentioned above the enhancing effect of cnts on mn vii oxidation was much stronger at lower ph however the ph dependency of organics oxidation in mn vii cnts system varied with the type of organic substrates in general phenols and anilines degradation kinetics in mn vii cnts system followed a similar trend to those observed in mn vii alone oxidation zhao et al 2016 wang et al 2021b observed the gradually decreased removal of cip with initial solution ph increasing from 3 0 to 11 0 2 4 2 biochar tian et al 2019 reported that the addition of biochar greatly enhanced the degradation of smx by mn vii they suggested that the reductive sites of biochar e g c h c c and c o groups reacted with mn vii to produce biochar complexed manganese intermediates which were more reactive than mn vii and readily oxidized smx it was observed that preoxidized biochar ozonized for an hour almost completely lost the activating effect for mn vii indicating the important role of reduction property of biochar characterization e g ft ir xps and elemental composition analyses of the spent biochar supported the hypothesis of manganese intermediates combining on the surface of biochar in mn vii biochar system in addition pp showed an inhibiting effect on smx degradation in mn vii biochar system implying the involvement of rmns however the mn valence of biochar complexed rmns was not determined in their study furthermore the specific carbon sites for complexing with rmns were not identified which deserves further study increasing the dosage of biochar or mn vii in mn vii biochar system facilitated the removal of smx the repetitive use of biochar resulted in a decrease of smx oxidation efficiency mainly due to the consumption of reductive sites of biochar during mn vii oxidation compared with that conducted in deionized water the oxidation rate of smx was higher in groundwater but was lower in surface water this was due to the complex effects of water background constituents e g nom and inorganic ions which interacted with mn vii or surface sites of biochar to impact the oxidation of smx 2 4 3 graphite peng et al 2021 also observed the activating effect of carbonaceous materials on mn vii by using graphite they claimed that graphite as a good electron mediator stimulated the direct electron transfer from organics e g smx to mn vii rather than induced rmns generation via the interaction of mn vii with reductive sites on carbon surface in their study the degradation of smx by mn vii with the preoxidized graphite ozonized for 2 h was comparable to that with raw graphite indicating that the electron donating reductive sites of graphite were not mainly responsible for its activating effect alternatively they proposed an electron transfer mechanism for the mn vii graphite system which was verified by a galvanic oxidation process gop in brief organic contaminants and mn vii were separately present in two half cells and graphite sheets were used as the electrodes a high current value was detected as mn vii was added into the half cell and smx oxidation efficiency in the gop reached 61 which clearly confirmed the direct electron transfer between smx and mn vii via graphite sheets in addition graphite was unable to enhance the transformation of pmso by mn vii indicating the negligible contribution of rmns in mn vii graphite system the mechanistic discrepancy between mn vii graphite and mn vii biochar system was attributed to the difference of carbonaceous materials nature the conductivity of biochar 6 8 10 5 s cm 1 was much lower than that of graphite 170 8 s cm 1 indicating that biochar was not conducive to direct electron transfer however biochar had a higher electron donating ability than graphite so the redox reaction between mn vii and biochar was more apt to occur than that between mn vii and graphite the degradation rate of smx in mn vii graphite system increased with increasing mn vii concentration and then kept constant after reaching the maximum a lower solution ph was favorable for smx oxidation the presence of ha inhibited smx oxidation and the inhibiting effect increased as ha concentration increased results of repetitive experiments showed that the smx oxidation efficiency was obviously decreased with an increased cycle time of graphite this was attributed to the adsorption of mno2 in situ formed during reaction on the surface of graphite which impeded electron transfer from smx to mn vii via graphite ultrasonic treatment is a simple and effective way to remove the adsorbed mno2 from graphite without changing the physiochemical properties of graphite compared with other activated mn vii oxidation processes e g mn vii biochar and mn vii bisulfite system the mn vii graphite system via the electron transfer mechanism exhibited higher mn vii utilization efficiency 2 4 4 rgo more recently zhang et al 2022b used rgo with tuned defective degree and quantity of oxygen groups as a model carbocatalyst to probe the active sites for enhancing mn vii oxidation experimental results revealed that the activation performance and pathway of mn vii by carbonaceous materials were closely related to their surface chemistry oxygen containing groups e g hydroxyl group c oh carboxyl group cooh and carbonyl group c o could act as electron donors to induce the decomposition of mn vii into rmns mainly mn v and mn vi while structural defects e g vacancy and edge defects mediated the electron transfer from pollutants to mn vii these were further verified by dft calculations it was noted that an appropriate low oxygen content of rgo was conductive to boost mn vii oxidation but excessive oxygen content was adverse because excessive surface oxygen groups not only occupied the active sites through the stereo hindrance effect but also did damage to the conductivity of carbon in a word both rmns and electron transfer might occur in mn vii rgo system devoting to organics degradation and their contributions strongly depended on the type and content of active sites on carbon surface therefore the oxidation pathway of the mn vii rgo system could be controlled by regulating oxygen functional groups and structural defects the increase of rgo or mn vii dosage was beneficial for organics oxidation in mn vii rgo system the removal efficiency of dcf by mn vii rgo system was similar at ph 4 0 8 0 while it significantly decreased as ph increased from 8 0 to 10 0 the mn vii rgo system enhanced a variety of organic contaminants oxidation compared to mn vii alone but it exhibited a selective reactivity for instance the mn vii rgo system showed superior removal performances for phenol bpa carbamazepine cbz and rhodamine b rhb while the performances for smx ba and diethyl phthalate dep removal were much inferior moreover the mn vii rgo system was also fairly efficient in abatement of pollutants in real waters e g tap water and lake water 2 5 other activation methods 2 5 1 activation by benzoquinone bq quinone groups as an important fraction of humic substance are abundant in aquatic environments which play an important role in biological and chemical processes pat espadas et al 2014 zhu et al 2019b interestingly recent studies reported that quinone compounds such as bq could activate mn vii to enhance the oxidative removal of levofloxacin lev one widely used fluoroquinolone antibiotic under acid and neutral conditions in a study by xu et al 2018 mn iii and 1o2 were proposed as the dominant reactive species for enhanced degradation of lev they assumed that the reduction of mn vii by bq generated mn ii eq 15 which reacted with bq to yield mn iii and semiquinone radical sq in the presence of do mn iii further reacted with sq to produce 1o2 and o2 eq 16 in addition mn vii could react with mn ii to produce mn iii which then interacted with sq to form mn iii sq complexes in turn promoting generation of 1o2 eq 17 15 m n v i i b q m n i i b q b y p r o d u c t s 16 m n i i b q h 2 o m n i i i s q o 2 m n i i b q 1 o 2 o 2 17 m n v i i 4 m n i i l 5 m n i i i l l ligand sq however zhou et al 2021 found that sodium azide nan3 an efficient scavenger for 1o2 at a comparable or one order of magnitude higher concentration 2 50 μm than that of lev 5 μm exhibited a negligible effect on the degradation of lev in mn vii bq system suggesting that 1o2 was not the dominant oxidizing species generated in this process if 1o2 was otherwise produced as the primary oxidant the degradation of lev should be substantially inhibited according to the extremely high reaction rate of nan3 with 1o2 109 m 1 s 1 gsponer et al 1987 moreover the ex situ prepared complexes of mn iii with ligands mn iii l showed a sluggish reactivity toward lev also ruling out the possible contribution of mn iii l in mn vii bq system alternatively zhou et al 2021 proposed that bq and the co present hydroquinone hq resulting from self condensation or decomposition of bq might promote the reduction of mn vii to in situ form mno2 which efficiently catalyzed mn vii to oxidize lev therein several lines of evidence were provided including that i bq activated mn vii oxidation showed a similar ph dependent trend to that of mno2 catalytic oxidation of mn vii i e the activating effect strengthened with ph decreasing ii elevating bq concentration resulted in a marked increase of uv visible absorbance 500 nm corresponding to mno2 confirming the promoted reduction of mn vii by bq and iii other reducing agents including inorganic as iii and mnso4 as well as organic resorcinol noting that it could not be oxidized to quinonoid intermediates also accelerated the oxidation of lev by mn vii owing to the promoted formation of mno2 via mn vii reduction in this regard mno2 in situ formed might play a key role in enhanced degradation of organics in mn vii bq system dong et al 2022 further explored the potential mechanism involved in mn vii bq system and suggested that multiple components including 1o2 mn iii and in situ formed mno2 together contributed to the accelerated degradation of bpa in mn vii bq system among them the catalytic effect of in situ formed mno2 on mn vii oxidation was important under acidic conditions while the bq induced enhancement of mn vii oxidation ability under alkaline conditions e g ph 8 0 10 0 might be associated with generation of other reactive species the role of 1o2 was confirmed by the results of i the inhibitory effect of furfuryl alcohol ffa a scavenger of 1o2 on bpa degradation and ii the negative impact induced by purging with nitrogen it was generally believed that do was involved in 1o2 generation these observations were consistent with those reported in xu s study xu et al 2018 lee et al 2020 have published a review to assess the role of 1o2 in persulfate based advanced oxidation therein they suggest that 1o2 is a highly selective oxidant with a low oxidation potential e0 1o2 o2 0 81 vnhe the reaction kinetics of 1o2 with most organic compounds are too slow to be practical in water treatment applications quenching experiments with scavengers may not be an appropriate way to investigate the role of 1o2 because scavengers not only quench the target 1o2 but also can change the whole reaction process e g enhancing the consumption of oxidants to interfere the generation of reactive species guo et al 2022b wang et al 2022 so further solid evidence for 1o2 contribution in mn vii bq system should be provided in addition the main evidence for mn iii involving in organics transformation was that the addition of pp greatly improved the degradation efficiency of bpa due to its stabilizing effect for mn iii interestingly xu et al 2018 reported a significant inhibition of lev degradation in the presence of pp the completely opposite effects of pp observed in mn vii bq system might be related to the selective reactivity of mn iii l toward organics namely mn iii l was highly reactive toward phenolic compounds but was inert to lev as demonstrated in zhou s study zhou et al 2021 nevertheless since mn iii is one of intermediate products from mn vii transformation the presence of pp leading to the generation of mn iii l to impact organics degradation in mn vii based oxidation processes seems not difficult to understand but this might not be a reliable evidence for the stable occurrence of mn iii and its participating in reactions in mn vii bq system the role of sq as a complexing ligand for mn iii stabilization in mn vii bq system should be further verified for better understanding of the potential mechanism the enhancement of bq on mn vii oxidation was influenced by solution ph and also related to target compounds xu et al 2018 and zhou et al 2021 reported a more significant enhancement of bq on mn vii oxidation toward lev under acid condition compared to that under alkaline condition however dong et al 2022 found that the extent of bq enhancing the degradation of bpa by mn vii was similar within a wide ph range of 4 0 10 0 in general a higher bq concentration was conducive to accelerating organics abatement in mn vii bq system while excessive bq could cause a negative impact because of the competitive consumption of bq toward oxidizing species dong et al 2022 xu et al 2018 the degradation efficiency of organics increased in mn vii bq system as a low concentration of ha e g 0 2 0 mgc l was present dong et al 2022 moreover the mn vii bq system exhibited a higher degradation efficiency of organics in real waters than that in pure water 2 5 2 activation by heterogeneous ru catalysts in early literature ruthenium iii ru iii is reported as an efficient catalyst for mn vii oxidation toward many organic compounds such as amino acids atenolol d panthenol and amitriptyline under strong alkaline oh 0 05 m or strong acidic h 0 03 m conditions abbar et al 2011 halligudi et al 2001 hiremath et al 2004 kini et al 2002 afterwards zhang et al zhang and guan 2014 zhang et al 2014b demonstrated that ru iii could also enhance the degradation of pollutants e g aniline and bpa by mn vii at environmentally relevant ph however most studies focus on the soluble ru iii which is far from practical application due to its expensive price and difficulty in removal recovery from the effluents further zhang and his co workers investigated the catalytic performance of heterogeneous ru loaded catalysts such as ceria or titania supported ru ru ceo2 or ru tio2 on mn vii zhang et al 2013 2014a based on their findings the presence of ru loaded catalysts significantly promoted the removal of organic pollutants by mn vii the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes analysis revealed that ru iii deposited on the surface of supports was oxidized by mn vii to its higher oxidation state ru vi and ru vii which acted as the active co oxidants participating in organics transformation zhang et al 2013 meanwhile ru vi and ru vii were reduced by organics to the initial state of ru iii in other words ru loaded catalysts acted as an electron shuttle in catalytic oxidation of mn vii which was a little similar to the mechanism of mn vii activation by redox mediators reactive intermediates derived from the catalyst rather than from mn vii accounted for enhanced degradation of organics ru loaded catalysts were effective in catalyzing mn vii oxidation over a wide ph range for instance the degradation rate of bp by mn vii was accelerated by 3 4 95 7 times at ph 4 0 8 0 with the most significant enhancement occurring at ph 5 0 due to the presence of ru tio2 zhang et al 2013 the increase of either mn vii or catalysts dosage was beneficial to organics degradation the enhancing effect of ru loaded catalysts was closely related to the type of organic pollutants for instance the second order rate constant of cip degradation by mn vii increased from 0 60 to 8 40 m 1 s 1 14 fold due to the presence of 1 0 g l ru tio2 while the oxidation of caffeine was negligibly affected by ru tio2 zhang et al 2014a these catalysts maintained the excellent catalytic activity during multiple successive runs moreover the removal efficiency of organic pollutants in real waters was comparable or even slightly higher than that in deionized water zhang et al 2013 2014a 3 conclusions and outlooks the extensive review of recently published results confirms activated mn vii oxidation processes are a viable strategy for destruction of emerging contaminants in water many methods including photoactivation electrical activation the addition of redox mediators carbonaceous materials and other chemical agents show excellent performances in mn vii activation different oxidation mechanisms are involved in these processes including the generation of reactive intermediates derived from mn vii e g mn iii mn v and mn vi or activators e g intermediates of redox mediators and ru catalysts reactive oxygen species ros e g oh o2 and 1o2 as well as electron transfer from organics to mn vii via catalysts as the electron mediator notably except oh that is generated as one of co oxidants in uv mn vii process other reactive species involved in activated mn vii oxidation processes are relatively mild oxidants they exhibit more selective reactivity toward organic pollutants and higher tolerance to water matrixes e g inorganic ions and nom compared to highly active radical species thus high pollutants removal efficiencies can be achieved in complex environmental matrices making these mn vii based oxidation technologies have a good application prospect in practical engineering processes however the potential applications of these technologies deserve further efforts firstly energy based activation methods e g uv irradiation and electrochemical technologies require high energy consumption and complicated reactors thus hampering their applications on a large scale by contrast the use of relatively cheap and green carbonaceous materials for mn vii activation may be a good option in water treatment nevertheless the cost effectiveness of mn vii carbonaceous materials systems should be evaluated comprehensively by considering the synthetic cost of carbonaceous materials and mn vii dosage moreover the activation efficiency and mechanism of mn vii by carbonaceous materials are greatly dependent on their nature and properties both oxygen containing groups and structural defects have been identified as the main active sites for mn vii activation via different pathways which can give guidance to the rational design of carbonaceous materials with high catalytic activities in addition the economic cost of other mn vii activation methods is also unavailable in current studies which should be calculated to assess the practical application potential of these technologies secondly the mechanistic understanding for activated mn vii oxidation processes should be further advanced the claims that are questioned throughout this article should be scrutinized for instance soluble free mn iii has been proposed as the main oxidant in many activated mn vii oxidation processes e g e mn vii vl mn vii and mn vii bq systems however a big question is how mn iii can exist stably against disproportionation in the absence of complexing agents the influence of pp on organics degradation kinetics may not be a reliable evidence for mn iii occurrence since it can scavenge instantaneous mn iii generated during mn vii transformation in addition the roles of ros such as o2 and 1o2 identified in vl mn vii and mn vii bq systems also need clarification since they are highly selective oxidants and have a limited reactivity toward most organic pollutants in practical water treatment lee et al 2020 min et al 2022 the commonly used quenching experiments may not be appropriate for their identification due to the complex influences induced by quenchers addition in addition the mechanistic discrepancy among different photo activated mn vii processes is worthy of further investigation thirdly mno2 is usually in situ formed as a stable product from mn vii transformation and it exhibits an excellent catalytic capacity for mn vii especially under acidic conditions however the vital role of mno2 in some activated mn vii oxidation processes e g e mn vii system has been overlooked which should be re evaluated furthermore the accurate catalytic mechanism of mno2 for mn vii is still unclear which is worth deep exploration earlier studies suggest that organic compounds first adsorb on mno2 surface to form active complexes which are more reactive and thus quickly oxidized by mn vii perez benito 2009 2011 recently it is reported that mno2 can promote the degradation of pollutants by fe vi luo et al 2022 and periodate io4 du et al 2020 that are both oxyanions analogous to mn vii the enhancing mechanism of mno2 involves the first formation of metastable mno2 fe vi and mn iv o io3 complexes through the interaction of mno2 and oxidants which are able to rapidly react with organics and meanwhile result in other reactive species formation fourthly since multiple reaction pathways usually co exist in activated mn vii oxidation processes it is necessary to precisely and quantitatively estimate the contribution of each pathway to total organics oxidation for better guiding the application of these technologies this however is still challenging due to the lack of analytical methods on the other hand dft calculation may provide some useful information about the preferable reaction pathway thus developing new and effective research techniques assisted with theoretical calculation for distinguishing the role of various reactive species should be a future research direction finally the decontamination performance of these mn vii based oxidation technologies should be tested at a pilot and field scale for assessing their feasibility in practical water treatment the applicable conditions of these technologies should be carefully considered and the operating parameters should be further optimized in terms of specific water quality conditions e g the type and level of organic contaminants and water matrix components moreover the addition of chemicals such as synthetic redox mediators bq and ru catalysts can bring about some environmental risks e g n containing organic byproducts formation and ru leaching the inadvertent release of carbonaceous materials into the effluents after treatment process may also cause environmental concerns so environmental risk assessment of these technologies should be

corresponding author biological nitrogen removal bnr is one of the most important environmental concerns in the field of wastewater treatment the conventional bnr process based on heterotrophic nitrogen removal henr is suffering from several limitations including external carbon source dependence excessive sludge production and greenhouse gas emissions through the mediation of autotrophic nitrogen removal aunr mixed mixotrophic nitrogen removal mixnr offers a viable solution to the optimization of the bnr process here the recent advance and characteristics of mixnr process guided by sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sdad and anammox are summarized in this review additionally we discuss the functional microorganisms in different mixnr systems shedding light on metabolic mechanisms and microbial interactions the significance of mixnr for carbon reduction in the bnr process has also been noted the knowledge gaps and the future research directions that may facilitate the practical application of the mixnr process are highlighted overall the prospect of the mixnr process is attractive and this review will provide guidance for the future implementation of mixnr process as well as deciphering the microbially metabolic mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological nitrogen removal mixotrophic sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification anammox data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen is an essential component of all living organisms on earth meanwhile environmental issues related to nitrogen pollution are also a global concern nowadays it has been reported that 50 of the food produced by human society needs to rely on industrial nitrogen fertilizers which doubles the input of nitrogen to the ecosystem increasing the risk of water eutrophication kuypers et al 2018 nitrous oxide n2o regarded as one type of greenhouse gas ghg contributes 300 times more of ghg than carbon dioxide co2 at the same unit liu et al 2019 worse n2o emissions have also increased in the last decade due to the productive activities of human society kuypers et al 2018 to deal with the nitrogen pollution various nitrogen removal technologies have been developed among which biological nitrogen removal bnr is favored due to its high performance and economic efficiency the bnr process is performed by heterotrophs or autotrophs or both of them which convert various forms of nitrogen into n2 heterotrophic nitrogen removal henr refers to heterotrophic denitrification in this study is a process of reducing nitrate nitrite to n2 using organic compounds as electron donors which is most widely applied in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps fig 1 nevertheless the henr process is mainly suffering from some limitations for instance external carbon sources requirement excessive sludge production and n2o emissions liu et al 2019 instead of organics autotrophic denitrification uses inorganics e g h2 s2 s0 s2o3 2 fe2 mn2 as electron donors fig 1 which can conquer the above bottleneck to some extent pang and wang 2021 aunr process however is also limited by the long start up stage and high hydraulic retention time hrt with limited biomass due to the slow growth rate of autotrophic bacteria thus extensive studies have attempted to combine the aunr and henr to optimize the bnr process besides nitrogen removal microbes of mixotrophic metabolism are also gaining widely attentions collectively it is referred to here as mixed mixotrophic nitrogen removal mixnr on the one hand the mixnr system inherits the advantages of both henr and aunr and can achieve a high nitrogen loading rate while avoiding a series of issues caused by reliance on external carbon sources the tight microbial interactions between autotrophs and heterotrophs in the mixnr system help to improve the stability of the system and thus optimize the bnr performance in terms of mixnr sulfur based mixnr and anammox based mixnr have gained the most widely attention the former relies on the coupling of autotrophic sulfur oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb with heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria h nrb while the construction of the anammox based mixnr system lies in the realization of the coupling of anammox bacteria anaob and h nrb wang et al 2005 and chen et al 2008 constructed a sulfur based mixnr process which successfully achieved efficient synergistic removal of organics nitrogen and sulfur pollutants based on the sulfur recycling the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process designed by professor chen s group achieved great success in reducing energy consumption and sludge reduction lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 in the sani process although aunr is considered to be the main contributor to nitrogen removal mixnr due to the presence of organics is in fact not negligible as well qian et al 2015a wu et al 2016 in the anammox based mixnr the terminating nitrate no3 n reduction to nitrite no2 n can be achieved in henr namely partial denitrification pd which provides the substrate no2 n for anammox and achieves the original utilization of by product no3 n du et al 2019 besides the presence of organic matter in the actual wastewater also supports the construction of anammox based mixnr thus the mixotrophic condition is not negligible in the promotion of anammox technology and regulating the ecological balance between h nrb and anaob is crucial in summary organic carbon org c nitrogen and reduced sulfur components are necessary to establish the sulfur based mixnr process therefore the sulfur based mixnr process lies in dealing with compound pollutants especially sulfur containing wastewater meanwhile in terms of mainstream wastewater the anammox based mixnr process provides an effective solution for the improvement of the conventional bnr process thus the mixnr process lays a foundation for the development of the bnr process toward more efficiency and sustainability herein as shown in fig 2 the recent advance and status of mixnr process guided by sdad and anammox are systematically summarized in this review mainly including the key configurations of bioreactor functional microorganisms microbially metabolic interactions and the applications the existing knowledge gaps about the metabolic mechanisms and microbial interactions in mixnr system will be discussed furthermore some perspectives and future trends for applications will be put forward the obtained knowledge could facilitate the improvement and optimization of traditional bnr technology by reducing carbon footprint and increasing process performance 2 biological nitrogen removal process based on mixnr 2 1 sulfur based mixnr process sulfide s0 and thiosulfate are most commonly used as the reduced sulfur components among them the sulfur based mixnr process using sulfide as electron donor has been studied intensively including process flow operating parameters and mathematical modeling herein this section will sort out the sulfur based mixnr process in line with the multiple reduced sulfur components 2 1 1 sulfide as electron donor process flow and performance org c nitrogen and sulfur commonly coexist in a variety of actual wastewaters such as flue gas desulfurization cod 500 mg l 1 no2 n 30 mg l 1 so4 2 s 500 mg l 1 and pharmaceutical wastewater cod 10000 13000 mg l 1 nh4 n 500 700 mg l 1 so4 2 s 1000 1666 mg l 1 which highlight the attractive potentials of the sulfur based mixnr process zhang et al 2020a the mixotrophic conditions org c sulfide and no3 n can be constructed in a practical application through the reasonable planning of the process as shown in fig 3 a in the anaerobic unit sulfate is first reduced in the presence of heterotrophic sulfate reduction bacteria h srb the sulfide produced accompanied by the org c and no3 n refluxed from aerobic unit as shown in fig 3 a supports the construction of the mixnr system in the second unit the sulfur based mixnr process the second unit in fig 3 a was firstly constructed in a fluidized bed reactor 15 l by gommers et al 1988 and stable process performance was maintained with acetate 17 7 mg l 1 as org c during 25 days of operation removal rate 3 kg s m 3 d 1 6 kg c m 3 d 1 5 kg n m 3 d 1 in a similar reactor configuration 4 l the sulfur based mixnr process achieved complete removal 100 removal efficiency of acetate nitrate and sulfide at an influent no3 n concentration of 150 mg l 1 during 490 days of operation huang et al 2021a high levels of sulfate emissions are a potential environmental risk which can lead to acidification of surface and groundwater and even endanger human health ding and zeng 2022 sulfate the end production of the sulfur driven denitrification process sdad is also a potential hazard in the odours emission of the water environment it is reported that high concentrations of sulfate will lead to odor 400 mg l 1 and even diarrhea 1000 1200 mg l 1 zhang et al 2021a besides sulfate has the potential to be reduced to sulfide in river substrate and pipelines which increases the environmental risk according to the u s epa the maximum sulfate concentration in drinking water is 250 mg l 1 zhang et al 2021a therefore many studies have avoided sulfate over emissions by pursuing the recovery s0 in the sulfur based mixnr process as shown in fig 3 d s0 is an intermediate product in the oxidation process of sulfides hence if s0 is available as an end product conversion of sulfide to s0 then the sulfur resources in the reactor and effluent can be recovered by simple physical separation from the perspective of functional bacteria modulation and coupling between h nrb and a sonrb are crucial to achieving efficient sulfur recovery while considering nitrogen removal the functional mechanisms of the sulfur based mixnr system are shown in fig 3 d first sulfide is oxidized by nitrate to s0 and generates nitrite in the presence of a sonrb r 1 then the oxidation reaction proceeds further to produce sulfate with n2 r 2 from the perspective of henr h nrb uses nitrate r 3 or nitrite r 4 to oxidize organic matter to produce n2 and co2 previous studies had shown that the reaction rate of r 1 is about three times that of r 2 yuan et al 2019 which provides the basis for s0 recovery and the accumulation of nitrite was effectively avoided by the action of h nrb chen et al 2017 in our previous study a high s conversion ratio 86 7 was achieved at a sulfide concentration 400 mg l 1 zhang et al 2018 the setup of reflux by proportionally refluxing the effluent to the influent has proven to be an effective means of improving the s0 recovery performance with a reflux ratio of 3 1 yuan et al 2014 achieved a maximum s conversion ratio of more than 90 recently the ph condition has also been shown to be one of the crucial factors affecting s0 recovery jia et al 2022 found that alkaline conditions 7 0 ph 10 2 were more favorable for the recovery s0 conversion ratio of 77 0 in the mixnr system compared to only about 10 under acidic conditions ph 7 4 sulfur based mixnr also provides a viable path for the optimization of the sani process the flow sheet of conventional sani process is similar to fig 1 a sulfur based mixnr with sulfide as electron donor except that s0 is not well recovered and nitrogen removal relies mainly on aunr the long hydraulic retention time hrt 34 h is a barrier to the full scale application of this process when aunr dominates lu et al 2012 by increasing the concentration of influent cod 490 750 mg l 1 to enhance the contribution of henr qian et al 2015b constructed the mixnr system 28 heterotrophic and 72 autotrophic in the conventional sani process which increased the denitrification rate by 6 times moreover it inherited the advantage of low sludge production 0 03 kg vss kg 1 cod besides using anaerobic digested sludge as seeding sludge may also be a factor of achieving the excellent process performance it is noteworthy that sdad and anammox could be theoretically coupled in the anoxic unit nh4 n from influent no2 n from partial nitrification or partial denitrification via sdad of the sani process based on this huo et al 2022 proposed a modified sani process coupled anammox with sdad as the core of bnr recently this modified sani process eliminates the need for a high internal circulation and avoids the requirement for strict control of split flow ratio which facilitates simplified the operation and saves costs huo et al 2022 therefore the sulfur based mixnr technology also provides a viable option for expanding the application of the sani process optimization of the operating parameters the working parameters are critical in determining the performance of the sulfur based mixnr process as shown in table 1 the process performance is firstly relying upon the ratio of substrates s n c the research of chen et al 2008 showed for the first time that the optimal molar ration of c n in the sulfur based mixnr system is 1 26 1 and 1 1 2 for s n influent no3 n 87 5 mg l 1 nre 99 as the increasing no3 n concentrations no3 n 220 0 mg l 1 wang et al 2015 found that the nre obtained by sulfur based mixnr process was up to 90 under the s n c of 1 1 4 4 8 although excess electron donors org c or sulfides provide a safeguard for nitrate removal in the case of the mix process this also leads to a disruption of the balance of the microbial community and deteriorates the process performance zhang et al 2018 on this basis recent studies have shown that the appropriate s n c was generally determined as 1 1 2 1 as shown in table 1 it is noteworthy that the micro oxygen conditions have a positive effect on improving the s0 recovery and bnr performance of the sulfur based mixnr process table 1 as shown in fig 3 a the liquid returning to the mixnr unit usually contains a certain amount of dissolved oxygen do 0 5 mg l 1 which leads to an inhibition of heterotrophs dominated activated sludge denitrification process li et al 2017 a previous study showed that do at 0 09 mg l 1 significantly inhibited heterotrophs dominated denitrification 30 reduction in rate oh and silverstein 1999 thus the response of sulfur based mixnr system to micro oxygen should be highlighted in the batch test chen et al 2010 first found the enhancement of mixnr performance by micro oxygen conditions do 0 5 mg l 1 but observed the accumulation of nitrite subsequently lots of studies in the past 10 years have confirmed the positive effects of micro oxygen on the sulfur based mixnr system xu et al 2017a zhang et al 2020a wang et al 2016a a high concentration of sulfide can inhibit the activity of microorganisms in the wastewater treatment process wang et al 2016b at a sulfide loading rate of 8 16 kg s m 3 d 1 wang et al 2015 successfully achieved a s conversion ratio of 100 under micro oxygen conditions do 0 1 0 3 mg l 1 furthermore the enhancement of the sulfur based mixnr system by micro oxygen has also been deciphered in a series of studies on microbial community ecological succession xu et al 2017a wang et al 2016a and genes response of key bacterial zhang et al 2020a details will be discussed in the next section therefore the sulfur based mixnr process is expected to show technical advantages over the conventional henr based denitrification process of dealing with the suppression of do and sulfide mathematical modeling mathematical simulation is an important part of the design and optimal operation of wastewater biological treatment systems in the case of sulfide as an electron donor xu et al 2014 successfully developed a kinetic model applicable to the sulfur based mixnr process by modifying the classical activated sludge model ams and anaerobic digestion model adm of the international water association iwa this model contained the following six processes 1 oxidation of sulfide to s0 with no3 n as electron acceptor 2 oxidation of sulfide to s0 with no2 n as electron acceptor 3 reduction of no3 n to no2 n with org c as electron donor 4 reduction of no2 n to n2 with org c as electron donor 5 oxidation of s0 to so4 2 with no3 n as electron acceptor and oxidation of s0 to so4 2 with no2 n as electron acceptor xu et al 2014 besides the biomass was also introduced as a constant xi as well according to the best fit parameters the r2 of the fits was all above 0 95 in describing the removal of sulfide org c and no3 n meanwhile the obtained model provided an effective prediction of the conversion ratio of s0 xu et al 2014 the model further well described the dynamic removal of org c nitrate and sulfide considering the growth characteristics of functional microbial xu et al 2017b as mentioned before micro oxygen conditions have a reinforcing effect on the sulfur based mixnr system in the sulfur based mixnr system previous studies introduced the parameter r os molar ratio of oxygen to sulfide into the model further determining the optimal r os interval 1 0 2 0 xu et al 2013 however this r os interval 1 0 2 0 does not seem to support the operation of continuous operation in the study by zhang et al 2020a using micro oxygen for the enhancement of sulfur based mixnr process the r os under continuous flow operation was calculated to be 2 5 10 3 the highest r os in another similar study calculated as about 0 08 sun et al 2020 on the one hand the experiment implemented by xu et al 2013 was batching test which may not well to support the operation of continuous flow on the other hand the do in the batching test reached up to 150 300 mg l 1 which is undesirable for practical nevertheless the development of relevant models is a simple and efficient mean of describing process performance and interpreting the response of environmental factors which provides an important theoretical basis and technical guidance for the application of the sulfur based mixnr process thus the mathematical model regarding the sulfur based mixnr process needs to be further optimized in order to guide the practical via the operation of continuous flow process 2 1 2 s0 as electron donor instead of dissolved reduced sulfur compounds s can also be used as an electron donor for low cost nitrogen removal processes because of the wide range of sources zhang et al 2021a as shown in fig 3 c the s0 based packed bed is the most widely employed for this process however the solubility of s0 is extremely low 5 μg l 1 at 25 c which limits the bioavailability boulegue 1978 the mixnr system provides a viable solution for the issue mentioned above in the presence of org c as shown in fig 3 c part of s0 will be reduced to hs under the action of heterotrophic sulfate reduction bacteria h srb zhang et al 2021a subsequently polysulfides could be generated spontaneously through the abiotic reaction between sulfide and sulfur nucleophilic attack under neutral or alkaline conditions fig 3 c rampelotto 2016 the higher bioavailability of polysulfides compared to s0 greatly enhances the performance of the nitrogen removal process using woodchips as a carbon source the mixnr system constructed by li et al 2016 resulted in a nearly 5 6 times improvement in nitrogen removal performance compared to the s0 based sdad process similar results have also been confirmed by other studies wan et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 and further suggested that the c n of 0 25 0 5 is the optimal interval for improving nitrogen removal performance qiu et al 2020 controlling the neutral environment is also an important guarantee for the efficient operation of the s0 based sdad process zhang et al 2021a s0 based sdad process is an acid producing process and the removal of one gram of nitrate will be accompanied by a depletion of 4 57 g of alkalinity zhang et al 2021a in contrast henr is a process that can produce alkalinity as shown in fig 3 therefore the sulfur based mixnr process has a lower alkalinity consumption than the s0 based aunr process liu et al 2009 in a previous study the ph of mixnr and sdad effluent were 8 04 and 7 6 respectively at the same influent ph of 7 5 which indicate that the alkalinity produced by henr was largely consumed by sdad liu et al 2009 furthermore the sulfate production in the s0 based packed bed and related processes will also be decreased due to the reduction of alkalinity consumption in the study by zhang et al 2015 the sulfate production of the sdad process s0 as electron donor was about 700 mg l 1 while in the case of mixnr it is only 161 mg l 1 details related to ph and sulfate production in the related processes have been systematically discussed and summarized by previous studies wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a overall the intervention of mixnr is a compromised approach to reduce the risk of secondary sulfate contamination of the sdad processes as well as to enhance the nitrogen removal performance 2 1 3 thiosulfate as electron donor among the common reduced sulfur components thiosulfate will lead to the highest sdad performance due to its excellent bioavailability and low toxicity zhang et al 2021a however the decreased ph of the thiosulfate based sdad process leads to large amounts of sulfate in the effluent specifically the complete reduction of 1 g no3 n will be accompanied by the production of 12 15 g sulfate sun et al 2020 additional costs will be incurred to control sulfate production through ph regulation the mixnr with thiosulfate as electron donor was implemented by some studies to cope with the related issues a previous study showed that the effluent sulfate of the process with thiosulfate as electron donors was above 250 mg l 1 yet it was only 150 mg l 1 with the mixed electron donors org c and thiosulfate process sun et al 2020 moreover the mixed electron donors could also reduce the production of n2o by about 50 sun et al 2020 on the one hand the mixed electron donor is more conducive to complete denitrification thus effectively avoiding the accumulation of nitrite which is a factor contributing to the increased n2o production frostegård et al 2022 on the other hand n2o reductase is easily inhibited at low ph conditions and the mixed electron donor process will effectively avoid excessive reduction of ph zhang et al 2020d in another case the mixnr mediated by thiosulfate in the floating treatment wetland can promote nitrogen removal by plants and bacteria synergistically gao et al 2018 nevertheless the unstable chemical nature of thiosulfate makes its applications for engineering problematic therefore the current process with thiosulfate as an electron donor is mostly a laboratory scale in addition to thiosulfate some other reduced sulfur components such as sulfite could also theoretically support the establishment of mixnr system however relevant studies are still lacking the previously developed models focus only on the sdad process and are mostly described simply by zero half or first order reactions xu et al 2016 koenig and liu 2001 huiliñir et al 2020 and heterotrophic process was not well considered only in the study by koenig and liu 2001 sdad and henr were compared by half order reaction and it was shown that henr had a higher reaction rate than sdad while thiosulfate drove better compared to s0 in addition the indirect coupling of electrons ice model was developed to evaluate the electron competition between s0 and thiosulfate in the sdad system yang et al 2022 therefore the application of mathematical models in the mixnr process with thiosulfate or s0 as electron donor is still inadequate 2 1 4 practical and engineering applications as far as applications the sulfur based mixnr process using sulfide as an electron donor is at the forefront so far the process shown in fig 3 a has been successfully applied to the treatment of food processing influent cod 2000 mg l 1 so4 2 1500 mg l 1 nh4 n 300 mg l 1 scale 4 5 l hrt from 24 h to 12 h yuan et al 2014 and pharmaceutical wastewater influent cod 9000 14000 mg l 1 so4 2 3000 5000 mg l 1 scale 15 l hrt 24 h zhao et al 2014 in the above case while achieving satisfactory performance a high sulfur recovery rate was obtained which effectively avoids secondary pollution the s0 production rate reached 90 in the study of yuan et al 2014 in terms of municipal domestic wastewater the sani process is undoubtedly the most successful case in recent years the land occupation and sludge production can be reduced by 30 40 and 60 70 respectively in the sani process wu et al 2016 it is reported that the full size sani scale of the mixnr unit 672 m3 flow rate 800 1000 m3 d 1 hrt 2 5 h process will reduce operating costs by 50 compared to the traditional process in hong kong wu et al 2016 besides lu et al 2012 developed a stable state model for the pilot scale sani process which is an important guide for the design and parameter input of the process the feasibility of the sulfur based mixnr process with s0 and corncob as fillers scale 0 8 l hrt 1 5 h the mass of s0 and limestone 176 39 g and 259 94 g in treating actual effluent from simulated wwtps was also verified ma et al 2021 over 98 nitrate removal efficiency was obtained in that study ma et al 2021 which providing a feasible strategy for wwtps to meet the demand of deep nitrogen removal 2 2 anammox based mixnr process 2 2 1 process flow and performance as an efficient and economical aunr technology anammox has attracted much attention since its discovery zhang et al 2021b however the shortage of nitrite in the actual wastewater and the production of nitrate 11 production as no3 n have limited the application of this technology du et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in order to cope with this technical bottleneck partial nitrification pn and pd were proposed successively many previous reviews have systematically summarized pn a versus pd a du et al 2019 wu et al 2022 cao et al 2021 in brief the technical core of pn is the enrichment of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob while eliminating nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob to achieve the accumulation of nitrite however do srt and free ammonia fa or free nitrous acid fna modulation strategies are not satisfactory in maintaining stable pn performance du et al 2019 zhao et al 2021b compared with pn a coupling pd controlling henr at the nitrite stage with anammox namely pd a one stage has been proven to be a viable option due to the low facility cost and simplicity of operation du et al 2019 the core of pd a is the coupling of aunr anammox and henr pd which is a successful mixnr system as shown in fig 3 b nitrate produced by the anammox process can be in situ removed directly by henr in a one stage pd a system which further highlights the advantages of anammox based mixnr cao et al 2016 implemented the first successful construction of anammox based mixnr system in a sequencing batch reactor working volume 2 0 l hrt from 8 h by coupling anammox with pd and achieved a high nre of 97 at a total nitrogen concentration of 55 mg l 1 nh4 n 25 mg l 1 no3 n 30 mg l 1 the anammox based mixnr process was also successful in treating actual domestic wastewater with nh4 n and no3 n concentrations of 63 6 and 69 2 mg l 1 nre 95 8 respectively in a sequencing batch reactor working volume 2 0 l diameter 12 cm and height 25 cm hrt 8h du et al 2017b therefore the mixnr technology route offers a viable strategy for the mainstream application of the anammox process 2 2 2 optimization of the operating parameters the appropriate mixotrophic conditions are paramount in determining performance of anammox based mixnr which in practice is mainly regulated by the ratio of c n the theoretical c n required for complete denitrification is 4 1 ma et al 2017 so the anammox based mixnr system is lower than that value excessive org c concentrations can upset the balance between anammox and pd thereby deteriorating the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox based mixnr system du et al 2019 based on previous studies the empirical c n in actual operation is usually in the range of 2 5 3 5 zhang et al 2020d du et al 2019 ma et al 2017 the hrt is another crucial parameter although the limited carbon source leads to the pd process accumulated nitrite could also be consumed by endogenous respiration of bacteria zhang et al 2020d thus a suitable hrt reaction time will avoid excessive consumption of nitrite and maintain its accumulation at the highest level according to previously different reactor configurations may be suitable for different hrts in a continuous flow uasb 1 2 l reactor setting the hrt of the anammox based mixnr process to 0 75 h proved to be ideal correspondingly the reaction time of the anaerobic phase in the sbr system can be set to 6 h du et al 2017a and when antibiotics are present in the wastewater the reaction time should be longer than when treating general municipal wastewater a recent study has shown that when the anammox based mixnr process in treating pharmaceutical wastewater a high level of nitrogen removal performance could be guaranteed at an hrt of 10 h zhang et al 2022a however the extension of hrt will increase the operational burden and cost in a very recent study the extremely short hrt proved to be an effective means of stimulating a significant increase in anammox activity and achieved a high nre of 94 1 nitrogen removal rate of 1 28 kg n m 3 d 1 at hrt of 1 h du et al 2022 ph is another crucial parameter the optimal range of ph is 8 5 9 0 as alkaline condition could lead to the inhibition of cu type nitrite reductase nirk activity and thus cause the accumulation of nitrite du et al 2019 reducing the loss of biomass in the reactors should also be considered due to the slow growth rate of anaob the construction of granular sludge and biofilm has been shown to be a promising scheme it is recommended that the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss should be kept at 3000 3500 mg l 1 li et al 2019 the biofilm enriched by anaob and pd bacteria was successfully obtained during the 600 days of operation relative abundance anaob 0 11 pd bacteria about 10 by adding fillers into the anoxic zone in a full scale municipal wwtp integrating anoxic moving bed biofilm reactor with anaerobic anoxic oxic system hrt about 10 h including anaerobic 2 h anoxic 2 6 h and oxic 6 4 h srt 14 18 day li et al 2019 moreover the spatial structure of biofilm or granular sludge is also more conducive to the tolerance of the anammox based mixnr system to adverse environments du et al 2017b ma et al 2017 for example a recent study by zhang et al 2022a showed that anammox based mixnr biofilms exhibit high tolerance to bismuth nitrate and bismuth potassium citrate using actual pharmaceutical wastewater as an influent nh4 n 77 9 mg l 1 no3 n 104 1 mg l 1 the process showed a satisfied nre of up to 81 2 in fact anaob has been widely reported to have a strong extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion capacity which leads to a macroscopic preference for the biomass to be in the form of biofilm or granules jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b yu 2020 therefore the addition of carriers is a feasible strategy for anammox based mixnr process in practical applications the mathematical models have also been established in anammox based mixnr systems by several studies as mentioned previously the construction of biofilms is an effective strategy to enable anammox biomass to be retained in mixnr system zhang et al 2021b in the biofilm system an one dimensional mathematical model for evaluating the relationship between anammox and henr was proposed by mattei et al 2015 the one dimensional mathematical assessed the effect of boundary conditions on microbial competition and revealed the diffusion pattern of the substrate ammonium organics nitrite and nitrate in the timescales mattei et al 2015 meanwhile the model was similarly applied to investigate n2o emissions from the anammox based mixnr system with the model developer utility a previous study extended the asm1 by introducing n2o gas variables and showed that high ammonia and low nitrite loading resulted in a minimal n2o production factor range from 1 7 to 2 9 lu et al 2018 however the large number of process parameters in practice inevitably complicates the model and the fitting of multiple effecters may lead to distortion recently machine learning has been widely adopted to guide the operation of wastewater treatment process huang et al 2021b which also provides the idea of a more stable and efficient mathematical model for mixnr 2 2 3 practical and engineering applications in fact the existence of anaob has been widely reported in many municipal wwtps with a low anammox rate 0 08 1 2 μmol n g 1vss h 1 yang et al 2021 however the low enrichment of anaob cannot meet the application requirements in 2019 the anammox phenomenon in municipal wwtp 25 104 m 3 d 1 was reported for the first time with a high anaob abundance 0 11 in western china li et al 2019 marking the feasibility of anammox based mixnr for nitrogen removal from mainstream municipal wastewater the adoption of an anoxic carrier is a key strategy for the enrichment of anaob in the mainstream condition in that study hence the construction of the biofilm based structure is suggested as an effective application strategy for the anammox based mixnr addition to municipal wastewater the anammox based mixnr process is also well applied to the actual treatment of landfill leachate in general the tn concentration in landfill leachate is in the range of 1000 3000 mg l 1 which will lead to the nitrate concentration of anammox process effluent over 200 mg l 1 in a previous study a anammox based mixnr process was constructed in a biocarriers tank to achieve effective treatment of landfill leachate 1 74 kg cod m 3 d 1 with cod and ammonia removal efficiencies of 79 6 0 8 and 77 5 3 9 respectively dan and le luu 2021 furthermore the process with related technologies as the core has also been successfully applied to the shiyan landfill leachate treatment plant flow 150 m3 d 1 land space 2040 m2 in hubei province which is an excellent practical case of china relying on anammox based mixnr wu et al 2022 with the two stage uasb system in operation the process achieved cod and total nitrogen removal efficiency of greater than 60 and 80 respectively it can be concluded from the above practical cases that the complexity of the actual wastewater determines that mixotrophic conditions are the most common scenario in the applications of anammox thus the anammox based mixnr process is the solution that meets the practical needs in addition the close synergy of multi microbes heterotrophs and autotrophs also facilitates the maintenance of process stability which can meet the needs of dealing with actual fluctuations of wastewater quality 2 3 other promising mixnr process the discovered nitrogen conversion bioprocesses including nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox strous et al 1999 fe based autotrophic denitrification nielsen and nielsen 1998 straub et al 1996 and hydrogen based autotrophic denitrification tang et al 2011 szekeres et al 2001 have greatly expanded the nitrogen removal process fig 1 among them the application of damo in wastewater treatment provides new ideas for mixnr as shown in fig 1 n damo bacteria and n damo archaea are the two distinct microbial groups and the latter can be well coupled with anammox achieving efficient nitrogen removal liu et al 2019 so far combining anammox and n damo process has been proven to be successful in treating the real domestic sewage and anaerobic digestion liquor nitrogen removal rate 0 46 kg n m 3 d 1 lim et al 2021 besides the anammox and n damo coupling process also broken the bottleneck of low temperature by exploiting the overcapacity of biofilm nitrogen removal rate 0 13 kg n m 3 d 1 at 10 c liu et al 2020b according to the insights of liu et al 2019 the process 0 5 million m 3 d 1 with coupled anammox with n damo as core could theoretically achieve produced energy at 290 tj y 1 while the conventional process is accompanied by a negative energy of 181 tj y 1 thus the dmao process is expected to advance wwtps to achieve the transition to energy production the advantage of the damo process is the in situ utilization of ch4 from the biogas produced by waste sludge in wwtps which is an inexpensive organic source for denitrification yet as another coexist component of biogas the fate of h2s should also be concern noteworthy the coexist of h2s and ch4 seems to support both a sonrb and damo bacteria archaea in ecological niches recently the coupling bnr process of sdad and damo namely sulfide driven denitrification methane oxidation sdmo was successfully established and achieved an nre of 100 in over 700 days of operation wang et al 2022c it was surprising to find that the intervention of h2s nearly doubled the contribution of damo to nitrogen removal from 2 9 mg n l 1 d 1 to 6 2 mg n l 1 d 1 may be attributed to the enhanced metabolic potential wang et al 2022c meanwhile the recent finding of mixotrophic methane sulfur oxidizing bacteria hy1 have expanded our knowledge of the unknow global elemental cycle gwak et al 2022 therefore the mixotrophic conditions may not only increase the metabolic association of the bnr system but also facilitate the exploration of novel pathways 3 functional microorganisms as the main contributor to nitrogen removal the functional microorganisms in the mixnr based wastewater treatment systems have been highlighted in fig 3 the details of the related bacteria in different mixnr systems are introduced as follows 3 1 functional bacteria in sulfur based mixnr process 3 1 1 autotrophic sulfur oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb the functional bacteria in the sulfur based mixnr process are mainly composed of h nrb and a sonrb with low sulfide concentration and show a dynamic succession table 2 in terms of a sonrb thiobacillus and arcobacter are the most frequently identified as the dominant genus by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2020a the substrate ratio is the primary factor affecting the abundance of a sonrb at high organics content a sonrb tends to be eliminated due to the slow growth rate using s0 as electron donors qiu et al 2020 observed that the abundance of thiobacillus was only 0 1 at a c n ratio of 2 7 in the case of dissolved sulfur components at the optimal substrate ratio s n c 1 1 2 1 as discussed in section 2 1 the relative abundances of a sonrb ranged from 20 to 40 table 2 which lead to the satisfying process performance the sulfide loading is another crucial factor in shaping the functional composition huang et al 2015b a previous study found that elevated sulfide loading from 1 2 to 3 6 kg s m 3 d 1 s n c 1 1 2 1 would lead to a shift in dominant bacteria from a sonrb arcobacter to h nrb azoarcus and pseudomonas with potential sulfur oxidation capacity which will be discussed in detail subsequently liu et al 2020a a similar phenomenon was also confirmed in another study zhang et al 2018 which found that the dominant genus shifted from thiobacillus to azoarcus and pseudomonas with increasing sulfide concentration 200 to 400 mg l 1 notably the sulfur oxidation capacity of pseudomonas plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the sulfur based mixnr system at high sulfide concentrations some other a sonrbs have also been reported in the mixnr system for example at the genus level thermomonas ferritrophicum and sulfurimonas table 2 notably in addition to reduced sulfur compounds ferritrophicum has the ability to reduce nitrate using fe2 or h2 as an electron donor in a study of optimizing the sdad process with the addition of feco3 the relative abundance of ferritrophicum was up to 10 and was suggested to be a non negligible participant in nitrate reduction zhu et al 2019 sulfurimonas were previously reported on a low relative abundance 1 86 in the sulfur based mixnr system ma et al 2021 compared with thiobacillus the sulfur oxidation capacity of sulfurimonas is mainly executed through sox dependent enzyme complex pathway and tends to use thiosulfate as substrate sievert et al 2008 synergy rather than competition between it and thiobacillus has been proposed in the study by wolff et al 2018 the positively correlated between thiobacillus and sulfurimonas was observed under antibiotic venlafaxine diatrizoate and tramadol stress therefore in the mixnr system sulfurimonas may play a positive role for the stabilization of microbial communities 3 1 2 heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria h nrb as shown in table 2 thauera azoarcus and pseudomonas as h nrb are commonly reported at the genus level with a relative abundance from 30 to 60 ma et al 2021 liang et al 2022b differences in carbon sources were the dominant factors affecting h nrb in the sulfur based mixnr system as methanol was used as a carbon source methyloversatilis tended to be the dominant h nrb while thauera became the dominant h nrb under ethanol conditions zhang et al 2015 besides ethanol proved to be a more desirable carbon source for achieving high bnr performance in the sulfur based mixnr process which may be due to its easier utilization by h nrb interestingly a recent study in the sulfur based mixnr system found a significant negative correlation between thauera and a sonrb in the microbial community network li et al 2022 therefore competitive relationships between functional bacteria may be a potential factor of the elimination of thauera when corncob powder was used as a carbon source simplicispira which has the ability to metabolize lignocellulose was enriched as heterotrophs liang et al 2022a in the study by ma et al 2021 simplicispira relative abundance 7 07 was likewise identified as a dominant h nrb with corncob as fillers in addition to the functional bacteria mentioned above some other h nrb have also been reported in sulfur based mixnr systems such as ferruginibacter saprospiraceae dokdonella and hydrogenophaga sun et al 2020 however the corresponding functions and contribution to nitrogen removal still need further investigation noteworthy the s0 recovery performance depends on the composition of the functional bacteria the study by huang et al 2017 found that the functional combination of thauera and sulfurimonas achieved better performance s0 recovery rate 77 9 than the combination of azoarcus and thiobacillus 45 1 in the same process azoarcus and pseudomonas drove better s0 recovery performance compared to thiobacillus which was also confirmed in another study zhang et al 2018 notably the sulfide oxidation capacity of some h nrb has also been widely reported and is crucial for the stable process performance of the sulfur based mixnr system huang et al 2015a huang et al 2017 which will be discussed in the next section 3 1 3 heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb the discovery of heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb has greatly expanded the knowledge of elemental cycles in ecosystems on the one hand h sonrb can perform denitrification through heterotrophic metabolic pathways on the other hand the electrons generated by sulfide oxidation can also support autotrophic denitrification so far h sonrb has been widely reported in natural conditions such as oceans and lakes lee et al 2014 callbeck et al 2019 as mentioned previously at a high sulfide loading rate the removal of pollutants c n and s from the sulfur based mixnr system is mainly dominated by h sonrb in the sulfur based mixnr reactors pseudomonas c27 in a egsb reactor 1 l chen et al 2013 thauera hdd in a biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor 12 56 ml huang et al 2018 thiopseudomonas in a uasb reactor 1 l tan et al 2016 azoarcus nsc3 in a egsb reactor 4 l huang et al 2021a have been successfully isolated in the laboratory core metabolic pathways of h sonrb represented by pseudomonas c27 although many h sonrb have been isolated and purified sulfur based mixotrophic metabolic functions are still not sufficiently annotated at the phylum or even at the genus level among the h sonrb in the mixnr systems pseudomonas c27 is of interest and has been systematically studied for nearly 10 years due to its efficient metabolic capacity herein the core metabolic pathways of pseudomonas c27 were systematically summarized for the first time to provide a metabolic reference for the understanding of h sonrb pseudomonas c27 was first isolated and purely cultured in an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor performing the sulfur based mixnr process by chen and lee et al additionally a variety of carbon sources such as acetate malate and ethanol can be utilized by pseudomonas c27 for heterotrophic denitrification along with sulfide oxidation and the optimal growth ph and temperature have been shown to be 9 0 and 25 30 c respectively chen et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 a the morphology of pseudomonas c27 is rod shaped more recently our understanding of the genetic and metabolic properties of pseudomonas c27 has been greatly expanded due to the rapid development of molecular biology genomic sequencing techniques fig 4 b shows the metabolic information of pseudomonas c27 based on a single cell library of genomic dna genbank accession number cp043320 zhang et al 2020a pseudomonas c27 metabolizes organic carbon sources through the tca pathway taking acetate as an example acetate is converted into acetyl coa under the catalysis of acetate kinase ak and phosphotransferase pta successively and then enters the tca cycle the conversion of sulfide is mainly catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr and persulfide dioxygenase pdo the former is responsible for catalyzing the formation of polysulfide or s from sulfide hydrogen sulfide which subsequently reacts with glutathione gsh to form gssh wang et al 2019 meanwhile gssh is catalyzed by the persulfide dioxygenase pdo enzyme to form sulfite which is further oxidation to thiosulfate by the regulation of downstream genes fig 4 b besides disproportionation reactions of sulfite and s0 including gssh and polysulfides are also critical contributions to the production of thiosulfate the electrons generated by the above tca and sulfur metabolism are transferred to the respiratory chain to provide electrons for the reduction of nitrate zhang et al 2020a since heterotrophic metabolic organic carbon confers higher growth rates for pseudomonas c27 compared to a sonrb this was confirmed in a recent study comparing the growth characteristics of pseudomonas c27 and thiobacillus denitrificans zhang et al 2022b besides the sulfide oxidation capacity of pseudomonas c27 is also higher than that of thiobacillus denitrificans zhang et al 2022b on the one hand pseudomonas c27 may obtain more energy for metabolism due to the operation of cysteine synthetase on the other hand pdo accelerates the conversion of sulfide yet thiobacillus denitrificans do not possess the relevant coding genes pdo gregersen et al 2011 therefore high sulfide concentrations may be one of the triggers for h sonrb to be dominant based on this the dynamic changes in community structure guided by h sonrb could be summarized in brief autotrophic and heterotrophic condition favors a sonrb and h nrb respectively the changes in the composition of functional microorganisms under mixotrophic condition depend on the sulfide concentration under low sulfide concentration the a sonrb and h nrb drives the maintenance of process performance in mixnr system zhang et al 2018 at high sulfide concentration a sonrb in the system is replaced by h sonrb and works in conjunction with h nrb zhang et al 2020a in this model a sonrb and h sonrb are responsible for the conversion of sulfur at low and high sulfide concentrations respectively metabolic enhancement of pseudomonas c27 by micro oxygen it is noteworthy that the metabolism of pseudomonas c27 could be enhanced under micro oxygen conditions zhang et al 2020b showed that under micro oxygen conditions pseudomonas c27 have a 1 4 times higher sulfide oxidation rate than that under an anaerobic environment further at the transcriptional level elevated sulfide concentration significantly promoted the expression of pdo gene zhang et al 2020b pdo enzymes are classified into three types according to their evolutionary relationship and topological structure xia et al 2017 the first type of pdo is widely distributed in gram negative bacteria the second type is most widely distributed but only exists in proteobacteria the third type has a broad distribution in both gram negative and positive bacteria according to the phylogenetic tree of pdo homologs fig 4 c the pdo in pseudomonas c27 should belong to the second type in fact the operation of pdo is a process that requires the involvement of oxygen liu et al 2014 thus under micro oxygen conditions a pathway preceded by pdo was activated in addition to sqr resulting in an enhanced sulfide oxidation capacity of pseudomonas c27 besides as an electron donor the presence of oxygen may also drive the intensification of electron cycling in the cell which thereby enhances the nutrients removal performance of pseudomonas c27 however existing studies on the electron transport pathways in pseudomonas c27 are still inadequate which should be highlighted in the future studies traditionally sulfide and do are considered to be the inhibitory for the denitrification process in contrast pseudomonas c27 could adapt to high sulfide concentrations section 3 1 3 1 and the nitrogen and sulfur metabolic capacity could be enhancement by micro oxygen thus enrichment and applications of h sonrb in the wastewater treatment system provide a new perspective on overcoming the toxicity of sulfide and do 3 2 functional bacteria in the anammox based mixnr process 3 2 1 anammox bacteria anaob in the stably anammox based mixnr process one stage pd a the relative abundance of anaob is typically in the of 1 10 by the results of by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing table 3 nevertheless anammox still contributed to most of the nitrogen removal a recent study demonstrated that anaob candidatus brocadia with only 0 66 relative abundance by metagenomic sequencing analysis could contribute 90 9 5 2 of the total nitrogen removal of the anammox based mixnr process according to the batching test through 15n stable isotope in treating domestic sewage and industrial nitrate wastewater liu et al 2021b specifically as shown in table 3 most of the reported anaob in anammox based mixnr systems are dominated by candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia and candidatus jettenia at the genus level according to 16s rrna high throughput sequencing with ca brocadia being widely regarded the enrichment advantage of ca brocadia in the anammox based mixnr system can be tentatively explained by the following reasons 1 more efficiently in metabolizing organic matter section 3 2 3 and 2 higher do tolerance although the anammox pathway is widely considered to be an anaerobic metabolism ca brocadia exhibits tolerance to micro oxygen 0 02 mg o2 l 1 seuntjens et al 2018 furthermore taking the brocadia dominated biomass as a target the potential oxygen detoxification mechanism based on key genes encoding superoxide dismutase sod and cytochrome c peroxidase ccp in ca brocadia sp was elucidated by ji et al 2019 thus considering the do in the nitrifying reflux fig 3 b the adaptation of ca brocadia to do may be the reason for their extensive enrichment in the anammox based mixnr process 3 higher growth rate based on the microbial growth kinetic ca brocadia sp has a higher growth rate than other freshwater anaob under almost all conditions zhang and okabe 2020 which facilitates the enrichment in the wastewater treatment systems it is noteworthy that the coexistence of diverse anaob in the anammox based mixnr process was also widely reported zhao et al 2021a du et al 2017a wang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2022 however the existing knowledge on the ecological niches of anaob among species is still inadequate thus there is an urgent need to improve the construction of phylogenetic trees as well as an in depth analysis of metabolic properties of anaob among species 3 2 2 heterotrophic partial denitrification bacteria h pdb another functional bacterium in the anammox based mixnr process is the heterotrophic partial denitrification bacteria h pdb as shown in fig 1 as shown in table 3 at genus level thauera denitratisoma and myxococcota are most widely reported in the anammox based mixnr process with relative abundance ranging from 5 45 h pdb is mainly categorized into two groups truncated denitrifiers and progressive onset po denitrifiers the pd capacity of truncated denitrifiers is due to the absence of nitrite reductase which allows nitrite to be accumulated in the case of po denitrifiers although the denitrification pathway is complete the gene that controlled nitrite reduction and their downstream genes are only partially expressed liu et al 2013 lycus et al 2017 myxococcota and thauera are the typical of po denitrifiers a previous study showed that the gene expression ratio of nirk to napa and narg encoding nitrate reductase in myxococcota metagenome assembled genome bins id mxy1 was 0 8 in an anammox based mixnr system zhuang et al 2022 the blockage in nitrite reduction and subsequent pathway is the reason for the realization of pd that is the po pathway thauera was likewise shown to perform the po pathway in the study by liu et al 2013 the addition of nitrate 1 mm to cultures of t terpenica a thauera strain resulted in an immediate decrease in nitrite reduction activity furthermore it is found that the nitrate reductase of t terpenica a thauera strain has preferential electron flow and that nirs was not detected at the transcriptional level when nitrate was sufficient liu et al 2013 supporting the po pathway additionally a recent study postulated the mechanism of nitrite accumulation in thauera genus from the perspective of carbon storage by the combined approaches to metagenomic and metatranscriptomic zhang et al 2020c first the metabolic potential for thauera aminoaromatica suggested that nitrate restricted the electron allocation and transcription by downstream denitrifying pathways interestingly the reducing power generated by the tca cycle is preferentially allocated to the synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate phb zhang et al 2020c in this model the phb can act as electron donors for nitrate reduction when the external carbon source is insufficient which favors the survival advantage of thauera under oligotrophic conditions zhang et al 2020c in addition to the genus mentioned above some other bacteria with potential pd functions have also been widely reported such as comamonas alishewanella ornatilinea and pseudomonas wang et al 2020 han et al 2021 however the existing studies are still extremely limited in the corresponding physiological properties and pd mechanisms 3 2 3 mixotrophic potentials of anammox bacteria as mentioned before the mixotrophic metabolism of anaob has been reported by several previous studies so far the organic metabolism ability of ca brocadia ca kuenenia and ca jettenia has been confirmed from a genetic perspective so far xiao et al 2021 in the study by güven et al 2005 anaob was found to have the ability to metabolize propionate and acetate furthermore at the species level candidatus brocadia fulgida tends to use acetate as substrates feng et al 2018 while candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus prefers propionate kartal et al 2007 interestingly the mixotrophic metabolic capacity of anaob favors the dominance in interspecific competition according to existing research anaob adopts the following two potential mixotrophic metabolic pathways 1 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway performed by anaob and 2 acetyl coa pathway in the dnra pathway organics can act as electron donors for nitrate nitrite reduction which is supported by the detection of the key gene nrfa in anaob park et al 2017 wang et al 2022b some small molecule acids like propionate and acetate have been shown to act as electron donors supporting the dnra performed by anaob güven et al 2005 besides the presence of ammonia as well as limited cod is beneficial for the dnra of anaob wang et al 2022b in another pathway the organics could be oxidized through the acetyl coa pathway and enters the tca cycle ji et al 2019 interestingly ca brocadia show an advantage in metabolizing acetate due to more complete acetate metabolic pathways xiao et al 2021 by the catalysis of acetyl coa synthetases acs acetate combines with coa to form acetyl coa which is subsequently bound in the tca cycle yang et al 2021 despite the presence of acs a recent study has shown that ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis do not have the ability to metabolize acetate as a carbon source lawson et al 2021 although the mixotrophic characteristic of anaob has been highlighted it is insufficient to rely on this for the treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater however genome based evidence suggests that some physiological properties of anaob such as eps secretion aggregation and biological activity are related to mixotrophic metabolism the research by feng et al 2018 suggested that the mixotrophic growth anaob obtained higher biomass yield than autotrophic growth which favors the prevalence of anaob in nutrient limited conditions thus the exploration of the mixotrophic metabolism of anammox bacteria provides a new perspective for the optimization of the anammox system 4 microbial interaction in functional consortia in the mixnr system both sulfur based and anammox based mixnr the conversion of nitrogen is accomplished by the collaboration of multiple functional microorganisms thus in addition to the functional interpretation knowledge related to microbial interactions will provide deeper interpretation and guidance for the optimization and regulation of the mixnr process 4 1 microbially interaction in sulfur based mixnr system in the sulfur based mixnr system as shown in fig 5 a the removal of nitrogen is performed by a sonrb and h nrb h sonrb together and the sulfide is mainly oxidized by a sonrb and gets accumulated intracellularly in the form of s0 on the one hand the production and accumulation of s0 provide the cell with a store of electron donors cui et al 2019 on the other hand this process is also a critical basis of the mixnr system to achieve the desulfurization function huang et al 2016 it is noteworthy that the presence of h sonrb as discussed in section 3 1 in the mixnr system also performs the function of sulfur metabolism in terms of carbon there is a strong metabolic interaction between a sonrb and h nrb h sonrb when inorganic carbon sources are scarce in the system first the organic matter represented by acetate is oxidized by h nrb h sonrb to produce co2 then the co2 can be used by a sonrb to synthesize organic matter through carbon fixation pathways like the calvin benson bassham cbb cycle huang et al 2021a meanwhile the organic matter produced can in turn be reused by h nrb h sonrb thus enabling the coupling of carbon metabolism among bacteria interestingly some recent studies have detected the expression of methane synthesis related genes in the mixnr system huang et al 2021a li et al 2021b the related studies provide potential possibilities for achieving energy recovery from the mixnr system and expand the existing knowledge on carbon metabolism in mixnr system this microbial interaction promotes the establishment of functional redundancy which facilitates the stabilization of process performance louca et al 2018 through the technology of dna based stable isotope probing dna sip xing et al 2018 demonstrated that the symbiosis of autotrophs heterotrophs and mixotrophs could significantly improve the nitrogen removal performance of the process specifically bicarbonate h13co3 and acetate 13ch3 13coo labeled with 13c were fed separately to mixnr system followed by centrifugation of the dna and precise identification of autotrophs and heterotrophs by high throughput sequencing xing et al 2018 furthermore arenimonas and rubellimicrobium were identified as mixotrophs thus the sulfur based mixnr process has a competitive advantage in terms of stability of nitrogen removal compared to the henr or aunr based processes additionally microbial interactions are of equal ecological importance it has been reported that the mixotrophic conditions can improve trophic transfer efficiency and facilitate carbon sequestration in marine ecosystems ward and follows 2016 besides the mixotrophic conditions driven by the sulfur cycle are a non negligible contribution to global nutrient cycling and energy flows canfield don et al 2010 and the complex and tight microbial interactions among bacteria are intrinsically driven to achieve ecological functions 4 2 microbial interactions in anammox based mixnr system the most notable microbial interaction between anaob and h pdb is the conversion of nitrogen as discussed in section 3 2 2 in addition there is may also a strong interaction in terms of carbon metabolism firstly as shown in fig 5 b as the inorganic carbon source the co2 produced by h pdb can be fixed by anaob via the wood ljungdahl pathway to support the autotrophic activities strous et al 2006 kuenen 2008 further for some large molecules of organic matter microbial interaction between anaob and h pdb is performed by cross feeding it is well known that anammox consortia are often accompanied by a large amount of eps consisting mainly of proteins with polysaccharides jia et al 2017 due to the presence of some eps modifying enzymes yu 2020 eps can be partially hydrolyzed with polypeptides and amino acids as the main products this organic matter from the eps matrix especially amino acids can be utilized by h pdb as a potential carbon source besides some secondary metabolites secreted by anaob during the carbon metabolism process also have this function zhao et al 2018 a recent study identified the existence of amino acids cross feeding between ca kuenenia and thauera zhang et al 2021c which should be highlighted due to the pd function of thauera section 3 2 2 furthermore in another study the draft genomes of chb1 recovered from a sequencing batch reactor 5 l do 0 5 0 5 mg l 1 ph 6 8 8 0 showed that chb1 in anammox consortia lacks catabolic pathways of amino acids with high biosynthetic cost lawson et al 2017 in contrast anaob expresses nearly all of the amino acid synthesis pathways lawson et al 2017 thus the less costly amino acids derived from anaob compensate to some extent for the metabolic deficiency of h pdb interestingly anaob does not seem to be an unrequited contributor to this symbiotic model the study by speth et al 2016 showed that the reduction of nitrate to nitrite is coupled with amino acid oxidation in heterotrophic bacteria besides the release of ammonia is also increased due to amino acid oxidation speth et al 2016 thus h pdb appears to compensate for anaob in the form of substrates supplementation through nitrogen metabolism while taking up amino acids in addition to the amino acids the metabolic exchange of b vitamins between anaob and heterotrophic bacteria has also been identified in several studies zhang et al 2021c lawson et al 2017 feng et al 2019 in brief the anaob has the ability to synthesize b vitamins and supply b vitamins to members of the members of anammox microbial community however the specific role of b vitamins in the anammox system remains to be further explored in fact the microbial interaction mentioned above based on cross feeding is widely distributed over the anammox system and has been reported on anammox consortia with ca brocadia zhao et al 2018 ca jettenia feng et al 2019 and ca kuenenia sun et al 2019 as the core species respectively in addition to facilitating the process performance this microbial interaction of cross feeding is also ecologically crucial due to the relatively strict metabolic conditions anaob in natural ecosystems often suffers from starvation stress and the microbial interaction between anaob and other bacteria would contribute to the stability of the anammox system under starvation conditions as confirmed in a recent study that observed the upregulation of genes related to amino acid biosynthesis and protein degradation wang et al 2022a besides the microbial interaction may also affect the aggregation ability of anammox consortia zhao et al 2018 and the aggregation behavior of anaob has been considered as an important ecological strategy to resist unfavorable environmental conditions zhang et al 2021b therefore the microbial interactions based on public goods cellular metabolites and signaling in the anammox system should be further emphasized in future studies both for wastewater treatment processes and natural ecosystems 5 significance of mixnr process for carbon reduction the significance of the mixnr process for carbon reduction is illustrated in fig 6 in terms of domestic sewage under mainstream conditions the anammox based mixnr should be considered first as mentioned the traditional heterotrophic denitrification based bnr process is limited by carbon source dependence it has been reported that the conventional bnr process has difficulty in achieving high nitrogen removal performance when the c n ratio is below 5 due to the insufficient carbon source yang et al 2007 while the carbon consumption will be greatly reduced by anammox based mixnr from the source because the conventional heterotrophic denitrification does not need to be completely performed it has been reported that the bnr process combining anammox with henr will reduce the carbon source consumption by 40 80 compared to the conventional henr based process while enhancing the nitrogen removal performance cao et al 2019 cao et al 2021 in terms of energy recovery only about 20 of cod in municipal wastewater can be recovered in the form of energy through anaerobic digestion liu et al 2019 most of the remaining carbon is released in the form of co2 in the traditional bnr process in fact the organic energy contained in wastewater is 9 10 times greater than the energy consumption of the treatment process shizas and bagley 2004 so far seven representative wwtps around the world has achieved carbon neutrality through the rational conversion to organic energy accompanied by carbon neutral efficiency in the range of 100 160 hao et al 2015 the most representative one is the strass wwtp in austria which achieved a carbon neutral efficiency of 160 through the a b anammox process combined with anaerobic digestion flow 27500 m3 d 1 influent cod 605 mg l 1 reardon 2014 however the carbon neutrality process in chinese wwtps is widely limited due to the low organic energy potential of municipal wastewater cod 200 400 mg l 1 hao et al 2015 thus it is advantageous to retain the organic energy in the wastewater to achieving energy self sufficiency and carbon neutrality in the wastewater treatment system the mixnr process has a low dependence on carbon sources especially anammox based mixnr which will contribute to the retention of organic energy what s more considering that waste sludge treatment account for about 30 of wwtps operating shen et al 2015 reducing sludge production is also a necessary strategy to achieve carbon reduction the sludge yield of the mixnr process will also be reduced as discussed in section 2 1 due to the slow growth rate of autotrophic bacteria therefore the mixnr process is promising both in terms of carbon input and output in addition to co2 the emission of n2o is also a significant entire carbon footprint of wwtps and accounts for about 80 duan et al 2021 it is reported that the global warming potential led by n2o is about 300 times higher than co2 while wwtps contribute about 3 of the global n2o emissions liu et al 2019 a recent view by duan et al 2021 proposed that henr is the source as well as the sink of n2o in wwtps from the metabolic pathway figs 4 and 5 the activity of n2o reductase encoded by nosz is intrinsically responsible for determining the accumulation of n2o in addition to nitrite and ph as discussed in section 2 1 3 sulfide and do were other crucial factors affecting the activity of n2o reductase it has been reported that 0 04 mg l 1 of sulfide h2s s can inhibit the reduction of n2o by 50 in the denitrification process pan et al 2013 interestingly it seems to be different when do and sulfide are considered together according to the very recent study the presence of molecular oxygen reduced the emission of n2o by 36 9 in the sulfur based mixnr system initial mass transport oxygen ranging from 0 021 to 0 062 mm which highlight the reciprocal detoxification mechanism based on the sulfur oxygen cycling shao et al 2022 in brief sulfides were detoxified to the reduced sulfur with low toxic e g thiosulfate and sulfite by bio oxidation and the capture of free oxygen by pdo prevented further translocation of the inhibitor into the periplasm shao et al 2022 for the wwtps the mainstream process flow provides sufficient conditions for the incubation of the sulfur oxygen cycling as discussed in section 3 1 3 2 which offers a novel perspective on n2o reduction thus more on site investigation and the regulation means based on sulfur oxygen cycling are urgently needed for future study the low n2o emissions in the anammox based mixnr process have also been confirmed by some studies du et al 2019 du et al 2016 almost no n2o 0 005 mg l 1 was produced in anammox based mixnr process at a low c n 3 2 du et al 2016 in anammox metabolism fig 5 b n2h4 no and nh2oh but not n2o are intermediates which avoids the production of n2o at source thus henr process was the only source sink of n2o in the processes meanwhile nitrite can be rapidly consumed by anaob which avoids the increase of n2o due to nitrite accumulation frostegård et al 2022 6 conclusions and perspectives in the present study the recent advance and microbial mechanisms of mixnr process guided by sdad and anammox have been critically reviewed existing research and engineering experience consistently indicate that the anammox based mixnr has significant technical advantages in breaking through the limitations of traditional bnr processes meanwhile the sulfur based mixnr has shown great potential in dealing the multiple pollutants sulfate cod and ammonium contained wastewater and the tight microbial interactions between autotrophs and heterotrophs are also conducive to the enhancement of the stability for wastewater treatment process however it is still inadequate in terms of engineering implementation fundamental knowledge of the functional mechanisms of bacteria is still lacking herein several future research directions and targets aimed to fill the related gap are proposed 1 key operating parameters although some of the optimum operating parameters of the mixnr process such as substrate ratio hrt ph and temperature have been relatively comprehensively captured by existing studies in practice there are often fluctuations in influent quality thus the critical value or the parameter interval that ensures the stability of the process is also worth exploring for example it is recommended to establishing series parameters related to the spatial distribution of substrates and do as discussed in section 3 1 3 2 do is a crucial factor affecting mixnr activity therefore considering the spatial distribution of do is an effective solution to optimize the reactor configuration and it is recommended to optimize the key parameters on the pilot and full scale system besides the accumulation of engineering experience is still needed 2 expanding the application of mixnr through the combined processes the discovery of several novel bnr pathways such as damo has received much attention in recent years the successful coupling of anammox with n damo is also seen as a forward looking technology to drive the bnr process the potential applicability of damo is also highlighted by the report of ch4 in some sulfur based mixnr systems section 4 1 besides in dealing with anaerobic digestion effluent and municipal wastewater an innovative mixnr process based on coupling anaob a sonrb and n damo archaea with h pdb has also been proposed by zhang et al 2020d the combined process can on the one hand extend the application of mixnr for example by utilizing ch4 via damo or fe via ferric ammonium oxidation additionally the combination of multiple functional microbes facilitates the stability of the mixnr system as discussed in section 4 therefore future studies are encouraged to try combinations of bnr pathways at laboratory scale based on practicality and to determine the feasibility and applicability of the combinations 1 identification of new bacteria and their functional interpretation the isolation and purification of h sonrb pseudomonas c27 have greatly expanded the knowledge of sulfur based mixnr systems however studies based on bacterial isolation in anammox systems are still very limited the acquisition of pure strains and their metabolic reconstruction are direct evidence for functional interpretation as well as a powerful tool to optimize and guide the process besides the role and contribution to multifunctional microbes represented by h sonrb in mainstream wastewater treatment systems is still rarely interpreted hence future studies are required to focus on the exploration and functional interpretation of novel microbes to extends our understanding of wastewater treatment systems 2 focus on energy resource recovery from the mixnr process in addition to nitrogen removal performance resource and energy recovery should also be looked at in the context of carbon reduction in addition to the conventional s0 and ch4 it is also relevant to recover new useful resources such as eps yu 2020 biopolymers li et al 2021a and sulfated polysaccharides liu et al 2021a and electrical energy under this concept the mixnr process is expected to be considered as a processing plant for the product while exercising the function of nitrogen removal therefore the characterization and quantification of the by products of the mixnr process especially dissolved organic compounds still need to be fully penetrated besides further interpretation of the metabolism and interactions of bacterial communities not limited to functional bacteria will facilitate the determination of the potential for energy resource recovery in addition to the points mentioned above the accumulation of engineering experience and microbial metabolic associations should also not be overlooked in summary mixnr technology has shown great potential in optimizing the conventional bnr process in fact mixotrophic conditions are common in natural ecosystems and the design and implementation of wastewater treatment processes should follow the laws of nature in order to achieve a true sense of sustainability with the above proposed targets it is expected to turn the traditional bnr process into a more efficient and energy saving mode through the mixnr technology credit authorship contribution statement quan zhang

corresponding author biological nitrogen removal bnr is one of the most important environmental concerns in the field of wastewater treatment the conventional bnr process based on heterotrophic nitrogen removal henr is suffering from several limitations including external carbon source dependence excessive sludge production and greenhouse gas emissions through the mediation of autotrophic nitrogen removal aunr mixed mixotrophic nitrogen removal mixnr offers a viable solution to the optimization of the bnr process here the recent advance and characteristics of mixnr process guided by sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sdad and anammox are summarized in this review additionally we discuss the functional microorganisms in different mixnr systems shedding light on metabolic mechanisms and microbial interactions the significance of mixnr for carbon reduction in the bnr process has also been noted the knowledge gaps and the future research directions that may facilitate the practical application of the mixnr process are highlighted overall the prospect of the mixnr process is attractive and this review will provide guidance for the future implementation of mixnr process as well as deciphering the microbially metabolic mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological nitrogen removal mixotrophic sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification anammox data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen is an essential component of all living organisms on earth meanwhile environmental issues related to nitrogen pollution are also a global concern nowadays it has been reported that 50 of the food produced by human society needs to rely on industrial nitrogen fertilizers which doubles the input of nitrogen to the ecosystem increasing the risk of water eutrophication kuypers et al 2018 nitrous oxide n2o regarded as one type of greenhouse gas ghg contributes 300 times more of ghg than carbon dioxide co2 at the same unit liu et al 2019 worse n2o emissions have also increased in the last decade due to the productive activities of human society kuypers et al 2018 to deal with the nitrogen pollution various nitrogen removal technologies have been developed among which biological nitrogen removal bnr is favored due to its high performance and economic efficiency the bnr process is performed by heterotrophs or autotrophs or both of them which convert various forms of nitrogen into n2 heterotrophic nitrogen removal henr refers to heterotrophic denitrification in this study is a process of reducing nitrate nitrite to n2 using organic compounds as electron donors which is most widely applied in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps fig 1 nevertheless the henr process is mainly suffering from some limitations for instance external carbon sources requirement excessive sludge production and n2o emissions liu et al 2019 instead of organics autotrophic denitrification uses inorganics e g h2 s2 s0 s2o3 2 fe2 mn2 as electron donors fig 1 which can conquer the above bottleneck to some extent pang and wang 2021 aunr process however is also limited by the long start up stage and high hydraulic retention time hrt with limited biomass due to the slow growth rate of autotrophic bacteria thus extensive studies have attempted to combine the aunr and henr to optimize the bnr process besides nitrogen removal microbes of mixotrophic metabolism are also gaining widely attentions collectively it is referred to here as mixed mixotrophic nitrogen removal mixnr on the one hand the mixnr system inherits the advantages of both henr and aunr and can achieve a high nitrogen loading rate while avoiding a series of issues caused by reliance on external carbon sources the tight microbial interactions between autotrophs and heterotrophs in the mixnr system help to improve the stability of the system and thus optimize the bnr performance in terms of mixnr sulfur based mixnr and anammox based mixnr have gained the most widely attention the former relies on the coupling of autotrophic sulfur oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb with heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria h nrb while the construction of the anammox based mixnr system lies in the realization of the coupling of anammox bacteria anaob and h nrb wang et al 2005 and chen et al 2008 constructed a sulfur based mixnr process which successfully achieved efficient synergistic removal of organics nitrogen and sulfur pollutants based on the sulfur recycling the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process designed by professor chen s group achieved great success in reducing energy consumption and sludge reduction lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 in the sani process although aunr is considered to be the main contributor to nitrogen removal mixnr due to the presence of organics is in fact not negligible as well qian et al 2015a wu et al 2016 in the anammox based mixnr the terminating nitrate no3 n reduction to nitrite no2 n can be achieved in henr namely partial denitrification pd which provides the substrate no2 n for anammox and achieves the original utilization of by product no3 n du et al 2019 besides the presence of organic matter in the actual wastewater also supports the construction of anammox based mixnr thus the mixotrophic condition is not negligible in the promotion of anammox technology and regulating the ecological balance between h nrb and anaob is crucial in summary organic carbon org c nitrogen and reduced sulfur components are necessary to establish the sulfur based mixnr process therefore the sulfur based mixnr process lies in dealing with compound pollutants especially sulfur containing wastewater meanwhile in terms of mainstream wastewater the anammox based mixnr process provides an effective solution for the improvement of the conventional bnr process thus the mixnr process lays a foundation for the development of the bnr process toward more efficiency and sustainability herein as shown in fig 2 the recent advance and status of mixnr process guided by sdad and anammox are systematically summarized in this review mainly including the key configurations of bioreactor functional microorganisms microbially metabolic interactions and the applications the existing knowledge gaps about the metabolic mechanisms and microbial interactions in mixnr system will be discussed furthermore some perspectives and future trends for applications will be put forward the obtained knowledge could facilitate the improvement and optimization of traditional bnr technology by reducing carbon footprint and increasing process performance 2 biological nitrogen removal process based on mixnr 2 1 sulfur based mixnr process sulfide s0 and thiosulfate are most commonly used as the reduced sulfur components among them the sulfur based mixnr process using sulfide as electron donor has been studied intensively including process flow operating parameters and mathematical modeling herein this section will sort out the sulfur based mixnr process in line with the multiple reduced sulfur components 2 1 1 sulfide as electron donor process flow and performance org c nitrogen and sulfur commonly coexist in a variety of actual wastewaters such as flue gas desulfurization cod 500 mg l 1 no2 n 30 mg l 1 so4 2 s 500 mg l 1 and pharmaceutical wastewater cod 10000 13000 mg l 1 nh4 n 500 700 mg l 1 so4 2 s 1000 1666 mg l 1 which highlight the attractive potentials of the sulfur based mixnr process zhang et al 2020a the mixotrophic conditions org c sulfide and no3 n can be constructed in a practical application through the reasonable planning of the process as shown in fig 3 a in the anaerobic unit sulfate is first reduced in the presence of heterotrophic sulfate reduction bacteria h srb the sulfide produced accompanied by the org c and no3 n refluxed from aerobic unit as shown in fig 3 a supports the construction of the mixnr system in the second unit the sulfur based mixnr process the second unit in fig 3 a was firstly constructed in a fluidized bed reactor 15 l by gommers et al 1988 and stable process performance was maintained with acetate 17 7 mg l 1 as org c during 25 days of operation removal rate 3 kg s m 3 d 1 6 kg c m 3 d 1 5 kg n m 3 d 1 in a similar reactor configuration 4 l the sulfur based mixnr process achieved complete removal 100 removal efficiency of acetate nitrate and sulfide at an influent no3 n concentration of 150 mg l 1 during 490 days of operation huang et al 2021a high levels of sulfate emissions are a potential environmental risk which can lead to acidification of surface and groundwater and even endanger human health ding and zeng 2022 sulfate the end production of the sulfur driven denitrification process sdad is also a potential hazard in the odours emission of the water environment it is reported that high concentrations of sulfate will lead to odor 400 mg l 1 and even diarrhea 1000 1200 mg l 1 zhang et al 2021a besides sulfate has the potential to be reduced to sulfide in river substrate and pipelines which increases the environmental risk according to the u s epa the maximum sulfate concentration in drinking water is 250 mg l 1 zhang et al 2021a therefore many studies have avoided sulfate over emissions by pursuing the recovery s0 in the sulfur based mixnr process as shown in fig 3 d s0 is an intermediate product in the oxidation process of sulfides hence if s0 is available as an end product conversion of sulfide to s0 then the sulfur resources in the reactor and effluent can be recovered by simple physical separation from the perspective of functional bacteria modulation and coupling between h nrb and a sonrb are crucial to achieving efficient sulfur recovery while considering nitrogen removal the functional mechanisms of the sulfur based mixnr system are shown in fig 3 d first sulfide is oxidized by nitrate to s0 and generates nitrite in the presence of a sonrb r 1 then the oxidation reaction proceeds further to produce sulfate with n2 r 2 from the perspective of henr h nrb uses nitrate r 3 or nitrite r 4 to oxidize organic matter to produce n2 and co2 previous studies had shown that the reaction rate of r 1 is about three times that of r 2 yuan et al 2019 which provides the basis for s0 recovery and the accumulation of nitrite was effectively avoided by the action of h nrb chen et al 2017 in our previous study a high s conversion ratio 86 7 was achieved at a sulfide concentration 400 mg l 1 zhang et al 2018 the setup of reflux by proportionally refluxing the effluent to the influent has proven to be an effective means of improving the s0 recovery performance with a reflux ratio of 3 1 yuan et al 2014 achieved a maximum s conversion ratio of more than 90 recently the ph condition has also been shown to be one of the crucial factors affecting s0 recovery jia et al 2022 found that alkaline conditions 7 0 ph 10 2 were more favorable for the recovery s0 conversion ratio of 77 0 in the mixnr system compared to only about 10 under acidic conditions ph 7 4 sulfur based mixnr also provides a viable path for the optimization of the sani process the flow sheet of conventional sani process is similar to fig 1 a sulfur based mixnr with sulfide as electron donor except that s0 is not well recovered and nitrogen removal relies mainly on aunr the long hydraulic retention time hrt 34 h is a barrier to the full scale application of this process when aunr dominates lu et al 2012 by increasing the concentration of influent cod 490 750 mg l 1 to enhance the contribution of henr qian et al 2015b constructed the mixnr system 28 heterotrophic and 72 autotrophic in the conventional sani process which increased the denitrification rate by 6 times moreover it inherited the advantage of low sludge production 0 03 kg vss kg 1 cod besides using anaerobic digested sludge as seeding sludge may also be a factor of achieving the excellent process performance it is noteworthy that sdad and anammox could be theoretically coupled in the anoxic unit nh4 n from influent no2 n from partial nitrification or partial denitrification via sdad of the sani process based on this huo et al 2022 proposed a modified sani process coupled anammox with sdad as the core of bnr recently this modified sani process eliminates the need for a high internal circulation and avoids the requirement for strict control of split flow ratio which facilitates simplified the operation and saves costs huo et al 2022 therefore the sulfur based mixnr technology also provides a viable option for expanding the application of the sani process optimization of the operating parameters the working parameters are critical in determining the performance of the sulfur based mixnr process as shown in table 1 the process performance is firstly relying upon the ratio of substrates s n c the research of chen et al 2008 showed for the first time that the optimal molar ration of c n in the sulfur based mixnr system is 1 26 1 and 1 1 2 for s n influent no3 n 87 5 mg l 1 nre 99 as the increasing no3 n concentrations no3 n 220 0 mg l 1 wang et al 2015 found that the nre obtained by sulfur based mixnr process was up to 90 under the s n c of 1 1 4 4 8 although excess electron donors org c or sulfides provide a safeguard for nitrate removal in the case of the mix process this also leads to a disruption of the balance of the microbial community and deteriorates the process performance zhang et al 2018 on this basis recent studies have shown that the appropriate s n c was generally determined as 1 1 2 1 as shown in table 1 it is noteworthy that the micro oxygen conditions have a positive effect on improving the s0 recovery and bnr performance of the sulfur based mixnr process table 1 as shown in fig 3 a the liquid returning to the mixnr unit usually contains a certain amount of dissolved oxygen do 0 5 mg l 1 which leads to an inhibition of heterotrophs dominated activated sludge denitrification process li et al 2017 a previous study showed that do at 0 09 mg l 1 significantly inhibited heterotrophs dominated denitrification 30 reduction in rate oh and silverstein 1999 thus the response of sulfur based mixnr system to micro oxygen should be highlighted in the batch test chen et al 2010 first found the enhancement of mixnr performance by micro oxygen conditions do 0 5 mg l 1 but observed the accumulation of nitrite subsequently lots of studies in the past 10 years have confirmed the positive effects of micro oxygen on the sulfur based mixnr system xu et al 2017a zhang et al 2020a wang et al 2016a a high concentration of sulfide can inhibit the activity of microorganisms in the wastewater treatment process wang et al 2016b at a sulfide loading rate of 8 16 kg s m 3 d 1 wang et al 2015 successfully achieved a s conversion ratio of 100 under micro oxygen conditions do 0 1 0 3 mg l 1 furthermore the enhancement of the sulfur based mixnr system by micro oxygen has also been deciphered in a series of studies on microbial community ecological succession xu et al 2017a wang et al 2016a and genes response of key bacterial zhang et al 2020a details will be discussed in the next section therefore the sulfur based mixnr process is expected to show technical advantages over the conventional henr based denitrification process of dealing with the suppression of do and sulfide mathematical modeling mathematical simulation is an important part of the design and optimal operation of wastewater biological treatment systems in the case of sulfide as an electron donor xu et al 2014 successfully developed a kinetic model applicable to the sulfur based mixnr process by modifying the classical activated sludge model ams and anaerobic digestion model adm of the international water association iwa this model contained the following six processes 1 oxidation of sulfide to s0 with no3 n as electron acceptor 2 oxidation of sulfide to s0 with no2 n as electron acceptor 3 reduction of no3 n to no2 n with org c as electron donor 4 reduction of no2 n to n2 with org c as electron donor 5 oxidation of s0 to so4 2 with no3 n as electron acceptor and oxidation of s0 to so4 2 with no2 n as electron acceptor xu et al 2014 besides the biomass was also introduced as a constant xi as well according to the best fit parameters the r2 of the fits was all above 0 95 in describing the removal of sulfide org c and no3 n meanwhile the obtained model provided an effective prediction of the conversion ratio of s0 xu et al 2014 the model further well described the dynamic removal of org c nitrate and sulfide considering the growth characteristics of functional microbial xu et al 2017b as mentioned before micro oxygen conditions have a reinforcing effect on the sulfur based mixnr system in the sulfur based mixnr system previous studies introduced the parameter r os molar ratio of oxygen to sulfide into the model further determining the optimal r os interval 1 0 2 0 xu et al 2013 however this r os interval 1 0 2 0 does not seem to support the operation of continuous operation in the study by zhang et al 2020a using micro oxygen for the enhancement of sulfur based mixnr process the r os under continuous flow operation was calculated to be 2 5 10 3 the highest r os in another similar study calculated as about 0 08 sun et al 2020 on the one hand the experiment implemented by xu et al 2013 was batching test which may not well to support the operation of continuous flow on the other hand the do in the batching test reached up to 150 300 mg l 1 which is undesirable for practical nevertheless the development of relevant models is a simple and efficient mean of describing process performance and interpreting the response of environmental factors which provides an important theoretical basis and technical guidance for the application of the sulfur based mixnr process thus the mathematical model regarding the sulfur based mixnr process needs to be further optimized in order to guide the practical via the operation of continuous flow process 2 1 2 s0 as electron donor instead of dissolved reduced sulfur compounds s can also be used as an electron donor for low cost nitrogen removal processes because of the wide range of sources zhang et al 2021a as shown in fig 3 c the s0 based packed bed is the most widely employed for this process however the solubility of s0 is extremely low 5 μg l 1 at 25 c which limits the bioavailability boulegue 1978 the mixnr system provides a viable solution for the issue mentioned above in the presence of org c as shown in fig 3 c part of s0 will be reduced to hs under the action of heterotrophic sulfate reduction bacteria h srb zhang et al 2021a subsequently polysulfides could be generated spontaneously through the abiotic reaction between sulfide and sulfur nucleophilic attack under neutral or alkaline conditions fig 3 c rampelotto 2016 the higher bioavailability of polysulfides compared to s0 greatly enhances the performance of the nitrogen removal process using woodchips as a carbon source the mixnr system constructed by li et al 2016 resulted in a nearly 5 6 times improvement in nitrogen removal performance compared to the s0 based sdad process similar results have also been confirmed by other studies wan et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 and further suggested that the c n of 0 25 0 5 is the optimal interval for improving nitrogen removal performance qiu et al 2020 controlling the neutral environment is also an important guarantee for the efficient operation of the s0 based sdad process zhang et al 2021a s0 based sdad process is an acid producing process and the removal of one gram of nitrate will be accompanied by a depletion of 4 57 g of alkalinity zhang et al 2021a in contrast henr is a process that can produce alkalinity as shown in fig 3 therefore the sulfur based mixnr process has a lower alkalinity consumption than the s0 based aunr process liu et al 2009 in a previous study the ph of mixnr and sdad effluent were 8 04 and 7 6 respectively at the same influent ph of 7 5 which indicate that the alkalinity produced by henr was largely consumed by sdad liu et al 2009 furthermore the sulfate production in the s0 based packed bed and related processes will also be decreased due to the reduction of alkalinity consumption in the study by zhang et al 2015 the sulfate production of the sdad process s0 as electron donor was about 700 mg l 1 while in the case of mixnr it is only 161 mg l 1 details related to ph and sulfate production in the related processes have been systematically discussed and summarized by previous studies wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a overall the intervention of mixnr is a compromised approach to reduce the risk of secondary sulfate contamination of the sdad processes as well as to enhance the nitrogen removal performance 2 1 3 thiosulfate as electron donor among the common reduced sulfur components thiosulfate will lead to the highest sdad performance due to its excellent bioavailability and low toxicity zhang et al 2021a however the decreased ph of the thiosulfate based sdad process leads to large amounts of sulfate in the effluent specifically the complete reduction of 1 g no3 n will be accompanied by the production of 12 15 g sulfate sun et al 2020 additional costs will be incurred to control sulfate production through ph regulation the mixnr with thiosulfate as electron donor was implemented by some studies to cope with the related issues a previous study showed that the effluent sulfate of the process with thiosulfate as electron donors was above 250 mg l 1 yet it was only 150 mg l 1 with the mixed electron donors org c and thiosulfate process sun et al 2020 moreover the mixed electron donors could also reduce the production of n2o by about 50 sun et al 2020 on the one hand the mixed electron donor is more conducive to complete denitrification thus effectively avoiding the accumulation of nitrite which is a factor contributing to the increased n2o production frostegård et al 2022 on the other hand n2o reductase is easily inhibited at low ph conditions and the mixed electron donor process will effectively avoid excessive reduction of ph zhang et al 2020d in another case the mixnr mediated by thiosulfate in the floating treatment wetland can promote nitrogen removal by plants and bacteria synergistically gao et al 2018 nevertheless the unstable chemical nature of thiosulfate makes its applications for engineering problematic therefore the current process with thiosulfate as an electron donor is mostly a laboratory scale in addition to thiosulfate some other reduced sulfur components such as sulfite could also theoretically support the establishment of mixnr system however relevant studies are still lacking the previously developed models focus only on the sdad process and are mostly described simply by zero half or first order reactions xu et al 2016 koenig and liu 2001 huiliñir et al 2020 and heterotrophic process was not well considered only in the study by koenig and liu 2001 sdad and henr were compared by half order reaction and it was shown that henr had a higher reaction rate than sdad while thiosulfate drove better compared to s0 in addition the indirect coupling of electrons ice model was developed to evaluate the electron competition between s0 and thiosulfate in the sdad system yang et al 2022 therefore the application of mathematical models in the mixnr process with thiosulfate or s0 as electron donor is still inadequate 2 1 4 practical and engineering applications as far as applications the sulfur based mixnr process using sulfide as an electron donor is at the forefront so far the process shown in fig 3 a has been successfully applied to the treatment of food processing influent cod 2000 mg l 1 so4 2 1500 mg l 1 nh4 n 300 mg l 1 scale 4 5 l hrt from 24 h to 12 h yuan et al 2014 and pharmaceutical wastewater influent cod 9000 14000 mg l 1 so4 2 3000 5000 mg l 1 scale 15 l hrt 24 h zhao et al 2014 in the above case while achieving satisfactory performance a high sulfur recovery rate was obtained which effectively avoids secondary pollution the s0 production rate reached 90 in the study of yuan et al 2014 in terms of municipal domestic wastewater the sani process is undoubtedly the most successful case in recent years the land occupation and sludge production can be reduced by 30 40 and 60 70 respectively in the sani process wu et al 2016 it is reported that the full size sani scale of the mixnr unit 672 m3 flow rate 800 1000 m3 d 1 hrt 2 5 h process will reduce operating costs by 50 compared to the traditional process in hong kong wu et al 2016 besides lu et al 2012 developed a stable state model for the pilot scale sani process which is an important guide for the design and parameter input of the process the feasibility of the sulfur based mixnr process with s0 and corncob as fillers scale 0 8 l hrt 1 5 h the mass of s0 and limestone 176 39 g and 259 94 g in treating actual effluent from simulated wwtps was also verified ma et al 2021 over 98 nitrate removal efficiency was obtained in that study ma et al 2021 which providing a feasible strategy for wwtps to meet the demand of deep nitrogen removal 2 2 anammox based mixnr process 2 2 1 process flow and performance as an efficient and economical aunr technology anammox has attracted much attention since its discovery zhang et al 2021b however the shortage of nitrite in the actual wastewater and the production of nitrate 11 production as no3 n have limited the application of this technology du et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in order to cope with this technical bottleneck partial nitrification pn and pd were proposed successively many previous reviews have systematically summarized pn a versus pd a du et al 2019 wu et al 2022 cao et al 2021 in brief the technical core of pn is the enrichment of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob while eliminating nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob to achieve the accumulation of nitrite however do srt and free ammonia fa or free nitrous acid fna modulation strategies are not satisfactory in maintaining stable pn performance du et al 2019 zhao et al 2021b compared with pn a coupling pd controlling henr at the nitrite stage with anammox namely pd a one stage has been proven to be a viable option due to the low facility cost and simplicity of operation du et al 2019 the core of pd a is the coupling of aunr anammox and henr pd which is a successful mixnr system as shown in fig 3 b nitrate produced by the anammox process can be in situ removed directly by henr in a one stage pd a system which further highlights the advantages of anammox based mixnr cao et al 2016 implemented the first successful construction of anammox based mixnr system in a sequencing batch reactor working volume 2 0 l hrt from 8 h by coupling anammox with pd and achieved a high nre of 97 at a total nitrogen concentration of 55 mg l 1 nh4 n 25 mg l 1 no3 n 30 mg l 1 the anammox based mixnr process was also successful in treating actual domestic wastewater with nh4 n and no3 n concentrations of 63 6 and 69 2 mg l 1 nre 95 8 respectively in a sequencing batch reactor working volume 2 0 l diameter 12 cm and height 25 cm hrt 8h du et al 2017b therefore the mixnr technology route offers a viable strategy for the mainstream application of the anammox process 2 2 2 optimization of the operating parameters the appropriate mixotrophic conditions are paramount in determining performance of anammox based mixnr which in practice is mainly regulated by the ratio of c n the theoretical c n required for complete denitrification is 4 1 ma et al 2017 so the anammox based mixnr system is lower than that value excessive org c concentrations can upset the balance between anammox and pd thereby deteriorating the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox based mixnr system du et al 2019 based on previous studies the empirical c n in actual operation is usually in the range of 2 5 3 5 zhang et al 2020d du et al 2019 ma et al 2017 the hrt is another crucial parameter although the limited carbon source leads to the pd process accumulated nitrite could also be consumed by endogenous respiration of bacteria zhang et al 2020d thus a suitable hrt reaction time will avoid excessive consumption of nitrite and maintain its accumulation at the highest level according to previously different reactor configurations may be suitable for different hrts in a continuous flow uasb 1 2 l reactor setting the hrt of the anammox based mixnr process to 0 75 h proved to be ideal correspondingly the reaction time of the anaerobic phase in the sbr system can be set to 6 h du et al 2017a and when antibiotics are present in the wastewater the reaction time should be longer than when treating general municipal wastewater a recent study has shown that when the anammox based mixnr process in treating pharmaceutical wastewater a high level of nitrogen removal performance could be guaranteed at an hrt of 10 h zhang et al 2022a however the extension of hrt will increase the operational burden and cost in a very recent study the extremely short hrt proved to be an effective means of stimulating a significant increase in anammox activity and achieved a high nre of 94 1 nitrogen removal rate of 1 28 kg n m 3 d 1 at hrt of 1 h du et al 2022 ph is another crucial parameter the optimal range of ph is 8 5 9 0 as alkaline condition could lead to the inhibition of cu type nitrite reductase nirk activity and thus cause the accumulation of nitrite du et al 2019 reducing the loss of biomass in the reactors should also be considered due to the slow growth rate of anaob the construction of granular sludge and biofilm has been shown to be a promising scheme it is recommended that the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss should be kept at 3000 3500 mg l 1 li et al 2019 the biofilm enriched by anaob and pd bacteria was successfully obtained during the 600 days of operation relative abundance anaob 0 11 pd bacteria about 10 by adding fillers into the anoxic zone in a full scale municipal wwtp integrating anoxic moving bed biofilm reactor with anaerobic anoxic oxic system hrt about 10 h including anaerobic 2 h anoxic 2 6 h and oxic 6 4 h srt 14 18 day li et al 2019 moreover the spatial structure of biofilm or granular sludge is also more conducive to the tolerance of the anammox based mixnr system to adverse environments du et al 2017b ma et al 2017 for example a recent study by zhang et al 2022a showed that anammox based mixnr biofilms exhibit high tolerance to bismuth nitrate and bismuth potassium citrate using actual pharmaceutical wastewater as an influent nh4 n 77 9 mg l 1 no3 n 104 1 mg l 1 the process showed a satisfied nre of up to 81 2 in fact anaob has been widely reported to have a strong extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion capacity which leads to a macroscopic preference for the biomass to be in the form of biofilm or granules jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b yu 2020 therefore the addition of carriers is a feasible strategy for anammox based mixnr process in practical applications the mathematical models have also been established in anammox based mixnr systems by several studies as mentioned previously the construction of biofilms is an effective strategy to enable anammox biomass to be retained in mixnr system zhang et al 2021b in the biofilm system an one dimensional mathematical model for evaluating the relationship between anammox and henr was proposed by mattei et al 2015 the one dimensional mathematical assessed the effect of boundary conditions on microbial competition and revealed the diffusion pattern of the substrate ammonium organics nitrite and nitrate in the timescales mattei et al 2015 meanwhile the model was similarly applied to investigate n2o emissions from the anammox based mixnr system with the model developer utility a previous study extended the asm1 by introducing n2o gas variables and showed that high ammonia and low nitrite loading resulted in a minimal n2o production factor range from 1 7 to 2 9 lu et al 2018 however the large number of process parameters in practice inevitably complicates the model and the fitting of multiple effecters may lead to distortion recently machine learning has been widely adopted to guide the operation of wastewater treatment process huang et al 2021b which also provides the idea of a more stable and efficient mathematical model for mixnr 2 2 3 practical and engineering applications in fact the existence of anaob has been widely reported in many municipal wwtps with a low anammox rate 0 08 1 2 μmol n g 1vss h 1 yang et al 2021 however the low enrichment of anaob cannot meet the application requirements in 2019 the anammox phenomenon in municipal wwtp 25 104 m 3 d 1 was reported for the first time with a high anaob abundance 0 11 in western china li et al 2019 marking the feasibility of anammox based mixnr for nitrogen removal from mainstream municipal wastewater the adoption of an anoxic carrier is a key strategy for the enrichment of anaob in the mainstream condition in that study hence the construction of the biofilm based structure is suggested as an effective application strategy for the anammox based mixnr addition to municipal wastewater the anammox based mixnr process is also well applied to the actual treatment of landfill leachate in general the tn concentration in landfill leachate is in the range of 1000 3000 mg l 1 which will lead to the nitrate concentration of anammox process effluent over 200 mg l 1 in a previous study a anammox based mixnr process was constructed in a biocarriers tank to achieve effective treatment of landfill leachate 1 74 kg cod m 3 d 1 with cod and ammonia removal efficiencies of 79 6 0 8 and 77 5 3 9 respectively dan and le luu 2021 furthermore the process with related technologies as the core has also been successfully applied to the shiyan landfill leachate treatment plant flow 150 m3 d 1 land space 2040 m2 in hubei province which is an excellent practical case of china relying on anammox based mixnr wu et al 2022 with the two stage uasb system in operation the process achieved cod and total nitrogen removal efficiency of greater than 60 and 80 respectively it can be concluded from the above practical cases that the complexity of the actual wastewater determines that mixotrophic conditions are the most common scenario in the applications of anammox thus the anammox based mixnr process is the solution that meets the practical needs in addition the close synergy of multi microbes heterotrophs and autotrophs also facilitates the maintenance of process stability which can meet the needs of dealing with actual fluctuations of wastewater quality 2 3 other promising mixnr process the discovered nitrogen conversion bioprocesses including nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox strous et al 1999 fe based autotrophic denitrification nielsen and nielsen 1998 straub et al 1996 and hydrogen based autotrophic denitrification tang et al 2011 szekeres et al 2001 have greatly expanded the nitrogen removal process fig 1 among them the application of damo in wastewater treatment provides new ideas for mixnr as shown in fig 1 n damo bacteria and n damo archaea are the two distinct microbial groups and the latter can be well coupled with anammox achieving efficient nitrogen removal liu et al 2019 so far combining anammox and n damo process has been proven to be successful in treating the real domestic sewage and anaerobic digestion liquor nitrogen removal rate 0 46 kg n m 3 d 1 lim et al 2021 besides the anammox and n damo coupling process also broken the bottleneck of low temperature by exploiting the overcapacity of biofilm nitrogen removal rate 0 13 kg n m 3 d 1 at 10 c liu et al 2020b according to the insights of liu et al 2019 the process 0 5 million m 3 d 1 with coupled anammox with n damo as core could theoretically achieve produced energy at 290 tj y 1 while the conventional process is accompanied by a negative energy of 181 tj y 1 thus the dmao process is expected to advance wwtps to achieve the transition to energy production the advantage of the damo process is the in situ utilization of ch4 from the biogas produced by waste sludge in wwtps which is an inexpensive organic source for denitrification yet as another coexist component of biogas the fate of h2s should also be concern noteworthy the coexist of h2s and ch4 seems to support both a sonrb and damo bacteria archaea in ecological niches recently the coupling bnr process of sdad and damo namely sulfide driven denitrification methane oxidation sdmo was successfully established and achieved an nre of 100 in over 700 days of operation wang et al 2022c it was surprising to find that the intervention of h2s nearly doubled the contribution of damo to nitrogen removal from 2 9 mg n l 1 d 1 to 6 2 mg n l 1 d 1 may be attributed to the enhanced metabolic potential wang et al 2022c meanwhile the recent finding of mixotrophic methane sulfur oxidizing bacteria hy1 have expanded our knowledge of the unknow global elemental cycle gwak et al 2022 therefore the mixotrophic conditions may not only increase the metabolic association of the bnr system but also facilitate the exploration of novel pathways 3 functional microorganisms as the main contributor to nitrogen removal the functional microorganisms in the mixnr based wastewater treatment systems have been highlighted in fig 3 the details of the related bacteria in different mixnr systems are introduced as follows 3 1 functional bacteria in sulfur based mixnr process 3 1 1 autotrophic sulfur oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb the functional bacteria in the sulfur based mixnr process are mainly composed of h nrb and a sonrb with low sulfide concentration and show a dynamic succession table 2 in terms of a sonrb thiobacillus and arcobacter are the most frequently identified as the dominant genus by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2020a the substrate ratio is the primary factor affecting the abundance of a sonrb at high organics content a sonrb tends to be eliminated due to the slow growth rate using s0 as electron donors qiu et al 2020 observed that the abundance of thiobacillus was only 0 1 at a c n ratio of 2 7 in the case of dissolved sulfur components at the optimal substrate ratio s n c 1 1 2 1 as discussed in section 2 1 the relative abundances of a sonrb ranged from 20 to 40 table 2 which lead to the satisfying process performance the sulfide loading is another crucial factor in shaping the functional composition huang et al 2015b a previous study found that elevated sulfide loading from 1 2 to 3 6 kg s m 3 d 1 s n c 1 1 2 1 would lead to a shift in dominant bacteria from a sonrb arcobacter to h nrb azoarcus and pseudomonas with potential sulfur oxidation capacity which will be discussed in detail subsequently liu et al 2020a a similar phenomenon was also confirmed in another study zhang et al 2018 which found that the dominant genus shifted from thiobacillus to azoarcus and pseudomonas with increasing sulfide concentration 200 to 400 mg l 1 notably the sulfur oxidation capacity of pseudomonas plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the sulfur based mixnr system at high sulfide concentrations some other a sonrbs have also been reported in the mixnr system for example at the genus level thermomonas ferritrophicum and sulfurimonas table 2 notably in addition to reduced sulfur compounds ferritrophicum has the ability to reduce nitrate using fe2 or h2 as an electron donor in a study of optimizing the sdad process with the addition of feco3 the relative abundance of ferritrophicum was up to 10 and was suggested to be a non negligible participant in nitrate reduction zhu et al 2019 sulfurimonas were previously reported on a low relative abundance 1 86 in the sulfur based mixnr system ma et al 2021 compared with thiobacillus the sulfur oxidation capacity of sulfurimonas is mainly executed through sox dependent enzyme complex pathway and tends to use thiosulfate as substrate sievert et al 2008 synergy rather than competition between it and thiobacillus has been proposed in the study by wolff et al 2018 the positively correlated between thiobacillus and sulfurimonas was observed under antibiotic venlafaxine diatrizoate and tramadol stress therefore in the mixnr system sulfurimonas may play a positive role for the stabilization of microbial communities 3 1 2 heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria h nrb as shown in table 2 thauera azoarcus and pseudomonas as h nrb are commonly reported at the genus level with a relative abundance from 30 to 60 ma et al 2021 liang et al 2022b differences in carbon sources were the dominant factors affecting h nrb in the sulfur based mixnr system as methanol was used as a carbon source methyloversatilis tended to be the dominant h nrb while thauera became the dominant h nrb under ethanol conditions zhang et al 2015 besides ethanol proved to be a more desirable carbon source for achieving high bnr performance in the sulfur based mixnr process which may be due to its easier utilization by h nrb interestingly a recent study in the sulfur based mixnr system found a significant negative correlation between thauera and a sonrb in the microbial community network li et al 2022 therefore competitive relationships between functional bacteria may be a potential factor of the elimination of thauera when corncob powder was used as a carbon source simplicispira which has the ability to metabolize lignocellulose was enriched as heterotrophs liang et al 2022a in the study by ma et al 2021 simplicispira relative abundance 7 07 was likewise identified as a dominant h nrb with corncob as fillers in addition to the functional bacteria mentioned above some other h nrb have also been reported in sulfur based mixnr systems such as ferruginibacter saprospiraceae dokdonella and hydrogenophaga sun et al 2020 however the corresponding functions and contribution to nitrogen removal still need further investigation noteworthy the s0 recovery performance depends on the composition of the functional bacteria the study by huang et al 2017 found that the functional combination of thauera and sulfurimonas achieved better performance s0 recovery rate 77 9 than the combination of azoarcus and thiobacillus 45 1 in the same process azoarcus and pseudomonas drove better s0 recovery performance compared to thiobacillus which was also confirmed in another study zhang et al 2018 notably the sulfide oxidation capacity of some h nrb has also been widely reported and is crucial for the stable process performance of the sulfur based mixnr system huang et al 2015a huang et al 2017 which will be discussed in the next section 3 1 3 heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb the discovery of heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb has greatly expanded the knowledge of elemental cycles in ecosystems on the one hand h sonrb can perform denitrification through heterotrophic metabolic pathways on the other hand the electrons generated by sulfide oxidation can also support autotrophic denitrification so far h sonrb has been widely reported in natural conditions such as oceans and lakes lee et al 2014 callbeck et al 2019 as mentioned previously at a high sulfide loading rate the removal of pollutants c n and s from the sulfur based mixnr system is mainly dominated by h sonrb in the sulfur based mixnr reactors pseudomonas c27 in a egsb reactor 1 l chen et al 2013 thauera hdd in a biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor 12 56 ml huang et al 2018 thiopseudomonas in a uasb reactor 1 l tan et al 2016 azoarcus nsc3 in a egsb reactor 4 l huang et al 2021a have been successfully isolated in the laboratory core metabolic pathways of h sonrb represented by pseudomonas c27 although many h sonrb have been isolated and purified sulfur based mixotrophic metabolic functions are still not sufficiently annotated at the phylum or even at the genus level among the h sonrb in the mixnr systems pseudomonas c27 is of interest and has been systematically studied for nearly 10 years due to its efficient metabolic capacity herein the core metabolic pathways of pseudomonas c27 were systematically summarized for the first time to provide a metabolic reference for the understanding of h sonrb pseudomonas c27 was first isolated and purely cultured in an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor performing the sulfur based mixnr process by chen and lee et al additionally a variety of carbon sources such as acetate malate and ethanol can be utilized by pseudomonas c27 for heterotrophic denitrification along with sulfide oxidation and the optimal growth ph and temperature have been shown to be 9 0 and 25 30 c respectively chen et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 a the morphology of pseudomonas c27 is rod shaped more recently our understanding of the genetic and metabolic properties of pseudomonas c27 has been greatly expanded due to the rapid development of molecular biology genomic sequencing techniques fig 4 b shows the metabolic information of pseudomonas c27 based on a single cell library of genomic dna genbank accession number cp043320 zhang et al 2020a pseudomonas c27 metabolizes organic carbon sources through the tca pathway taking acetate as an example acetate is converted into acetyl coa under the catalysis of acetate kinase ak and phosphotransferase pta successively and then enters the tca cycle the conversion of sulfide is mainly catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr and persulfide dioxygenase pdo the former is responsible for catalyzing the formation of polysulfide or s from sulfide hydrogen sulfide which subsequently reacts with glutathione gsh to form gssh wang et al 2019 meanwhile gssh is catalyzed by the persulfide dioxygenase pdo enzyme to form sulfite which is further oxidation to thiosulfate by the regulation of downstream genes fig 4 b besides disproportionation reactions of sulfite and s0 including gssh and polysulfides are also critical contributions to the production of thiosulfate the electrons generated by the above tca and sulfur metabolism are transferred to the respiratory chain to provide electrons for the reduction of nitrate zhang et al 2020a since heterotrophic metabolic organic carbon confers higher growth rates for pseudomonas c27 compared to a sonrb this was confirmed in a recent study comparing the growth characteristics of pseudomonas c27 and thiobacillus denitrificans zhang et al 2022b besides the sulfide oxidation capacity of pseudomonas c27 is also higher than that of thiobacillus denitrificans zhang et al 2022b on the one hand pseudomonas c27 may obtain more energy for metabolism due to the operation of cysteine synthetase on the other hand pdo accelerates the conversion of sulfide yet thiobacillus denitrificans do not possess the relevant coding genes pdo gregersen et al 2011 therefore high sulfide concentrations may be one of the triggers for h sonrb to be dominant based on this the dynamic changes in community structure guided by h sonrb could be summarized in brief autotrophic and heterotrophic condition favors a sonrb and h nrb respectively the changes in the composition of functional microorganisms under mixotrophic condition depend on the sulfide concentration under low sulfide concentration the a sonrb and h nrb drives the maintenance of process performance in mixnr system zhang et al 2018 at high sulfide concentration a sonrb in the system is replaced by h sonrb and works in conjunction with h nrb zhang et al 2020a in this model a sonrb and h sonrb are responsible for the conversion of sulfur at low and high sulfide concentrations respectively metabolic enhancement of pseudomonas c27 by micro oxygen it is noteworthy that the metabolism of pseudomonas c27 could be enhanced under micro oxygen conditions zhang et al 2020b showed that under micro oxygen conditions pseudomonas c27 have a 1 4 times higher sulfide oxidation rate than that under an anaerobic environment further at the transcriptional level elevated sulfide concentration significantly promoted the expression of pdo gene zhang et al 2020b pdo enzymes are classified into three types according to their evolutionary relationship and topological structure xia et al 2017 the first type of pdo is widely distributed in gram negative bacteria the second type is most widely distributed but only exists in proteobacteria the third type has a broad distribution in both gram negative and positive bacteria according to the phylogenetic tree of pdo homologs fig 4 c the pdo in pseudomonas c27 should belong to the second type in fact the operation of pdo is a process that requires the involvement of oxygen liu et al 2014 thus under micro oxygen conditions a pathway preceded by pdo was activated in addition to sqr resulting in an enhanced sulfide oxidation capacity of pseudomonas c27 besides as an electron donor the presence of oxygen may also drive the intensification of electron cycling in the cell which thereby enhances the nutrients removal performance of pseudomonas c27 however existing studies on the electron transport pathways in pseudomonas c27 are still inadequate which should be highlighted in the future studies traditionally sulfide and do are considered to be the inhibitory for the denitrification process in contrast pseudomonas c27 could adapt to high sulfide concentrations section 3 1 3 1 and the nitrogen and sulfur metabolic capacity could be enhancement by micro oxygen thus enrichment and applications of h sonrb in the wastewater treatment system provide a new perspective on overcoming the toxicity of sulfide and do 3 2 functional bacteria in the anammox based mixnr process 3 2 1 anammox bacteria anaob in the stably anammox based mixnr process one stage pd a the relative abundance of anaob is typically in the of 1 10 by the results of by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing table 3 nevertheless anammox still contributed to most of the nitrogen removal a recent study demonstrated that anaob candidatus brocadia with only 0 66 relative abundance by metagenomic sequencing analysis could contribute 90 9 5 2 of the total nitrogen removal of the anammox based mixnr process according to the batching test through 15n stable isotope in treating domestic sewage and industrial nitrate wastewater liu et al 2021b specifically as shown in table 3 most of the reported anaob in anammox based mixnr systems are dominated by candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia and candidatus jettenia at the genus level according to 16s rrna high throughput sequencing with ca brocadia being widely regarded the enrichment advantage of ca brocadia in the anammox based mixnr system can be tentatively explained by the following reasons 1 more efficiently in metabolizing organic matter section 3 2 3 and 2 higher do tolerance although the anammox pathway is widely considered to be an anaerobic metabolism ca brocadia exhibits tolerance to micro oxygen 0 02 mg o2 l 1 seuntjens et al 2018 furthermore taking the brocadia dominated biomass as a target the potential oxygen detoxification mechanism based on key genes encoding superoxide dismutase sod and cytochrome c peroxidase ccp in ca brocadia sp was elucidated by ji et al 2019 thus considering the do in the nitrifying reflux fig 3 b the adaptation of ca brocadia to do may be the reason for their extensive enrichment in the anammox based mixnr process 3 higher growth rate based on the microbial growth kinetic ca brocadia sp has a higher growth rate than other freshwater anaob under almost all conditions zhang and okabe 2020 which facilitates the enrichment in the wastewater treatment systems it is noteworthy that the coexistence of diverse anaob in the anammox based mixnr process was also widely reported zhao et al 2021a du et al 2017a wang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2022 however the existing knowledge on the ecological niches of anaob among species is still inadequate thus there is an urgent need to improve the construction of phylogenetic trees as well as an in depth analysis of metabolic properties of anaob among species 3 2 2 heterotrophic partial denitrification bacteria h pdb another functional bacterium in the anammox based mixnr process is the heterotrophic partial denitrification bacteria h pdb as shown in fig 1 as shown in table 3 at genus level thauera denitratisoma and myxococcota are most widely reported in the anammox based mixnr process with relative abundance ranging from 5 45 h pdb is mainly categorized into two groups truncated denitrifiers and progressive onset po denitrifiers the pd capacity of truncated denitrifiers is due to the absence of nitrite reductase which allows nitrite to be accumulated in the case of po denitrifiers although the denitrification pathway is complete the gene that controlled nitrite reduction and their downstream genes are only partially expressed liu et al 2013 lycus et al 2017 myxococcota and thauera are the typical of po denitrifiers a previous study showed that the gene expression ratio of nirk to napa and narg encoding nitrate reductase in myxococcota metagenome assembled genome bins id mxy1 was 0 8 in an anammox based mixnr system zhuang et al 2022 the blockage in nitrite reduction and subsequent pathway is the reason for the realization of pd that is the po pathway thauera was likewise shown to perform the po pathway in the study by liu et al 2013 the addition of nitrate 1 mm to cultures of t terpenica a thauera strain resulted in an immediate decrease in nitrite reduction activity furthermore it is found that the nitrate reductase of t terpenica a thauera strain has preferential electron flow and that nirs was not detected at the transcriptional level when nitrate was sufficient liu et al 2013 supporting the po pathway additionally a recent study postulated the mechanism of nitrite accumulation in thauera genus from the perspective of carbon storage by the combined approaches to metagenomic and metatranscriptomic zhang et al 2020c first the metabolic potential for thauera aminoaromatica suggested that nitrate restricted the electron allocation and transcription by downstream denitrifying pathways interestingly the reducing power generated by the tca cycle is preferentially allocated to the synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate phb zhang et al 2020c in this model the phb can act as electron donors for nitrate reduction when the external carbon source is insufficient which favors the survival advantage of thauera under oligotrophic conditions zhang et al 2020c in addition to the genus mentioned above some other bacteria with potential pd functions have also been widely reported such as comamonas alishewanella ornatilinea and pseudomonas wang et al 2020 han et al 2021 however the existing studies are still extremely limited in the corresponding physiological properties and pd mechanisms 3 2 3 mixotrophic potentials of anammox bacteria as mentioned before the mixotrophic metabolism of anaob has been reported by several previous studies so far the organic metabolism ability of ca brocadia ca kuenenia and ca jettenia has been confirmed from a genetic perspective so far xiao et al 2021 in the study by güven et al 2005 anaob was found to have the ability to metabolize propionate and acetate furthermore at the species level candidatus brocadia fulgida tends to use acetate as substrates feng et al 2018 while candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus prefers propionate kartal et al 2007 interestingly the mixotrophic metabolic capacity of anaob favors the dominance in interspecific competition according to existing research anaob adopts the following two potential mixotrophic metabolic pathways 1 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway performed by anaob and 2 acetyl coa pathway in the dnra pathway organics can act as electron donors for nitrate nitrite reduction which is supported by the detection of the key gene nrfa in anaob park et al 2017 wang et al 2022b some small molecule acids like propionate and acetate have been shown to act as electron donors supporting the dnra performed by anaob güven et al 2005 besides the presence of ammonia as well as limited cod is beneficial for the dnra of anaob wang et al 2022b in another pathway the organics could be oxidized through the acetyl coa pathway and enters the tca cycle ji et al 2019 interestingly ca brocadia show an advantage in metabolizing acetate due to more complete acetate metabolic pathways xiao et al 2021 by the catalysis of acetyl coa synthetases acs acetate combines with coa to form acetyl coa which is subsequently bound in the tca cycle yang et al 2021 despite the presence of acs a recent study has shown that ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis do not have the ability to metabolize acetate as a carbon source lawson et al 2021 although the mixotrophic characteristic of anaob has been highlighted it is insufficient to rely on this for the treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater however genome based evidence suggests that some physiological properties of anaob such as eps secretion aggregation and biological activity are related to mixotrophic metabolism the research by feng et al 2018 suggested that the mixotrophic growth anaob obtained higher biomass yield than autotrophic growth which favors the prevalence of anaob in nutrient limited conditions thus the exploration of the mixotrophic metabolism of anammox bacteria provides a new perspective for the optimization of the anammox system 4 microbial interaction in functional consortia in the mixnr system both sulfur based and anammox based mixnr the conversion of nitrogen is accomplished by the collaboration of multiple functional microorganisms thus in addition to the functional interpretation knowledge related to microbial interactions will provide deeper interpretation and guidance for the optimization and regulation of the mixnr process 4 1 microbially interaction in sulfur based mixnr system in the sulfur based mixnr system as shown in fig 5 a the removal of nitrogen is performed by a sonrb and h nrb h sonrb together and the sulfide is mainly oxidized by a sonrb and gets accumulated intracellularly in the form of s0 on the one hand the production and accumulation of s0 provide the cell with a store of electron donors cui et al 2019 on the other hand this process is also a critical basis of the mixnr system to achieve the desulfurization function huang et al 2016 it is noteworthy that the presence of h sonrb as discussed in section 3 1 in the mixnr system also performs the function of sulfur metabolism in terms of carbon there is a strong metabolic interaction between a sonrb and h nrb h sonrb when inorganic carbon sources are scarce in the system first the organic matter represented by acetate is oxidized by h nrb h sonrb to produce co2 then the co2 can be used by a sonrb to synthesize organic matter through carbon fixation pathways like the calvin benson bassham cbb cycle huang et al 2021a meanwhile the organic matter produced can in turn be reused by h nrb h sonrb thus enabling the coupling of carbon metabolism among bacteria interestingly some recent studies have detected the expression of methane synthesis related genes in the mixnr system huang et al 2021a li et al 2021b the related studies provide potential possibilities for achieving energy recovery from the mixnr system and expand the existing knowledge on carbon metabolism in mixnr system this microbial interaction promotes the establishment of functional redundancy which facilitates the stabilization of process performance louca et al 2018 through the technology of dna based stable isotope probing dna sip xing et al 2018 demonstrated that the symbiosis of autotrophs heterotrophs and mixotrophs could significantly improve the nitrogen removal performance of the process specifically bicarbonate h13co3 and acetate 13ch3 13coo labeled with 13c were fed separately to mixnr system followed by centrifugation of the dna and precise identification of autotrophs and heterotrophs by high throughput sequencing xing et al 2018 furthermore arenimonas and rubellimicrobium were identified as mixotrophs thus the sulfur based mixnr process has a competitive advantage in terms of stability of nitrogen removal compared to the henr or aunr based processes additionally microbial interactions are of equal ecological importance it has been reported that the mixotrophic conditions can improve trophic transfer efficiency and facilitate carbon sequestration in marine ecosystems ward and follows 2016 besides the mixotrophic conditions driven by the sulfur cycle are a non negligible contribution to global nutrient cycling and energy flows canfield don et al 2010 and the complex and tight microbial interactions among bacteria are intrinsically driven to achieve ecological functions 4 2 microbial interactions in anammox based mixnr system the most notable microbial interaction between anaob and h pdb is the conversion of nitrogen as discussed in section 3 2 2 in addition there is may also a strong interaction in terms of carbon metabolism firstly as shown in fig 5 b as the inorganic carbon source the co2 produced by h pdb can be fixed by anaob via the wood ljungdahl pathway to support the autotrophic activities strous et al 2006 kuenen 2008 further for some large molecules of organic matter microbial interaction between anaob and h pdb is performed by cross feeding it is well known that anammox consortia are often accompanied by a large amount of eps consisting mainly of proteins with polysaccharides jia et al 2017 due to the presence of some eps modifying enzymes yu 2020 eps can be partially hydrolyzed with polypeptides and amino acids as the main products this organic matter from the eps matrix especially amino acids can be utilized by h pdb as a potential carbon source besides some secondary metabolites secreted by anaob during the carbon metabolism process also have this function zhao et al 2018 a recent study identified the existence of amino acids cross feeding between ca kuenenia and thauera zhang et al 2021c which should be highlighted due to the pd function of thauera section 3 2 2 furthermore in another study the draft genomes of chb1 recovered from a sequencing batch reactor 5 l do 0 5 0 5 mg l 1 ph 6 8 8 0 showed that chb1 in anammox consortia lacks catabolic pathways of amino acids with high biosynthetic cost lawson et al 2017 in contrast anaob expresses nearly all of the amino acid synthesis pathways lawson et al 2017 thus the less costly amino acids derived from anaob compensate to some extent for the metabolic deficiency of h pdb interestingly anaob does not seem to be an unrequited contributor to this symbiotic model the study by speth et al 2016 showed that the reduction of nitrate to nitrite is coupled with amino acid oxidation in heterotrophic bacteria besides the release of ammonia is also increased due to amino acid oxidation speth et al 2016 thus h pdb appears to compensate for anaob in the form of substrates supplementation through nitrogen metabolism while taking up amino acids in addition to the amino acids the metabolic exchange of b vitamins between anaob and heterotrophic bacteria has also been identified in several studies zhang et al 2021c lawson et al 2017 feng et al 2019 in brief the anaob has the ability to synthesize b vitamins and supply b vitamins to members of the members of anammox microbial community however the specific role of b vitamins in the anammox system remains to be further explored in fact the microbial interaction mentioned above based on cross feeding is widely distributed over the anammox system and has been reported on anammox consortia with ca brocadia zhao et al 2018 ca jettenia feng et al 2019 and ca kuenenia sun et al 2019 as the core species respectively in addition to facilitating the process performance this microbial interaction of cross feeding is also ecologically crucial due to the relatively strict metabolic conditions anaob in natural ecosystems often suffers from starvation stress and the microbial interaction between anaob and other bacteria would contribute to the stability of the anammox system under starvation conditions as confirmed in a recent study that observed the upregulation of genes related to amino acid biosynthesis and protein degradation wang et al 2022a besides the microbial interaction may also affect the aggregation ability of anammox consortia zhao et al 2018 and the aggregation behavior of anaob has been considered as an important ecological strategy to resist unfavorable environmental conditions zhang et al 2021b therefore the microbial interactions based on public goods cellular metabolites and signaling in the anammox system should be further emphasized in future studies both for wastewater treatment processes and natural ecosystems 5 significance of mixnr process for carbon reduction the significance of the mixnr process for carbon reduction is illustrated in fig 6 in terms of domestic sewage under mainstream conditions the anammox based mixnr should be considered first as mentioned the traditional heterotrophic denitrification based bnr process is limited by carbon source dependence it has been reported that the conventional bnr process has difficulty in achieving high nitrogen removal performance when the c n ratio is below 5 due to the insufficient carbon source yang et al 2007 while the carbon consumption will be greatly reduced by anammox based mixnr from the source because the conventional heterotrophic denitrification does not need to be completely performed it has been reported that the bnr process combining anammox with henr will reduce the carbon source consumption by 40 80 compared to the conventional henr based process while enhancing the nitrogen removal performance cao et al 2019 cao et al 2021 in terms of energy recovery only about 20 of cod in municipal wastewater can be recovered in the form of energy through anaerobic digestion liu et al 2019 most of the remaining carbon is released in the form of co2 in the traditional bnr process in fact the organic energy contained in wastewater is 9 10 times greater than the energy consumption of the treatment process shizas and bagley 2004 so far seven representative wwtps around the world has achieved carbon neutrality through the rational conversion to organic energy accompanied by carbon neutral efficiency in the range of 100 160 hao et al 2015 the most representative one is the strass wwtp in austria which achieved a carbon neutral efficiency of 160 through the a b anammox process combined with anaerobic digestion flow 27500 m3 d 1 influent cod 605 mg l 1 reardon 2014 however the carbon neutrality process in chinese wwtps is widely limited due to the low organic energy potential of municipal wastewater cod 200 400 mg l 1 hao et al 2015 thus it is advantageous to retain the organic energy in the wastewater to achieving energy self sufficiency and carbon neutrality in the wastewater treatment system the mixnr process has a low dependence on carbon sources especially anammox based mixnr which will contribute to the retention of organic energy what s more considering that waste sludge treatment account for about 30 of wwtps operating shen et al 2015 reducing sludge production is also a necessary strategy to achieve carbon reduction the sludge yield of the mixnr process will also be reduced as discussed in section 2 1 due to the slow growth rate of autotrophic bacteria therefore the mixnr process is promising both in terms of carbon input and output in addition to co2 the emission of n2o is also a significant entire carbon footprint of wwtps and accounts for about 80 duan et al 2021 it is reported that the global warming potential led by n2o is about 300 times higher than co2 while wwtps contribute about 3 of the global n2o emissions liu et al 2019 a recent view by duan et al 2021 proposed that henr is the source as well as the sink of n2o in wwtps from the metabolic pathway figs 4 and 5 the activity of n2o reductase encoded by nosz is intrinsically responsible for determining the accumulation of n2o in addition to nitrite and ph as discussed in section 2 1 3 sulfide and do were other crucial factors affecting the activity of n2o reductase it has been reported that 0 04 mg l 1 of sulfide h2s s can inhibit the reduction of n2o by 50 in the denitrification process pan et al 2013 interestingly it seems to be different when do and sulfide are considered together according to the very recent study the presence of molecular oxygen reduced the emission of n2o by 36 9 in the sulfur based mixnr system initial mass transport oxygen ranging from 0 021 to 0 062 mm which highlight the reciprocal detoxification mechanism based on the sulfur oxygen cycling shao et al 2022 in brief sulfides were detoxified to the reduced sulfur with low toxic e g thiosulfate and sulfite by bio oxidation and the capture of free oxygen by pdo prevented further translocation of the inhibitor into the periplasm shao et al 2022 for the wwtps the mainstream process flow provides sufficient conditions for the incubation of the sulfur oxygen cycling as discussed in section 3 1 3 2 which offers a novel perspective on n2o reduction thus more on site investigation and the regulation means based on sulfur oxygen cycling are urgently needed for future study the low n2o emissions in the anammox based mixnr process have also been confirmed by some studies du et al 2019 du et al 2016 almost no n2o 0 005 mg l 1 was produced in anammox based mixnr process at a low c n 3 2 du et al 2016 in anammox metabolism fig 5 b n2h4 no and nh2oh but not n2o are intermediates which avoids the production of n2o at source thus henr process was the only source sink of n2o in the processes meanwhile nitrite can be rapidly consumed by anaob which avoids the increase of n2o due to nitrite accumulation frostegård et al 2022 6 conclusions and perspectives in the present study the recent advance and microbial mechanisms of mixnr process guided by sdad and anammox have been critically reviewed existing research and engineering experience consistently indicate that the anammox based mixnr has significant technical advantages in breaking through the limitations of traditional bnr processes meanwhile the sulfur based mixnr has shown great potential in dealing the multiple pollutants sulfate cod and ammonium contained wastewater and the tight microbial interactions between autotrophs and heterotrophs are also conducive to the enhancement of the stability for wastewater treatment process however it is still inadequate in terms of engineering implementation fundamental knowledge of the functional mechanisms of bacteria is still lacking herein several future research directions and targets aimed to fill the related gap are proposed 1 key operating parameters although some of the optimum operating parameters of the mixnr process such as substrate ratio hrt ph and temperature have been relatively comprehensively captured by existing studies in practice there are often fluctuations in influent quality thus the critical value or the parameter interval that ensures the stability of the process is also worth exploring for example it is recommended to establishing series parameters related to the spatial distribution of substrates and do as discussed in section 3 1 3 2 do is a crucial factor affecting mixnr activity therefore considering the spatial distribution of do is an effective solution to optimize the reactor configuration and it is recommended to optimize the key parameters on the pilot and full scale system besides the accumulation of engineering experience is still needed 2 expanding the application of mixnr through the combined processes the discovery of several novel bnr pathways such as damo has received much attention in recent years the successful coupling of anammox with n damo is also seen as a forward looking technology to drive the bnr process the potential applicability of damo is also highlighted by the report of ch4 in some sulfur based mixnr systems section 4 1 besides in dealing with anaerobic digestion effluent and municipal wastewater an innovative mixnr process based on coupling anaob a sonrb and n damo archaea with h pdb has also been proposed by zhang et al 2020d the combined process can on the one hand extend the application of mixnr for example by utilizing ch4 via damo or fe via ferric ammonium oxidation additionally the combination of multiple functional microbes facilitates the stability of the mixnr system as discussed in section 4 therefore future studies are encouraged to try combinations of bnr pathways at laboratory scale based on practicality and to determine the feasibility and applicability of the combinations 1 identification of new bacteria and their functional interpretation the isolation and purification of h sonrb pseudomonas c27 have greatly expanded the knowledge of sulfur based mixnr systems however studies based on bacterial isolation in anammox systems are still very limited the acquisition of pure strains and their metabolic reconstruction are direct evidence for functional interpretation as well as a powerful tool to optimize and guide the process besides the role and contribution to multifunctional microbes represented by h sonrb in mainstream wastewater treatment systems is still rarely interpreted hence future studies are required to focus on the exploration and functional interpretation of novel microbes to extends our understanding of wastewater treatment systems 2 focus on energy resource recovery from the mixnr process in addition to nitrogen removal performance resource and energy recovery should also be looked at in the context of carbon reduction in addition to the conventional s0 and ch4 it is also relevant to recover new useful resources such as eps yu 2020 biopolymers li et al 2021a and sulfated polysaccharides liu et al 2021a and electrical energy under this concept the mixnr process is expected to be considered as a processing plant for the product while exercising the function of nitrogen removal therefore the characterization and quantification of the by products of the mixnr process especially dissolved organic compounds still need to be fully penetrated besides further interpretation of the metabolism and interactions of bacterial communities not limited to functional bacteria will facilitate the determination of the potential for energy resource recovery in addition to the points mentioned above the accumulation of engineering experience and microbial metabolic associations should also not be overlooked in summary mixnr technology has shown great potential in optimizing the conventional bnr process in fact mixotrophic conditions are common in natural ecosystems and the design and implementation of wastewater treatment processes should follow the laws of nature in order to achieve a true sense of sustainability with the above proposed targets it is expected to turn the traditional bnr process into a more efficient and energy saving mode through the mixnr technology credit authorship contribution statement quan zhang

graphical abstract keywords microbial electrochemical technologies anaerobic digestion electromethanogenesis biomethane microbial community assembly extracellular electron transfer data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a well established technology for producing methane ch4 through biodegradation and reduction of highly concentrated organic waste angelidaki et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yadav et al 2022 the main merit of ad is the bioconversion of waste water into bioenergy as biogas 60 70 ch4 and 30 40 co2 ning et al 2021 which can be further converted into electrical energy the prime reason for ad reactor instability often originates from the difficulty in maintaining the balance between two groups of acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms which differ widely concerning physiology nutritional needs growth kinetics and sensitivity to environmental conditions park et al 2020 moreover biogas upgrading will be further required to enhance ch4 purification by lowering co2 content xu et al 2021 these shortcomings can negatively affect the ad process viability and prevent ad from being more

2019 rousseau et al 2020 by giving a small external voltage the mec process is more easily controllable external voltage acts like a switch button which can befittingly adjust the direction and

practical approach to resolving some aforementioned obstacles park et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 2022b more importantly integrating the mecs with the ad system may regulate the establishment of the microbial community structures and electron transfer pathways and thus increase both the overall energy efficiency and the whole system s stability wang et al 2020b c however the mec ad coupling processes need to be further developed and the role of bioelectrochemistry in an anaerobic bioreactor system has not been thoroughly investigated the critical factors that affect the overall

mechanisms of electron transfer in mecs and better understand bioelectrochemical contributions to organic conversion or ch4 promotion liu et al 2016b zhen et al 2015 iii to assess the performance of the mec ad integrated systems at different scales and identify understand susceptible factors of the stability such as ph temperature and organic loading rates substrate concentrations cerrillo et al 2017 2018 de vrieze et al 2014 lee et al 2019 park et al 2019 sangeetha et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 or to elucidate the energy recovery efficiencies in mec ad gajaraj et al 2016 iv to process different wastes or design reactors and structures zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2014 nonetheless there are only few systematic reviews that strived to unravel the microbial fingerprints i e diversity composition and function of methanation in mec ad addressing the predominant presence of eubacteria and archaea in the biomass and the metabolically active populations therefore this study aims to comprehensively resolve the above gaps in this field to begin with the working principles and typical configurations of mec ad are fully analyzed furthermore the influential factors such as reactor configurations applied voltages temperatures conductive materials etc of the system s performance as well as electron transfer in such a versatile coupling system are well summarized finally the electroactive community especially electro methanogens with the capability of catalyzing the conversion of co2 into ch4 and complicated ecological networks are investigated from the perspective of the mec ad integration and development we expect to provide a useful reference to comprehensively understand methanation reactions microbial community regulation and interaction involved in the bioelectrochemical electron transfer process for upgrading bioenergy recovery 2 overview of mec ad 2 1 working principles and classifications to avoid or eliminate the ch4 formation in mec ad the following strategies have been adopted in the past i bioelectrodes exposed to the air intermittently call and logan 2008 ii operation under lower ph hu et al 2008 lower temperature conditions lu et al 2011 or with ultraviolet irradiation hou et al 2014 iii washout of methanogens by lowering hydraulic retention time wang et al 2009 iv reducing carbonate concentration rozendal et al 2008 and v addition of methanogen inhibitors e g 2 bromoethanesulfonate chae et al 2010 ch4 as a main product of ad has been widely used to produce electricity in wastewater treatment facilities albeit ch4 contains less energy than h2 per unit of mass however rather than avoiding ch4 production it has been suggested that combining mecs and ad may represent a promising strategy for bioenergy production and a practical biofunneling process for removing residual organic matter present in the digester effluent clauwaert and verstraete 2009 mecs can enhance superior resource recovery from ad effluents rich in high concentration nutrients or organics because of the destabilization or inhibition of ad the ad effluent is also likely to be polished by the mec with the capacity of handling low organic loading rates fig 1 displays a schematic representation of the working principles of the mec ad coupling system electrons shuttled from the oxidation of organic matter electron donor to nad alongside protons and co2 are transported to the anode and flow through an external circuit to the cathode to form ch4 this process is supported by exoelectrogenic microorganisms exoelectrogens that are capable of transferring electrons from biodegradable substrates outside the cell wang et al 2020a electrotrophic microorganisms electrotrophs on the other hand can accept electrons into the cell from external sources for example various functional species on the cathode in mec ad which is mainly dominated by electro methanogens to date the exoelectrogens isolated from natural environment belong primarily to the phylum of proteobacteria and firmicutes mostly facultative anaerobic microorganisms which can harvest energy to sustain growth via anaerobic respiration and fermentation metabolism most exoelectrogens are fe iii reducing bacteria viz fe iii is the final electron acceptor of the respiratory chain lovley 2006 table s1 summarizes reported exoelectrogens in microbial electrochemical systems the ex situ electric biological reactor type i reactor or in situ electric biological reactor type ii reactor have been developed and investigated in numerous studies in the past decade using different equipped electrodes in the ad reactor cerrillo et al 2017 liu et al 2016a zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 it can be easily concluded that the type ii reactor in situ electric biological reactor especially the single chamber mec ad is more common accounting for over 90 of reported works fig 1e table s2 this might be because the mec integrated into ad can save costs and the single chamber also can promote a higher ch4 production rate it is also confirmed that the in situ biogas upgrading system is more efficient than the ex situ one xu et al 2014 typically the single chamber systems are considered a better way to eliminate ph gradient and produce a lower ohmic voltage compared to the dual chambers with a separator call and logan 2008 wang et al 2022a on the other hand the ph polarization around the cathode may still act as a barrier for microbes in the biofilm due to a higher ph value another advantage of the single chamber mec ad is that the membrane free bioreactors can allow microbes freely reach and colonize from one electrode to the other one and thus electrons not only flow to the cathode but also to the anode which means anodic methanogens mainly composed of hydrogenotrophic methanogens also can consume electrons and protons to reduce co2 into ch4 wang et al 2022a thus a more mutualistic relationship can be formed in mec ad it is known that different applied potentials can bring varying ch4 production rates in mecs liu et al 2005 with the increase in applied anode potentials the ch4 production rate and cod removal efficiency increased simultaneously fig 1f table s2 however the ch4 production rate increased first and then decreased with the increase in applied cell voltages from 0 5 to 1 5 v whereas cod removal efficiency always kept rising fig 1f table s2 which used the 1 to 1 mixture of glucose and ad effluent as a substrate type ii reactor choi et al 2017 several studies concerning the fixed voltage applied in the coupling system have also similar confirmations tested with various substrates bo et al 2014 feng et al 2015 of note the optimal external voltages for mec ad are essential to achieve high removal rates of pollutants maximum biogas production and supreme energy recovery there is an obvious difference in temperature between ad and mecs acetotrophic methanogenesis would become the prime limiting rate step to come up than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at a lower temperature which is far more temperature sensitive the methanogenic activity would become sluggish at low temperatures 20 c because of fatty acid accumulation ad requires mesophilic 25 37 c and thermophilic temperatures 55 65 c to ensure optimal microbial activity many types of wastewater are discharged at low temperatures such as beer wastewater soft drink industrial wastewater and domestic sewage with typical temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 c the low temperature usually decreases methanogens activity and slows the growth rate in ad consequently resulting in a low methanogenic rate and cod removal liu et al 2016a fig 1g table s2 however introducing electrodes to a complicated anaerobic microbial community driven by external electricity possibly causes diverse spatial self organization which means this manipulation can bring more diversities for improving the robustness of the system goldschmidt et al 2021 thus can substantially enhance the ch4 production rate and cod removal efficiency meanwhile electrode materials determine the reaction rates and products of mec ad and are also a crucial partner of microbe material interfaces which usually grip electroactivity and biocompatibility fig 1h table s2 four different cathode materials of carbon felt carbon paper titanium mesh and stainless steel mesh were investigated to recover ch4 from the phenanthrene biodegradation in mec ad type ii reactor lin et al 2019 the result revealed that the carbon paper biocathode attained the highest cod removal efficiency as well as phenanthrene degradation rate also carbon based cathode materials were beneficial for microbes adhesion and diet however metallic based cathode materials could facilitate h2 transfer thus developing available electrode materials with high stability and conductivity as well as a large surface area of biocompatibility undoubtedly is beneficial for microbes adherence and functional biofilm formation subsequentially boosting superior performances of mec ad plus the fundamental understanding depth of microbe material interfaces is required to be untangled to further facilitate the titer of biogas in mec ad other unnoticeable factors such as ion exchange membranes electrode positions arrangement and proper operational modes batch or continuous are also expected to play key roles in the mec ad coupling system s performance the coupling mec ad reactor type ii reactor in the presence of a proton exchange membrane or an anion exchange membrane was evaluated using co2 simulating the typical influent biogas from an ad process zeppilli et al 2016 the reactor with an anion exchange membrane has almost 1 7 time coulomb efficiency cathode capture efficiency and co2 removal rate and an observed microbial growth yield 0 175 0 005 g cod g 1 cod obviously lower than that reported in a conventional activated sludge system 0 50 g cod g 1 cod whereas the proton exchange membrane presented in the reactor showed higher ch4 production rate and cod removal efficiency but exhibited a higher energy demand per unit of removal co2 when considering the effects of electrode positioning and arrangement along with hydraulic retention time on the coupling system type ii reactor to treat beer brewery wastewater the electrodes arranged at the bottom of the reactor with the cathode placed above the anode and hydraulic retention time of 36 h the integrated system had the maximum ch4 production rate cod removal efficiency and total organic carbon as well as carbohydrate removal efficiencies sangeetha et al 2017 these results demonstrated that the proper placement of the electrodes in the coupling system is a crucial parameter that not only affects the mass transfer and utilization of the substrates but also has a profound effect on ch4 production by regulating the prevalence of microbial communities in electrode biofilms which is consistent with this study the bottom positioned electrodes enriched more methanogens and electrogens furthermore the mec ad with different inoculants reactor configurations mediums etc also exhibits different performances however the fundamental reasons that the factors mentioned above affect the methanogenesis performance of the mec ad coupling system may be attributed to the changes in microbial community evolutions as further discussed below 2 2 extracelluar electron transfer in mec ad ch4 formation in both ad and mec ad depends on extracellular electron transfer mainly involved in interspecies electron transfer microbe microbe direct or mediated electron transfer microbe solid state electron acceptor donor referring to electrodes fig 2 a in the microbial consortium of mec ad other eams other than electro methanogens can directly or indirectly accept electrons from electrodes and perform interspecies transfer electrons to methanogens direct interspecies electron transfer diet is an alternative mediated interspecies electron transfer in which soluble electron carriers shuttle between partners for electron donors and acceptors lovley 2017 the nanowires with metallic like conductivity play a crucial role in the long range electron transport of either diet or direct electron transfer lovley and holmes 2022 cytochrome c as an important electron transfer protein participates in many biological functions such as cellular respiration lovley and holmes 2022 and as a bridge between the cytoplasm inside and outside of cells gu et al 2021 increasing the content of cytochrome c can effectively reduce the amount of metabolic energy invested in growing electrically conductive pili promoting the efficiency of diet liu et al 2012 hence geobacter possessing a vast network of cytochrome c can easily establish a direct connection with insoluble electron acceptors e g electrodes leonor et al 2013 to be noted not all methanogens contain cytochromes but have hydrogenases which present on the surface of the cell in addition electrically conductive materials such as carbon fiber graphite felt graphite rod etc have orders of magnitude higher conductivity than the biologically formed electron conductance that is pili deficient geobacter can transfer electrons freely to connect with methanogens for syntrophic metabolism in the presence of granular activated carbon as conductive material liu et al 2012 electrons possibly transfer from both inside and outside the cell that is intracellular and extracellular electron transfer kjeldsen et al 2019 the ability of electrons to enter and exit cells is of course evolved in microorganisms independent of the reason that the current flows in mecs however the cellular machinery by which methanogens originally absorb electrons is exactly unclear yet as well as which methanogens are electroactive at all it is assumed that the above electron uptake pathways contribute to the overall process specifically in mixed cultures electro methanogens are thought to accept electrons directly off the cathode surface to form ch4 or indirectly take up the h2 produced on the cathode to form ch4 fig 2b hydrogenases as important molecules for methanogenic metabolism can activate h2 for the further utilization within cells however hydrogenase independent uptake and metabolism of electrons have been proofed in a wild type strain of methanococcus maripaludis in the electromethanogenesis system which indicated that hydrogenases are not mandatory in indirect electron transfer lohner et al 2014 2 3 biomethane production pathways methanogens can utilize a limited number of substrates to generate ch4 mainly including co2 and h2 low fatty acids such as acetate and formate c1 compounds and methyl compounds such as methanol methylamines and methyl sulfides costa and leigh 2014 evans et al 2019 all possible reactions of methanogenesis in mec ad are summarized fig 3 a the substrates are oxidized via eams and electrons are extracellularly transferred to the anode in mec ad i e low molecular organics are fermented into co2 protons and electrons by eams attached to the anode surface and then electrons are transferred to the cathode through an external circuit under an artificially applied potential between electrodes after which co2 and protons are reduced to ch4 on the cathode surface wang et al 2022a 2022b the reactions governing the ch4 production involved in mecs can be mainly divided into two parts anodic reaction ch3cooh 2 h2o 2 co2 8 h 8 e e0 0 187 and eanode 0 289 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she reaction 1 cathodic reaction 8 h 8 e 4 h2 e0 0 and ecathode 0 412 v vs she reaction 2 co2 4 h2 ch4 2 h2o e0 0 227 and ecathode 0 248 v vs she reaction 3 fundamental understanding and technological advancements in ch4 production in the ad process have progressed rapidly and in parallel in the last decade ampese et al 2022 emebu et al 2022 therefore the occurrence of ch4 in mec ad will be highly highlighted in this review chen et al firstly reported that a new process of a biocathode without precious metal catalysts coated could convert electrical current and co2 into ch4 cheng et al 2009 they demonstrated that the ch4 production did not necessarily require h2 evolution and electrons can be obtained directly from the electrode through electro methanogens attached to the biocathode to form ch4 and the main microbial species involved in ch4 generation were archaeon methanobacterium palustre using h2 but not acetate for growth batlle vilanova et al found that h2 as an intermediate made a greater contribution to generating ch4 in mec ad without acetate or other small molecular organics detected batlle vilanova et al 2015 clauwaert et al ran the fed continuous membrane less mec ad with 1 38 kg cod m 3 day 1 acetate and reached 1 65 4 41 times of ch4 production rate 0 28 0 75 l ch4 l 1 day 1 at the applied voltage of ca 0 8 v higher than that of under the open circuit 0 17 l ch4 l 1 day 1 it further suggested that 55 147 of acetate could be recovered as ch4 that is 23 61 of ch4 came from acetate clauwaert and verstraete 2009 it is a fact that electron flow is always accompanied by energy consumption gibbs free energy in mecs so combining half reaction for the electron sources to form ch4 as a final product from acetate acetotrophic methanogenesis h2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and the cathode together with cathodic methanogenesis it is easy to conclude that the cathodic potential in bioelectrochemistry determines the gibbs free energy and drives ch4 production δgcathode 0 nfecathode fig 3b the bioelectrochemical reduction of co2 into ch4 reaction 3 requires an additional voltage larger than a theoretical voltage of 0 248 v vs she at standard conditions 25 c ph 7 due to the effect of quite a large overpotential that however could be possibly reduced by using a microbial cathode cai et al 2021 another bonus the electrical field would remarkably benefit from the anaerobic process for example positively inducing glucose fermentation to yield more acetate and less propionate and butyrate which is upregulating the percent of acetate to the total of propionate and butyrate from 97 of ad to 148 of mec ad guo et al 2017 thus the mec ad process could trigger the available journey of respiratory electron transfer from interspecies h2 transfer to diet or cross interspecies electron transfer ultimately altering more ch4 generation fig 3c a more elaborate understanding of microbial electron transfer mechanisms that is how the associated microbes accept electrons at the molecular level steering electron flows to targeted biofuels apart from c1 ch4 longer carbon chain c2 bioalkanes are also desired and improving co2 conversion efficiency should be priorities for microbial electrochemical technologies advancement coupling of ad lin et al 2021 3 roles of electromethanogenesis in mec ad 3 1 electromethanogens all microorganisms discussed in this review are based on the mec ad system so these are mixed cultures due to low ch4 production rates 2 3 44 mmol day 1 m 2 and current densities 500 ma m 2 through pure cultures of methanogens attached to the cathode to produce ch4 sato et al 2013 mixed cultures are more tolerant to environmental fluctuations but it will be challenging to pinpoint electromethanogens from electroactive consortia which may contain enriched methanogenic strains that can be detected through sequencing analysis and are thus possibly considered as being electroactive table s3 lists several instances of methanogens that predominate in electroactive consortia methodologies applied for the microbial community characterization and primer information commonly used in mec ad are shown in table s4 some studies were conducted with pure methanogenic cultures that demonstrated their electroactivity for example methanobacterium beese vasbender et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 methanococcus maripaludis lohner et al 2014 methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus hara et al 2013 methanosarcina barkeri rowe et al 2019 and methanospirillum hungatei walker et al 2019 more investigations on electromethanogens as well as under extreme operational conditions are required methanogens are the predominant cathodic archaeal community in mec ad to generate ch4 whose taxonomy and division can be generally divided into four classes seven orders and fifteen families fig 4 burdukiewicz et al 2018 even though methanogens may employ different substrates differ in shape and inhabit varied optimum growth conditions and habitats all methanogens share the ability to produce ch4 and the requirement for anaerobic growth thauer et al 2008 in particular ch4 producing archaea can be further divided into three categories based on their preferred substrates acetotrophic that convert acetate into ch4 and hydrogenotrophic methanogens that convert h2 and co2 or formate into ch4 which may provide perspectives for reducing greenhouse gasses emissions thus are considered as the most important role in methanogenic metabolism in mec ad and methylotrophic methanogens that use methanol or methylated amines and sulfides generally belonging to methanosarcinales because microorganisms utilize inorganic carbon sources for cell growth autotrophic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is also regarded as the lithotrophic process offre et al 2013 in addition hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is more likely to be enriched on the cathode whereas acetotrophic methanogens prefer being enriched on the anode zhao et al 2015 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is also often accompanied by homo acetogenesis metabolized with h2 co2 to produce acetate via the wood ljungdahl pathway in the case of homo acetogens like acetobacterium woodii or species out of the bacterial group clostridia rachbauer et al 2017 however homo acetogenic processes have been reported to occur only when methanogenesis is inhibited parameswaran et al 2010 syntrophic acetogenesis also can occur in the methanogenesis process in which specialized organotrophic microbes degrade the main intermediate metabolite propionate to acetate h2 and co2 and symbiotically feed these by products to partnering hydrogenotrophic and acetogenic methanogens chen et al 2020 homo acetogenesis 2 co2 4 h2 ch3cooh 2 h2o g0 104 0 kj mol 1 reaction 4 syntrophic acetogenesis c3h5o2 propionate 3 h2o ch3coo hco3 h 3 h2 g0 71 7 kj mol 1 reaction 5 c4h7o2 butyrate 2 h2o 2 ch3coo h 2 h2 g0 48 3 kj mol 1 reaction 6 methanogenic archaea are definitely dominant in mec ad bacteria can also play an important role for example as an anchor to assist the formation of electrode biofilms particularly among them e g sphingomonas spp and mycobacterium frederiksbergense wick et al 2004 can endure external electrostimulation and vigorously attach on the electrode surface fermentative bacteria can further use cell lysis to produce h2 and co2 to feed methanogens and some bacteria can produce redox mediators that can act as electron carriers thus improving ch4 yield via biocathodic methanogens pham et al 2008 some exoelectrogenic bacteria even though typically detected on the anode geelhoed and stams 2011 can catalyze electrons and protons into h2 on the biocathode which can benefit from h2 mediated electromethanogenesis however some bacteria can divert the electron flow away from electromethanogenesis for example homo acetogens as scavengers for h2 and co2 can divert electron equivalents away from ch4 generation when acetotrophic methanogens are not present or not active on the biocathode dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 some bacteria need additional fermentation and would deliver electrons to volatile fatty acids resulting in a decrease in the final electron flow to ch4 hence how bacteria influence methanogenesis in different ways are required more investigation dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 3 2 microbial interactions between exoelectrogens and electro methanogens in mec ad eams enable exchanging of electrons with their external environment mainly including electrodes and minerals lovley and holmes considerably overviewed the phylogenetic diversity of eams from the natural environment to microbial electrochemical technologies in depth lovley and holmes 2022 only a few microbes have been proven to directly transfer electrons from organics to a conductive surface exoelectrogens capable of electron transfer can be divided into four taxonomic groups iron reducers e g geobacter sulfurreducens lovley and phillips 1988 and shewanella oneidensis myers and nealson 1988 sulfate reducers e g desulfuromonas acetoxidans bond et al 2002 and geothrix fermentans bond and lovley 2005 nitrate reducers e g comamonas denitrificans kiely et al 2010 and paracoccus pantotrophus xing et al 2010 and phototrophic purple nonsulfur bacteria e g rhodopseudomonas palustris xing et al 2008 geobacter as one of the most crucial members of exoelectrogens with the high efficiency of electron transfer between bacteria and electrode is well known to comprise a major portion of anodic populations logan et al 2019 presumably the great increase of geobacter considerably facilitated organic oxidation and electron transport which occurred concurrently with the arising of current and ch4 production thus the development of a geobacter dominated community at the anode is considered to have a vast potential for ch4 recovery in a mec ad system methylocystis sp is also particularly common in the ch4 producing environment and ch4 generated on the biocathode in mec ad is beneficial to such a certain microorganism batlle vilanova et al 2015 methylocystis sp is capable of converting ch4 to co2 under an aerobic condition stein et al 2011 whose activity can provoke the archaea activity to remove o2 that diffuses from the anode to biocathode in mecs creating an anaerobic environment however this reaction lowers the efficiency of ch4 production because of the consumption of ch4 by altering the activity and diversity of microbial populations participating in the mec ad process the mec can effectively enhance the degradation rates of substrates e g recalcitrant and complex substrates and improve biogas yield introducing mecs into ad can aid ad fermentation by maintaining a balance between ph and volatile fatty acids concentration also improve the mec ad stability furthermore the mec may be used as a biosensor to monitor the process of biogas fermentation via monitoring volatile fatty acids concentrations singh and kumar 2021 direct or proximity contact between syntrophic and methanogenic microorganisms has been perceived as an important function in improving the performance of ad lovley 2017 which also has the same influence on mec ad zhao et al 2016 liu et al designed the single chamber membrane less mec ad type ii reactor for raw waste activated sludge treatment under mild conditions 20 25 c whose ch4 production rate was improved 3 times compared to the control ad liu et al 2016b the dominant community structure of anodic biofilm was typical exoelectrogens including enriched geobacter over 20 shewanella and pseudomonas thus favoring extracellular electron transport in the anodic biofilm the dominant communities in the cathodic biofilm were hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium 6 4 methanospirillum 0 56 and methanobrevibacter 0 01 which in turn led to an increased ch4 production rate and a few acetotrophic methanogens methanosaeta 1 2 and methanosarcina 0 01 were higher than these 0 49 in the anodic biofilm and a few geobacter 0 33 these results elucidated that the acclimation of the biocathode communities promoted the ch4 production rate in the sludge fermentation even though the effects of the internal circulation of the system were still poorly understood however because there was no substantial increase in acetate concentration or acetotrophic methanogens abundance which was identified in the bulk solution around the cathode the methanogenesis process was restricted to the cathodic biofilm cai et al found the ph polarised region in the 2 mm surrounding the cathode ranged from 6 9 to 10 1 using a ph microsensor which substantially affected the ch4 production rate as well as microbial community structure cai et al 2018 subsequently employing qpcr with the mcra gene revealed the dominant microbes on the cathode were hydrogenotrophic methanogens mostly basophilic methanobacterium alcaliphilum implying that regional ph variation in the microenvironment surrounding the electrode was an ecological niche siegert et al also demonstrated that methanobacterium was the dominant cathodic community based on qpcr analysis of mcra gene abundance and 16s rrna gene sequencing for different inocula mecs siegert et al 2014 h2 evolution and diet induced hydrogenotrophic methanogens growth leading to the enrichment of diverse hydrogenotrophic methanogens on the cathode the only methanobacterium that can tolerate this ph surrounding the cathode ranged from 7 to nearly 10 although methanosarcina can compete with methanobacterium as it can derive h2 or electrons from the electrode liu et al 2018 rotaru et al 2014a cai et al further demonstrated the role of external voltages in shifting and maintaining the archaea and bacteria assemblies specifically in the dynamic changes of bacteria and methanogens in response to the introduction of bioelectrochemistry to ad particularly changes in anodic and planktonic communities cai et al 2020 the external voltage evolved exoelectrogens geobacter pairing with methanogens in anodic and cathodic biofilms to generate ch4 resulting in a shift in the dominant microbes from acetotrophic mainly methanosarcina mazei lyc to hydrogenotrophic methanogens mainly basophilic methanobacterium alcaliphilum on the cathode with 0 8 v these findings indicated that electric stimulation could alter bacterial archaeal populations by regulating micro environmental circumstances many studies have reported that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are usually regulated by h2 produced on the cathode surface or by diet lee et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014b and cathodic hydrogenotrophic methanogens contributed the most to the increased ch4 yield despite anodic methanogens were marginally enriched acetotrophic methanogens would not be competitive with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in a single chamber mec ad reactor on the other hand acetobacterium family eubacteriaceae an h2 scavenging bacterium was substantially enriched in the cathodic biofilm however h2 generation may bring about the coexistence of acetobacterium and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cathodic biofilm in another study of an ex situ biological reactor type i treating pig slurry the methylotrophic methanomassiliicoccaceae family belonging to the metabolically active methanogenic archaea was also simultaneously enriched which suggested that methanol might be present in the cathode compartment but not detected cerrillo et al 2018 this outcome differs from previous results methanol is produced on the anode by the fermentation of organic compounds lactate mainly via acetogens clostridium species and then migrates to the cathode through the cation exchange membrane methanomassiliicoccaceae is an obligate h2 consuming methanogen that could reduce methanol and methylamine instead of co2 borrel et al 2013 iino et al 2013 ammonia oxidizing bacteria could partially oxidize ch4 into methanol using ammonia in presence of very low o2 partial pressure taher and chandran 2013 this is the same as that of genera nitrosomonas ammonia oxidizing bacteria which was detected in the cathodic biofilm at low relative abundance 0 01 also some ch4 oxidizing archaea and bacteria can anaerobically oxidize ch4 ge et al 2014 mainly represented by methanotrophic archaea mcglynn et al 2015 however they are still well unknown to date because it is difficult to determine if they are present on the biocathode and little literature focuses on them several studies however have indicated that diet may have a greater effect on ch4 production while cathodic reduction plays only a small role in mec ad zhao et al revealed the differences between the presence and absence of the conductive material carbon felt and voltage supply 0 6 v in mec ad to evaluate the effects of diet on the anaerobic sludge digestion zhao et al 2016 they discovered that adding carbon felt into the ad resulted in a 12 9 rise in ch4 yield and a 17 2 reduction in sludge which means that carbon electrodes serving as conductive materials for electron exchange between various microbes might participate in anaerobic sludge digestion when electrodes were supplied a voltage the digestion performance was considerably enhanced but the cathodic reduction only contributed to 27 5 of increased ch4 yield microbial community analysis revealed the mec ad with carbon electrode had higher abundances of methanosaeta and geobacter especially when the voltage was applied meanwhile indicating that diet played a major role in ad lee et al compared the differences in microbial communities of the bulk sludge between the ad and mec ad type ii reactor in situ membrane less electric biological reactor as specifically shown in fig 1d after a steady state lee et al 2017 the results showed that the archaea communities changed significantly while the dominant bacterial communities remained unchanged methanobacterium genus hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium beijingense and methanobacterium petrolearium species were dominant in ad and methanosarcina genus acetotrophic methanogens methanosarcina thermophila and methanobacterium formicicum species were dominant in mec ad the overall bacterial population was further enriched by 40 in mec ad resulting in accelerating the removal of organic compounds and conversion of volatile fatty acids thus increasing electrochemical ch4 formation during the start up period and improving methanogenic activity at a steady state make it simple to stabilize the entire system rapidly and promote ch4 yield in mec ad 3 3 microbial ecological networks of mec ad each stage s products converge in the extracellular space to form a shared substance pool in ad in addition to syntrophic relationships competition for substances among various bacterial groups is prevalent throughout the ad system fig s1 syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria and acetotrophic methanogens for instance compete for acetate while hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homo acetogens both consume h2 and co2 homo acetogens acetotrophic methanogens and syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria hydrogenotrophic methanogens become mutual partners through product cross feeding and the niche competition develops owing to similar mutual metabolism westerholm et al 2019 the ecological niche competition of mixed microorganisms is affected by their environmental adaptability and the syntrophic metabolism is frequently confined to the more vulnerable partner machado et al 2021 it has been demonstrated that acetate oxidation as the reversal process of the wood ljungdahl pathway to produce acetate is exceedingly unfavorable thermodynamically ragsdale and pierce 2008 therefore syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria are often at a disadvantage in competition with acetotrophic methanogens putting them at a disadvantage in the syntrophic metabolism as a whole however when temperature rises the thermodynamic barrier to acetate oxidation will be relatively declined thereby enhancing the competitiveness of syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria dolfing 2014 besides compared to fermentative bacteria methanogenic archaea generally have lower redundancy and niche width and thus are more susceptible to severe circumstances which in turn impact mutual partners metabolism and even endanger the system s steady state in particular acetotrophic methanogens have a narrower ecological niche than other types of methanogens nobu et al 2020 and they struggle to thrive in extreme settings such as high free ammonia low ph and high salt conditions syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria hydrogenotrophic methanogens with higher tolerance will occupy the ecological vacancy de vrieze et al 2017 nobu et al 2020 on the other hand the correlations of microbial communities in a bioelectrochemical anaerobic system tend to be a small ecosystem where commensalism competition and cooperation are always happening liang et al 2019 both microbes stuck on the electrodes and planktonic species long term immersed in the electric field play crucial roles in the utilization of substrates waste wastewater and the production of ch4 fig 5 microbial growth and metabolic behavior can be easily regulated by the polarized electrodes subsequently mediated electron transfer respiratory for producing ch4 in mec ad park et al 2020 richter et al 2012 it has been widely revealed that functional microbial populations of electrode biofilms are metabolically coordinated spatially clustered and maintain homeostasis to withstand harsh and fierce disturbances leading to high energy recovery efficiencies heijne et al 2021 wang et al 2020c electron transfer occurs in electrode biofilms but responds to mass transfer which also basically adapts in the bulk solution however the involvement of electron and mass transfer between the electrodes and bulk solution is still not well disclosed wang et al 2021a the diffusion causing the electron loss of the electrode mediated electromethanogenesis in mec ad may be supplemented by latent electron transfer in the bulk solution fig 5 which is mainly divided into two types i direct electron transfer and diet geppert et al 2016 ii mediated interspecies electron transfer i e the electrons diffusive exchange between species through soluble electron shuttles e g h2 and formate lovley 2017 wang et al 2020c the interspecies competition in such a system will be more complex than that we are mainly concerned about between exoelectrogens and non exoelectrogens recently it was found that a competition relationship among geobacter genera in the long term evolution of biofilm yan et al 2021 which hinted those specific niches and competitiveness occurred and affected mec ad microbial consortia therefore various microbial assemblies and networks involved in the interspecies electron transfer process are composed of primary secondary fermentative bacteria acetogens eams and methanogens park et al 2020 wang et al 2020c fermentative bacteria representatively e g petrimonas lentimicrobium anaerovorax fusibacter azoarcus dysgonomonas anaerocella and clostridium ferment complex organic polymer substrates into small modules and acetogens representatively e g acetobacterium acetoanaerobium and acetobacteroides also can convert sugars to feed eams representatively e g rhodopseudomonas geobacter comamonas pseudomonas desulfovibrio acinetobacter azonexus arcobacter dechlorobacter dechlorosoma and shewanella for the growth current generation and synchronous organic removal these often overlooked functional microbes long term stimulated by electric field may play surprising roles in the treatment of low concentration nitrate wastewater coupled with the zero valent iron assisted autotrophic denitrification and groundwater bioremediation zhu et al 2019 moreover the versatile effluents of mec ad can be influent in new bioelectrochemical reactors to reduce the start up time and reinforce the performances of the system on the other hand because a well defined microbial ecological network mature biofilms and stable electron transfer paths have already developed with the aid of a weak electric field high voltage start up and low voltage operation is another energy efficient method for boosting ch4 generation in mec ad guo et al 2017 4 future research directions biomethane is a carbon neutral footprint substitute for compressed natural gas from fossil resources with a market value higher than biogas khan et al 2021 the co2 recovery for methanation by mecs will serve as an innovative biogas upgrading technology which can promote organic matter oxidation on the anode and in situ co2 capture and reduction on the cathode mecs provide additional ch4 generation in a coupled mec ad system which means they can serve each other in the complementary character of both technologies of note ch4 has versatile applications spanning from household utilization fuels to industrial manufacture h2 energy carrier and chemical precursors however it is still a sort of greenhouse gas to some extent which needs rigorous supply chain management thus to make the mec ad coupling platform more widely applied in the large scale system for biogas upgrading many challenges require to be overcome the following directions possibly call for more explorations 4 1 microbial metabolic specialization functional microorganisms mainly eams and electro methanogens have profound significance for the methanation process in mec ad however metabolic specialization as a common characteristic for all microbial communities in such a system of the energy environment microbe material nexus has not been well understood especially under the long term stimulation of electrical field even though numerous studies of mec ad have reported the most intuitive microbial communities features exposed to the electric field for a long time e g microbial diversities and compositions variations de vrieze et al 2014 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020c zhao et al 2021 the more molecular level metabolic characteristics such as enzyme activities co factors and amino acid levels are still missing different microbial community assemblies in mec ad are interdependent in metabolic functions and follow the laws of mass and energy balance while maintaining the stability of the system the interrelated interconnected enzyme systems provide supports for the mec ad to perform complementary or alternative metabolic activities identifying the existence and expression of genes encoding key enzymes is a crucial step in probing the link between the system metabolic pathway and syntrophic deconstruction evans et al 2019 wang et al 2021b the transcriptional expression and protein molecular composition of metabolically active microorganisms in mec ad may be determined using metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics chen et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 and the gene expression and metabolic capability of microbiotas can be promptly evaluated through the direct identification of small molecule metabolites and metabolomics can discover the information on the key metabolic pathways and infer the microbiome s potential metabolic mechanism thus a better knowledge of the metabolic specialization of mec ad is required for a better understanding of microbial communities and ecological networks in general 4 2 deciphering microbe electrode interface classifying and identifying microbial communities of electrode biofilms will map a more unambiguous comprehension of the synergistic and interchangeable communication of microbiota on the system performance improvement cai et al 2020 most importantly it is still well unclear how this methanogenic microbiota works synergistically in the cathodic biofilm to share electrons and protons in the cathodic electron transport pathway unprecedented improvement in the knowledge of the biological processes of the ad microbial community in response to the electrical field stimulation is also necessitated the core shell structures with eams fermentative bacteria and methanogens will be closely related to novel biological electrode materials which can be functioned as bio carriers and bio packings to provide a suitable space for aggregated functional microbes growth and distribution long periods of formation for functional biofilm will be decreased and biofilms synthesizing disposing more exclusive products contaminants can be further specified moreover introducing multi omics technologies for example single cell sequencing andrews et al 2021 and epicpcr emulsion paired isolation and concatenation polymerase chain reaction based on single cell isolation hu et al 2021 opens up new avenues for further revealing the metabolic capacity and trend of species for example using a combination of culture omics and existing omics technologies a large number of uncultured microorganisms in mec ad can be deciphered and using a combination of high resolution mass spectrometry with omics technologies the matching and interaction of microbes metabolites can be revealed additionally the combination of microsensors with micro scale microscopy is brewing for in situ exploring the inside of biofilm dynamic behavior as well as proton and electron transfer mechanisms cai et al 2020 4 3 exploitation of mec ad database the novel integrated ad technology shows promising advantages for treatment and resource recovery from waste sludge recalcitrant or complex substrates however optimal operations to the bioreactors need to be further well understood more effective experimental data on the lab scale will provide a more solid guidance basis for future field applications inspired by this an open mec ad database with the performance data and microbial community analysis in this field is urgent to be exploited and launched it is challenging to connect metabolites with species in ad because of the broad range of substrates and high species diversity bioinformatics technologies like ecological network analysis have opened up new possibilities for matching a huge number of organic molecules with microbes zhu et al 2020 on the one hand the construction of a molecular ecological network based on big data analysis can reveal core species in highly complex microbial communities and the interaction between organic matter degradation and microbiota wang et al 2020c on the other hand introducing more detailed system operating and environmental parameters can establish an environment microbe interaction model dominated by deterministic factors xiao et al 2022 life cycle assessment is a comprehensive approach that allows for the analysis of systems and products and can be employed in a hybrid electric biological ad system to discover environmental advantages and improve waste resources management and recovery faragò et al 2021 another interesting direction is directly manufacturing reactor components of mec ad by three dimensional bioprinting based on the coming established mec ad database as a guideline chen et al 2022 and the process of developing cutting edge reactors will be sped up from weeks to days or hours and then the overall cycle of biological processes will be shortened and the size restrictions of the bioreactor will be widened resulting in more efficient bioproducts being produced 5 conclusions the hybrid electric biological ad system possesses promising features and potentials over conventional ad which harness bioenergy from waste and wastewater and simultaneously remove contaminants using diverse functional microorganisms mainly dominated by eams and electro methanogens integrating electromethanogenic biocathodes allows for upgrading the ch4 content of the biogas produced in ad complicated microbial ecological niches including competitive symbiotic and cooperative relationships under the long term electrical field stimulation provide a realistic solution for sharing the unwanted metabolic burden among several microbial strains and exceeding the metabolic capacity limit of a single microbial strain however when artificially systemic microbial communities are constructed a lot of unknown factors e g the ambiguous mechanisms of electron communications among diverse species changes in microbial community structures and compositions and compromise of cultivation parameters are remained thus multidisciplinary research efforts coming from microbiology electrochemistry bioinorganic chemistry physics and material science are sought and required to fine tune the most prominent approaches to

15328,biomethane as a sustainable alternative and carbon neutral renewable energy source to fossil fuels is highly needed to alleviate the global energy crisis and climate change the conventional anaerobic digestion ad process for biomethane production from waste water streams has been widely employed while struggling with a low production rate low biogas qualities and frequent instability the electric biologically hybrid microbial electrochemical anaerobic digestion system mec ad prospects more stable and robust biomethane generation which facilitates complex organic substrates degradation and mediates functional microbial populations by giving a small input power commonly voltages 1 0 v mainly enhancing the communication between electroactive microorganisms and electro methanogens despite numerous bioreactor tests and studies that have been conducted based on the mec ad systems the integrated microbial fingerprints and cooperation accelerating substrate degradation and biomethane production have not been fully summarized herein we present a comprehensive review of this novel developing biotechnology beginning with the principles of mec ad first we examine the fundamentals configurations classifications and influential factors of the whole system s performances reactor types applied voltages temperatures conductive materials etc second extracellular electron transfer either between diverse microbes or between microbes and electrodes for enhanced biomethane production are analyzed third we further conclude electro methanogenesis and microbial interactions and construct ecological networks of microbial consortia in mec ad finally future development and perspectives on mec ad for biomethane production are proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrochemical technologies anaerobic digestion electromethanogenesis biomethane microbial community assembly extracellular electron transfer data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a well established technology for producing methane ch4 through biodegradation and reduction of highly concentrated organic waste angelidaki et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yadav et al 2022 the main merit of ad is the bioconversion of waste water into bioenergy as biogas 60 70 ch4 and 30 40 co2 ning et al 2021 which can be further converted into electrical energy the prime reason for ad reactor instability often originates from the difficulty in maintaining the balance between two groups of acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms which differ widely concerning physiology nutritional needs growth kinetics and sensitivity to environmental conditions park et al 2020 moreover biogas upgrading will be further required to enhance ch4 purification by lowering co2 content xu et al 2021 these shortcomings can negatively affect the ad process viability and prevent ad from being more widespread in commercialization microbial electrochemical technologies are a broad term for electricity harvesting microbial fuel cells and electricity consuming microbial electrolysis cells mecs to drive otherwise nonspontaneous reactions chiranjeevi and patil 2020 yi et al 2022 microbial electrochemical technologies have been proclaimed the promising biotechnology to restrict anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gasses and foster sustainable energy conversion especially mecs possess tremendous potential for anaerobic wastewater treatment and energy recovery fu et al 2021 logan et al 2019 rousseau et al 2020 by giving a small external voltage the mec process is more easily controllable external voltage acts like a switch button which can befittingly adjust the direction and velocity of electron flows to achieve optimal energy efficiency guo et al 2017 moreno et al 2016 wang et al 2020b electrochemical reactions with ad processes i e mec ad have been considered a practical approach to resolving some aforementioned obstacles park et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 2022b more importantly integrating the mecs with the ad system may regulate the establishment of the microbial community structures and electron transfer pathways and thus increase both the overall energy efficiency and the whole system s stability wang et al 2020b c however the mec ad coupling processes need to be further developed and the role of bioelectrochemistry in an anaerobic bioreactor system has not been thoroughly investigated the critical factors that affect the overall efficiency primarily lie in the cooperation and competition between ad populations and electroactive microorganisms eams which refers to those that can directly or indirectly transfer electrons to solid phase electron acceptors exoelectrogens or that receive electrons from the electrode electrotrophs logan and rabaey 2012 logan et al 2019 the unleashing research and reviews are fundamental to implementing feasible mec ad reactor operations in the future nelabhotla and dinamarca 2018 ning et al 2021 park et al 2020 the prevalent investigative directions can be summarized as followings i to explore whether employing cheaper electrode materials to treat wastewater and upgrade biogas ch4 content bo et al 2014 feng et al 2015 lee et al 2017 ren et al 2019 ii to elucidate the principal mechanisms of electron transfer in mecs and better understand bioelectrochemical contributions to organic conversion or ch4 promotion liu et al 2016b zhen et al 2015 iii to assess the performance of the mec ad integrated systems at different scales and identify understand susceptible factors of the stability such as ph temperature and organic loading rates substrate concentrations cerrillo et al 2017 2018 de vrieze et al 2014 lee et al 2019 park et al 2019 sangeetha et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 or to elucidate the energy recovery efficiencies in mec ad gajaraj et al 2016 iv to process different wastes or design reactors and structures zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2014 nonetheless there are only few systematic reviews that strived to unravel the microbial fingerprints i e diversity composition and function of methanation in mec ad addressing the predominant presence of eubacteria and archaea in the biomass and the metabolically active populations therefore this study aims to comprehensively resolve the above gaps in this field to begin with the working principles and typical configurations of mec ad are fully analyzed furthermore the influential factors such as reactor configurations applied voltages temperatures conductive materials etc of the system s performance as well as electron transfer in such a versatile coupling system are well summarized finally the electroactive community especially electro methanogens with the capability of catalyzing the conversion of co2 into ch4 and complicated ecological networks are investigated from the perspective of the mec ad integration and development we expect to provide a useful reference to comprehensively understand methanation reactions microbial community regulation and interaction involved in the bioelectrochemical electron transfer process for upgrading bioenergy recovery 2 overview of mec ad 2 1 working principles and classifications to avoid or eliminate the ch4 formation in mec ad the following strategies have been adopted in the past i bioelectrodes exposed to the air intermittently call and logan 2008 ii operation under lower ph hu et al 2008 lower temperature conditions lu et al 2011 or with ultraviolet irradiation hou et al 2014 iii washout of methanogens by lowering hydraulic retention time wang et al 2009 iv reducing carbonate concentration rozendal et al 2008 and v addition of methanogen inhibitors e g 2 bromoethanesulfonate chae et al 2010 ch4 as a main product of ad has been widely used to produce electricity in wastewater treatment facilities albeit ch4 contains less energy than h2 per unit of mass however rather than avoiding ch4 production it has been suggested that combining mecs and ad may represent a promising strategy for bioenergy production and a practical biofunneling process for removing residual organic matter present in the digester effluent clauwaert and verstraete 2009 mecs can enhance superior resource recovery from ad effluents rich in high concentration nutrients or organics because of the destabilization or inhibition of ad the ad effluent is also likely to be polished by the mec with the capacity of handling low organic loading rates fig 1 displays a schematic representation of the working principles of the mec ad coupling system electrons shuttled from the oxidation of organic matter electron donor to nad alongside protons and co2 are transported to the anode and flow through an external circuit to the cathode to form ch4 this process is supported by exoelectrogenic microorganisms exoelectrogens that are capable of transferring electrons from biodegradable substrates outside the cell wang et al 2020a electrotrophic microorganisms electrotrophs on the other hand can accept electrons into the cell from external sources for example various functional species on the cathode in mec ad which is mainly dominated by electro methanogens to date the exoelectrogens isolated from natural environment belong primarily to the phylum of proteobacteria and firmicutes mostly facultative anaerobic microorganisms which can harvest energy to sustain growth via anaerobic respiration and fermentation metabolism most exoelectrogens are fe iii reducing bacteria viz fe iii is the final electron acceptor of the respiratory chain lovley 2006 table s1 summarizes reported exoelectrogens in microbial electrochemical systems the ex situ electric biological reactor type i reactor or in situ electric biological reactor type ii reactor have been developed and investigated in numerous studies in the past decade using different equipped electrodes in the ad reactor cerrillo et al 2017 liu et al 2016a zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 it can be easily concluded that the type ii reactor in situ electric biological reactor especially the single chamber mec ad is more common accounting for over 90 of reported works fig 1e table s2 this might be because the mec integrated into ad can save costs and the single chamber also can promote a higher ch4 production rate it is also confirmed that the in situ biogas upgrading system is more efficient than the ex situ one xu et al 2014 typically the single chamber systems are considered a better way to eliminate ph gradient and produce a lower ohmic voltage compared to the dual chambers with a separator call and logan 2008 wang et al 2022a on the other hand the ph polarization around the cathode may still act as a barrier for microbes in the biofilm due to a higher ph value another advantage of the single chamber mec ad is that the membrane free bioreactors can allow microbes freely reach and colonize from one electrode to the other one and thus electrons not only flow to the cathode but also to the anode which means anodic methanogens mainly composed of hydrogenotrophic methanogens also can consume electrons and protons to reduce co2 into ch4 wang et al 2022a thus a more mutualistic relationship can be formed in mec ad it is known that different applied potentials can bring varying ch4 production rates in mecs liu et al 2005 with the increase in applied anode potentials the ch4 production rate and cod removal efficiency increased simultaneously fig 1f table s2 however the ch4 production rate increased first and then decreased with the increase in applied cell voltages from 0 5 to 1 5 v whereas cod removal efficiency always kept rising fig 1f table s2 which used the 1 to 1 mixture of glucose and ad effluent as a substrate type ii reactor choi et al 2017 several studies concerning the fixed voltage applied in the coupling system have also similar confirmations tested with various substrates bo et al 2014 feng et al 2015 of note the optimal external voltages for mec ad are essential to achieve high removal rates of pollutants maximum biogas production and supreme energy recovery there is an obvious difference in temperature between ad and mecs acetotrophic methanogenesis would become the prime limiting rate step to come up than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at a lower temperature which is far more temperature sensitive the methanogenic activity would become sluggish at low temperatures 20 c because of fatty acid accumulation ad requires mesophilic 25 37 c and thermophilic temperatures 55 65 c to ensure optimal microbial activity many types of wastewater are discharged at low temperatures such as beer wastewater soft drink industrial wastewater and domestic sewage with typical temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 c the low temperature usually decreases methanogens activity and slows the growth rate in ad consequently resulting in a low methanogenic rate and cod removal liu et al 2016a fig 1g table s2 however introducing electrodes to a complicated anaerobic microbial community driven by external electricity possibly causes diverse spatial self organization which means this manipulation can bring more diversities for improving the robustness of the system goldschmidt et al 2021 thus can substantially enhance the ch4 production rate and cod removal efficiency meanwhile electrode materials determine the reaction rates and products of mec ad and are also a crucial partner of microbe material interfaces which usually grip electroactivity and biocompatibility fig 1h table s2 four different cathode materials of carbon felt carbon paper titanium mesh and stainless steel mesh were investigated to recover ch4 from the phenanthrene biodegradation in mec ad type ii reactor lin et al 2019 the result revealed that the carbon paper biocathode attained the highest cod removal efficiency as well as phenanthrene degradation rate also carbon based cathode materials were beneficial for microbes adhesion and diet however metallic based cathode materials could facilitate h2 transfer thus developing available electrode materials with high stability and conductivity as well as a large surface area of biocompatibility undoubtedly is beneficial for microbes adherence and functional biofilm formation subsequentially boosting superior performances of mec ad plus the fundamental understanding depth of microbe material interfaces is required to be untangled to further facilitate the titer of biogas in mec ad other unnoticeable factors such as ion exchange membranes electrode positions arrangement and proper operational modes batch or continuous are also expected to play key roles in the mec ad coupling system s performance the coupling mec ad reactor type ii reactor in the presence of a proton exchange membrane or an anion exchange membrane was evaluated using co2 simulating the typical influent biogas from an ad process zeppilli et al 2016 the reactor with an anion exchange membrane has almost 1 7 time coulomb efficiency cathode capture efficiency and co2 removal rate and an observed microbial growth yield 0 175 0 005 g cod g 1 cod obviously lower than that reported in a conventional activated sludge system 0 50 g cod g 1 cod whereas the proton exchange membrane presented in the reactor showed higher ch4 production rate and cod removal efficiency but exhibited a higher energy demand per unit of removal co2 when considering the effects of electrode positioning and arrangement along with hydraulic retention time on the coupling system type ii reactor to treat beer brewery wastewater the electrodes arranged at the bottom of the reactor with the cathode placed above the anode and hydraulic retention time of 36 h the integrated system had the maximum ch4 production rate cod removal efficiency and total organic carbon as well as carbohydrate removal efficiencies sangeetha et al 2017 these results demonstrated that the proper placement of the electrodes in the coupling system is a crucial parameter that not only affects the mass transfer and utilization of the substrates but also has a profound effect on ch4 production by regulating the prevalence of microbial communities in electrode biofilms which is consistent with this study the bottom positioned electrodes enriched more methanogens and electrogens furthermore the mec ad with different inoculants reactor configurations mediums etc also exhibits different performances however the fundamental reasons that the factors mentioned above affect the methanogenesis performance of the mec ad coupling system may be attributed to the changes in microbial community evolutions as further discussed below 2 2 extracelluar electron transfer in mec ad ch4 formation in both ad and mec ad depends on extracellular electron transfer mainly involved in interspecies electron transfer microbe microbe direct or mediated electron transfer microbe solid state electron acceptor donor referring to electrodes fig 2 a in the microbial consortium of mec ad other eams other than electro methanogens can directly or indirectly accept electrons from electrodes and perform interspecies transfer electrons to methanogens direct interspecies electron transfer diet is an alternative mediated interspecies electron transfer in which soluble electron carriers shuttle between partners for electron donors and acceptors lovley 2017 the nanowires with metallic like conductivity play a crucial role in the long range electron transport of either diet or direct electron transfer lovley and holmes 2022 cytochrome c as an important electron transfer protein participates in many biological functions such as cellular respiration lovley and holmes 2022 and as a bridge between the cytoplasm inside and outside of cells gu et al 2021 increasing the content of cytochrome c can effectively reduce the amount of metabolic energy invested in growing electrically conductive pili promoting the efficiency of diet liu et al 2012 hence geobacter possessing a vast network of cytochrome c can easily establish a direct connection with insoluble electron acceptors e g electrodes leonor et al 2013 to be noted not all methanogens contain cytochromes but have hydrogenases which present on the surface of the cell in addition electrically conductive materials such as carbon fiber graphite felt graphite rod etc have orders of magnitude higher conductivity than the biologically formed electron conductance that is pili deficient geobacter can transfer electrons freely to connect with methanogens for syntrophic metabolism in the presence of granular activated carbon as conductive material liu et al 2012 electrons possibly transfer from both inside and outside the cell that is intracellular and extracellular electron transfer kjeldsen et al 2019 the ability of electrons to enter and exit cells is of course evolved in microorganisms independent of the reason that the current flows in mecs however the cellular machinery by which methanogens originally absorb electrons is exactly unclear yet as well as which methanogens are electroactive at all it is assumed that the above electron uptake pathways contribute to the overall process specifically in mixed cultures electro methanogens are thought to accept electrons directly off the cathode surface to form ch4 or indirectly take up the h2 produced on the cathode to form ch4 fig 2b hydrogenases as important molecules for methanogenic metabolism can activate h2 for the further utilization within cells however hydrogenase independent uptake and metabolism of electrons have been proofed in a wild type strain of methanococcus maripaludis in the electromethanogenesis system which indicated that hydrogenases are not mandatory in indirect electron transfer lohner et al 2014 2 3 biomethane production pathways methanogens can utilize a limited number of substrates to generate ch4 mainly including co2 and h2 low fatty acids such as acetate and formate c1 compounds and methyl compounds such as methanol methylamines and methyl sulfides costa and leigh 2014 evans et al 2019 all possible reactions of methanogenesis in mec ad are summarized fig 3 a the substrates are oxidized via eams and electrons are extracellularly transferred to the anode in mec ad i e low molecular organics are fermented into co2 protons and electrons by eams attached to the anode surface and then electrons are transferred to the cathode through an external circuit under an artificially applied potential between electrodes after which co2 and protons are reduced to ch4 on the cathode surface wang et al 2022a 2022b the reactions governing the ch4 production involved in mecs can be mainly divided into two parts anodic reaction ch3cooh 2 h2o 2 co2 8 h 8 e e0 0 187 and eanode 0 289 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she reaction 1 cathodic reaction 8 h 8 e 4 h2 e0 0 and ecathode 0 412 v vs she reaction 2 co2 4 h2 ch4 2 h2o e0 0 227 and ecathode 0 248 v vs she reaction 3 fundamental understanding and technological advancements in ch4 production in the ad process have progressed rapidly and in parallel in the last decade ampese et al 2022 emebu et al 2022 therefore the occurrence of ch4 in mec ad will be highly highlighted in this review chen et al firstly reported that a new process of a biocathode without precious metal catalysts coated could convert electrical current and co2 into ch4 cheng et al 2009 they demonstrated that the ch4 production did not necessarily require h2 evolution and electrons can be obtained directly from the electrode through electro methanogens attached to the biocathode to form ch4 and the main microbial species involved in ch4 generation were archaeon methanobacterium palustre using h2 but not acetate for growth batlle vilanova et al found that h2 as an intermediate made a greater contribution to generating ch4 in mec ad without acetate or other small molecular organics detected batlle vilanova et al 2015 clauwaert et al ran the fed continuous membrane less mec ad with 1 38 kg cod m 3 day 1 acetate and reached 1 65 4 41 times of ch4 production rate 0 28 0 75 l ch4 l 1 day 1 at the applied voltage of ca 0 8 v higher than that of under the open circuit 0 17 l ch4 l 1 day 1 it further suggested that 55 147 of acetate could be recovered as ch4 that is 23 61 of ch4 came from acetate clauwaert and verstraete 2009 it is a fact that electron flow is always accompanied by energy consumption gibbs free energy in mecs so combining half reaction for the electron sources to form ch4 as a final product from acetate acetotrophic methanogenesis h2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and the cathode together with cathodic methanogenesis it is easy to conclude that the cathodic potential in bioelectrochemistry determines the gibbs free energy and drives ch4 production δgcathode 0 nfecathode fig 3b the bioelectrochemical reduction of co2 into ch4 reaction 3 requires an additional voltage larger than a theoretical voltage of 0 248 v vs she at standard conditions 25 c ph 7 due to the effect of quite a large overpotential that however could be possibly reduced by using a microbial cathode cai et al 2021 another bonus the electrical field would remarkably benefit from the anaerobic process for example positively inducing glucose fermentation to yield more acetate and less propionate and butyrate which is upregulating the percent of acetate to the total of propionate and butyrate from 97 of ad to 148 of mec ad guo et al 2017 thus the mec ad process could trigger the available journey of respiratory electron transfer from interspecies h2 transfer to diet or cross interspecies electron transfer ultimately altering more ch4 generation fig 3c a more elaborate understanding of microbial electron transfer mechanisms that is how the associated microbes accept electrons at the molecular level steering electron flows to targeted biofuels apart from c1 ch4 longer carbon chain c2 bioalkanes are also desired and improving co2 conversion efficiency should be priorities for microbial electrochemical technologies advancement coupling of ad lin et al 2021 3 roles of electromethanogenesis in mec ad 3 1 electromethanogens all microorganisms discussed in this review are based on the mec ad system so these are mixed cultures due to low ch4 production rates 2 3 44 mmol day 1 m 2 and current densities 500 ma m 2 through pure cultures of methanogens attached to the cathode to produce ch4 sato et al 2013 mixed cultures are more tolerant to environmental fluctuations but it will be challenging to pinpoint electromethanogens from electroactive consortia which may contain enriched methanogenic strains that can be detected through sequencing analysis and are thus possibly considered as being electroactive table s3 lists several instances of methanogens that predominate in electroactive consortia methodologies applied for the microbial community characterization and primer information commonly used in mec ad are shown in table s4 some studies were conducted with pure methanogenic cultures that demonstrated their electroactivity for example methanobacterium beese vasbender et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 methanococcus maripaludis lohner et al 2014 methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus hara et al 2013 methanosarcina barkeri rowe et al 2019 and methanospirillum hungatei walker et al 2019 more investigations on electromethanogens as well as under extreme operational conditions are required methanogens are the predominant cathodic archaeal community in mec ad to generate ch4 whose taxonomy and division can be generally divided into four classes seven orders and fifteen families fig 4 burdukiewicz et al 2018 even though methanogens may employ different substrates differ in shape and inhabit varied optimum growth conditions and habitats all methanogens share the ability to produce ch4 and the requirement for anaerobic growth thauer et al 2008 in particular ch4 producing archaea can be further divided into three categories based on their preferred substrates acetotrophic that convert acetate into ch4 and hydrogenotrophic methanogens that convert h2 and co2 or formate into ch4 which may provide perspectives for reducing greenhouse gasses emissions thus are considered as the most important role in methanogenic metabolism in mec ad and methylotrophic methanogens that use methanol or methylated amines and sulfides generally belonging to methanosarcinales because microorganisms utilize inorganic carbon sources for cell growth autotrophic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is also regarded as the lithotrophic process offre et al 2013 in addition hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is more likely to be enriched on the cathode whereas acetotrophic methanogens prefer being enriched on the anode zhao et al 2015 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is also often accompanied by homo acetogenesis metabolized with h2 co2 to produce acetate via the wood ljungdahl pathway in the case of homo acetogens like acetobacterium woodii or species out of the bacterial group clostridia rachbauer et al 2017 however homo acetogenic processes have been reported to occur only when methanogenesis is inhibited parameswaran et al 2010 syntrophic acetogenesis also can occur in the methanogenesis process in which specialized organotrophic microbes degrade the main intermediate metabolite propionate to acetate h2 and co2 and symbiotically feed these by products to partnering hydrogenotrophic and acetogenic methanogens chen et al 2020 homo acetogenesis 2 co2 4 h2

reaction 6 methanogenic archaea are definitely dominant in mec ad bacteria can also play an important role for example as an anchor to assist the formation of electrode biofilms particularly among them e g sphingomonas spp and mycobacterium frederiksbergense wick et al 2004 can endure external electrostimulation and vigorously attach on the electrode surface fermentative bacteria can further use cell lysis to produce h2 and co2 to feed methanogens and some bacteria can produce redox mediators that can act as electron carriers thus improving ch4 yield via biocathodic methanogens pham et al 2008 some exoelectrogenic bacteria even though typically detected on the anode geelhoed and stams 2011 can catalyze electrons and protons into h2 on the biocathode which can benefit from h2 mediated electromethanogenesis however some bacteria can divert the electron flow away from electromethanogenesis for example homo acetogens as scavengers for h2 and co2 can divert electron equivalents away from ch4 generation when acetotrophic methanogens are not present or not active on the biocathode dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 some bacteria need additional fermentation and would deliver electrons to volatile fatty acids resulting in a decrease in the final electron flow to ch4 hence how bacteria influence methanogenesis in different ways are required more investigation dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 3 2 microbial interactions between exoelectrogens and electro methanogens in mec ad eams enable exchanging of electrons with their external environment mainly including electrodes and minerals lovley and holmes considerably overviewed the phylogenetic diversity of eams from the natural environment to microbial electrochemical technologies in depth lovley and holmes 2022 only a few microbes have been proven to directly transfer electrons from organics to a conductive surface exoelectrogens capable of electron transfer can be divided into four taxonomic groups iron reducers e g geobacter sulfurreducens lovley and phillips 1988 and shewanella oneidensis myers and nealson 1988 sulfate reducers e g desulfuromonas acetoxidans bond et al 2002 and geothrix fermentans bond and lovley 2005 nitrate reducers e g comamonas denitrificans kiely et al 2010 and paracoccus pantotrophus xing et al 2010 and phototrophic purple nonsulfur bacteria e g rhodopseudomonas palustris xing et al 2008 geobacter as one of the most crucial members of exoelectrogens with the high efficiency of electron transfer between bacteria and electrode is well known to comprise a major portion of anodic populations logan et al 2019 presumably the great increase of geobacter considerably facilitated organic oxidation and electron transport which occurred concurrently with the arising of current and ch4 production thus the development of a geobacter dominated community at the anode is considered to have a vast potential for ch4 recovery in a mec ad system methylocystis sp is also particularly common in the ch4 producing environment and ch4 generated on the biocathode in mec ad is beneficial to such a certain microorganism batlle vilanova et al 2015 methylocystis sp is capable of converting ch4 to co2 under an aerobic condition stein et al 2011 whose activity can provoke the archaea activity to remove o2 that diffuses from the anode to biocathode in mecs creating an anaerobic environment however this reaction lowers the efficiency of ch4 production because of the consumption of ch4 by altering the activity and diversity of microbial populations participating in the mec ad process the mec can effectively enhance the degradation rates of substrates e g recalcitrant and complex substrates and improve biogas yield introducing mecs into ad can aid ad fermentation by maintaining a balance between ph and volatile fatty acids concentration also improve the mec ad stability furthermore the mec may be used as a biosensor to monitor the process of biogas fermentation via monitoring volatile fatty acids concentrations singh and kumar 2021 direct or proximity contact between syntrophic and methanogenic microorganisms has been perceived as an important function in improving the performance of ad lovley 2017 which also has the same influence on mec ad zhao et al 2016 liu et al designed the single chamber membrane less mec ad type ii reactor for raw waste activated sludge treatment under mild conditions 20 25 c whose ch4 production rate was improved 3 times compared to the control ad liu et al 2016b the dominant community structure of anodic biofilm was typical exoelectrogens including enriched geobacter over 20 shewanella and pseudomonas thus favoring extracellular electron transport in the anodic biofilm the dominant communities in the cathodic biofilm were hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium 6 4 methanospirillum 0 56 and methanobrevibacter 0 01 which in turn led to an increased ch4 production rate and a few acetotrophic methanogens methanosaeta 1 2 and methanosarcina 0 01 were higher than these 0 49 in the anodic biofilm and a few geobacter 0 33 these results elucidated that the acclimation of the biocathode communities promoted the ch4 production rate in the sludge fermentation even though the effects of the internal circulation of the system were still poorly understood however because there was no substantial increase in acetate concentration or acetotrophic methanogens abundance which was identified in the bulk solution around the cathode the methanogenesis process was restricted to the cathodic biofilm cai et al found the ph polarised region in the 2 mm surrounding the cathode ranged from 6 9 to 10 1 using a ph microsensor which substantially affected the ch4 production rate as well as microbial community structure cai et al 2018 subsequently employing qpcr with the mcra gene revealed the dominant microbes on the cathode were hydrogenotrophic methanogens mostly basophilic methanobacterium alcaliphilum implying that regional ph variation in the microenvironment surrounding the electrode was an ecological niche siegert et al also demonstrated that methanobacterium was the dominant cathodic community based on qpcr analysis of mcra gene abundance and 16s rrna gene sequencing for different inocula mecs siegert et al 2014 h2 evolution and diet induced hydrogenotrophic methanogens growth leading to the enrichment of diverse hydrogenotrophic methanogens on the cathode the only methanobacterium that can tolerate this ph surrounding the cathode ranged from 7 to nearly 10 although methanosarcina can compete with methanobacterium as it can derive h2 or electrons from the electrode liu et al 2018 rotaru et al 2014a cai et al further demonstrated the role of external voltages in shifting and maintaining the archaea and bacteria assemblies specifically in the dynamic changes of bacteria and methanogens in response to the introduction of bioelectrochemistry to ad particularly changes in anodic and planktonic communities cai et al 2020 the external voltage evolved exoelectrogens geobacter pairing with methanogens in anodic and cathodic biofilms to generate ch4 resulting in a shift in the dominant microbes from acetotrophic mainly methanosarcina mazei lyc to hydrogenotrophic methanogens mainly basophilic methanobacterium alcaliphilum on the cathode with 0 8 v these findings indicated that electric stimulation could alter bacterial archaeal populations by regulating micro environmental circumstances many studies have reported that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are usually regulated by h2 produced on the cathode surface or by diet lee et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014b and cathodic hydrogenotrophic methanogens contributed the most to the increased ch4 yield despite anodic methanogens were marginally enriched acetotrophic methanogens would not be competitive with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in a single chamber mec ad reactor on the other hand acetobacterium family eubacteriaceae an h2 scavenging bacterium was substantially enriched in the cathodic biofilm however h2 generation may bring about the coexistence of acetobacterium and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cathodic biofilm in another study of an ex situ biological reactor type i treating pig slurry the methylotrophic methanomassiliicoccaceae family belonging to the metabolically active methanogenic archaea was also simultaneously enriched which suggested that methanol might be present in the cathode compartment but not detected cerrillo et al 2018 this outcome differs from previous results methanol is produced on the anode by the fermentation of organic compounds lactate mainly via acetogens clostridium species and then migrates to the cathode through the cation exchange membrane methanomassiliicoccaceae is an obligate h2 consuming methanogen that could reduce methanol and methylamine instead of co2 borrel et al 2013 iino et al 2013 ammonia oxidizing bacteria could partially oxidize ch4 into methanol using ammonia in presence of very low o2 partial pressure taher and chandran 2013 this is the same as that of genera nitrosomonas ammonia oxidizing bacteria which was detected in the cathodic biofilm at low relative abundance 0 01 also some ch4 oxidizing archaea and bacteria can anaerobically oxidize ch4 ge et al 2014 mainly represented by methanotrophic archaea mcglynn et al 2015 however they are still well unknown to date because it is difficult to determine if they are present on the biocathode and little literature focuses on them several studies however have indicated that diet may have a greater effect on ch4 production while cathodic reduction plays only a small role in mec ad zhao et al revealed the differences between the presence and absence of the conductive material carbon felt and voltage supply 0 6 v in mec ad to evaluate the effects of diet on the anaerobic sludge digestion zhao et al 2016 they discovered that adding carbon felt into the ad resulted in a 12 9 rise in ch4 yield and a 17 2 reduction in sludge which means that carbon electrodes serving as conductive materials for electron exchange between various microbes might participate in anaerobic sludge digestion when electrodes were supplied a voltage the digestion performance was considerably enhanced but the cathodic reduction only contributed to 27 5 of increased ch4 yield microbial community analysis revealed the mec ad with carbon electrode had higher abundances of methanosaeta and geobacter especially when the voltage was applied meanwhile indicating that diet played a major role in ad lee et al compared the differences in microbial communities of the bulk sludge between the ad and mec ad type ii reactor in situ membrane less electric biological reactor as specifically shown in fig 1d after a steady state lee et al 2017 the results showed that the archaea communities changed significantly while the dominant bacterial communities remained unchanged methanobacterium genus hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium beijingense and methanobacterium petrolearium species were dominant in ad and methanosarcina genus acetotrophic methanogens methanosarcina thermophila and methanobacterium formicicum species were dominant in mec ad the overall bacterial population was further enriched by 40 in mec ad resulting in accelerating the removal of organic compounds and conversion of volatile fatty acids thus increasing electrochemical ch4 formation during the start up period and improving methanogenic activity at a steady state make it simple to stabilize the entire system rapidly and promote ch4 yield in mec ad 3 3 microbial ecological networks of mec ad each stage s products converge in the extracellular space to form a shared substance pool in ad in addition to syntrophic relationships competition for substances among various bacterial groups is prevalent throughout the ad system fig s1 syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria and acetotrophic methanogens for instance compete for acetate while hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homo acetogens both consume h2 and co2 homo acetogens acetotrophic methanogens and syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria hydrogenotrophic methanogens become mutual partners through product cross feeding and the niche competition develops owing to similar mutual metabolism westerholm et al 2019 the ecological niche competition of mixed microorganisms is affected by their environmental adaptability and the syntrophic metabolism is frequently confined to the more vulnerable partner machado et al 2021 it has been demonstrated that acetate oxidation as the reversal process of the wood ljungdahl pathway to produce acetate is exceedingly unfavorable thermodynamically ragsdale and pierce 2008 therefore syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria are often at a disadvantage in competition with acetotrophic methanogens putting them at a disadvantage in the syntrophic metabolism as a whole however when temperature rises the thermodynamic barrier to acetate oxidation will be relatively declined thereby enhancing the competitiveness of syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria dolfing 2014 besides compared to fermentative bacteria methanogenic archaea generally have lower redundancy and niche width and thus are more susceptible to severe circumstances which in turn impact mutual partners metabolism and even endanger the system s steady state in particular acetotrophic methanogens have a narrower ecological niche than other types of methanogens nobu et al 2020 and they struggle to thrive in extreme settings such as high free ammonia low ph and high salt conditions syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria hydrogenotrophic methanogens with higher tolerance will occupy the ecological vacancy de vrieze et al 2017 nobu et al 2020 on the other hand the correlations of microbial communities in a bioelectrochemical anaerobic system tend to be a small ecosystem where commensalism competition and cooperation are always happening liang et al 2019 both microbes stuck on the electrodes and planktonic species long term immersed in the electric field play crucial roles in the utilization of substrates waste wastewater and the production of ch4 fig 5 microbial growth and metabolic behavior can be easily regulated by the polarized electrodes subsequently mediated electron transfer respiratory for producing ch4 in mec ad park et al 2020 richter et al 2012 it has been widely revealed that functional microbial populations of electrode biofilms are metabolically coordinated spatially clustered and maintain homeostasis to withstand harsh and fierce disturbances leading to high energy recovery efficiencies heijne et al 2021 wang et al 2020c electron transfer occurs in electrode biofilms but responds to mass transfer which also basically adapts in the bulk solution however the involvement of electron and mass transfer between the electrodes and bulk solution is still not well disclosed wang et al 2021a the diffusion causing the electron loss of the electrode mediated electromethanogenesis in mec ad may be supplemented by latent electron transfer in the bulk solution fig 5 which is mainly divided into two types i direct electron transfer and diet geppert et al 2016 ii mediated interspecies electron transfer i e the electrons diffusive exchange between species through soluble electron shuttles e g h2 and formate lovley 2017 wang et al 2020c the interspecies competition in such a system will be more complex than that we are mainly concerned about between exoelectrogens and non exoelectrogens recently it was found that a competition relationship among geobacter genera in the long term evolution of biofilm yan et al 2021 which hinted those specific niches and competitiveness occurred and affected mec ad microbial consortia therefore various microbial assemblies and networks involved in the interspecies electron transfer process are composed of primary secondary fermentative bacteria acetogens eams and methanogens park et al 2020 wang et al 2020c fermentative bacteria representatively e g petrimonas lentimicrobium anaerovorax fusibacter azoarcus dysgonomonas anaerocella and clostridium ferment complex organic polymer substrates into small modules and acetogens representatively e g acetobacterium acetoanaerobium and acetobacteroides also can convert sugars to feed eams representatively e g rhodopseudomonas geobacter comamonas pseudomonas desulfovibrio acinetobacter azonexus arcobacter dechlorobacter dechlorosoma and shewanella for the growth current generation and synchronous organic removal these often overlooked functional microbes long term stimulated by electric field may play surprising roles in the treatment of low concentration nitrate wastewater coupled with the zero valent iron assisted autotrophic denitrification and groundwater bioremediation zhu et al 2019 moreover the versatile effluents of mec ad can be influent in new bioelectrochemical reactors to reduce the start up time and reinforce the performances of the system on the other hand because a well defined microbial ecological network mature biofilms and stable electron transfer paths have already developed with the aid of a weak electric field high voltage start up and low voltage operation is another energy efficient method for boosting ch4 generation in mec ad guo et al 2017 4 future research directions biomethane is a carbon neutral footprint substitute for compressed natural gas from fossil resources with a market value higher than biogas khan et al 2021 the co2 recovery for methanation by mecs will serve as an innovative biogas upgrading technology which can promote organic matter oxidation on the anode and in situ co2 capture and reduction on the cathode mecs provide additional ch4 generation in a coupled mec ad system which means they can serve each other in the complementary character of both technologies of note ch4 has versatile applications spanning from household utilization fuels to industrial manufacture h2 energy carrier and chemical precursors however it is still a sort of greenhouse gas to some extent which needs rigorous supply chain management thus to make the mec ad coupling platform more widely applied in the large scale system for biogas upgrading many challenges require to be overcome the following directions possibly call for more explorations 4 1 microbial metabolic specialization functional microorganisms mainly eams and electro methanogens have profound significance for the methanation process in mec ad however metabolic specialization as a common characteristic for all microbial communities in such a system of the energy environment microbe material nexus has not been well understood especially under the long term stimulation of electrical field even though numerous studies of mec ad have reported the most intuitive microbial communities features exposed to the electric field for a long time e g microbial diversities and compositions variations de vrieze et al 2014 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020c zhao et al 2021 the more molecular level metabolic characteristics such as enzyme activities co factors and amino acid levels are still missing different microbial community assemblies in mec ad are interdependent in metabolic functions and follow the laws of mass and energy balance while maintaining the stability of the system the interrelated interconnected enzyme systems provide supports for the mec ad to perform complementary or alternative metabolic activities identifying the existence and expression of genes encoding key enzymes is a crucial step in probing the link between the system metabolic pathway and syntrophic deconstruction evans et al 2019 wang et al 2021b the transcriptional expression and protein molecular composition of metabolically active microorganisms in mec ad may be determined using metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics chen et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 and the gene expression and metabolic capability of microbiotas can be promptly evaluated through the direct identification of small molecule metabolites and metabolomics can discover the information on the key metabolic pathways and infer the microbiome s potential metabolic mechanism thus a better knowledge of the metabolic specialization of mec ad is required for a better understanding of microbial communities and ecological networks in general 4 2 deciphering microbe electrode interface classifying and identifying microbial communities of electrode biofilms will map a more unambiguous comprehension of the synergistic and interchangeable communication of microbiota on the system performance improvement cai et al 2020 most importantly it is still well unclear how this methanogenic microbiota works synergistically in the cathodic biofilm to share electrons and protons in the cathodic electron transport pathway unprecedented improvement in the knowledge of the biological processes of the ad microbial community in response to the electrical field stimulation is also necessitated the core shell structures with eams fermentative bacteria and methanogens will be closely related to novel biological electrode materials which can be functioned as bio carriers and bio packings to provide a suitable space for aggregated functional microbes growth and distribution long periods of formation for functional biofilm will be decreased and biofilms synthesizing disposing more exclusive products contaminants can be further specified moreover introducing multi omics technologies for example single cell sequencing andrews et al 2021 and epicpcr emulsion paired isolation and concatenation polymerase chain reaction based on single cell isolation hu et al 2021 opens up new avenues for further revealing the metabolic capacity and trend of species for example using a combination of culture omics and existing omics technologies a large number of uncultured microorganisms in mec ad can be deciphered and using a combination of high resolution mass spectrometry with omics technologies the matching and interaction of microbes metabolites can be revealed additionally the combination of microsensors with micro scale microscopy is brewing for in situ exploring the inside of biofilm dynamic behavior as well as proton and electron transfer mechanisms cai et al 2020 4 3 exploitation of mec ad database the novel integrated ad technology shows promising advantages for treatment and resource recovery from waste sludge recalcitrant or complex substrates however optimal operations to the bioreactors need to be further well understood more effective experimental data on the lab scale will provide a more solid guidance basis for future field applications inspired by this an open mec ad database with the performance data and microbial community analysis in this field is urgent to be exploited and launched it is challenging to connect metabolites with species in ad because of the broad range of substrates and high species diversity bioinformatics technologies like ecological network analysis have opened up new possibilities for matching a huge number of organic molecules with microbes zhu et al 2020 on the one hand the construction of a molecular ecological network based on big data analysis can reveal core species in highly complex microbial communities and the interaction between organic matter degradation and microbiota wang et al 2020c on the other hand introducing more detailed system operating and environmental parameters can establish an environment microbe interaction model dominated by deterministic factors xiao et al 2022 life cycle assessment is a comprehensive approach that allows for the analysis of systems and products and can be employed in a hybrid electric biological ad system to discover environmental advantages and improve waste resources management and recovery faragò et al 2021 another interesting direction is directly manufacturing reactor components of mec ad by three dimensional bioprinting based on the coming established mec ad database as a guideline chen et al 2022 and the process of developing cutting edge reactors will be sped up from weeks to days or hours and then the overall cycle of biological processes will be shortened and the size restrictions of the bioreactor will be widened resulting in more efficient bioproducts being produced 5 conclusions the hybrid electric biological ad system possesses promising features and potentials over conventional ad which harness bioenergy from waste and wastewater and simultaneously remove contaminants using diverse functional microorganisms mainly dominated by eams and electro methanogens integrating electromethanogenic biocathodes allows for upgrading the ch4 content of the biogas produced in ad complicated microbial ecological niches including competitive symbiotic and cooperative relationships under the long term electrical field stimulation provide a realistic solution for sharing the unwanted metabolic burden among several microbial strains and exceeding the metabolic capacity limit of a single microbial strain however when artificially systemic microbial communities are constructed a lot of unknown factors e g the ambiguous mechanisms of electron communications among diverse species changes in microbial community structures and compositions and compromise of cultivation parameters are remained thus multidisciplinary research efforts coming from microbiology electrochemistry bioinorganic chemistry physics and material science are sought and required to fine tune the most prominent approaches to

15329,bioelectrochemical systems bess are promising devices for wastewater treatment and bio energy production since various processes are interacted and affect the overall performance of the device the development of theoretical modeling is an efficient approach to understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern the performance of the bes this review aims to summarize the physiochemical principle and mathematical method in bes models which is of great importance for the establishment of an accurate model while has received little attention in previous reviews in this review we begin with a classification of existing models including bioelectrochemical models electronic models and machine learning models subsequently physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in models are discussed from two aspects one is the description of methodology how to build a framework for models and the other is to further review additional methods that can enrich model functions finally the advantages disadvantages extended applications and perspectives of models are discussed it is expected that this review can provide a viewpoint from methodologies to understand bes models graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioelectrochemical system physiochemical principles mathematical methods model building data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction discharge of huge waste has become a serious issue for our society tahir et al 2021a xu et al 2021 yang et al 2021a more than 2 0 gt municipal wastes are released globally every year posing heavy burdens on the environmental protection and water treatment jiang et al 2019 bioelectrochemical systems bess is a promising technology that can degrade organic matter recover abundant chemical energy and produce bio energy from waste water exhibiting a great potential to alleviate above issues cheng et al 2021a lee et al 2021 rabaey and rozendal 2010 a typical bes commonly consists of an anode a cathode and an ion exchange membrane the electrodes are immersed in electrolyte and the membrane is used to separate the anodic and cathodic electrolyte fig 1 in a bes redox reaction occurs at the electrode surface on which a layer of biofilm electroactive microorganism acts as biocatalysts benefiting from the self regeneration ability of microorganisms and the good catalysis activity of enzymes in biofilm bess can be operated under mild conditions e g room temperature ambient pressure and neutral solution with a high conversion efficiency and a satisfactory longevity malvankar et al 2011 yang et al 2021a b generally bess can be operated in microbial fuel cells mfcs mode and microbial electrolysis cells mecs mode gadkari et al 2018 rabaey and rozendal 2010 yang et al 2021a in the mfc mode organic matters in wastewater are degraded to generate electricity through bioelectrochemical reactions bolognesi et al 2021 tahir et al 2021a tahir et al 2021b yang and chen 2020 while in the mec mode an external power source is input to recover the chemical energy in wastes and further generate bio products such as h2 ch4 acetate and other carbon based products geppert et al 2016 lin et al 2021 rabaey and rozendal 2010 notably it is widely accepted that the formation mechanism of carbon based products are quite different to that of h2 thus the bess for h2 production are usually called as mecs gadkari et al 2018 jadhav et al 2020 while those generating carbon based products are often called as microbial electrosynthesis systems mess cabau peinado et al 2021 roy et al 2021 sadhukhan et al 2016 various physical chemical biological phenomena occurs simultaneously in bess including 1 bacteria growth and decay in electrolyte fernandez et al 2016 moscoviz et al 2016 schievano et al 2016 2 biofilm formation and detachment on or from electrodes leininger et al 2020 picioreanu et al 2004 picioreanu et al 2010b 3 substrate and ion transfer in porous biofilms and in bulk solution cabau peinado et al 2021 hernández garcía et al 2020b kato marcus et al 2007 4 electron transfer in biofilms or between biofilms and electrodes li et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 xiao and yu 2020 5 bioelectrochemical mass conversion in biofilms yang et al 2021a yang et al 2021b yates et al 2021 and 6 equilibrium mass conversion in liquid phase guo et al 2021 picioreanu et al 2010b ruiz et al 2016 etc these complex processes resulted in a strongly non linear relationship among different state variables of the bes jadhav et al 2020 luo et al 2016 xia et al 2018a therefore it is quite difficult to exactly understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern the performance of bess solely through experimental methods casula et al 2021 long et al 2021 mardanpour et al 2019 vu et al 2020 compared with experiments theoretical models can provide a deeper insight into the investigation of the dominating factors that limit the overall performance of bess and reduce the measurement efforts of experiments gadkari et al 2020b hernández garcía et al 2020b ismail and habeeb 2017 mardanpour et al 2017 for example hernández garcía et al developed a model consisting of equations for charge transfer mass balance electrolyte flow and substrate consumption to analyze the current potential distribution on packed electrodes in a mec the authors identified that the flow conditions had a significant impact on the current potential distribution of packed electrodes and therefore influenced the overall current response of a mec gadkari et al 2020a nowadays many efforts have been devoted to the development of theoretical models deb et al 2020 jadhav et al 2020 recio garrido et al 2016b and many reviews have summarized the recent processes and advantages shortages of bes models gadkari et al 2018 luo et al 2016 ortiz martinez et al 2015 xia et al 2018a although previous reviews have exhibited comprehensive expositions for the functions and applications of models few have highlighted the physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in models which is of great significance to understand the internal logic for model establishment and to improve model accuracy in this review we aim to overview the physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in bes models we firstly classify the existing models into three categories according to their equation characteristics section 2 according above categories the physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in typical models are analyzed to outline a framework of model establishment and the functions that can enrich the analytical ability of models are also discussed section 3 meanwhile the development and advantages disadvantages of models are summarized in section 3 finally we conclude this review with a perspective particularly focusing on the simulation of biofilm formation section 4 2 classification of models before analyzing physiochemical principles and mathematical methods the existing models are classified into different categories according to models equation characteristics from this point existing models can be generally divided into bioelectrochemical models electronic models and machine learning models fig 2 more detail information is discussed below for bioelectrochemical models the key feature is that the governing equations can be considered as two components the one focuses on bioelectrochemical kinetics and the other is conservation behaviors such as mass charge energy balance gadkari et al 2019c ping et al 2016 sedaqatvand et al 2013 for electronic models a bes is considered as an integrated system consisting of classical electronic components e g resistances and capacitors lu et al 2015 park et al 2017 vu et al 2020 thus their governing equations are developed based on electronic principles such as kirchhoff circuit laws pathapati et al 2005 recio garrido et al 2016b differently machine learning models are developed based on statistical principles and intelligent algorithms aiming to screen the collected data analyze learning samples and output predictions cheng et al 2021b long et al 2021 luo et al 2016 in the machine learning model the in depth knowledge of bess and the governing equations describing the complex processes are no longer emphasized but the accuracies and efficiencies of data mining which are determined by statistical methods used in models are significantly highlighted 3 physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in models 3 1 bioelectrochemical models a bioelectrochemical model aims to elaborately describe the physical chemical and biological behaviors in a bes because electrode kinetics mass transfer charge transfer and reactor polarization are the most basic behaviors for a bes a bioelectrochemical model can be built through a two step approach 1 developing a framework according to the basic behaviors and 2 integrating additional equations that describe other phenomena such as biofilm growth liquid flow substrate competition etc into the framework to enrich model function mathematically for the equation set consisting of electrode kinetics mass transfer charge transfer and polarization there are only three independent variables i e current generation i substrate concentration c and overpotential η indicating that one of the four equations can be derived from the others for example both charge transfer and polarization can be used to describe the relationship between i and η indicating that one of the two equations can be derived by combining the other one with electrode kinetics and mass transfer equations therefore two strategies are feasible to build the framework of a bes model strategy i developing the framework based on kinetics mass transfer and charge transfer strategy ii developing the framework based on kinetics mass transfer and polarization fig 3 3 1 1 strategy i a framework based on kinetics mass and charge transfer for this strategy the framework mainly consists of the equations for electrode kinetics mass balance and charge balance fig 4 in a bes the electrode kinetics can be described by butler volmer equation bv eq 1 picioreanu et al 2007 2008 2010a 2010b which is a classical kinetics equation of electrochemical reactions el shafie et al 2020 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2018b however when bv is used in a bes the biological features e g bacterial activity biomass biofilm thickness etc will be epitomized by the exchange current density leading to an obscure illustration of biological processes to emphasize the biological factors nernst monod equation nm eq 2 casula et al 2021 su et al 2018 2019 tafel monod equation tm eq 3 gadkari et al 2019a oliveira et al 2013 zeng et al 2010 and butler volmer monod equation bvm eq 4 hamelers et al 2011 stein et al 2011 see more details in table 1 have been developed in the past decades ping et al 2014 pinto et al 2011 yao et al 2016 however there are still several empirical parameters e g half maximum rate constant in nm casula et al 2021 su et al 2018 and tm gadkari et al 2019a oliveira et al 2013 zeng et al 2010 product inhibition constant in bvm hamelers et al 2011 see details in table 1 to precisely illustrate electrode kinetics in bes models it is important to obtain the accurate values of the empirical parameters notably all the electrode kinetics equations are algebraic equations with particular focus on the quantitative relationship among i c and η a mass balance equation which bridges c and i can be illustrated as ordinary eq 7 or partial differential forms eq 5 and 6 commonly the mass balance in bulk solution can be expressed as an ordinary differential equation ode pinto et al 2011 shankar et al 2013 zhang and halme 1995 while it can be illustrated as a partial differential equation pde in diffusion layers and biofilms alavijeh et al 2015b sedaqatvand et al 2013 in bulk solution the ode describes the concentration variations of components over time ping et al 2014 pinto et al 2011 indicating that an initial condition is necessary to make the ode feasible in diffusion layers and biofilms the pde can describe the concentration changes of component in time and space at the same time therefore both initial conditions and boundary conditions are needed in biofilms the boundary conditions are the no flux boundary condition and the continuity of flux boundary condition table 2 and fig 4 which are used at the surface of electrodes and the interface of biofilm liquid respectively kato marcus et al 2007 ou et al 2016b in diffusion layers the boundary conditions are the continuity of flux boundary condition and the dirichlet boundary condition table 2 and fig 4 which are used at the biofilm liquid interface and diffusion bulk interface respectively alavijeh et al 2015a kato marcus et al 2007 similar to mass balance a charge balance equation that bridges i and η can also be expressed as an ode eq 9 or a pde eq 8 although odes can simplify calculations oliveira et al 2013 shankar et al 2013 zeng et al 2010 the detailed information such as local potential local substrate utilization and local current density cannot be analyzed therefore almost all of the present models are more likely to describe charge balance as pdes jadhav et al 2020 korth and harnisch 2019 sedaqatvand et al 2013 yang et al 2021b commonly the pde is expressed as the poisson s equation hernández garcía et al 2020a kato marcus et al 2007 with two types of boundary conditions i e the insulation boundary condition and the electric potential boundary condition table 2 and fig 4 the two conditions are used at the biofilm liquid interface and electrode surface respectively alavijeh et al 2015a yao et al 2016 the former implies that the gradient of electrode potential on the biofilm liquid interface is zero while the latter implies that the value of electrode surface potential electric potential should be determined which is relatively more complex in fig 4 three typical approaches are summarized to determine the electric potential according to different application scenarios of models approach i poising the electrode surface potential this approach is usually used in a half cell model or a full cell model with poised electrode potentials the use of approach ӏ can satisfy the electric potential boundary condition when the bes reactors are usually operated in the three electrode system mode indicating that the electrode surface potential used in models can be directly determined according to the experimental value correspondingly the developed model usually concerns the bioelectrochemical behaviors just occurring on a specific electrode alavijeh et al 2015a gadkari et al 2020b hernandez garcia et al 2020 ou et al 2016a ou et al 2016b approach ii estimating the electrode surface potential this approach is usually used in a full cell model with variable electrode potentials when approach ii is used the bes reactors are operated in the normal mode i e mfcs are operated by applying an external resistance mecs and mess are operated by inputting a voltage or current under these conditions the electrode surface potentials of bess varies with current but an average value can still be estimated alavijeh et al 2015a sedaqatvand et al 2013 the average value is used to satisfy the electric potential boundary condition and the detailed approaches to estimate the average value are discussed by alavijeh et al 2015a similar to approach i the models based on approach ii also tend to concern the bioelectrochemical behaviors occurring on a specific electrode alavijeh et al 2015a ou et al 2016b approach iii iterating the electrode surface potential when a bes is operated in the normal mode the electrode surface potentials can be precisely obtained based on bioelectrochemical behaviors occurring on both anode and cathode abel and clark 2021 casula et al 2021 gadkari et al 2020b sirinutsomboon 2014 yao et al 2016 firstly kinetics and charge balance of both anode and cathode should be simultaneously illustrated then the electrode potentials can be obtained via iteration based on two principles 1 the current of an anode equals to that of a cathode 2 the deviation of the cathode and anode potentials is a certain value for mfcs this value is the output voltage for mecs and mess it is the applied voltage model development based on approach i a half cell model based on approach i was developed by marcus et al aiming to study the limitations in anode biofilms such as the substrate concentration and local potential kato marcus et al 2007 in this model the bioanode was divided into four domains including electrode anode biofilm diffusion layer and bulk solution the authors formulated a framework as follows nm to illustrate the anode kinetics fick s law for mass balance and a second order pde to express charge balance in the biofilm for mass balance the no flux boundary condition and the continuity of flux boundary condition were used on the electrode surface and the biofilm liquid interface respectively for charge balance the insulation boundary condition was used on the biofilm liquid interface and a known electrode surface potential was used to satisfy the electric potential boundary condition based on this framework biofilm growth bacterial decay and endogenous microorganism respiration were further considered to enrich model function the above model acted as a template and more functions are achieved in the latter developed models for example jayasinghe et al modified the above model using a genome scale flux balance theory to improve the prediction accuracy for cellular physiology under different operation conditions jayasinghe et al 2014 except for bioanodes the above model was also utilized to develop the model for biocathodes to analyze synthesis processes of acetate kazemi et al 2015 cabau peinado et al improved the cathodic kinetics using thermodynamics method to link microbial metabolism to the electrochemical reaction and the simultaneous production of acetate n butyrate and n caproate through co2 reduction were illustrated cabau peinado et al 2021 except half cell models the template model has also been used to develop full cell models hernandez garcia et al 2020 hernández garcía et al 2020b ou et al 2016a for example flores estrella et al reported a mec that operated in a three electrode system in which the anode potential was kept at a known value flores estrella et al 2019 to build a full cell model the current obtained from the anode kinetics equation was directly set to be equal to the cathode current the production rate of cathode products h2 and ch4 was directly related to the current through faraday s law and the boundary conditions were similar to those in the half cell model these examples strongly identified the feasibility and reliability of approach i model development based on approach ii a typical model using approach ii was developed by alavijeh et al 2015a aiming to investigate the bioenergy production in mfcs fed with complex substrates such as glucose gluconic acid xylose arabinose cellulose protein and dairy wastewater to avoid the high computational resources occupation during simulation the authors used the strategy as reported by flores estrella et al 2019 illustrating the anode kinetics by nm anode charge balance by differential equations and anaerobic digestion in bulk solution by monod equations equaling the cathode current to anode current and using faraday s law to correlate the product yields with current in contrast mfcs reported by alavijeh et al were operated with external resistances indicating that the anode surface potential varied over time the estimated anode surface potential was used to satisfy the electric potential boundary condition and the simulated results were in good agreement with experimental data alavijeh et al 2015a after their previous attempts alavijeh et al further developed a generalized model which integrated mfcs and mecs into the same framework alavijeh et al 2015a and also developed a model for large scale mfcs alavijeh et al 2015b inspired by the above models ou et al constructed a full cell model focusing on the electrochemical behaviors of the air cathode and the substrate competition of the cathodic biofilm in mfcs ou et al 2016b from the above cases one can see that an appropriate potential value can also satisfy the electric potential boundary condition though approach ii cannot describe the precise variation of the electrode surface potential model development based on approach iii a typical model based on approach iii was developed by yao et al 2016 in their model the tm equation was used to describe the kinetics of anode and cathode the poisson equation was used to illustrate the charge balance on anode and cathode and fick s law was used to describe the mass transfer in solution based on this framework a 2d two phase mass transport model for a flat plate mfc was constructed by integrating two phase flow theory and mass transfer in porous materials into the framework equaling anode current to cathode current and setting power output ecell as the difference of anode potential and cathode potential the model was able to predict the concentration distributions of chemical components and power generation in their mfc based on the above template model several modified models have been developed for example by integrating biofilm porosity bacterial population and cathodic air diffusion into the above template an advanced model was constructed to analyze substrate distribution in anodic biofilms and o2 transfer in air cathodes of a mfc gadkari et al 2019a by considering spatial dimension a 3d model can be developed and used to predict the flow conditions and biofilm distribution in a mfc casula et al 2021 although approach iii can precisely calculate the electrode potential it should be noted that the computational amount of this approach is much larger than the other two approaches because solving a set of second order pdes is quite complex summary of strategy i in summary electrode kinetics mass balance and charge balance can formulate a framework for a bes model based on the framework biofilm growth kato marcus et al 2007 sedaqatvand et al 2013 zeng et al 2010 hydromechanics casula et al 2021 hernandez garcia et al 2020 hernández garcía et al 2020b substrate competition alavijeh et al 2015a ou et al 2016b shankar et al 2013 heat transfer abel and clark 2021 gadkari et al 2020b oliveira et al 2013 shankar et al 2013 bacterial populations alavijeh et al 2015a alavijeh et al 2015b multi dimension gadkari et al 2019a merkey and chopp 2012 yao et al 2016 and other additional functions can be further considered to extend the application of models notably the governing equations in the above framework are usually expressed as pdes indicating that the relevant models have a good ability to solve the spatial issues for the same reason the developed models commonly possess high mathematical complexity especially when multidimensional space is considered 3 1 2 strategy ii a framework based on kinetics mass balance and polarization electrode kinetics mass transfer and reactor polarization can also be combined to develop a model framework for a bes fig 5 in this framework the equation set mainly consists of the equations for electrode kinetics mass balance and cell polarization the electrode kinetics and mass balance are similar to those in strategy i while the polarization provides another view for the relationship between i and η compared to that of charge balance in strategy i the charge balance equation in strategy i is often developed based on the electrochemical behaviors of a specific component in bess such as electrodes and biofilms alavijeh et al 2015a flores estrella et al 2019 gadkari et al 2020b while polarization equation in strategy ii is usually obtained according to the electrochemical behaviors occurred at the whole cell scale luo et al 2017 mardanpour et al 2019 pinto et al 2011 the different standpoints of these two strategies lead to various logics and governing equation forms for model establishment for strategy i the pdes were mainly used to illustrate the micro scale behaviors and appropriate boundary conditions are very important to ensure the convergence of calculation in addition strategy i can be used to develop both half cell models and full cell models while for strategy ii the algebraic equations and odes were generally used to investigate the macro scale phenomena e g activation overpotentials concentration overpotentials and ohmic overpotentials and to provide a global consideration for bess thus strategy ii is usually applied to develop a full cell model notably there are also two types of frameworks based on strategy ii according to the different application scenarios of models framework i models with local kinetics in this framework the kinetic equation is used to illustrate local current densities and the polarization equation is described as the implicit function of the overall current in a bes oliveira et al 2013 pinto et al 2011 meanwhile the mass balance equation is expressed as an ode framework i in fig 5 notably an integral equation is necessary to bridge the local current density and the overall current of bess framework ii models with macroscopic kinetics similar to framework i the polarization equation is also combined with the kinetic equation to obtain an implicit function of the current differently the kinetic equation used in framework i mainly focuses on local current densities while the kinetics in framework ii focuses on the overall current of a bes due to the absence of local currents it is unnecessary to bridge kinetics and polarizations based on integral equations and thus significantly decreasing the computational complexities framework ii in fig 5 model development based on framework i a typical model based on framework i was proposed by picioreanu et al 2007 in this model the local current of the mfc anode was illustrated by bv and the mfc voltage was obtained according to the equilibrium cell potential and polarizations to bridge the kinetics and polarizations all possible local currents were integrated over the electrode surface based on the above framework microbial reaction stoichiometry microbial growth and ph variation were further involved to simulate time progresses of several mfc process variables based on the above study picioreanu et al 2008 further considered anaerobic digestion and coexistence of methanogenic and other electroactive bacteria in the liquid and biofilms the modified model promoted the understanding of electron transfer from biofilms to anodes via soluble redox mediators when methanogens and other electroactive microorganisms coexisted in mfcs katuri and scott 2011 developed a typical model to study the dynamic response of an mfc and provided a basis to understand the dynamic characteristic and activity of anode biofilm recently esfandyari et al further developed a framework to construct a model for a two chamber mfc in which the substrate was continuously fed and the inoculation was the pure culture of shewanella esfandyari et al 2017 picioreanu et al 2007 picioreanu et al 2008 picioreanu et al 2010a the results showed that the model could precisely predicate biofilm thickness current voltage output the concentrations of substrate dissolved co2 and the oxygen distribution in cathode chambers a widespread application of the framework i indicated that the proposed framework can effectively formulate construction of models providing a guidance for bes optimization model development based on framework ii a typical model based on framework ii was developed by pinto et al 2010a in their model the reactants and products in reactors were assumed to be well distributed and therefore the overall current was directly obtained by using the electrode kinetics at macro scale on the basis of framework the equilibrium cell potential and polarizations were further combined with the kinetics to obtain an implicit function of the current also the mass balances in anodic chamber and intracellular compartment were considered based on the above model pinto et al further analyzed the processes of wastewater treatment pinto et al 2010b constructed a multi population model for an mec pinto et al 2011 formulated an unified model for both mfc or mec according to application scenarios pinto et al 2011 and provided a guidance for optimizing bioenergy productivity of mecs pinto et al 2012 except for above applications framework ii has also been modified to construct improved models to investigate electrochemical and biological behaviors of some special bioreactors such as microfluidic mecs mardanpour and yaghmaei 2017 microfluidic mfcs kalantar et al 2018 mardanpour et al 2019 mardanpour et al 2017 and integrated photo bioelectrochemical systems luo et al 2017 for example mardanpour et al mardanpour and yaghmaei 2017 modified the typical model pinto et al 2010a to study the dynamic characteristics of a microfluidic mec in which bacteria distribution biofilm growth electron transfer reactor polarization and mass transfer were considered luo et al 2017 developed an integrated model to describe and predict the physical chemical and biological phenomena in an photo bioelectrochemical system which was constructed by combing a mfc with an algal bioreactor on the other hand framework ii has also been used for cathode model construction to analyze the electrochemical and biological behavior on biocathodes for instance gadkari et al 2019b constructed a mes model to investigate the physical chemical and biological behaviors in the cathode chamber due to the similarities among various bess the applications of framework ii have been further extended to other scenarios such as predicting wastewater treatment and water desalination in microbial desalination cells mdcs ping et al 2014 ping et al 2016 the modifications mentioned above strongly identified the feasibility of framework ii and significantly extended its application summary of strategy ii in summary electrode kinetics mass balance and polarization can be integrated to develop a model framework providing an overall viewpoint to understand the electrochemical phenomena in bess to improve the prediction accuracy of models and extend their applications parameter estimations recio garrido et al 2014 substrate competition capodaglio et al 2017 gadkari et al 2019c radeef and ismail 2019 reactor configurations li et al 2016 yao et al 2016 and other relevant factors can be further integrated into the developed framework notably despite the models based on strategy ii possess a low mathematical complexity and a high computational efficiency the analysis of spatial issues was difficult this is because that the governing equations of these models mainly consist of odes which only concerns the time dependent issues therefore when both of computational efficiency and spatial problems are considered some pdes can also be added into the framework to develop an integrated model mardanpour and yaghmaei 2017 mardanpour et al 2017 3 2 electronic models electronic models in which a bes was consider as an electrical equipment consisting of various classical electronic components mainly focus on the behaviors of electron flow and electric charge storage park et al 2017 recio garrido et al 2016a sindhuja et al 2016 in these models kirchhoff s law ohm s law and charging discharging of capacitors are used develop a model framework meanwhile an equivalent circuit was formulated to describe the electronic processes in a bes fig 6 carreon bautista et al 2015 coronado et al 2015 generally an equivalent circuit consists of power sources vbes ohmic resistors rohm polarization resistors rp and capacitors ce in the circuit vbes represents the power output of a mfc or power supply of a mec mes rohm represents the overall resistances of electrolyte current collector wires ion exchange membranes and biofilms lu et al 2015 rp represents the resistive component accounting for both the activation and concentration losses he and mansfeld 2009 xia et al 2018a and ce represents the actual bes capacitances in some cases capacitors of bess are further divided into double layer capacitors cdl and constant phase elements cpe cdl is mainly used to describe the delay of electron discharge charge in cdl which are formed at the electrode electrolyte interface park et al 2017 cpe represents the capacitances which are mainly caused by electrode roughness coating and distribution of reaction rate fradler et al 2014 he and mansfeld 2009 except for capacitors charge transfer resistors rct and warburg elements w can also be integrated into the equivalent circuit to describe the resistance of charge transfer and diffusion respectively cooper and smith 2006 ha et al 2010 he and mansfeld 2009 xia et al 2018a model development a typical electronic model was developed by ha et al to determine the rct and cdl of a mfc ha et al 2010 an equivalent circuit was developed by connecting cdl and rct in parallel and then connecting a rohm and vbes in series based on this circuit both of the charge transfer processes and the dynamic behaviors of the mfc could be described by the formulated model these results indicated that formulating an appropriate equivalent circuit is the basic step for the construction of an electronic model sindhuja et al 2016 formulated a lumped equivalent circuit by using vbes rext external resistance and rin internal resistance aiming to reveal the effect of internal resistances on the mfc performance to analyze the distribution of internal resistances the authors divided the internal resistance into ohmic resistances activation resistances and concentration resistances which were corresponded to ohmic losses activation losses and concentration losses respectively as expected the formulated model showed a good ability to analyze the potential losses caused by different electrode materials it is should be noted that the corresponding equivalent circuit was equivalent to that of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis which has been widely used to analyze electrochemical behaviors in bess when power sources are not integrated into an electronic model cooper and smith 2006 kashyap et al 2014 ter heijne et al 2011 yin et al 2013 for example vu et al 2020 used rohm rct cdl and w to formulate the randles circuit and aimed to investigate the influence of magnetite nanoparticles on current generation and methane production of a mes tahir et al 2021a used a combination of rohm rct cdl and w to form a modified randles circuit to study charge transport and electrode electrolyte interfacial phenomenon occurred on the nickel ferrite mxene coated anode in mfcs similar to the formulation of electronic model the equivalent circuit of eis should also be modified according to their applications for example khan et al 2020 used rs rct and cpe to analyze the nyquist plot of an anoxic mfc and used rs rct cpe and w to analyze the impedance of an oxic mfc because these two mfcs showed distinguished diffusion behaviors recently combination of the bess with power management systems and other electrical controls has been proposed sanchez et al 2020 shahparasti et al 2020 yang et al 2012 and thus the equivalent circuits are further extended to investigate the electrical behaviors of the combined system carreon bautista et al 2015 coronado et al 2013 2015 erbay et al 2014 for example pulse width modulated electrical loads have been combined with a mfc to achieve the on line monitoring for electrochemical outputs to estimate the open circuit voltages the internal resistances and capacitances of a mfc the equivalent circuit of the mfc was combined with a pulse width modulated external resistor to develop an on line procedure coronado et al 2013 2015 considering the low power outputs of an mfc power management systems pms are also merged with mfcs to achieve a more readily usable voltage outputs in this application the pms can deliver low fluctuating voltages generated by mfcs to a super capacitor by which the electronic devices can be powered carreon bautista et al 2015 to describe the combined system the equivalent circuit of the mfc was combined with maximum power point tracking and boost converter circuits erbay et al 2014 shahparasti et al 2020 integrated a mes stack into an electrical grid attempting to convert surplus energy into biofuels to analyze the static and dynamic non linear behaviors of mes stack under different operation conditions the classical equivalent circuit of mess was combined with diodes to form a new model which can be used to explain the internal reactions of the mes stack accurately summary of electronic models in summary electronic models are developed based on the equivalent circuits of bess and particularly focus on the influence of impedances on the voltage current of a bes in an electronic model the equation set consists of several algebraic or ordinary differential equations it implies that only several initial conditions are required to realize the calculations thus the computational cost of an electronic model is quite low on the other hand because the core equation of electronic models is kirchhoff s equation which has been widely used in electric engineering this model has apparent advantages in analyzing the variation of bes voltages currents when a bes is integrated into a complex electric circuit although the specific processes such as redox reactions mass charge transfer and biofilm formation were not considered in electronic models the formulation of the equivalent circuit is still based on the physiochemical behaviors in a bes thus a deep understanding for the bioelectrochemical principles of a bes is still necessary 3 3 machine learning models with the rapid development of intelligent algorithm in the past years the technologies namely machine learning models that concern the underling interactions between inputs and outputs have been developed to simulate and predict the electrochemical behaviors in bess especially in the lack of effective parameters of complex mechanisms lesnik and liu 2017 luo et al 2016 these models are constructed based on data mining methods without an analytical form fig 7 illustrates the normal processes of simulations using a machine learning model generally data are first collected from experiments or simulated results of other models de clercq et al 2019 fang et al 2013 ghasemi et al 2021 then the collected data are screened to obtain training samples based on these samples intelligent algorithms are trained to learn and mine the underling interactions of data and hence to predict outputs model development fig 7 indicates that the collection of plentiful training samples with good structure and high quality is the basic step to develop a machine learning model in practice a bes usually shows slow dynamics characteristics suggesting that it would take a long time to acquire enough training samples in this case the design of experiments methods doe can be used to deal with the collected data and generate a large number of derived data to satisfy the requirement of training samples fang et al 2013 luo et al 2016 xia et al 2018a he and ma 2016 for example fang et al 2013 performed uniform design ud to reduce the number of the experimental trails in which a large number of factors act as variables he et al y j he and z f ma 2016 used hammersley sequence sampling hss to ensure the representative of the training samples generated from collected data and reduced the computational cost of data screening when the above generated data were inputted into the corresponding intelligent algorithm the results showed a good accuracy compared to experimental data except for ud and hss factorial design fd monte carlo design mc he and ma 2016 central composite design ccd sedighi et al 2018 box behnken design bbd islam et al 2018 placket burman design pbd al shehri et al 2013 zhang and angelidaki 2011 and other doe have also been reported in recent years in a word these approaches aim to formulate a pre treatment process by which the representative data can be obtained to train the intelligent algorithm the intelligent algorithms as the core component of the machine learning model were usually constructed based on linear methods such as linear regression lr in early stage of development this machine learning models had a good interpretability and simple model structures luo et al 2016 in recent years data mining methods are used for the algorithm fig 7 despite the analytical form was not involved the algorithm indeed significantly improved the prediction accuracy of machine learning models cai et al 2019 garg et al 2014 kalogirou 2001 luo et al 2016 for example ramón fernández et al 2019 used fuzzy logic approach to simulate the power output of mfcs fed with human urine by using this algorithm an inference system was constructed based on the vague information and the uncertainty of something being either completely true or completely false the proposed inference system was used to replicate the human reasoning procedures and statistically predict the results ghasemi et al 2021 kalogirou 2001 tsompanas et al 2017 used cellular non linear network cnn to construct a uniform regular array of locally connected continuous state nodes attempting to realize the simultaneous updating of data states in discrete time and the prediction of biochemical and electrochemical phenomena in mfcs as a algorithms that generally uses a number of connected neurons to achieve complex learning and generalization in a nonlinear and parallel manner kalogirou 2001 luo et al 2016 tsompanas et al 2019 artificial neural network ann was also used to simulate power generation of mfcs tsompanas et al 2019 biogas production of mecs quashie et al 2021 and biofilm communities of bioanodes lesnik and liu 2017 except for the typical algorithms mentioned above many other algorithms have also been widely used in bess such as relevance vector machine rvm fang et al 2013 gaussian process regression gpr sun et al 2017 he and ma 2016 bayesian network cheng et al 2021b random forest rf long et al 2021 support vector machines svm cai et al 2019 long et al 2021 logistic regression multiclass glmnet cai et al 2019 wang et al 2020 scalable tree boosting system xgboost cai et al 2019 k nearest neighbor knn cai et al 2019 de clercq et al 2019 and multi gene genetic programming mggp garg et al 2014 it should be noted that the types of algorithms and prediction accuracy of models are depended on the structure and quality of the training samples despite that the most important step for developing a machine learning model is to obtain a good algorithm to analyze the input samples y j he and z f ma 2016 this indicates that the integration of doe and intelligent algorithms should be also considered during the model construction summary of machine learning model in summary the most important component of a machine learning model is the intelligent algorithm which is an imitated technology based on studies of human brain and nervous system these algorithms are designed to analyze the statistical relationship between inputs and outputs while the fundamental physiochemical principles are not highlighted because statistics requires large datasets large training samples with good data structure and quality are required to improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning models this indicates that the collection of large datasets from experiments or doe is the most basic step for this model 4 conclusion and prospects theoretical simulation has been regarded as a useful approach to reveal the scientific principles behind the experimental phenomena in bess to promote the understanding of this approach this review analyzes the physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in theoretical models from the viewpoint of methodologies we first classify the present models into bioelectrochemical models electronic models and machine learning models and the characteristics physiochemical principles mathematical methods and model frameworks of each category are summarized and discussed generally bioelectrochemical models are developed based on the physiochemical processes in bess and electrode kinetics and conservation principles are critical to establish the model electronic models are developed based on an electronic viewpoint and kirchhoff s law is the most important principle differently machine learning models are developed based on the intelligent algorithms which are determined by statistics nowadays most of mass and charge transfer in a bes can solved since the nernst planck equation darcy s law naiver stokes equation and ohm s law can be used to describe these processes casula et al 2021 hernández garcía et al 2020b sirinutsomboon 2014 yao et al 2016 however biofilm formation on electrodes is still a hard to solved issue the major reason is that there is limited scientific understanding for the biofilm formation processes including bacterial growth in solution bacterial adhesion to electrodes and biofilm growth on electrode surfaces borole et al 2011 rabaey and rozendal 2010 santoro et al 2017 although the fundamental principles of biofilm formation remain obscure it is widely accepted that the performance of bess is significantly affected by the biofilm including biofilm structure porosity thickness and conductivity and even biofilm kinetics substrate consumption rate and biofilm activity borole et al 2011 lesnik and liu 2017 ou et al 2016b therefore a deep understanding for biofilm structure and kinetics may be the further research emphasis for bes models either developing novel experimental approaches or theoretical models in the future one possible way to achieve above goal is the combination of machine learning models with visual approaches or electrochemical approaches such as eis and cyclic voltammetry one can first use visual approaches to obtain large datasets which illustrate the relationships between operation parameters and the structure kinetics parameters of biofilms and then use machine learning models to deal with these datasets to give predictions for the critical parameters of biofilm such as porosity thickness conductivity similarly machine learning models can also be combined with electrochemical approaches to predict resistances and capacitances of bess after the collection the important parameters can be integrated into relevant models to describe the transport and reaction processes from physiochemical viewpoints or provide a deeper understanding of bess from electronic viewpoints credit authorship contribution statement zhuo li conceptualization

15329,bioelectrochemical systems bess are promising devices for wastewater treatment and bio energy production since various processes are interacted and affect the overall performance of the device the development of theoretical modeling is an efficient approach to understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern the performance of the bes this review aims to summarize the physiochemical principle and mathematical method in bes models which is of great importance for the establishment of an accurate model while has received little attention in previous reviews in this review we begin with a classification of existing models including bioelectrochemical models electronic models and machine learning models subsequently physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in models are discussed from two aspects one is the description of methodology how to build a framework for models and the other is to further review additional methods that can enrich model functions finally the advantages disadvantages extended applications and perspectives of models are discussed it is expected that this review can provide a viewpoint from methodologies to understand bes models graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioelectrochemical system physiochemical principles mathematical methods model building data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction discharge of huge waste has become a serious issue for our society tahir et al 2021a xu et al 2021 yang et al 2021a more than 2 0 gt municipal wastes are released globally every year posing heavy burdens on the environmental protection and water treatment jiang et al 2019 bioelectrochemical systems bess is a promising technology that can degrade organic matter recover abundant chemical energy and produce bio energy from waste water exhibiting a great potential to alleviate above issues cheng et al 2021a lee et al 2021 rabaey and rozendal 2010 a typical bes commonly consists of an anode a cathode and an ion exchange membrane the electrodes are immersed in electrolyte and the membrane is used to separate the anodic and cathodic electrolyte fig 1 in a bes redox reaction occurs at the electrode surface on which a layer of biofilm electroactive microorganism acts as biocatalysts benefiting from the self regeneration ability of microorganisms and the good catalysis activity of enzymes in biofilm bess can be operated under mild conditions e g room temperature ambient pressure and neutral solution with a high conversion efficiency and a satisfactory longevity malvankar et al 2011 yang et al 2021a b generally bess can be operated in microbial fuel cells mfcs mode and microbial electrolysis cells mecs mode gadkari et al 2018 rabaey and rozendal 2010 yang et al 2021a in the mfc mode organic matters in wastewater are degraded to generate electricity through bioelectrochemical reactions bolognesi et al 2021 tahir et al 2021a tahir et al 2021b yang and chen 2020 while in the mec mode an external power source is input to recover the chemical energy in wastes and further generate bio products such as h2 ch4 acetate and other carbon based products geppert et al 2016 lin et al 2021 rabaey and rozendal 2010 notably it is widely accepted that the formation mechanism of carbon based products are quite different to that of h2 thus the bess for h2 production are usually called as mecs gadkari et al 2018 jadhav et al 2020 while those generating carbon based products are often called as microbial electrosynthesis systems mess cabau peinado et al 2021 roy et al 2021 sadhukhan et al 2016 various physical chemical biological phenomena occurs simultaneously in bess including 1 bacteria growth and decay in electrolyte fernandez et al 2016 moscoviz et al 2016 schievano et al 2016 2 biofilm formation and detachment on or from electrodes leininger et al 2020 picioreanu et al 2004 picioreanu et al 2010b 3 substrate and ion transfer in porous biofilms and in bulk solution cabau peinado et al 2021 hernández garcía et al 2020b kato marcus et al 2007 4 electron transfer in biofilms or between biofilms and electrodes li et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 xiao and yu 2020 5 bioelectrochemical mass conversion in biofilms yang et al 2021a yang et al 2021b yates et al 2021 and 6 equilibrium mass conversion in liquid phase guo et al 2021 picioreanu et al 2010b ruiz et al 2016 etc these complex processes resulted in a strongly non linear relationship among different state variables of the bes jadhav et al 2020 luo et al 2016 xia et al 2018a therefore it is quite difficult to exactly understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern the performance of bess solely through experimental methods casula et al 2021 long et al 2021 mardanpour et al 2019 vu et al 2020 compared with experiments theoretical models can provide a deeper insight into the investigation of the dominating factors that limit the overall performance of bess and reduce the measurement efforts of experiments gadkari et al 2020b hernández garcía et al 2020b ismail and habeeb 2017 mardanpour et al 2017 for example hernández garcía et al developed a model consisting of equations for charge transfer mass balance electrolyte flow and substrate consumption to analyze the current potential distribution on packed electrodes in a mec the authors identified that the flow conditions had a significant impact on the current potential distribution of packed electrodes and therefore influenced the overall current response of a mec gadkari et al 2020a nowadays many efforts have been devoted to the development of theoretical models deb et al 2020 jadhav et al 2020 recio garrido et al 2016b and many reviews have summarized the recent processes and advantages shortages of bes models gadkari et al 2018 luo et al 2016 ortiz martinez et al 2015 xia et al 2018a although previous reviews have exhibited comprehensive expositions for the functions and applications of models few have highlighted the physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in models which is of great significance to understand the internal logic for model establishment and to improve model accuracy in this review we aim to overview the physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in bes models we firstly classify the existing models into three categories according to their equation characteristics section 2 according above categories the physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in typical models are analyzed to outline a framework of model establishment and the functions that can enrich the analytical ability of models are also discussed section 3 meanwhile the development and advantages disadvantages of models are summarized in section 3 finally we conclude this review with a perspective particularly focusing on the simulation of biofilm formation section 4 2 classification of models before analyzing physiochemical principles and mathematical methods the existing models are classified into different categories according to models equation characteristics from this point existing models can be generally divided into bioelectrochemical models electronic models and machine learning models fig 2 more detail information is discussed below for bioelectrochemical models the key feature is that the governing equations can be considered as two components the one focuses on bioelectrochemical kinetics and the other is conservation behaviors such as mass charge energy balance gadkari et al 2019c ping et al 2016 sedaqatvand et al 2013 for electronic models a bes is considered as an integrated system consisting of classical electronic components e g resistances and capacitors lu et al 2015 park et al 2017 vu et al 2020 thus their governing equations are developed based on electronic principles such as kirchhoff circuit laws pathapati et al 2005 recio garrido et al 2016b differently machine learning models are developed based on statistical principles and intelligent algorithms aiming to screen the collected data analyze learning samples and output predictions cheng et al 2021b long et al 2021 luo et al 2016 in the machine learning model the in depth knowledge of bess and the governing equations describing the complex processes are no longer emphasized but the accuracies and efficiencies of data mining which are determined by statistical methods used in models are significantly highlighted 3 physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in models 3 1 bioelectrochemical models a bioelectrochemical model aims to elaborately describe the physical chemical and biological behaviors in a bes because electrode kinetics mass transfer charge transfer and reactor polarization are the most basic behaviors for a bes a bioelectrochemical model can be built through a two step approach 1 developing a framework according to the basic behaviors and 2 integrating additional equations that describe other phenomena such as biofilm growth liquid flow substrate competition etc into the framework to enrich model function mathematically for the equation set consisting of electrode kinetics mass transfer charge transfer and polarization there are only three independent variables i e current generation i substrate concentration c and overpotential η indicating that one of the four equations can be derived from the others for example both charge transfer and polarization can be used to describe the relationship between i and η indicating that one of the two equations can be derived by combining the other one with electrode kinetics and mass transfer equations therefore two strategies are feasible to build the framework of a bes model strategy i developing the framework based on kinetics mass transfer and charge transfer strategy ii developing the framework based on kinetics mass transfer and polarization fig 3 3 1 1 strategy i a framework based on kinetics mass and charge transfer for this strategy the framework mainly consists of the equations for electrode kinetics mass balance and charge balance fig 4 in a bes the electrode kinetics can be described by butler volmer equation bv eq 1 picioreanu et al 2007 2008 2010a 2010b which is a classical kinetics equation of electrochemical reactions el shafie et al 2020 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2018b however when bv is used in a bes the biological features e g bacterial activity biomass biofilm thickness etc will be epitomized by the exchange current density leading to an obscure illustration of biological processes to emphasize the biological factors nernst monod equation nm eq 2 casula et al 2021 su et al 2018 2019 tafel monod equation tm eq 3 gadkari et al 2019a oliveira et al 2013 zeng et al 2010 and butler volmer monod equation bvm eq 4 hamelers et al 2011 stein et al 2011 see more details in table 1 have been developed in the past decades ping et al 2014 pinto et al 2011 yao et al 2016 however there are still several empirical parameters e g half maximum rate constant in nm casula et al 2021 su et al 2018 and tm gadkari et al 2019a oliveira et al 2013 zeng et al 2010 product inhibition constant in bvm hamelers et al 2011 see details in table 1 to precisely illustrate electrode kinetics in bes models it is important to obtain the accurate values of the empirical parameters notably all the electrode kinetics equations are algebraic equations with particular focus on the quantitative relationship among i c and η a mass balance equation which bridges c and i can be illustrated as ordinary eq 7 or partial differential forms eq 5 and 6 commonly the mass balance in bulk solution can be expressed as an ordinary differential equation ode pinto et al 2011 shankar et al 2013 zhang and halme 1995 while it can be illustrated as a partial differential equation pde in diffusion layers and biofilms alavijeh et al 2015b sedaqatvand et al 2013 in bulk solution the ode describes the concentration variations of components over time ping et al 2014 pinto et al 2011 indicating that an initial condition is necessary to make the ode feasible in diffusion layers and biofilms the pde can describe the concentration changes of component in time and space at the same time therefore both initial conditions and boundary conditions are needed in biofilms the boundary conditions are the no flux boundary condition and the continuity of flux boundary condition table 2 and fig 4 which are used at the surface of electrodes and the interface of biofilm liquid respectively kato marcus et al 2007 ou et al 2016b in diffusion layers the boundary conditions are the continuity of flux boundary condition and the dirichlet boundary condition table 2 and fig 4 which are used at the biofilm liquid interface and diffusion bulk interface respectively alavijeh et al 2015a kato marcus et al 2007 similar to mass balance a charge balance equation that bridges i and η can also be expressed as an ode eq 9 or a pde eq 8 although odes can simplify calculations oliveira et al 2013 shankar et al 2013 zeng et al 2010 the detailed information such as local potential local substrate utilization and local current density cannot be analyzed therefore almost all of the present models are more likely to describe charge balance as pdes jadhav et al 2020 korth and harnisch 2019 sedaqatvand et al 2013 yang et al 2021b commonly the pde is expressed as the poisson s equation hernández garcía et al 2020a kato marcus et al 2007 with two types of boundary conditions i e the insulation boundary condition and the electric potential boundary condition table 2 and fig 4 the two conditions are used at the biofilm liquid interface and electrode surface respectively alavijeh et al 2015a yao et al 2016 the former implies that the gradient of electrode potential on the biofilm liquid interface is zero while the latter implies that the value of electrode surface potential electric potential should be determined which is relatively more complex in fig 4 three typical approaches are summarized to determine the electric potential according to different application scenarios of models approach i poising the electrode surface potential this approach is usually used in a half cell model or a full cell model with poised electrode potentials the use of approach ӏ can satisfy the electric potential boundary condition when the bes reactors are usually operated in the three electrode system mode indicating that the electrode surface potential used in models can be directly determined according to the experimental value correspondingly the developed model usually concerns the bioelectrochemical behaviors just occurring on a specific electrode alavijeh et al 2015a gadkari et al 2020b hernandez garcia et al 2020 ou et al 2016a ou et al 2016b approach ii estimating the electrode surface potential this approach is usually used in a full cell model with variable electrode potentials when approach ii is used the bes reactors are operated in the normal mode i e mfcs are operated by applying an external resistance mecs and mess are operated by inputting a voltage or current under these conditions the electrode surface potentials of bess varies with current but an average value can still be estimated alavijeh et al 2015a sedaqatvand et al 2013 the average value is used to satisfy the electric potential boundary condition and the detailed approaches to estimate the average value are discussed by alavijeh et al 2015a similar to approach i the models based on approach ii also tend to concern the bioelectrochemical behaviors occurring on a specific electrode alavijeh et al 2015a ou et al 2016b approach iii iterating the electrode surface potential when a bes is operated in the normal mode the electrode surface potentials can be precisely obtained based on bioelectrochemical behaviors occurring on both anode and cathode abel and clark 2021 casula et al 2021 gadkari et al 2020b sirinutsomboon 2014 yao et al 2016 firstly kinetics and charge balance of both anode and cathode should be simultaneously illustrated then the electrode potentials can be obtained via iteration based on two principles 1 the current of an anode equals to that of a cathode 2 the deviation of the cathode and anode potentials is a certain value for mfcs this value is the output voltage for mecs and mess it is the applied voltage model development based on approach i a half cell model based on approach i was developed by marcus et al aiming to study the limitations in anode biofilms such as the substrate concentration and local potential kato marcus et al 2007 in this model the bioanode was divided into four domains including electrode anode biofilm diffusion layer and bulk solution the authors formulated a framework as follows nm to illustrate the anode kinetics fick s law for mass balance and a second order pde to express charge balance in the biofilm for mass balance the no flux boundary condition and the continuity of flux boundary condition were used on the electrode surface and the biofilm liquid interface respectively for charge balance the insulation boundary condition was used on the biofilm liquid interface and a known electrode surface potential was used to satisfy the electric potential boundary condition based on this framework biofilm growth bacterial decay and endogenous microorganism respiration were further considered to enrich model function the above model acted as a template and more functions are achieved in the latter developed models for example jayasinghe et al modified the above model using a genome scale flux balance theory to improve the prediction accuracy for cellular physiology under different operation conditions jayasinghe et al 2014 except for bioanodes the above model was also utilized to develop the model for biocathodes to analyze synthesis processes of acetate kazemi et al 2015 cabau peinado et al improved the cathodic kinetics using thermodynamics method to link microbial metabolism to the electrochemical reaction and the simultaneous production of acetate n butyrate and n caproate through co2 reduction were illustrated cabau peinado et al 2021 except half cell models the template model has also been used to develop full cell models hernandez garcia et al 2020 hernández garcía et al 2020b ou et al 2016a for example flores estrella et al reported a mec that operated in a three electrode system in which the anode potential was kept at a known value flores estrella et al 2019 to build a full cell model the current obtained from the anode kinetics equation was directly set to be equal to the cathode current the production rate of cathode products h2 and ch4 was directly related to the current through faraday s law and the boundary conditions were similar to those in the half cell model these examples strongly identified the feasibility and reliability of approach i model development based on approach ii a typical model using approach ii was developed by alavijeh et al 2015a aiming to investigate the bioenergy production in mfcs fed with complex substrates such as glucose gluconic acid xylose arabinose cellulose protein and dairy wastewater to avoid the high computational resources occupation during simulation the authors used the strategy as reported by flores estrella et al 2019 illustrating the anode kinetics by nm anode charge balance by differential equations and anaerobic digestion in bulk solution by monod equations equaling the cathode current to anode current and using faraday s law to correlate the product yields with current in contrast mfcs reported by alavijeh et al were operated with external resistances indicating that the anode surface potential varied over time the estimated anode surface potential was used to satisfy the electric potential boundary condition and the simulated results were in good agreement with experimental data alavijeh et al 2015a after their previous attempts alavijeh et al further developed a generalized model which integrated mfcs and mecs into the same framework alavijeh et al 2015a and also developed a model for large scale mfcs alavijeh et al 2015b inspired by the above models ou et al constructed a full cell model focusing on the electrochemical behaviors of the air cathode and the substrate competition of the cathodic biofilm in mfcs ou et al 2016b from the above cases one can see that an appropriate potential value can also satisfy the electric potential boundary condition though approach ii cannot describe the precise variation of the electrode surface potential model development based on approach iii a typical model based on approach iii was developed by yao et al 2016 in their model the tm equation was used to describe the kinetics of anode and cathode the poisson equation was used to illustrate the charge balance on anode and cathode and fick s law was used to describe the mass transfer in solution based on this framework a 2d two phase mass transport model for a flat plate mfc was constructed by integrating two phase flow theory and mass transfer in porous materials into the framework equaling anode current to cathode current and setting power output ecell as the difference of anode potential and cathode potential the model was able to predict the concentration distributions of chemical components and power generation in their mfc based on the above template model several modified models have been developed for example by integrating biofilm porosity bacterial population and cathodic air diffusion into the above template an advanced model was constructed to analyze substrate distribution in anodic biofilms and o2 transfer in air cathodes of a mfc gadkari et al 2019a by considering spatial dimension a 3d model can be developed and used to predict the flow conditions and biofilm distribution in a mfc casula et al 2021 although approach iii can precisely calculate the electrode potential it should be noted that the computational amount of this approach is much larger than the other two approaches because solving a set of second order pdes is quite complex summary of strategy i in summary electrode kinetics mass balance and charge balance can formulate a framework for a bes model based on the framework biofilm growth kato marcus et al 2007 sedaqatvand et al 2013 zeng et al 2010 hydromechanics casula et al 2021 hernandez garcia et al 2020 hernández garcía et al 2020b substrate competition alavijeh et al 2015a ou et al 2016b shankar et al 2013 heat transfer abel and clark 2021 gadkari et al 2020b oliveira et al 2013 shankar et al 2013 bacterial populations alavijeh et al 2015a alavijeh et al 2015b multi dimension gadkari et al 2019a merkey and chopp 2012 yao et al 2016 and other additional functions can be further considered to extend the application of models notably the governing equations in the above framework are usually expressed as pdes indicating that the relevant models have a good ability to solve the spatial issues for the same reason the developed models commonly possess high mathematical complexity especially when multidimensional space is considered 3 1 2 strategy ii a framework based on kinetics mass balance and polarization electrode kinetics mass transfer and reactor polarization can also be combined to develop a model framework for a bes fig 5 in this framework the equation set mainly consists of the equations for electrode kinetics mass balance and cell polarization the electrode kinetics and mass balance are similar to those in strategy i while the polarization provides another view for the relationship between i and η compared to that of charge balance in strategy i the charge balance equation in strategy i is often developed based on the electrochemical behaviors of a specific component in bess such as electrodes and biofilms alavijeh et al 2015a flores estrella et al 2019 gadkari et al 2020b while polarization equation in strategy ii is usually obtained according to the electrochemical behaviors occurred at the whole cell scale luo et al 2017 mardanpour et al 2019 pinto et al 2011 the different standpoints of these two strategies lead to various logics and governing equation forms for model establishment for strategy i the pdes were mainly used to illustrate the micro scale behaviors and appropriate boundary conditions are very important to ensure the convergence of calculation in addition strategy i can be used to develop both half cell models and full cell models while for strategy ii the algebraic equations and odes were generally used to investigate the macro scale phenomena e g activation overpotentials concentration overpotentials and ohmic overpotentials and to provide a global consideration for bess thus strategy ii is usually applied to develop a full cell model notably there are also two types of frameworks based on strategy ii according to the different application scenarios of models framework i models with local kinetics in this framework the kinetic equation is used to illustrate local current densities and the polarization equation is described as the implicit function of the overall current in a bes oliveira et al 2013 pinto et al 2011 meanwhile the mass balance equation is expressed as an ode framework i in fig 5 notably an integral equation is necessary to bridge the local current density and the overall current of bess framework ii models with macroscopic kinetics similar to framework i the polarization equation is also combined with the kinetic equation to obtain an implicit function of the current differently the kinetic equation used in framework i mainly focuses on local current densities while the kinetics in framework ii focuses on the overall current of a bes due to the absence of local currents it is unnecessary to bridge kinetics and polarizations based on integral equations and thus significantly decreasing the computational complexities framework ii in fig 5 model development based on framework i a typical model based on framework i was proposed by picioreanu et al 2007 in this model the local current of the mfc anode was illustrated by bv and the mfc voltage was obtained according to the equilibrium cell potential and polarizations to bridge the kinetics and polarizations all possible local currents were integrated over the electrode surface based on the above framework microbial reaction stoichiometry microbial growth and ph variation were further involved to simulate time progresses of several mfc process variables based on the above study picioreanu et al 2008 further considered anaerobic digestion and coexistence of methanogenic and other electroactive bacteria in the liquid and biofilms the modified model promoted the understanding of electron transfer from biofilms to anodes via soluble redox mediators when methanogens and other electroactive microorganisms coexisted in mfcs katuri and scott 2011 developed a typical model to study the dynamic response of an mfc and provided a basis to understand the dynamic characteristic and activity of anode biofilm recently esfandyari et al further developed a framework to construct a model for a two chamber mfc in which the substrate was continuously fed and the inoculation was the pure culture of shewanella esfandyari et al 2017 picioreanu et al 2007 picioreanu et al 2008 picioreanu et al 2010a the results showed that the model could precisely predicate biofilm thickness current voltage output the concentrations of substrate dissolved co2 and the oxygen distribution in cathode chambers a widespread application of the framework i indicated that the proposed framework can effectively formulate construction of models providing a guidance for bes optimization model development based on framework ii a typical model based on framework ii was developed by pinto et al 2010a in their model the reactants and products in reactors were assumed to be well distributed and therefore the overall current was directly obtained by using the electrode kinetics at macro scale on the basis of framework the equilibrium cell potential and polarizations were further combined with the kinetics to obtain an implicit function of the current also the mass balances in anodic chamber and intracellular compartment were considered based on the above model pinto et al further analyzed the processes of wastewater treatment pinto et al 2010b constructed a multi population model for an mec pinto et al 2011 formulated an unified model for both mfc or mec according to application scenarios pinto et al 2011 and provided a guidance for optimizing bioenergy productivity of mecs pinto et al 2012 except for above applications framework ii has also been modified to construct improved models to investigate electrochemical and biological behaviors of some special bioreactors such as microfluidic mecs mardanpour and yaghmaei 2017 microfluidic mfcs kalantar et al 2018 mardanpour et al 2019 mardanpour et al 2017 and integrated photo bioelectrochemical systems luo et al 2017 for example mardanpour et al mardanpour and yaghmaei 2017 modified the typical model pinto et al 2010a to study the dynamic characteristics of a microfluidic mec in which bacteria distribution biofilm growth electron transfer reactor polarization and mass transfer were considered luo et al 2017 developed an integrated model to describe and predict the physical chemical and biological phenomena in an photo bioelectrochemical system which was constructed by combing a mfc with an algal bioreactor on the other hand framework ii has also been used for cathode model construction to analyze the electrochemical and biological behavior on biocathodes for instance gadkari et al 2019b constructed a mes model to investigate the physical chemical and biological behaviors in the cathode chamber due to the similarities among various bess the applications of framework ii have been further extended to other scenarios such as predicting wastewater treatment and water desalination in microbial desalination cells mdcs ping et al 2014 ping et al 2016 the modifications mentioned above strongly identified the feasibility of framework ii and significantly extended its application summary of strategy ii in summary electrode kinetics mass balance and polarization can be integrated to develop a model framework providing an overall viewpoint to understand the electrochemical phenomena in bess to improve the prediction accuracy of models and extend their applications parameter estimations recio garrido et al 2014 substrate competition capodaglio et al 2017 gadkari et al 2019c radeef and ismail 2019 reactor configurations li et al 2016 yao et al 2016 and other relevant factors can be further integrated into the developed framework notably despite the models based on strategy ii possess a low mathematical complexity and a high computational efficiency the analysis of spatial issues was difficult this is because that the governing equations of these models mainly consist of odes which only concerns the time dependent issues therefore when both of computational efficiency and spatial problems are considered some pdes can also be added into the framework to develop an integrated model mardanpour and yaghmaei 2017 mardanpour et al 2017 3 2 electronic models electronic models in which a bes was consider as an electrical equipment consisting of various classical electronic components mainly focus on the behaviors of electron flow and electric charge storage park et al 2017 recio garrido et al 2016a sindhuja et al 2016 in these models kirchhoff s law ohm s law and charging discharging of capacitors are used develop a model framework meanwhile an equivalent circuit was formulated to describe the electronic processes in a bes fig 6 carreon bautista et al 2015 coronado et al 2015 generally an equivalent circuit consists of power sources vbes ohmic resistors rohm polarization resistors rp and capacitors ce in the circuit vbes represents the power output of a mfc or power supply of a mec mes rohm represents the overall resistances of electrolyte current collector wires ion exchange membranes and biofilms lu et al 2015 rp represents the resistive component accounting for both the activation and concentration losses he and mansfeld 2009 xia et al 2018a and ce represents the actual bes capacitances in some cases capacitors of bess are further divided into double layer capacitors cdl and constant phase elements cpe cdl is mainly used to describe the delay of electron discharge charge in cdl which are formed at the electrode electrolyte interface park et al 2017 cpe represents the capacitances which are mainly caused by electrode roughness coating and distribution of reaction rate fradler et al 2014 he and mansfeld 2009 except for capacitors charge transfer resistors rct and warburg elements w can also be integrated into the equivalent circuit to describe the resistance of charge transfer and diffusion respectively cooper and smith 2006 ha et al 2010 he and mansfeld 2009 xia et al 2018a model development a typical electronic model was developed by ha et al to determine the rct and cdl of a mfc ha et al 2010 an equivalent circuit was developed by connecting cdl and rct in parallel and then connecting a rohm and vbes in series based on this circuit both of the charge transfer processes and the dynamic behaviors of the mfc could be described by the formulated model these results indicated that formulating an appropriate equivalent circuit is the basic step for the construction of an electronic model sindhuja et al 2016 formulated a lumped equivalent circuit by using vbes rext external resistance and rin internal resistance aiming to reveal the effect of internal resistances on the mfc performance to analyze the distribution of internal resistances the authors divided the internal resistance into ohmic resistances activation resistances and concentration resistances which were corresponded to ohmic losses activation losses and concentration losses respectively as expected the formulated model showed a good ability to analyze the potential losses caused by different electrode materials it is should be noted that the corresponding equivalent circuit was equivalent to that of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis which has been widely used to analyze electrochemical behaviors in bess when power sources are not integrated into an electronic model cooper and smith 2006 kashyap et al 2014 ter heijne et al 2011 yin et al 2013 for example vu et al 2020 used rohm rct cdl and w to formulate the randles circuit and aimed to investigate the influence of magnetite nanoparticles on current generation and methane production of a mes tahir et al 2021a used a combination of rohm rct cdl and w to form a modified randles circuit to study charge transport and electrode electrolyte interfacial phenomenon occurred on the nickel ferrite mxene coated anode in mfcs similar to the formulation of electronic model the equivalent circuit of eis should also be modified according to their applications for example khan et al 2020 used rs rct and cpe to analyze the nyquist plot of an anoxic mfc and used rs rct cpe and w to analyze the impedance of an oxic mfc because these two mfcs showed distinguished diffusion behaviors recently combination of the bess with power management systems and other electrical controls has been proposed sanchez et al 2020 shahparasti et al 2020 yang et al 2012 and thus the equivalent circuits are further extended to investigate the electrical behaviors of the combined system carreon bautista et al 2015 coronado et al 2013 2015 erbay et al 2014 for example pulse width modulated electrical loads have been combined with a mfc to achieve the on line monitoring for electrochemical outputs to estimate the open circuit voltages the internal resistances and capacitances of a mfc the equivalent circuit of the mfc was combined with a pulse width modulated external resistor to develop an on line procedure coronado et al 2013 2015 considering the low power outputs of an mfc power management systems pms are also merged with mfcs to achieve a more readily usable voltage outputs in this application the pms can deliver low fluctuating voltages generated by mfcs to a super capacitor by which the electronic devices can be powered carreon bautista et al 2015 to describe the combined system the equivalent circuit of the mfc was combined with maximum power point tracking and boost converter circuits erbay et al 2014 shahparasti et al 2020 integrated a mes stack into an electrical grid attempting to convert surplus energy into biofuels to analyze the static and dynamic non linear behaviors of mes stack under different operation conditions the classical equivalent circuit of mess was combined with diodes to form a new model which can be used to explain the internal reactions of the mes stack accurately summary of electronic models in summary electronic models are developed based on the equivalent circuits of bess and particularly focus on the influence of impedances on the voltage current of a bes in an electronic model the equation set consists of several algebraic or ordinary differential equations it implies that only several initial conditions are required to realize the calculations thus the computational cost of an electronic model is quite low on the other hand because the core equation of electronic models is kirchhoff s equation which has been widely used in electric engineering this model has apparent advantages in analyzing the variation of bes voltages currents when a bes is integrated into a complex electric circuit although the specific processes such as redox reactions mass charge transfer and biofilm formation were not considered in electronic models the formulation of the equivalent circuit is still based on the physiochemical behaviors in a bes thus a deep understanding for the bioelectrochemical principles of a bes is still necessary 3 3 machine learning models with the rapid development of intelligent algorithm in the past years the technologies namely machine learning models that concern the underling interactions between inputs and outputs have been developed to simulate and predict the electrochemical behaviors in bess especially in the lack of effective parameters of complex mechanisms lesnik and liu 2017 luo et al 2016 these models are constructed based on data mining methods without an analytical form fig 7 illustrates the normal processes of simulations using a machine learning model generally data are first collected from experiments or simulated results of other models de clercq et al 2019 fang et al 2013 ghasemi et al 2021 then the collected data are screened to obtain training samples based on these samples intelligent algorithms are trained to learn and mine the underling interactions of data and hence to predict outputs model development fig 7 indicates that the collection of plentiful training samples with good structure and high quality is the basic step to develop a machine learning model in practice a bes usually shows slow dynamics characteristics suggesting that it would take a long time to acquire enough training samples in this case the design of experiments methods doe can be used to deal with the collected data and generate a large number of derived data to satisfy the requirement of training samples fang et al 2013 luo et al 2016 xia et al 2018a he and ma 2016 for example fang et al 2013 performed uniform design ud to reduce the number of the experimental trails in which a large number of factors act as variables he et al y j he and z f ma 2016 used hammersley sequence sampling hss to ensure the representative of the training samples generated from collected data and reduced the computational cost of data screening when the above generated data were inputted into the corresponding intelligent algorithm the results showed a good accuracy compared to experimental data except for ud and hss factorial design fd monte carlo design mc he and ma 2016 central composite design ccd sedighi et al 2018 box behnken design bbd islam et al 2018 placket burman design pbd al shehri et al 2013 zhang and angelidaki 2011 and other doe have also been reported in recent years in a word these approaches aim to formulate a pre treatment process by which the representative data can be obtained to train the intelligent algorithm the intelligent algorithms as the core component of the machine learning model were usually constructed based on linear methods such as linear regression lr in early stage of development this machine learning models had a good interpretability and simple model structures luo et al 2016 in recent years data mining methods are used for the algorithm fig 7 despite the analytical form was not involved the algorithm indeed significantly improved the prediction accuracy of machine learning models cai et al 2019 garg et al 2014 kalogirou 2001 luo et al 2016 for example ramón fernández et al 2019 used fuzzy logic approach to simulate the power output of mfcs fed with human urine by using this algorithm an inference system was constructed based on the vague information and the uncertainty of something being either completely true or completely false the proposed inference system was used to replicate the human reasoning procedures and statistically predict the results ghasemi et al 2021 kalogirou 2001 tsompanas et al 2017 used cellular non linear network cnn to construct a uniform regular array of locally connected continuous state nodes attempting to realize the simultaneous updating of data states in discrete time and the prediction of biochemical and electrochemical phenomena in mfcs as a algorithms that generally uses a number of connected neurons to achieve complex learning and generalization in a nonlinear and parallel manner kalogirou 2001 luo et al 2016 tsompanas et al 2019 artificial neural network ann was also used to simulate power generation of mfcs tsompanas et al 2019 biogas production of mecs quashie et al 2021 and biofilm communities of bioanodes lesnik and liu 2017 except for the typical algorithms mentioned above many other algorithms have also been widely used in bess such as relevance vector machine rvm fang et al 2013 gaussian process regression gpr sun et al 2017 he and ma 2016 bayesian network cheng et al 2021b random forest rf long et al 2021 support vector machines svm cai et al 2019 long et al 2021 logistic regression multiclass glmnet cai et al 2019 wang et al 2020 scalable tree boosting system xgboost cai et al 2019 k nearest neighbor knn cai et al 2019 de clercq et al 2019 and multi gene genetic programming mggp garg et al 2014 it should be noted that the types of algorithms and prediction accuracy of models are depended on the structure and quality of the training samples despite that the most important step for developing a machine learning model is to obtain a good algorithm to analyze the input samples y j he and z f ma 2016 this indicates that the integration of doe and intelligent algorithms should be also considered during the model construction summary of machine learning model in summary the most important component of a machine learning model is the intelligent algorithm which is an imitated technology based on studies of human brain and nervous system these algorithms are designed to analyze the statistical relationship between inputs and outputs while the fundamental physiochemical principles are not highlighted because statistics requires large datasets large training samples with good data structure and quality are required to improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning models this indicates that the collection of large datasets from experiments or doe is the most basic step for this model 4 conclusion and prospects theoretical simulation has been regarded as a useful approach to reveal the scientific principles behind the experimental phenomena in bess to promote the understanding of this approach this review analyzes the physiochemical principles and mathematical methods in theoretical models from the viewpoint of methodologies we first classify the present models into bioelectrochemical models electronic models and machine learning models and the characteristics physiochemical principles mathematical methods and model frameworks of each category are summarized and discussed generally bioelectrochemical models are developed based on the physiochemical processes in bess and electrode kinetics and conservation principles are critical to establish the model electronic models are developed based on an electronic viewpoint and kirchhoff s law is the most important principle differently machine learning models are developed based on the intelligent algorithms which are determined by statistics nowadays most of mass and charge transfer in a bes can solved since the nernst planck equation darcy s law naiver stokes equation and ohm s law can be used to describe these processes casula et al 2021 hernández garcía et al 2020b sirinutsomboon 2014 yao et al 2016 however biofilm formation on electrodes is still a hard to solved issue the major reason is that there is limited scientific understanding for the biofilm formation processes including bacterial growth in solution bacterial adhesion to electrodes and biofilm growth on electrode surfaces borole et al 2011 rabaey and rozendal 2010 santoro et al 2017 although the fundamental principles of biofilm formation remain obscure it is widely accepted that the performance of bess is significantly affected by the biofilm including biofilm structure porosity thickness and conductivity and even biofilm kinetics substrate consumption rate and biofilm activity borole et al 2011 lesnik and liu 2017 ou et al 2016b therefore a deep understanding for biofilm structure and kinetics may be the further research emphasis for bes models either developing novel experimental approaches or theoretical models in the future one possible way to achieve above goal is the combination of machine learning models with visual approaches or electrochemical approaches such as eis and cyclic voltammetry one can first use visual approaches to obtain large datasets which illustrate the relationships between operation parameters and the structure kinetics parameters of biofilms and then use machine learning models to deal with these datasets to give predictions for the critical parameters of biofilm such as porosity thickness conductivity similarly machine learning models can also be combined with electrochemical approaches to predict resistances and capacitances of bess after the collection the important parameters can be integrated into relevant models to describe the transport and reaction processes from physiochemical viewpoints or provide a deeper understanding of bess from electronic viewpoints credit authorship contribution statement zhuo li conceptualization
