15345,both huge volume and high moisture content of municipal sludge have brought great troubles and attracted extensive concerns in the world the bound water of sludge and pore clogging in the process of pressure filtration dewatering are two key factors influencing the deep dewatering effect of municipal sludge the results of this study suggest that microwave irradiation mi can be used to synchronously evaporate water reduce the bound water of sludge and solve the blockage of sludge pore channels during the process filtration dewatering which can greatly reduce the moisture content of municipal sludge low field nuclear magnetic resonance carbon dioxide gas absorption and desorption and scanning electron microscope were synthetically used to detect the pore structure of sludge cakes thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry was used to detect binding energy to calculate moisture distribution thermal mechanism was revealed by dielectric constant thermal conductivity fractal dimensions water saturation and porosity in different layers of sludge cake the results showed that the bound water in sludge samples after mi was reduced by 19 4 the pore fractal dimension was reduced from 2 955 to 2 867 the surface fractal dimension increased from 2 099 to 2 362 with the conditions of microwave power 700 w and treat time 5 min when the water saturation was close to 1 the dielectric constant of middle and outer layers was the main factor of heating while the water saturation was close to 0 the main factor became the difference of thermal conductivity in middle and outer layers moreover after mi moisture content of sludge was greatly reduced from 68 4 to 40 1 for its thermal effect further reduced to 34 1 by the continuous mechanical dewatering for its non thermal effect which change the pore structure and moisture distribution these conclusions are helpful to understand microwave thermal and non thermal mechanism and shed light on new dewatering drying integrated techniques of municipal sludge graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords municipal sludge microwave irradiation thermal and non thermal mechanism dewatering pore structure data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction an increasing of municipal sludge greatly threatens environmental safety worldwide to solve this problem sludge dewatering has become a vital process in wastewater treatment plants wu et al 2016 however the bound water of sludge and pore clogging in the process of pressure filtration dewatering are two key factors affecting the deep dewatering effect of municipal sludge mechanical dewatering mdw can only decrease moisture content of sludge to 50 80 maspolim et al 2015 wei et al 2019 the high moisture content of sludge will increase the cost of the following up transportation storage and disposal guo et al 2021 in addition the discharge of municipal sludge also degrades the quality of the effluent and therefore cannot be used directly for industrial applications li et al 2013 different pretreatment technologies have been proposed to reduce moisture content of sludge foladori et al 2010 for instance conditioner addition wang et al 2018 microwave irradiation mi tian et al 2013 acid treatment xiao et al 2016 and alkali treatment li et al 2019 heating wang et al 2019 freezing thawing shahheidar et al 2018 ultrasonication cai et al 2018 oxidation wang et al 2020 lu et al 2019 and fenton s reagent cai et al 2019 liang et al 2020 treatment among these mentioned treatment technologies mi has received practical attention due to its advantages of fast heating time and short process time arpia et al 2021 microwave refers to electromagnetic waves with a frequency between 300 mhz and 3000 ghz serdyuk 2008 the electromagnetic waves with high frequency cause frequent rotation of dipolar molecules in sludge cake then the friction of adjacent dipolar molecules will produce numerous heating yu et al 2010 found that suitable microwave time improved sludge dewaterability chen et al 2020 found that mi removed the bound water in sludge the distribution of free and bound water in the sludge determines the constant drying time associated with water evaporation for dry microwave radiation treatment kocbek et al 2022 rao et al 2019 demonstrated that after mi pretreatment mdw decreased the moisture content of sludge to about 25 component of sludge is complex which composed of bacterial biomass 10 24 carbohydrates 7 19 proteins 25 62 humic substances 8 29 and 3 5 dna gonzalez et al 2018 a reduction of vss tss ratio was 10 50 by alkali treatment jiang et al 2021 moreover mi could effectively remove the organic pollutants of sludge and reduce the release of harmful gasses during the pyrolysis process xu et al 2021 dai et al 2014 found a 187 increase of organic matter solubilization of sludge at 400 w mi zhang et al 2017 indicated that mi produced lower h2s than conventional pyrolysis from 100 to 800 c furthermore mi can change the microstructure and morphology of sludge the newly formed cavities and openness in the dried sludge wang et al 2020 and the porosity surface roughness and specific surface area of modified particle surface all increased zhou et al 2018 municipal sludge can be regarded as highly porous medium and pore structure of sludge shows the statistically fractal scaling characteristics xu et al 2013 2016 2017 qiu et al 2020 the electrical conductivity yin et al 2018 and thermal conductivity shen et al 2020 of sludge can be calculated by porosity pore radius and fractal dimension macias garcía et al 2020 therefore the change of pore structure in the mi process will influence dielectric properties heating product and transport of municipal sludge for detecting pore structure of sludge precisely and completely low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technology can gain porosity pore size distribution and mass of water in different layers in the sludge cake rao et al 2021 the gas absorption and desorption can quantitatively characterize the surface roughness in the sludge cake ge et al 2020 the form of particle surface in the sludge cake can be shown by scanning electron microscope sem liu et al 2018 therefore it is important to use different methods to explore the pore structure varieties in addition moisture distribution has great influence on the dewatering performance zhang et al 2019 deng et al 2011 used the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry tg dsc to test the moisture distribution of sludge which will facilitate our further investigation on the dewatering performance of the sludge cake there are many scholars studied the heating characteristic and microstructure morphology however research on the thermal and non thermal mechanisms of municipal sludge in mi process how it further fosters the mechanical dewatering effect of sludge after mi and dewatering drying integrated techniques are absent and insufficient in the present study the binding energy of moisture moisture distribution and the microscopic pore structure in sludge cake were synthetically detected by various methods porosity φ pore radius r mass of water in different layers roughness and fractal dimension of pore structure df in sludge cake were calculated the thermal mechanism of municipal sludge during mi was studied from the perspective of pore structure and moisture distribution the improvement of dewatering performance after mi was explored by different treatment parameters the organic matter content changes of sludge solid under mi were measured by volatile suspended solids suspended solids vss ss 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge samples the municipal sludge was sampled from hangzhou qige wastewater treatment plant in china which has a capacity of wastewater treatment of 1 2 million tons per day with anaerobic noxic oxic process properties of the sludge samples are shown in table 1 these sludge samples were pre dewatered by belt pressure filter through pretreatment with 2 3 kg cationic polyacrylamide per ton of dry sludge and the moisture content of pre dewatered sludge is approximately 83 initial sludge it should be noted that initial sludge was stored at 4 c for use within 3 days to avoid property transformation 2 2 experimental apparatus as shown in fig 1 a the innovatively designed mdw device consists of a hydraulic system lifting jack steel chamber filter chamber moving piston upper cover plate filter cloth reinforced cloth pressure controller and air pump and the diameter of the filter chamber was 100 mm and the maximum pressure on sludge could reach up to 12 mpa the mi device is a microwave oven mk2270m hauer electric co ltd china output power ranged from 70 w to 700 w frequency 2270 mhz with a plate inside the microwave oven as shown in fig 1 b six samples were collected during the experiments including initial sludge samples iss samples a ssa samples b ssb samples c ssc samples d ssd samples e sse which were defined in table 2 ssa and ssb served as a control group in order to study the effect of microwave pretreatment ssc to sse was a complete experimental process ssc was the sample obtained by mdw of the initial sludge its mechanical pressure is different with that of ssb and then ssc was processed by mi to obtain ssd which is further dewatered by mdw to obtain sse ssc and ssd were for exploring mi characteristics and mechanism mc of sse was compared with ssc and ssd to assess the improvement of mi on mdw the difference between surface and inside temperature of sludge cakes was measured by k type thermocouples and thermometer in the supplementary material the synchronous thermal analyzer sta449f3 netzsch scientific instruments trading co ltd german was used to determine the moisture distribution of sludge the co2 adsorption and desorption analyzer autosorb iq quantachrome instruments co ltd america was used to explore the adsorption desorption isotherm and of sludge samples the field emission sem su8010 hitachi instruments co ltd japan was used to characterize the surface of particles the main parameters of sem are as follows magnification 10 000 acceleration voltage 1 kv the lf nmr analyzer mesomr23 060h i suzhou niumag analytical instrument co ltd china was used to detect the pore structure of sludge cakes device parameters are in the supplementary material 2 3 methods and parameter setting 2 3 1 moisture distribution approximately 10 mg sludge sample was maintained for tg dsc test to detect e b the cell temperature was heated from 25 c to 90 c with heating rate of 10 c min and kept stable at 90 c for 45 min deng et al 2011 the types of moisture were divided as free water fw interstitial water iw surface water sw and bound water bw by tg dsc smith et al 1995 ferrasse et al 2000 vaxelaire et al 2004 these types of moisture were classified by different e b shown in table s1 in the supplementary material keey et al 1972 the e b moisture in the dewatered sludge kj kg h2o was calculated by the following equation yan et al 2009 chen et al al 1997 1 e b q c m s where q c is the heat flow at 90 c kj s m s is the drying rate g min 2 3 2 pore structure the pore size distribution and mass of water in different layers were measured by testing the relaxation time t 2 in sludge pores by lf nmr the t 2 value is closely related to its pore construction mao et al 2018 the relationship between t 2 and radius of pores is defined by 2 1 t 2 λ 2 r where λ is the transverse relaxation rate which is related to the chemical property of sludge and r is the radius of pore nm based on eq 2 it can be found that greater value of t 2 represents larger pore size therefore the pore size distribution and m c components of the dewatered sludge cakes under different dewatering conditions were measured with carr purcell meiboom gill the mass of water in different cake layers were obtained according to t 2 value of different layers with one dimensional gradient hard pulse spin echo in order to study the changes of pore structure on the sludge surface sem images were converted into binary images by the ostu method in matlab r2019a mathworks nc usa chu et al 2004 the d f of pore greyscale images in every sem image were calculated by the box counting method the parameters are shown in the table s2 in the supplementary material the fractal dimension dfp can be used to quantitatively describe the change of the sludge surface structure which can be calculated by the following equation yu 2008 3 d f p d e ln φ ln r m i n r m a x where rmin is the minimum pore size nm rmax is the maximum pore size nm de is the euclidean dimension sludge samples are the three dimensional entities so de is 3 in order to explore the roughness of the pore surface to further illustrate the improvement of dewaterability co2 adsorption and desorption were used to detect the changes in isotherms to obtain adsorption curves the adsorption curve indicates the relationship between the input gas volume va and the relative pressure p p 0 va can be obtained by the langmuir equation grant et al 1998 4 p p 0 v a b v m 1 v m p p 0 where b is the langmuir constant and vm is the saturated adsorption capacity cc of the single layer therefore based on the gas adsorption isotherm the fractal frenkel halsey hill fhh model is used to determine the fractal dimension ismail and pfeifer 1994 5 ln v a v m d ln ln p 0 p c where c is a constant the index d depends on the fractal dimension dfr and the adsorption mechanism then the dfr of the isotherm curve can be determined by dfr d 3 and its value varies from 2 to 3 2 3 3 dewatering performance and thermal mechanisms of mi single factor method was used to study the effect of different operating parameters including m i s p c t d p m and t m which are shown in table 3 in addition each series of experimental groups were repeated three times the dewatering performance is evaluated by moisture content of sludge which is measured by the conventional dry gravimetric method gb18918 2002 as follows 6 m c m 1 m 2 m 1 where m c is the moisture content of sludge cake m 1 is the mass of dewatered sludge cake g and m 2 is the mass of dry sludge cake after drying at 105 c for 24 h the transient water evaporation rate vr is similar to the transient filtrate flow rate which is the mass of filtrate during the unit time feng et al 2014 thus vr g min is defined as the following equation 7 v r m s t u where tu is the unit time min ms is the mass of water evaporation g during the unit time the absorption of microwave energy mainly depends on the imaginary part of dielectric constant of sludge ε regardless of the high frequency and low frequency of electromagnetic waves ε can be calculated as the following equation brodie et al 2014 8 ε σ 2 π f ε 0 where σ is conductivity s m f is microwave frequency hz that is 2 2 109hz ε 0 is the dielectric constant of free space that is 1 the σ can be determined as the fractal capillary bundle model wei et al 2015 9 σ d f d t 1 d f σ w φ 1 d t 1 d e d f where df is the fractal dimension that is 1 52 dt is tortuosity fractal dimension which can be 1 10 yu and cheng 2002 σ w is the conductivity of liquid phase which is the conductivity of pure water 2 5 10 4 s m φ is porosity in different layers of sludge cake relative thermal conductivity k in different layers can be calculated by fractal thermal conductivity model

the follow 11 vss ss m 3 m 2 where m 3 is the mass reduction of burned sludge at 600 c for 2 h the energy consumption ec of mi is defined as the following equation yu et al 2010 12 e c p m t m m 4 where ec is the energy consumption kj kg h2o pm is the microwave power w tm is the treatment time s m 4 is the water mass removed by mi g 3 results and discussion 3 1 moisture distribution as shown in fig 2 a there is a large peak and a small peak in the t 2 curves of the two sludge samples the relaxation time of the large peak of ssd at 1 ms is shorter than that of ssc at 8 ms this means that the average pore size of ssd after mi is smaller than that of ssc moisture distribution of sludge cake can be inferred from the peak area and peak position thus the large peak in the t 2 curve represents bound water and the small peak represents free water as shown in fig 2 b bound water of ssd is lower than ssc which indicates that mi can remove some bound water nevertheless the results of lf nmr cannot accurately illustrate the distribution of the four types of water rao et al 2021 found that tg dsc can more accurately determine the binding energy of sludge particles and moisture and can more accurately determine the complete moisture distribution as shown in fig 2 c binding energy of ssc and ssd are both close to 0 and increase with the moisture content decreasing after mi the highest binding energy of ssd can reach 2800 kj kg h2o while that of ssc can only reach 1400 kj kg h2o the moisture distribution of ssc and ssd can be distinguished according to binding energy curves as shown in fig 2 d after mi although the percentage of bound water is still highest mi can decrease 19 4 bound water furthermore some free water are produced in ssd but bound water surface water and interstitial water were all reduced it indicates that mi can convert the bound water into free water which can be removed by mdw therefore mi not only evaporate bound water but also produce some free water in order to analyze the influence of mi on bound water of sludge cakes binding energy inside ssd under different microwave treatment time was studied as shown in fig 3 a the binding energy of ssd is decreasing with the treatment time increasing when microwave treatment time is 1 min the highest binding energy exceeds 4000 kj kg h2o but when treatment time is 5 min it is only 1000 kj kg h2o in addition when moisture content of ssd exceeds 20 binding energy is close to 0 this shows that mi is processing binding energy of bound water is still decreasing some bound water are converted to free water as shown in fig 3 b with the increase of microwave treatment time both bound water and free water are gradually decreased mi can evaporate free water more than bound water and the ratio of bound water to free water is dramatically rising which means that the dewaterability of ssd is decreasing guo et al 2018 however mi can reduce the binding energy of bound water and increase the percentage of free water to improve dewaterability of ssd 3 2 pore structure 3 2 1 lf nmr as shown in fig 4 a the pore size in ssa and ssb are both concentrated on the range from 50 nm to 1400 nm the pore size distribution of ssa is similar with ssb as shown in fig 4 b percentage of r 0 01 pores with a radius more than 0 01 μm in ssd is higher than that in ssc it reflects that mi can change the pore structure of sludge cakes expand pore structure and provide more water drainage channels as shown in fig 4 c and d there is a stratification of water mass in the ssc and ssd the mass of water in ssc is concentrated in the inner layers 0 99 mm to 8 93 mm and that in ssd is also concentrated in the inner layers 0 99 mm to 3 98 mm furthermore the value of fractal dimension dfp characterizes to the complex of pore structure according to eq 3 dfp were calculated and shown in table 4 dfp of ssa is the same as that of ssb but the dfp of ssd is lower than ssc this means that mi can make the pore structure of sludge cake more uniform 3 2 2 sem morphology in order to study the pore structure changes of the sludge cake sem was used to observe the morphology of iss ssc ssd 1 and ssd 2 as shown in fig 5 a it can be found that there are some large particles in iss and the microstructure is loose as shown in fig 5 b after mdw ssc has a compact structure and a smooth surface of particle because of the squeeze force moreover there are very few internal pores and water flow path this indicates that mdw has a sealing effect on the pores of ssc resulting in a denser pore structure than iss as shown in fig 5 c and d under the mi condition pm 70 w tm 5 min ssd 1 has more micro pore structures on the solid surface than ssc these micropores can provide more effective water flow pathways moreover as shown in fig 5 d the microstructure of ssd 2 with the condition pm 700 w tm 5 min is rougher and the micro pore structures is more obvious than that of ssd 1 the increase of microwave power can foster the establishment of water flow path of sludge cakes pores edge detection of sludge samples is shown in the fig s1 in the supplementary material the change of pore structure of sludge particle surface can be quantitatively characterized by fractal dimension dfs as shown in fig 5 a d the dfs of iss is higher than ssc and that of ssd 1 is lower than ssd 2 moreover the gap in dfs between ssd 2 and ssc is largest the ability of mi to change the pore structure is greater than that of mdw thus mi can effectively open the micropores which is previously closed by mdw to improve the dewaterability of sludge cake 3 2 3 co2 adsorption and desorption as shown in fig 6 a and b the isotherm curves of ssc and ssd are characterized by co2 adsorption and desorption the adsorption curve indicates the relationship between the input gas volume va and the relative pressure p p 0 because of the low pressure p p 0 0 1 the main adsorption force of the pores is van der waals force the adsorption characteristics mainly show the surface characteristics of the pores therefore the dfr at low pressure calculated from the adsorption characteristics represents the roughness of the pores inside the sludge sample furthermore as shown in fig 6 c and d the dfr of ssc and ssd are 2 099 and 2 362 respectively the dfr of ssc is close to 2 which indicates that the surface of its internal pores is smooth and flat the dfr of ssd is higher indicating that the internal pore surface is rougher furthermore the increase in the surface roughness of the pores represents the removal or fracture of the surface material of the solid phase these phenomena coincide with the change of particle surface in fig 5 during the mi process the organic matter of the sludge undergoes a qualitative change because of the microwave energy and heat energy and the intuitive manifestation is that the surface roughness of the sludge is changed this is consistent with the research of mawioo et al 2017 3 3 thermal mechanisms of microwave irradiation on sludge cake the morphology of sludge cakes after mi under different treatment time and power are shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material the difference temperature δt between the surface and inside of sludge cake can clearly reflect the heating characteristics as shown in fig 7 a when microwave power is 70 w and 350 w even if the ec is increased to a high level 10 000 kj kg h2o δt is still lower than 0 the temperature of the inside is higher than the surface of sludge cake when microwave power is 535 w and 700 w under the ec is from 2000 kj kg h2o to 6000 kj kg h2o the temperature of the inside is lower than the surface of sludge cake the maximum δt can reach up to 42 4 c the process of mi heating can be considered as two steps the first is microwave energy absorption and the second is converting it to thermal energy according to eqs 8 and 9 based on the porosity in different layers of ssc the ε in different layers of sludge cake is shown in fig 7 b the ability of sludge cake to absorb microwave energy is consistent with the distribution of water mass in different layers the moisture content in the middle layer from 8th to 11st is higher than that in outer layers of sludge cake and the ability of the dipole to oscillate with microwaves is stronger so the ε is larger than that of outer layers in sludge cake the friction between adjacent dipoles is main reason for the thermal energy converting the ability to produce thermal energy mainly depends on the thermal conductivity according to eq 10 the k in different layers of ssc is shown in fig 7 c it is obvious that the k in outer layer 1st and 19th is higher than that in middle layers from 8th to 11st and the gap will increase with the reduction of sw when microwave power is 70 w and 350 w the heating process is sluggish and the water evaporation rate is reduced accordingly meanwhile sw is close to 1 which means the gap of k between outer layers and middle layers is not significant the decisive factor that determines δt is the ability to absorb microwave energy thus the internal temperature of the sludge cake is higher than the surface temperature furthermore because a large amount of microwave energy is absorbed ec of mi at low power 70 w and 350 w reaches a high level 10 000 kj kg h2o on the contrary when microwave power is 535 w and 700 w with the rapid evaporation of water sw is close to 0 the key factor is the gap of k thus δt is obvious and energy consumption maintains a low level 6000 kj kg h2o 3 4 comprehensive effect analysis of mi on moisture content reduction in order to study the comprehensive effect of mi on the reduction of sludge moisture content the initial sludge mc 83 was dewatered by mdw for a period of time until no water is removed then the microwave was applied for treating the dewatered sludge a certain time finally the sludge cake that has been treated by mi was dewatered once again by mdw to further reduce the moisture content as shown in fig 8 a and b mi can effectively reduce the moisture content of sludge for its thermal effect on impelling the water evaporation which can reduce the moisture content of 150 g municipal sludge from 68 4 to 40 1 within 5 min for 700 w microwave power when the initial mass of sludge is 250 g moisture content can be reduced from 76 8 to 59 8 the energy consumption of mi is about 4900 kj kg h2o ec of other drying methods is shown as below for instance ec of convective drying by hot air ranges from 2520 to 5040 kj kg h2o of conduction drying by thermal oil or steam is 2880 3240 kj kg h2o arlabosse et al 2014 because mi can quickly increase the temperature of sludge the evaporation rate is very fast there is similar water mass evaporated in 250 g and 150 g sludge cake for improving the evaporation efficiency of mi the thinner sludge cake should be more suitable to be treated by mi because the internal water is easier to drain and the evaporation rate is faster with thinner sludge cake in addition the water evaporation rate in different microwave power is shown in fig 8 d the evaporation rate of mi has a peak value within 5 min and the higher the microwave power the earlier the peak appears suitable microwave treatment time can improve the advantages of mi in addition mi also has a great impact on the organic matter inside the sludge vss ss in the sludge cake can represent the content of internal organic matter wu et al 2020 the detailed analysis of vss ss by mi is in the supplementary material moreover the sludge effected by microwave irradiation was dewatered again by mdw as shown in fig 8 c mi can improve dewatering performance of mdw after mi tm 5 min pm 700 w the following mdw can continuously reduce moisture content from 40 1 to 34 1 the main reason of dewatering improvement is the non thermal effect of mi owing to the improvement of the drainage pore structure and change of the moisture distribution on the one hand the great dense surface formed by the previous mechanical pressure filtration hinders the outflow of inside water of sludge cake which makes the inner water difficulty in flowing out mi carbonized the surface of sludge cakes and produced numerous new pores inside the sludge cake which will build water flow path thereby promoting the removing of water on the other hand mi can destroy the colloidal structure of sludge and changed the moisture distribution convert the bound water into free water which can be removed by mdw so as to reduce the moisture content of sludge therefore mi not only has the advantage of rapid heating speed but also can improve the dewatering performance of subsequent mdw 4 conclusion the pore structure of sludge cakes was detected synthetically by multiple methods the fractal dimensions were analyzed and compared based on different experiment condition the binding energy was detected to calculate moisture distribution thermal mechanism was revealed by dielectric constant ε and thermal conductivity k based on fractal dimension df water saturation sw and porosity in different layers of sludge cake thermal and non thermal effects mechanisms of microwave on reduction of moisture content were explored from the points as the water evaporation improvement of pore structure and reduction of bound water results showed that bound water was reduced by 19 4 df of pore structure was reduced from 2 955 to 2 867 df of pores surface roughness increased from 2 099 to 2 362 this indicated that mi could reduce the binding energy of sludge particles and moisture and make the pore structure more uniform to produce some new internal pores and water flow path which improved the dewatering performance of sludge when sw was close to 1 ε of middle and outer layers was the main factor of heating while when sw was close to 0 the main factor became the difference of k in middle and outer layers of sludge cakes moreover after mi moisture content of sludge was significantly reduced from 68 4 to 40 1 for its thermal effect further reduced to 34 1 by the continuous single mdw for its non thermal effect the present works are helpful to understand mechanism of mi on moisture content reduction and shed light on new dewatering drying integrated techniques of municipal sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

process of pressure filtration dewatering are two key factors influencing the deep dewatering effect of municipal sludge the results of this study suggest that microwave irradiation mi can be used to

the dielectric constant of middle and outer layers was the main factor of heating while the water saturation was close to 0 the main factor became the difference of thermal conductivity in middle and outer layers moreover after mi moisture content of sludge was greatly reduced from 68 4 to 40 1 for its thermal effect further reduced to 34 1 by the continuous mechanical dewatering for its non

pretreatment mdw decreased the moisture content of sludge to about 25 component of sludge is complex which composed of bacterial biomass 10 24 carbohydrates 7 19 proteins 25 62 humic substances 8 29 and 3 5 dna gonzalez et al 2018 a reduction of vss tss ratio was 10 50 by alkali treatment jiang et al 2021 moreover mi could effectively remove the organic pollutants of sludge and reduce the release of harmful gasses during the pyrolysis process xu et al 2021 dai et al 2014 found a 187 increase of organic matter solubilization of sludge at 400 w mi zhang et al 2017 indicated that mi produced lower h2s than conventional pyrolysis from 100 to 800 c furthermore mi can change the microstructure and morphology of sludge the newly formed cavities and openness in the dried sludge wang et al 2020 and the porosity surface roughness and specific surface area of modified particle surface all increased zhou et al 2018 municipal sludge can be regarded as highly porous medium and pore structure of sludge shows the statistically fractal scaling characteristics xu et al 2013 2016 2017 qiu et al 2020 the electrical conductivity yin et al 2018 and thermal conductivity shen et al 2020 of sludge can be calculated by porosity pore radius and fractal dimension macias garcía et al 2020 therefore the change of pore structure in the mi process will influence dielectric properties heating product and transport of municipal sludge for detecting pore structure of sludge precisely and completely low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technology can gain porosity pore size distribution and mass of water in different layers in the sludge cake rao et al 2021 the gas absorption and desorption can quantitatively characterize the surface roughness in the sludge cake ge et al 2020 the form of particle surface in the sludge cake can be shown by scanning electron microscope sem liu et al 2018 therefore it is important to use different methods to explore the pore structure varieties in addition moisture distribution has great influence on the dewatering performance zhang et al 2019 deng et al 2011 used the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry tg dsc to test the moisture distribution of sludge which will facilitate our further investigation on the dewatering performance of the sludge cake there are many scholars studied the heating characteristic and microstructure morphology however research on the thermal and non thermal mechanisms of municipal sludge in mi process how it further fosters the mechanical dewatering effect of sludge after mi and dewatering drying integrated techniques are absent and insufficient in the present study the binding energy of moisture moisture distribution and the microscopic pore structure in sludge cake were synthetically detected by various methods porosity φ pore radius r mass of water in different layers roughness and fractal dimension of pore structure df in sludge cake were calculated the thermal mechanism of municipal sludge during mi was studied from the perspective of pore structure and moisture distribution the improvement of dewatering performance after mi was explored by different treatment parameters the organic matter content changes of sludge solid under mi were measured by volatile suspended solids suspended solids vss ss 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge samples the municipal sludge was sampled from hangzhou qige wastewater treatment plant in china which has a capacity of wastewater treatment of 1 2 million tons per day with anaerobic noxic oxic process properties of the sludge samples are shown in table 1 these sludge samples were pre dewatered by belt pressure filter through pretreatment with 2 3 kg cationic polyacrylamide per ton of dry sludge and the moisture content of pre dewatered sludge is approximately 83 initial sludge it should be noted that initial sludge was stored at 4 c for use within 3 days to avoid property transformation 2 2 experimental apparatus as shown in fig 1 a the innovatively designed mdw device consists of a hydraulic system lifting jack steel chamber filter chamber moving piston upper cover plate filter cloth reinforced cloth pressure controller and air pump and the diameter of the filter chamber was 100 mm and the maximum pressure on sludge could reach up to 12 mpa the mi device is a microwave oven mk2270m hauer electric co ltd china output power ranged from 70 w to 700 w frequency 2270 mhz with a plate inside the microwave oven as shown in fig 1 b six samples were collected during the experiments including initial sludge samples iss samples a ssa samples b ssb samples c ssc samples d ssd samples e sse which were defined in table 2 ssa and ssb served as a control group in order to study the effect of microwave pretreatment ssc to sse was a complete experimental process ssc was the sample obtained by mdw of the initial sludge its mechanical pressure is different with that of ssb and then ssc was processed by mi to obtain ssd which is further dewatered by mdw to obtain sse ssc and ssd were for exploring mi characteristics and mechanism mc of sse was compared with ssc and ssd to assess the improvement of mi on mdw the difference between surface and inside temperature of sludge cakes was measured by k type thermocouples and thermometer in the supplementary material the synchronous thermal analyzer sta449f3 netzsch scientific instruments trading co ltd german was used to determine the moisture distribution of sludge the co2 adsorption and desorption analyzer autosorb iq quantachrome instruments co ltd america was used to explore the adsorption desorption isotherm and of sludge samples the field emission sem su8010 hitachi instruments co ltd japan was used to characterize the surface of particles the main parameters of sem are as follows magnification 10 000 acceleration voltage 1 kv the lf nmr analyzer mesomr23 060h i suzhou niumag analytical instrument co ltd china was used to detect the pore structure of sludge cakes device parameters are in the supplementary material 2 3 methods and parameter setting 2 3 1 moisture distribution approximately 10 mg sludge sample was maintained for tg dsc test to detect e b the cell temperature was heated from 25 c to 90 c with heating rate of 10 c min and kept stable at 90 c for 45 min deng et al 2011 the types of moisture were divided as free water fw interstitial water iw surface water sw and bound water bw by tg dsc smith et al 1995 ferrasse et al 2000 vaxelaire et al 2004 these types of moisture were classified by different e b shown in table s1 in the supplementary material keey et al 1972 the e b moisture in the dewatered sludge kj kg h2o was calculated by the following equation yan et al 2009 chen et al al 1997 1 e b q c m s where q c is the heat flow at 90 c kj s m s is the drying rate g min 2 3 2 pore structure the pore size distribution and mass of water in different layers were measured by testing the relaxation time t 2 in sludge pores by lf nmr the t 2 value is closely related to its pore construction mao et al 2018 the relationship between t 2 and radius of pores is defined by 2 1 t 2 λ 2 r where λ is the transverse relaxation rate which is related to the chemical property of sludge and r is the radius of pore nm based on eq 2 it can be found that greater value of t 2 represents larger pore size therefore the pore size distribution and m c components of the dewatered sludge cakes under different dewatering conditions were measured with carr purcell meiboom gill the mass of water in different cake layers were obtained according to t 2 value of different layers with one dimensional gradient hard pulse spin echo in order to study the changes of pore structure on the sludge surface sem images were converted into binary images by the ostu method in matlab r2019a mathworks nc usa chu et al 2004 the d f of pore greyscale images in every sem image were calculated by the box counting method the parameters are shown in the table s2 in the supplementary material the fractal dimension dfp can be used to quantitatively describe the change of the sludge surface structure which can be calculated by the following equation yu 2008 3 d f p d e ln φ ln r m i n r m a x where rmin is the minimum pore size nm rmax is the maximum pore size nm de is the euclidean dimension sludge samples are the three dimensional entities so de is 3 in order to explore the roughness of the pore surface to further illustrate the improvement of dewaterability co2 adsorption and desorption were used to detect the changes in isotherms to obtain adsorption curves the adsorption curve indicates the relationship between the input gas volume va and the relative pressure p p 0 va can be obtained by the langmuir equation grant et al 1998 4 p p 0 v a b v m 1 v m p p 0 where b is the langmuir constant and vm is the saturated adsorption capacity cc of the single layer therefore based on the gas adsorption isotherm the fractal frenkel halsey hill fhh model is used to determine the fractal dimension ismail and pfeifer 1994 5 ln v a v m d ln ln p 0 p c where c is a constant the index d depends on the fractal dimension dfr and the adsorption mechanism then the dfr of the isotherm curve can be determined by dfr d 3 and its value varies from 2 to 3 2 3 3 dewatering performance and thermal mechanisms of mi single factor method was used to study the effect of different operating parameters including m i s p c t d p m and t m which are shown in table 3 in addition each series of experimental groups were repeated three times the dewatering performance is evaluated by moisture content of sludge which is measured by the conventional dry gravimetric method gb18918 2002 as follows 6 m c m 1 m 2 m 1 where m c is the moisture content of sludge cake m 1 is the mass of dewatered sludge cake g and m 2 is the mass of dry sludge cake after drying at 105 c for 24 h the transient water evaporation rate vr is similar to the transient filtrate flow rate which is the mass of filtrate during the unit time feng et al 2014 thus vr g min is defined as the following equation 7 v r m s t u where tu is the unit time min ms is the mass of water evaporation g during the unit time the absorption of microwave energy mainly depends on the imaginary part of dielectric constant of sludge ε regardless of the high frequency and low frequency of electromagnetic waves ε can be calculated as the following equation brodie et al 2014 8 ε σ 2 π f ε 0 where σ is conductivity s m f is microwave frequency hz that is 2 2 109hz ε 0 is the dielectric constant of free space that is 1 the σ can be determined as the fractal capillary bundle model wei et al 2015 9 σ d

the conductivity of pure water 2 5 10 4 s m φ is porosity in different layers of sludge cake relative thermal conductivity k in different layers can be calculated by fractal thermal conductivity model

the follow 11 vss ss m 3 m 2 where m 3 is the mass reduction of burned sludge at 600 c for 2 h the energy consumption ec of mi is defined as the following equation yu et al 2010 12 e c p m t m m 4 where ec is the energy consumption kj kg h2o pm is the microwave power w tm is the treatment time s m 4 is the water mass removed by mi g 3 results and discussion 3 1 moisture distribution as shown in fig 2 a there is a large peak and a small peak in the t 2 curves of the two sludge samples the relaxation time of the large peak of ssd at 1 ms is shorter than that of ssc at 8 ms this means that the average pore size of ssd after mi is smaller than that of ssc moisture distribution of sludge cake can be inferred from the peak area and peak position thus the large peak in the t 2 curve represents bound water and the small peak represents free water as shown in fig 2 b bound water of ssd is lower than ssc which indicates that mi can remove some bound water nevertheless the results of lf nmr cannot accurately illustrate the distribution of the four types of water rao et al 2021 found that tg dsc can more accurately determine the binding energy of sludge particles and moisture and can more accurately determine the complete moisture distribution as shown in fig 2 c binding energy of ssc and ssd are both close to 0 and increase with the moisture content decreasing after mi the highest binding energy of ssd can reach 2800 kj kg h2o while that of ssc can only reach 1400 kj kg h2o the moisture distribution of ssc and ssd can be distinguished according to binding energy curves as shown in fig 2 d after mi although the percentage of bound water is still highest mi can decrease 19 4 bound water furthermore some free water are produced in ssd but bound water surface water and interstitial water were all reduced it indicates that mi can convert the bound water into free water which can be removed by mdw therefore mi not only evaporate bound water but also produce some free water in order to analyze the influence of mi on bound water of sludge cakes binding energy inside ssd under different microwave treatment time was studied as shown in fig 3 a the binding energy of ssd is decreasing with the treatment time increasing when microwave treatment time is 1 min the highest binding energy exceeds 4000 kj kg h2o but when treatment time is 5 min it is only 1000 kj kg h2o in addition when moisture content of ssd exceeds 20 binding energy is close to 0 this shows that mi is processing binding energy of bound water is still decreasing some bound water are converted to free water as shown in fig 3 b with the increase of microwave treatment time both bound water and free water are gradually decreased mi can evaporate free water more than bound water and the ratio of bound water to free water is dramatically rising which means that the dewaterability of ssd is decreasing guo et al 2018 however mi can reduce the binding energy of bound water and increase the percentage of free water to improve dewaterability of ssd 3 2 pore structure 3 2 1 lf nmr as shown in fig 4 a the pore size in ssa and ssb are both concentrated on the range from 50 nm to 1400 nm the pore size distribution of ssa is similar with ssb as shown in fig 4 b percentage of r 0 01 pores with a radius more than 0 01 μm in ssd is higher than that in ssc it reflects that mi can change the pore structure of sludge cakes expand pore structure and provide more water drainage channels as shown in fig 4 c and d there is a stratification of water mass in the ssc and ssd the mass of water in ssc is concentrated in the inner layers 0 99 mm to 8 93 mm and that in ssd is also concentrated in the inner layers 0 99 mm to 3 98 mm furthermore the value of fractal dimension dfp characterizes to the complex of pore structure according to eq 3 dfp were calculated and shown in table 4 dfp of ssa is the same as that of ssb but the dfp of ssd is lower than ssc this means that mi can make the pore structure of sludge cake more uniform 3 2 2 sem morphology in order to study the pore structure changes of the sludge cake sem was used to observe the morphology of iss ssc ssd 1 and ssd 2 as shown in fig 5 a it can be found that there are some large particles in iss and the microstructure is loose as shown in fig 5 b after mdw ssc has a compact structure and a smooth surface of particle because of the squeeze force moreover there are very few internal pores and water flow path this indicates that mdw has a sealing effect on the pores of ssc resulting in a denser pore structure than iss as shown in fig 5 c and d under the mi condition pm 70 w tm 5 min ssd 1 has more micro pore structures on the solid surface than ssc these micropores can provide more effective water flow pathways moreover as shown in fig 5 d the microstructure of ssd 2 with the condition pm 700 w tm 5 min is rougher and the micro pore structures is more obvious than that of ssd 1 the increase of microwave power can foster the establishment of water flow path of sludge cakes pores edge detection of sludge samples is shown in the fig s1 in the supplementary material the change of pore structure of sludge particle surface can be quantitatively characterized by fractal dimension dfs as shown in fig 5 a d the dfs of iss is higher than ssc and that of ssd 1 is lower than ssd 2 moreover the gap in dfs between ssd 2 and ssc is largest the ability of mi to change the pore structure is greater than that of mdw thus mi can effectively open the micropores which is previously closed by mdw to improve the dewaterability of sludge cake 3 2 3 co2 adsorption and desorption as shown in fig 6 a and b the isotherm curves of ssc and ssd are characterized by co2 adsorption and desorption the adsorption curve indicates the relationship between the input gas volume va and the relative pressure p p 0 because of the low pressure p p 0 0 1 the main adsorption force of the pores is van der waals force the adsorption characteristics mainly show the surface characteristics of the pores therefore the dfr at low pressure calculated from the adsorption characteristics represents the roughness of the pores inside the sludge sample furthermore as shown in fig 6 c and d the dfr of ssc and ssd are 2 099 and 2 362 respectively the dfr of ssc is close to 2 which indicates that the surface of its internal pores is smooth and flat the dfr of ssd is higher indicating that the internal pore surface is rougher furthermore the increase in the surface roughness of the pores represents the removal or fracture of the surface material of the solid phase these phenomena coincide with the change of particle surface in fig 5 during the mi process the organic matter of the sludge undergoes a qualitative change because of the microwave energy and heat energy and the intuitive manifestation is that the surface roughness of the sludge is changed this is consistent with the research of mawioo et al 2017 3 3 thermal mechanisms of microwave irradiation on sludge cake the morphology of sludge cakes after mi under different treatment time and power are shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material the difference temperature δt between the surface and inside of sludge cake can clearly reflect the heating characteristics as shown in fig 7 a when microwave power is 70 w and 350 w even if the ec is increased to a high level 10 000 kj kg h2o δt is still lower than 0 the temperature of the inside is higher than the surface of sludge cake when microwave power is 535 w and 700 w under the ec is from 2000 kj kg h2o to 6000 kj kg h2o the temperature of the inside is lower than the surface of sludge cake the maximum δt can reach up to 42 4 c the process of mi heating can be considered as two steps the first is microwave energy absorption and the second is converting it to thermal energy according to eqs 8 and 9 based on the porosity in different layers of ssc the ε in different layers of sludge cake is shown in fig 7 b the ability of sludge cake to absorb microwave energy is consistent with the distribution of water mass in different layers the moisture content in the middle layer from 8th to 11st is higher than that in outer layers of sludge cake and the ability of the dipole to oscillate with microwaves is stronger so the ε is larger than that of outer layers in sludge cake the friction between adjacent dipoles is main reason for the thermal energy converting the ability to produce thermal energy mainly depends on the thermal conductivity according to eq 10 the k in different layers of ssc is shown in fig 7 c it is obvious that the k in outer layer 1st and 19th is higher than that in middle layers from 8th to 11st and the gap will increase with the reduction of sw when microwave power is 70 w and 350 w the heating process is sluggish and the water evaporation rate is reduced accordingly meanwhile sw is close to 1 which means the gap of k between outer layers and middle layers is not significant the decisive factor that determines δt is the ability to absorb microwave energy thus the internal temperature of the sludge cake is higher than the surface temperature furthermore because a large amount of microwave energy is absorbed ec of mi at low power 70 w and 350 w reaches a high level 10 000 kj kg h2o on the contrary when microwave power is 535 w and 700 w with the rapid evaporation of water sw is close to 0 the key factor is the gap of k thus δt is obvious and energy consumption maintains a low level 6000 kj kg h2o 3 4 comprehensive effect analysis of mi on moisture content reduction in order to study the comprehensive effect of mi on the reduction of sludge moisture content the initial sludge mc 83 was dewatered by mdw for a period of time until no water is removed then the microwave was applied for treating the dewatered sludge a certain time finally the sludge cake that has been treated by mi was dewatered once again by mdw to further reduce the moisture content as shown in fig 8 a and b mi can effectively reduce the moisture content of sludge for its thermal effect on impelling the water evaporation which can reduce the moisture content of 150 g municipal sludge from 68 4 to 40 1 within 5 min for 700 w microwave power when the initial mass of sludge is 250 g moisture content can be reduced from 76 8 to 59 8 the energy consumption of mi is about 4900 kj kg h2o ec of other drying methods is shown as below for instance ec of convective drying by hot air ranges from 2520 to 5040 kj kg h2o of conduction drying by thermal oil or steam is 2880 3240 kj kg h2o arlabosse et al 2014 because mi can quickly increase the temperature of sludge the evaporation rate is very fast there is similar water mass evaporated in 250 g and 150 g sludge cake for improving the evaporation efficiency of mi the thinner sludge cake should be more suitable to be treated by mi because the internal water is easier to drain and the evaporation rate is faster with thinner sludge cake in addition the water evaporation rate in different microwave power is shown in fig 8 d the evaporation rate of mi has a peak value within 5 min and the higher the microwave power the earlier the peak appears suitable microwave treatment time can improve the advantages of mi in addition mi also has a great impact on the organic matter inside the sludge vss ss in the sludge cake can represent the content of internal organic matter wu et al 2020 the detailed analysis of vss ss by mi is in the supplementary material moreover the sludge effected by microwave irradiation was dewatered again by mdw as shown in fig 8 c mi can improve dewatering performance of mdw after mi tm 5 min pm 700 w the following mdw can continuously reduce moisture content from 40 1 to 34 1 the main reason of dewatering improvement is the non thermal effect of mi owing to the improvement of the drainage pore structure and change of the moisture distribution on the one hand the great dense surface formed by the previous mechanical pressure filtration hinders the outflow of inside water of sludge cake which makes the inner water difficulty in flowing out mi carbonized the surface of sludge cakes and produced numerous new pores inside the sludge cake which will build water flow path thereby promoting the removing of water on the other hand mi can destroy the colloidal structure of sludge and changed the moisture distribution convert the bound water into free water which can be removed by mdw so as to reduce the moisture content of sludge therefore mi not only has the advantage of rapid heating speed but also can improve the dewatering performance of subsequent mdw 4 conclusion the pore structure of sludge cakes was detected synthetically by multiple methods the fractal dimensions were analyzed and compared based on different experiment condition the binding energy was detected to calculate moisture distribution thermal mechanism was revealed by dielectric constant ε and thermal conductivity k based on fractal dimension df water saturation sw and porosity in different layers of sludge cake thermal and non thermal effects mechanisms of microwave on reduction of moisture content were explored from the points as the water evaporation improvement of pore structure and reduction of bound water results showed that bound water was reduced by 19 4 df of pore structure was reduced from 2 955 to 2 867 df of pores surface roughness increased from 2 099 to 2 362 this indicated that mi could reduce the binding energy of sludge particles and moisture and make the pore structure more uniform to produce some new internal pores and water flow path which improved the dewatering performance of sludge when sw was close to 1 ε of middle and outer layers was the main factor of heating while when sw was close to 0 the main factor became the difference of k in middle and outer layers of sludge cakes moreover after mi moisture content of sludge was significantly reduced from 68 4 to 40 1 for its thermal effect further reduced to 34 1 by the continuous single mdw for its non thermal effect the present works are helpful to understand mechanism of mi on moisture content reduction and shed light on new dewatering drying integrated techniques of municipal sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15346,nanoscale particles of zero valent iron were used to form a permeable reactive barrier whose performance in dechlorinating a solution of trichloroethylene was compared with that of a barrier formed from limestone the iron was combined with kaolin by calcination the test liquid contained sewage sludge and also added nh4cl and kh2po4 the average removal rates of trichloroethylene and phosphorus over 365 days both exceeded 94 chemical oxygen demand was reduced by 92 and ammonium nitrogen by 43 6 all were significantly greater than the removals with the limestone barrier the ceramsite barrier retained 85 of its effectiveness even after 365 days of use dechloromonas sp was the main dechlorinating bacterium but its removal ability is limited the removal of trichloroethylene in such a barrier mainly depends on reduction by the zero valent iron and biodegradation the results show that the prepared ceramsite is stable and effective in removing trichloroethylene from water

leak out due to improper storage or use potentially contaminating the aquifer they substances are frequently detected in groundwater wang et al 2020 tce is one of the most widely distributed

therefore listed tce thus have been listed as priority pollutant huang et al 2014 continuous effort has been devoted to enhancing the reductive dechlorination of tce via abiotic and biotic reactions for nearly half a century one of the most widely employed materials for abiotic treatment is nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi baldermann et al 2021 gu et al 2019 lyu et al 2018 with its strong reducing

engineering application data at home and abroad and the effect is very obvious epa 1999 turner et al 2005 a group led by gillham first studied the use of zvi to degrade organic chlorine pollutants in groundwater as early as 1994 gillham and o hannesin 1994 and there are now abundant published data in 1995 sunnyvale s group first studied using a prb system for in situ remediation of chlorinated hydrocarbon pollution in groundwater creating a precedent for using prb technology to remediate organic chlorides andrew et al 2007 conca and his colleagues filled a prb with zvi as a reaction medium

carbon ac can largely inhibit the anaerobic corrosion of zvi in water while slightly increasing its dechlorination activity vogel et al 2019 techniques that conserve water improve water quality increase energy efficiency minimize toxins and waste and reduce the emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are termed green remediation today s green remediation alternatives include passive technologies such as permeable reactive barriers and monitored natural attenuation as well as in situ technologies that minimize soil and habitat disturbance naseri rad et al 2022 nwankwegu et al 2022 among them prbs are one of the most potent cost effective and sustainable technologies for treating contaminated groundwater because no groundwater extraction or electric power is required andrew et al 2007 gillham and o hannesin 1994 depending on the reactive materials used contaminants are physically chemically or biologically removed bekele et al 2019 chang et al 2022 yang et al 2019 the working principle of prb technology involves installing a wall filled with removal reactant perpendicular to the potential trajectory of contaminated groundwater flow as the contaminated plume passively migrates through the medium in response to the natural hydraulic gradient the contaminants in the plume react with the reagent leading either to their transformation into less harmful compounds or to their fixation song et al 2021 alternatively moving bed biofilm reactors are commonly used to treat wastewater however that process requires aeration to promote the growth and reproduction of the microorganisms so it is not suitable for anaerobic environments gupta et al 2022 hamedi et al 2021 the physical and chemical properties of nzvi make it an effective reactant but certain environmental factors complicate the material s practical application and the performance of a zvi prb decreases over time it loses its hydraulic effectiveness and its removal effectiveness it becomes more sensitive to ph and become more expensive to maintain he et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 smaller zvi particles should be more mobile but they tend to agglomerate through magnetic and electrostatic attraction and at nanoscale through van der waals forces and because of their high surface energy that restricts the flow paths to a few centimetres in site remediation preparing nzvi uses a large amount of some expensive reducing agent such as nabh4 and the process is complicated and time consuming with multiple centrifugation washing and drying steps wei et al 2014 yu et al 2018 moreover the potential toxicity of nzvi can be a problem in large scale applications biruck et al 2016 combining nzvi with kaolin clay may help to solve these problems since kaolin has a high ion exchange capacity and its selective adsorption is relatively ph independent kaolin is hydrophilic has proven chemical and mechanical stability and is inexpensive this study therefore prepared a kind of carbonaceous ceramsite of clay and nzvi abbreviated as k c nzvi applying published methods zhu et al 2021 microorganisms were added to stabilize the nzvi and prevent its loss that created an iron

periods shown in table 1 the key control variables were the duration the hydraulic retention time hrt and the tce concentration in the influent see table 1 the tce concentration in period iii was increased by 1 mg l every two days until it reached 20 mg l data for each period were recorded after 10 days of operation 2 3 analytical methods the water temperature and its oxidation reduction potential orp ph and dissolved oxygen content were monitored using an hq40d portable water quality analyzer hach usa iron content chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp and nh4 nitrogen were detected in accordance with chinese standards hj t 345 2007 hj t 399 2007 gb 11893 89 and hj 535 2009 using uv visible spectrophotometry the test wavelengths were 510 nm for iron 440 nm for cod 700 nm for tp and 420 nm for nh4 nitrogen the cl ion concentration was also measured using uv visible spectrophotometry zhang et al 2020a the tce concentration was determined periodically with an agilent 7890 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector coupled with an agilent 5975 mass spectrometer cheng et al 2020 lyu et al 2020 the removal rate of pollutants rr was calculated as 2 1 r r 1 c t c 0 100 where c0 and ct are the pollutant concentrations mg l initially and at time t the bet specific surface area of the limestone and k c nzvi was determined using a 3h 2000pm2 bsd china physical adsorption apparatus the limestone and k c nzvi were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy using an fei inspect f50 thermo usa and with an octane super octane energy spectrum scanner edax usa to determine their microscopic morphology the crystalline morphology of the material was analyzed using a d8 advance a25x bruker ger x ray diffractometer cai et al 2021 2 4 microbial community analysis to investigate the effects of tce on the structure of the microbial community a total of 12 samples were collected from the limestone and k c nzvi layers at the end of periods ⅱ and ⅲ each sample was collected in triplicate and the three were mixed for centrifugation 15 min at 5000 rpm and 4 c dna from the centrifuged pellets was then analyzed in triplicate using an omega bio tek soil dna kit the commonly used primer pair 338f 806r was applied in polymerase chain reactions based on 16s rrna peng et al 2021 the total dna samples were also sequenced on an illumina novaseq platform by shanghai personal biotechnology corporation in shanghai 2 5 modeling an accurate model of a prb reactor would be useful for predicting the effectiveness of degradation and the tce content of the effluent it could also be used to optimize the operating conditions provide reference information for industrial design and greatly reduce the cost of experimental testing in this study a 3 layer artificial neural network ann model was developed artificial neural networks anns have been widely used in developing new materials disease prediction predicting pollution and much elset bogard et al 2019 ma et al 2020 yu et al 2021 artificial neural network models have showed themselves able to use water quality indicators to predict effluent water quality al ghazawi and alawneh 2021 xu used an ann to predict the occurrence of trihalomethanes in water from data on the temperature ph cl2 content and uva254 absorption xu et al 2022 empirical formulas are less useful with voluminous complex data and machine learning models often can quickly generate better prediction results in this study the nh4 nitrogen cod tp dissolved oxygen ph and orp in the feedwater were the inputs and the model predicted tce concentration as its output the experimental data were divided into a training set 70 a validation set 15 and test data 15 early termination was applied to prevent the model from overfitting vu et al 2019 the structure of the artificial neural network was determined using a simulated annealing algorithm taşçı et al 2022 model fit was quantified on the basis of mean mean square error mse and r2 coefficient of determination were used to evaluate model fit aaqib et al 2021 analysis of variance was performed with the aid of version 26 0 of the spss software suite duncan s multiple range test was applied with p 0 05 as the confidence threshold for statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the fill before the experiments and after 365 days of operation the scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x ray diffractometery xrd and bet area tests were performed to characterize the limestone and k c nzvi fig 2 shows the microscopic structure of the limestone and its x ray spectra before and after the experiment the limestone surface was initially smooth mostly block like and closely connected with few voids fig 2a c with the introduction of microorganisms and pollutants the adhesion of microorganisms and the accumulation of sediment the surface of the limestone after the reaction was no longer smooth fig 2b d the eds results show that the proportion of c and o on the limestone s surface had increased by 4 64 and 10 01 respectively after the reaction fig 2e f the microorganisms attached to and grew on the limestone surface to form a biofilm during the experiment the comparable results for the k c nzvi before and after the reaction are shown in fig 3 most of the k c nzvi particles were spherical with large pores before the experiment fig 3a c afterward they were surrounded by many clustered substances but there were still many pores fig 3b d the eds results fig 3e f show that the nzvi was stable at an iron to carbon mass ratio close to 4 1 fig 4 compares the phases before and after the reaction a small amount of the limestone caco3 dissolved but otherwise there was no obvious change in the limestone s xrd results before and after the experiment fig 4a the k c nzvi was amorphous some of the c was graphitic reflected in the large envelope peak before 2θ 15 the peaks around 2θ 44 indicate the presence of fe0 after the reaction feo oh peaks appeared in the k c nzvi spectra because fe acted as a reducing agent during the treatment of the pollutants fig 4b the specific surface area results are shown in table 2 the specific surface area of the k c nzvi was greater than that of the limestone the electron micrographs show many irregular holes on the surface of the fresh k c nzvi demonstrating its large average pore size after the reaction the specific surface area was smaller for the limestone the growth of microorganisms covering the surface with biofilm was the main reason in the k c nzvi in addition to microbial coverage the formation of iron bearing precipitates was another important factor the change in specific surface area before and after the reaction was nevertheless small which may be due to the toxicity of nzvi for microorganisms reducing the biofilm coverage rónavári et al 2016 zabetakis et al 2015 3 2 long term operation 3 2 1 hydraulic performance hydraulic retention time is one of the key factors affecting the removal of pollutants in a prb system wan et al 2019 the removal during period ii is shown in table 3 the l prb data cannot be used to discuss the optimum hydraulic retention time because of its weak ability to remove pollutants relying only on the action of microorganisms with k prb when the hydraulic retention time was 2 days the cod in the effluent was 26 65 0 73 mg l and the tp concentration was 0 32 0 00 mg l those levels meet the requirements of chinese standard gb3838 2002 shorter hrt will lead to less complete degradation of pollutants longer hrt is beneficial but too long will cause inefficient processing liu et al 2020 research assessing the long term stability of pbr has generally used retention times of 1 to 3 5 days ayala parra et al 2016 mittal et al 2021 considering the system s removal and treatment efficiency two days was selected as the optimum hrt for this system 3 2 2 pollutant monitoring and evaluation fig 5 presents the overall treatment performance of both prbs in terms of tp nh4 nitrogen cod and tce removal during period ⅲ over the entire experiment the average removal of tp was 71 72 2 36 in the l prb reactor and 96 10 0 99 with k prb fig 5a the corresponding average removal rates of nh4 nitrogen were 15 19 2 29 and 43 56 1 87 respectively fig 5b the figures for cod were 13 10 1 63 and 92 04 1 39 respectively fig 5c and for tce they were 51 22 3 97 and 94 85 1 82 respectively fig 5d the removal in the k prb system was significantly higher than that in the l prb system in all cases p 0 05 using k c nzvi improved tp removal by 23 to 25 75 there has been previous research showing that chemical precipitation and microbial processes are the main mechanisms contributing to long term phosphorus removal in prb systems bali and gueddari 2019 ji et al 2020 but that biodegradation is not very effective additional phosphate can be removed by adding nzvi in this process the iron ions released by the zvi are oxidized to iron oxides fig 4 which absorb phosphate from the water in addition fe released from the zvi can stimulate several biological processes such as iron dependent autotrophic denitrification by iron reducing bacteria the overall performance of the k prb system will thus be enhanced simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus can even be achieved with zvi zhang et al 2020b in addition microorganisms can use fe iii oxide as an electron acceptor with organic matter as the electron donor for their own metabolism machala et al 2011 nh4 can be oxidized anaerobically to no3 no2 n2 and other products bao and li 2017 huang and jaffe 2015 sawayama 2006 yan et al 2015 fe0 in the k prb system generates fe3 after participating in the reaction so ferric oxidation of ammonia may be an important process in fe c systems that is why k prb removed nh4 nitrogen more effectively than the l prb system p 0 05 the removal of cod and tce in the l prb system mainly depends on microbial degradation but tce is toxic for many microorganisms the lower removal of tce in the l prb system left more residual tce in the system and the growth of microorganisms was significantly inhibited in groundwater remediation indigenous microorganisms can be activated to degrade cod and tce by means which include injecting electron donors and growth factors brahushi et al 2017 but in general there is no indigenous bacterial species that can completely eliminate cod and degrade tce the l prb system thus has limited effectiveness in the k prb system zvi can act as an electron donor for microbial degradation of tce walaszek et al 2021 at the same time the iron ions generated by zero valent iron s corrosion can remove organic matter through flocculation adsorption and co precipitation reactions wu et al 2015 that is why the removal of cod and tce by fe c was significantly better than that in the l prb system p 0 05 3 2 3 water chemistry in in situ groundwater remediation nzvi changes the water s orp and ph yu et al 2014 in the process it may generate secondary pollution in terms of high concentrations of iron ions and chloride ions the orp ph total iron ion concentration and chloride ion concentration in the prb effluent were monitored with the results shown in fig 6 the average opr in the effluent of the l prb system was 51 70 22 64 mv with k prb it was 23 30 15 57 mv fig 6a the ph of the effluent water was very similar 7 74 0 46 with the limestone and 7 27 0 14 with the k prb fig 6b during the treatment no iron was detected in the effluent of the l prb system but total soluble iron in the effluent of the k prb system averaged 0 11 0 06 mg l fig 6c those concentrations meet the requirements for drinking water ganiyu et al 2021 the cl concentrations generated by dechlorination of tce were 2 58 1 15 mg l in the l prb system and 15 08 0 57 mg l in the k prb system fig 6d the orp reflects the redox properties of substances in aqueous solutions wu et al 2020 the effluent from the l prb experiment had oxidative properties not conducive to the reduction of tce the k prb effluent showed strong reducibility which was consistent with the observed tce removal the zvi in the k prb system was reduced generating fe2 and fe3 ions some of them precipitated and remained in the prb and a part flowed out with the effluent limestone is slightly soluble in water making the effluent alkaline initially with the growth of microorganisms and the biofilm s formation the limestone no longer dissolved and the ph of the l prb effluent gradually decreased and stabilized in the neutral range the zvi in the k prb system corroded during the experiment to generate electrons and oh which precipitates iron so the ph remained in the neutral range the speciation of chlorine can be calculated based on a chlorine mass balance in the l prb system the tce degradation product removed from the system is dichloroethylene dce the resulting theoretical cl concentration generated in the dechlorination process is 2 77 mg l the average cl concentration measured in the effluent was in fact 2 58 mg l 93 of the theoretical value that suggests that the removal of tce in the l prb system is dominated by a one step dechlorination reaction with k prb tce was assumed to be completely dechlorinated to produce ethylene eth or ethane the data show that the concentration of cl reached 98 of the theoretical value based on that assumption it seems that tce was completely dechlorinated and degraded in the k prb system 3 2 4 the bacterial community the shannon index was used to evaluate community diversity and the observed species index was used to assess community richness wang et al 2022 the results are shown in fig 7 there was no significant difference in microbial diversity and richness before the treatment p 0 05 the diversity of microorganisms in the l prb system had increased significantly p 0 05 after the treatment but the richness did not change significantly in the k prb system diversity had not changed significantly after the treatment but the richness had decreased significantly p 0 05 adding tce affected the alpha diversity of microorganisms because tce s toxicity inhibited growth and reproduction mao et al 2019 biodegradation is the main pathway for tce removal in the l prb system despite tce s toxicity some indigenous microorganisms can develop resistance to it and some tce degrading bacteria can use tce as a carbon source to grow and reproduce meckenstock et al 2015 tce is degraded in this process and some secondary products are produced those secondary products perform a secondary screening of the microorganisms in the system and induce the production of new microbial strains the diversity of microorganisms in the l prb system is thus significantly increased after tce treatment the growth of microorganisms in the system is still inhibited by the toxicity however the abundance did not change significantly in the k prb system the zvi plays an important role in tce removal reductive dechlorination occurs rapidly when tce enters the system the data show that a k prb can basically achieve the complete reduction and dechlorination of tce without producing a large amount of intermediate products for the secondary screening of microorganisms the diversity of microorganisms in the k prb system therefore did not change significantly after tce treatment however due to inhibition from the tce the abundance of microorganisms in the system decreased significantly the removal of tce by zvi is an electrochemical reduction process and its reaction rate is significantly higher than that of biodegradation as a result the evolution of microorganisms in the two reactors is different and the pollutant removal effect is also different which better explains the content of section 3 2 table 4 presents the samples annotated according to sequence species taxonomy yao et al 2021 statistical analysis of the changes in microorganisms was carried out at the order family and genus levels tce s effect differed on the different taxonomic levels in the l prb system the abundance of microorganisms on each taxonomic level did not change significantly the abundances in the k prb system decreased significantly however p 0 05 that is consistent with the changing trend of the observed species index of microorganisms in the alpha diversity in each system before and after tce treatment the different filling materials in prb could selectively influence the microbial community in which beneficiary microbiota will survive and occupy the dominant states the dominant populations on each taxonomic level are shown in fig 8 the microbial community analysis is shown in tables s1 s3 of the supplementary material online on the genus level nitrospira and hydrogenophaga were associated with nh4 nitrogen removal nitrospira oxidizes nh4 to no3 under aerobic conditions while hydrogenophaga reduces no3 to n2 after tce treatment the relative abundances of nitrospira 0 05 and hydrogenophaga 0 02 in the l prb system were lower probably due to the hypoxic environment in the prb that was not conducive to the growth of nitrospira that would have eventually led to less nh4 nitrogen removal in the k prb system virtually no nitrospira were detected but the relative abundance of hydrogenophaga 0 57 was higher than with limestone this confirms the speculation about the processes removing nh4 nitrogen in the two systems in the k prb system containing zvi anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation replaced some of the microorganism nitrification weakening the anoxic oxidation of nh4 that anaerobic process is more conducive to the growth of denitrifying bacteria after treating tce dechloromonas which can dechlorinate tce were found in both systems a relative abundance of 4 74 in the l prb system and 2 64 with the zvi despite the greater relative abundance of dechloromonas the removal of tce was less in the l prb system this confirms the inferences about the different mechanisms of tce removal suggested by the alpha diversity analysis 3 3 predicting removal there have been few studies of the influence of structure on removal liang et al 2021 prediction models usually rely on empirically derived formulas research shows that this can be inaccurate and developing the necessary data is certainly time consuming some studies have even generated r2 of 0 39 and 0 41 sodanil and chatthong 2014 tiwari et al 2012 ma has shown that iterative calculations can generate better predictions ma et al 2020 this study used a simulated annealing algorithm to determine the optimal structure of an ann which used water quality variables to predict the tce content of the effluent fig 9 the resulting r2 were between 0 92 and 0 97 indicating that using water quality data can give accurate tce predictions the best predictions were for the l prb system with the best training effect achieved when the epoch was 5 an r2 of 0 97 and an mse of 0 00025 the worst predictions were for the k prb system there the best training effect was achieved when the epoch was 31 an r2 of 0 92 with an mse of 0 0109 fig s1 the prediction accuracy with both systems was 99 or better and the r2 values shown in the plots confirm that the ann predicted the observed tce removal accurately over time when the removal rate decreases to below a certain level it will be necessary to replace the medium in a prb but despite that the system tested here merits scaling up from lab scale to practical application 3 4 practical application there are three reducing agents in zvi system namely fe fe2 and h2 so there is a triple dechlorination mode however because the reduction rate of fe2 is slower than that of fe0 and because the reaction between h2 and tce must be promoted by a catalyst the main reducting dechlorination reaction is the direct redox reaction between fe0 and tce filip et al 2014 liu et al 2007 rónavári et al 2016 the dechlorination pathway and removal mechanism of tce are shown in fig 10 in the anoxic environment typical of groundwater the biodegradation of tce is mainly through step by step dechlorination which sequentially generates dichloroethylene vinyl chloride and ethylene gu et al 2017 the first step forming dce is fast but the conversion of dce to vc and then eth is very slow lihl et al 2019 when there is a lack of bacteria capable of completing the dechlorination generally only the first step generating dce can be completed pant and pant 2010 but k c nzvi combined with microorganisms can achieve complete dechlorination of tce and the final product is eth or ethane compared with other fe based materials sulfidized nanoscale zerovalent iron particles give superior long term tce degradation performance it remains at 30 to 60 of the initial rate even after 90 days xiao et al 2022 in field experiments injecting nzvi at a site successfully removed 95 7 of the tce in the groundwater in 60 days without producing chlorinated intermediates ahn et al 2021 studies have shown that the removal of tce within 25 d can reach 82 and tce will be completely degraded within 60d yuan et al 2022 but using nzvi for the remediation of tce in groundwater would be very expensive and time consuming which would seriously limit its applicability in the field in general the prepared k c nzvi material achieved good tce removal in the prb system tested it achieved almost complete dechlorination without generating secondary pollution from chlorinated intermediates compared with biodegradation the chemical reduction using zvi is more efficient and stable in addition fewer microorganisms in the system can reduce any biofilm clogging of the system efficient removal of pollutants can still be maintained during long term treatment loading the nzvi onto active carbon overcame the difficulty of dispersing nzvi in water ribas et al 2019 encapsulating the zero valent iron in kaolin could delay its oxidation adusei gyamfi and acha 2016 moreover the iron carbon electrolytic micro environment thus formed improved tce removal under hypoxic conditions the as obtained composite materials exhibited an average 94 85 removal of tce during the 365 days of the experiment these findings provide new insight into the application of nzvi in in situ groundwater remediation it is likely to be more cost effective and less environmentally disruptive than some other techniques the price makes the preparation of nzvi affordable only at the laboratory scale nzvi is available commercially for about us 5 300 ton crane and scott 2012 the total calculated cost of the k c nzvi was about us 3 000 ton section s1 but these findings should be extended to other pollutants common in groundwater 4 conclusion coupling k c nzvi with bacteria provides a sustainable remediation solution for groundwater contaminated with trichloroethylene this research has shown that the k prb system tested exhibited more complete dechlorination than the study s l prb system in the simulated remediation of tce contaminated groundwater the k prb system s average removal of tce was 94 85 for nh4 nitrogen it was 43 56 and for tp 96 10 it reduced cod by 92 04 in each case that was significantly better than the removal achieved with limestone p 0 05 with limestone biodegradation was the main tce degradation mechanism while in the k prb system it was reductive dechlorination by zvi a model for predicting pollutant concentrations using water quality indicators was defined it showed an average accuracy of 99 5 that model provides help in using a prb system to alleviate pollution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15346,nanoscale particles of zero valent iron were used to form a permeable reactive barrier whose performance in dechlorinating a solution of trichloroethylene was compared with that of a barrier formed from limestone the iron was combined with kaolin by calcination the test liquid contained sewage sludge and also added nh4cl and kh2po4 the average removal rates of trichloroethylene and phosphorus over 365 days both exceeded 94 chemical oxygen demand was reduced by 92 and ammonium nitrogen by 43 6 all were significantly greater than the removals with the limestone barrier the ceramsite barrier retained 85 of its effectiveness even after 365 days of use dechloromonas sp was the main dechlorinating bacterium but its removal ability is limited the removal of trichloroethylene in such a barrier mainly depends on reduction by the zero valent iron and biodegradation the results show that the prepared ceramsite is stable and effective in removing trichloroethylene from water it is a promising in situ remediation material for groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zero valent iron coupled microorganisms permeable reactive barriers trichloroethene artificial neural networks groundwater purification data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction chlorinated organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls benzene hexachloride perchloroethene and trichloroethene tce are commonly found in pesticides and in industrial cleaning solutions li et al 2020 in industrial applications these chemical may leak out due to improper storage or use potentially contaminating the aquifer they substances are frequently detected in groundwater wang et al 2020 tce is one of the most widely distributed chlorinated organics in aquatic environments jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2020 it can seriously threaten public health and ecosystems lorenzo et al 2021 yang et al 2021 in china tce is one of the most frequently detected volatile pollutants in soil the atmosphere and groundwater he et al 2013 kranzioch et al 2013 song et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 china s ministry of environmental protection has therefore listed tce thus have been listed as priority pollutant huang et al 2014 continuous effort has been devoted to enhancing the reductive dechlorination of tce via abiotic and biotic reactions for nearly half a century one of the most widely employed materials for abiotic treatment is nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi baldermann et al 2021 gu et al 2019 lyu et al 2018 with its strong reducing ability e0 0 44v and high reactivity phenrat and kumloet 2016 on the removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons by zero valent iron permeable reactive barrier prb there are abundant experimental research and engineering application data at home and abroad and the effect is very obvious epa 1999 turner et al 2005 a group led by gillham first studied the use of zvi to degrade organic chlorine pollutants in groundwater as early as 1994 gillham and o hannesin 1994 and there are now abundant published data in 1995 sunnyvale s group first studied using a prb system for in situ remediation of chlorinated hydrocarbon pollution in groundwater creating a precedent for using prb technology to remediate organic chlorides andrew et al 2007 conca and his colleagues filled a prb with zvi as a reaction medium for in situ soil remediation and showed that using zvi as a medium can effectively remove tce from soil conca and wright 2006 when zvi is surrounded by carbon iron nanostructures embedded in activated carbon ac can largely inhibit the anaerobic corrosion of zvi in water while slightly increasing its dechlorination activity vogel et al 2019 techniques that conserve water improve water quality increase energy efficiency minimize toxins and waste and reduce the emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are termed green remediation today s green remediation alternatives include passive technologies such as permeable reactive barriers and monitored natural attenuation as well as in situ technologies that minimize soil and habitat disturbance naseri rad et al 2022 nwankwegu et al 2022 among them prbs are one of the most potent cost effective and sustainable technologies for treating contaminated groundwater because no groundwater extraction or electric power is required andrew et al 2007 gillham and o hannesin 1994 depending on the reactive materials used contaminants are physically chemically or biologically removed bekele et al 2019 chang et al 2022 yang et al 2019 the working principle of prb technology involves installing a wall filled with removal reactant perpendicular to the potential trajectory of contaminated groundwater flow as the contaminated plume passively migrates through the medium in response to the natural hydraulic gradient the contaminants in the plume react with the reagent leading either to their transformation into less harmful compounds or to their fixation song et al 2021 alternatively moving bed biofilm reactors are commonly used to treat wastewater however that process requires aeration to promote the growth and reproduction of the microorganisms so it is not suitable for anaerobic environments gupta et al 2022 hamedi et al 2021 the physical and chemical properties of nzvi make it an effective reactant but certain environmental factors complicate the material s practical application and the performance of a zvi prb decreases over time it loses its hydraulic effectiveness and its removal effectiveness it becomes more sensitive to ph and become more expensive to maintain he et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 smaller zvi particles should be more mobile but they tend to agglomerate through magnetic and electrostatic attraction and at nanoscale through van der waals forces and because of their high surface energy that restricts the flow paths to a few centimetres in site remediation preparing nzvi uses a large amount of some expensive reducing agent such as nabh4 and the process is complicated and time consuming with multiple centrifugation washing and drying steps wei et al 2014 yu et al 2018 moreover the potential toxicity of nzvi can be a problem in large scale applications biruck et al 2016 combining nzvi with kaolin clay may help to solve these problems since kaolin has a high ion exchange capacity and its selective adsorption is relatively ph independent kaolin is hydrophilic has proven chemical and mechanical stability and is inexpensive this study therefore prepared a kind of carbonaceous ceramsite of clay and nzvi abbreviated as k c nzvi applying published methods zhu et al 2021 microorganisms were added to stabilize the nzvi and prevent its loss that created an iron carbon micro electrolysis system combined with activated carbon used in a prb the prepared material was tested for its ability to achieve effective long term removal of pollutants 2 materials and

calcination time of 0 5 h zhu et al 2021 activated sludge was collected from a secondary sedimentation tank at a wastewater treatment plant in guilin china the mixed liquor held approximately 10 g l of suspended solids glucose nh4cl and kh2po4 were added to create synthetic wastewater its ph was adjusted to 7 4 0 3 and it was then stored at 10 c ahn et al 2016 wu et al 2021 2 2 the permeable

shanghai personal biotechnology corporation in shanghai 2 5 modeling an accurate model of a prb reactor would be useful for predicting the effectiveness of degradation and the tce content of the

data and machine learning models often can quickly generate better prediction results in this study the nh4 nitrogen cod tp dissolved oxygen ph and orp in the feedwater were the inputs and the model predicted tce concentration as its output the experimental data were divided into a training set 70 a validation set 15 and test data 15 early termination was applied to prevent the model from overfitting vu et al 2019 the structure of the artificial neural network was determined using a simulated annealing algorithm taşçı et al 2022 model fit was quantified on the basis of mean mean square error mse and r2 coefficient of determination were used to evaluate model fit aaqib et al 2021 analysis of variance was performed with the aid of version 26 0 of the spss software suite duncan s multiple range test was applied with p 0 05 as the confidence threshold for statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the fill before the experiments and after 365 days of operation the scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x ray diffractometery xrd and bet area tests were performed to characterize the limestone and k c nzvi fig 2 shows the microscopic structure of the limestone and its x ray spectra before and after the experiment the limestone surface was initially smooth mostly block like and closely connected with few voids fig 2a c with the introduction of microorganisms and pollutants the adhesion of microorganisms and the accumulation of sediment the surface of the limestone after the reaction was no longer smooth fig 2b d the eds results show that the proportion of c and o on the limestone s surface had increased by 4 64 and 10 01 respectively after the reaction fig 2e f the microorganisms attached to and grew on the limestone surface to form a biofilm during the experiment the comparable results for the k c nzvi before and after the reaction are shown in fig 3 most of the k c nzvi particles were spherical with large pores before the experiment fig 3a c afterward they were surrounded by many clustered substances but there were still many pores fig 3b d the eds results fig 3e f show that the nzvi was stable at an iron to carbon mass ratio close to 4 1 fig 4 compares the phases before and after the reaction a small amount of the limestone caco3 dissolved but otherwise there was no obvious change in the limestone s xrd results before and after the experiment fig 4a the k c nzvi was amorphous some of the c was graphitic reflected in the large envelope peak before 2θ 15 the peaks around 2θ 44 indicate the presence of fe0 after the reaction feo oh peaks appeared in the k c nzvi spectra because fe acted as a reducing agent during the treatment of the pollutants fig 4b the specific surface area results are shown in table 2 the specific surface area of the k c nzvi was greater than that of the limestone the electron micrographs show many irregular holes on the surface of the fresh k c nzvi demonstrating its large average pore size after the reaction the specific surface area was smaller for the limestone the growth of microorganisms covering the surface with biofilm was the main reason in the k c nzvi in addition to microbial coverage the formation of iron bearing precipitates was another important factor the change in specific surface area before and after the reaction was nevertheless small which may be due to the toxicity of nzvi for microorganisms reducing the biofilm coverage rónavári et al 2016 zabetakis et al 2015 3 2 long term operation 3 2 1 hydraulic performance hydraulic retention time is one of the key factors affecting the removal of pollutants in a prb system wan et al 2019 the removal during period ii is shown in table 3 the l prb data cannot be used to discuss the optimum hydraulic retention time because of its weak ability to remove pollutants relying only on the action of microorganisms with k prb when the hydraulic retention time was 2 days the cod in the effluent was 26 65 0 73 mg l and the tp concentration was 0 32 0 00 mg l those levels meet the requirements of chinese standard gb3838 2002 shorter hrt will lead to less complete degradation of pollutants longer hrt is beneficial but too long will cause inefficient processing liu et al 2020 research assessing the long term stability of pbr has generally used retention times of 1 to 3 5 days ayala parra et al 2016 mittal et al 2021 considering the system s removal and treatment efficiency two days was selected as the optimum hrt for this system 3 2 2 pollutant monitoring and evaluation fig 5 presents the overall treatment performance of both prbs in terms of tp nh4 nitrogen cod and tce removal during period ⅲ over the entire experiment the average removal of tp was 71 72 2 36 in the l prb reactor and 96 10 0 99 with k prb fig 5a the corresponding average removal rates of nh4 nitrogen were 15 19 2 29 and 43 56 1 87 respectively fig 5b the figures for cod were 13 10 1 63 and 92 04 1 39 respectively fig 5c and for tce they were 51 22 3 97 and 94 85 1 82 respectively fig 5d the removal in the k prb system was significantly higher than that in the l prb system in all cases p 0 05 using k c nzvi improved tp removal by 23 to 25 75 there has been previous research showing that chemical precipitation and microbial processes are the main mechanisms contributing to long term phosphorus removal in prb systems bali and gueddari 2019 ji et al 2020 but that biodegradation is not very effective additional phosphate can be removed by adding nzvi in this process the iron ions released by the zvi are oxidized to iron oxides fig 4 which absorb phosphate from the water in addition fe released from the zvi can stimulate several biological processes such as iron dependent autotrophic denitrification by iron reducing bacteria the overall performance of the k prb system will thus be enhanced simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus can even be achieved with zvi zhang et al 2020b in addition microorganisms can use fe iii oxide as an electron acceptor with organic matter as the electron donor for their own metabolism machala et al 2011 nh4 can be oxidized anaerobically to no3 no2 n2 and other products bao and li 2017 huang and jaffe 2015 sawayama 2006 yan et al 2015 fe0 in the k prb system generates fe3 after participating in the reaction so ferric oxidation of ammonia may be an important process in fe c systems that is why k prb removed nh4 nitrogen more effectively than the l prb system p 0 05 the removal of cod and tce in the l prb system mainly depends on microbial degradation but tce is toxic for many microorganisms the lower removal of tce in the l prb system left more residual tce in the system and the growth of microorganisms was significantly inhibited in groundwater remediation indigenous microorganisms can be activated to degrade cod and tce by means which include injecting electron donors and growth factors brahushi et al 2017 but in general there is no indigenous bacterial species that can completely eliminate cod and degrade tce the l prb system thus has limited effectiveness in the k prb system zvi can act as an electron donor for microbial degradation of tce walaszek et al 2021 at the same time the iron ions generated by zero valent iron s corrosion can remove organic matter through flocculation adsorption and co precipitation reactions wu et al 2015 that is why the removal of cod and tce by fe c was significantly better than that in the l prb system p 0 05 3 2 3 water chemistry in in situ groundwater remediation nzvi changes the water s orp and ph yu et al 2014 in the process it may generate secondary pollution in terms of high concentrations of iron ions and chloride ions the orp ph total iron ion concentration and chloride ion concentration in the prb effluent were monitored with the results shown in fig 6 the average opr in the effluent of the l prb system was 51 70 22 64 mv with k prb it was 23 30 15 57 mv fig 6a the ph of the effluent water was very similar 7 74 0 46 with the limestone and 7 27 0 14 with the k prb fig 6b during the treatment no iron was detected in the effluent of the l prb system but total soluble iron in the effluent of the k prb system averaged 0 11 0 06 mg l fig 6c those concentrations meet the requirements for drinking water ganiyu et al 2021 the cl concentrations generated by dechlorination of tce were 2 58 1 15 mg l in the l prb system and 15 08 0 57 mg l in the k prb system fig 6d the orp reflects the redox properties of substances in aqueous solutions wu et al 2020 the effluent from the l prb experiment had oxidative properties not conducive to the reduction of tce the k prb effluent showed strong reducibility which was consistent with the observed tce removal the zvi in the k prb system was reduced generating fe2 and fe3 ions some of them precipitated and remained in the prb and a part flowed out with the effluent limestone is slightly soluble in water making the effluent alkaline initially with the growth of microorganisms and the biofilm s formation the limestone no longer dissolved and the ph of the l prb effluent gradually decreased and stabilized in the neutral range the zvi in the k prb system corroded during the experiment to generate electrons and oh which precipitates iron so the ph remained in the neutral range the speciation of chlorine can be calculated based on a chlorine mass balance in the l prb system the tce degradation product removed from the system is dichloroethylene dce the resulting theoretical cl concentration generated in the dechlorination process is 2 77 mg l the average cl concentration measured in the effluent was in fact 2 58 mg l 93 of the theoretical value that suggests that the removal of tce in the l prb system is dominated by a one step dechlorination reaction with k prb tce was assumed to be completely dechlorinated to produce ethylene eth or ethane the data show that the concentration of cl reached 98 of the theoretical value based on that assumption it seems that tce was completely dechlorinated and degraded in the k prb system 3 2 4 the bacterial community the shannon index was used to evaluate community diversity and the observed species index was used to assess community richness wang et al 2022 the results are shown in fig 7 there was no significant difference in microbial diversity and richness before the treatment p 0 05 the diversity of microorganisms in the l prb system had increased significantly p 0 05 after the treatment but the richness did not change significantly in the k prb system diversity had not changed significantly after the treatment but the richness had decreased significantly p 0 05 adding tce affected the alpha diversity of microorganisms because tce s toxicity inhibited growth and reproduction mao et al 2019 biodegradation is the main pathway for tce removal in the l prb system despite tce s toxicity some indigenous microorganisms can develop resistance to it and some tce degrading bacteria can use tce as a carbon source to grow and reproduce meckenstock et al 2015 tce is degraded in this process and some secondary products are produced those secondary products perform a secondary screening of the microorganisms in the system and induce the production of new microbial strains the diversity of microorganisms in the l prb system is thus significantly increased after tce treatment the growth of microorganisms in the system is still inhibited by the toxicity however the abundance did not change significantly in the k prb system the zvi plays an important role in tce removal reductive dechlorination occurs rapidly when tce enters the system the data show that a k prb can basically achieve the complete reduction and dechlorination of tce without producing a large amount of intermediate products for the secondary screening of microorganisms the diversity of microorganisms in the k prb system therefore did not change significantly after tce treatment however due to inhibition from the tce the abundance of microorganisms in the system decreased significantly the removal of tce by zvi is an electrochemical reduction process and its reaction rate is significantly higher than that of biodegradation as a result the evolution of microorganisms in the two reactors is different and the pollutant removal effect is also different which better explains the content of section 3 2 table 4 presents the samples annotated according to sequence species taxonomy yao et al 2021 statistical analysis of the changes in microorganisms was carried out at the order family and genus levels tce s effect differed on the different taxonomic levels in the l prb system the abundance of microorganisms on each taxonomic level did not change significantly the abundances in the k prb system decreased significantly however p 0 05 that is consistent with the changing trend of the observed species index of microorganisms in the alpha diversity in each system before and after tce treatment the different filling materials in prb could selectively influence the microbial community in which beneficiary microbiota will survive and occupy the dominant states the dominant populations on each taxonomic level are shown in fig 8 the microbial community analysis is shown in tables s1 s3 of the supplementary material online on the genus level nitrospira and hydrogenophaga were associated with nh4 nitrogen removal nitrospira oxidizes nh4 to no3 under aerobic conditions while hydrogenophaga reduces no3 to n2 after tce treatment the relative abundances of nitrospira 0 05 and hydrogenophaga 0 02 in the l prb system were lower probably due to the hypoxic environment in the prb that was not conducive to the growth of nitrospira that would have eventually led to less nh4 nitrogen removal in the k prb system virtually no nitrospira were detected but the relative abundance of hydrogenophaga 0 57 was higher than with limestone this confirms the speculation about the processes removing nh4 nitrogen in the two systems in the k prb system containing zvi anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation replaced some of the microorganism nitrification weakening the anoxic oxidation of nh4 that anaerobic process is more conducive to the growth of denitrifying bacteria after treating tce dechloromonas which can dechlorinate tce were found in both systems a relative abundance of 4 74 in the l prb system and 2 64 with the zvi despite the greater relative abundance of dechloromonas the removal of tce was less in the l prb system this confirms the inferences about the different mechanisms of tce removal suggested by the alpha diversity analysis 3 3 predicting removal there have been few studies of the influence of structure on removal liang et al 2021 prediction models usually rely on empirically derived formulas research shows that this can be inaccurate and developing the necessary data is certainly time consuming some studies have even generated r2 of 0 39 and 0 41 sodanil and chatthong 2014 tiwari et al 2012 ma has shown that iterative calculations can generate better predictions ma et al 2020 this study used a simulated annealing algorithm to determine the optimal structure of an ann which used water quality variables to predict the tce content of the effluent fig 9 the resulting r2 were between 0 92 and 0 97 indicating that using water quality data can give accurate tce predictions the best predictions were for the l prb system with the best training effect achieved when the epoch was 5 an r2 of 0 97 and an mse of 0 00025 the worst predictions were for the k prb system there the best training effect was achieved when the epoch was 31 an r2 of 0 92 with an mse of 0 0109 fig s1 the prediction accuracy with both systems was 99 or better and the r2 values shown in the plots confirm that the ann predicted the observed tce removal accurately over time when the removal rate decreases to below a certain level it will be necessary to replace the medium in a prb but despite that the system tested here merits scaling up from lab scale to practical application 3 4 practical application there are three reducing agents in zvi system namely fe fe2 and h2 so there is a triple dechlorination mode however because the reduction rate of fe2 is slower than that of fe0 and because the reaction between h2 and tce must be promoted by a catalyst the main reducting dechlorination reaction is the direct redox reaction between fe0 and tce filip et al 2014 liu et al 2007 rónavári et al 2016 the dechlorination pathway and removal mechanism of tce are shown in fig 10 in the anoxic environment typical of groundwater the biodegradation of tce is mainly through step by step dechlorination which sequentially generates dichloroethylene vinyl chloride and ethylene gu et al 2017 the first step forming dce is fast but the conversion of dce to vc and then eth is very slow lihl et al 2019 when there is a lack of bacteria capable of completing the dechlorination generally only the first step generating dce can be completed pant and pant 2010 but k c nzvi combined with microorganisms can achieve complete dechlorination of tce and the final product is eth or ethane compared with other fe based materials sulfidized nanoscale zerovalent iron particles give superior long term tce degradation performance it remains at 30 to 60 of the initial rate even after 90 days xiao et al 2022 in field experiments injecting nzvi at a site successfully removed 95 7 of the tce in the groundwater in 60 days without producing chlorinated intermediates ahn et al 2021 studies have shown that the removal of tce within 25 d can reach 82 and tce will be completely degraded within 60d yuan et al 2022 but using nzvi for the remediation of tce in groundwater would be very expensive and time consuming which would seriously limit its applicability in the field in general the prepared k c nzvi material achieved good tce removal in the prb system tested it achieved almost complete dechlorination without generating secondary pollution from chlorinated intermediates compared with biodegradation the chemical reduction using zvi is more efficient and stable in addition fewer microorganisms in the system can reduce any biofilm clogging of the system efficient removal of pollutants can still be maintained during long term treatment loading the nzvi onto active carbon overcame the difficulty of dispersing nzvi in water ribas et al 2019 encapsulating the zero valent iron in kaolin could delay its oxidation adusei gyamfi and acha 2016 moreover the iron carbon electrolytic micro environment thus formed improved tce removal under hypoxic conditions the as obtained composite materials exhibited an average 94 85 removal of tce during the 365 days of the experiment these findings provide new insight into the application of nzvi in in situ groundwater remediation it is likely to be more cost effective and less environmentally disruptive than some other techniques the price makes the preparation of nzvi affordable only at the laboratory scale nzvi is available commercially for about us 5 300 ton crane and scott 2012 the total calculated cost of the k c nzvi was about us 3 000 ton section s1 but these findings should be extended to other pollutants common in groundwater 4 conclusion coupling k c nzvi with bacteria provides a sustainable remediation solution for groundwater contaminated with trichloroethylene this research has shown that the k prb system tested exhibited more complete dechlorination than the study s l prb system in the simulated remediation of tce contaminated groundwater the k prb system s average removal of tce was 94 85 for nh4 nitrogen it was 43 56 and for tp 96 10 it reduced cod by 92 04 in each case that was significantly better than the removal achieved with limestone p 0 05 with limestone biodegradation was the main tce degradation mechanism while in the k prb system it was reductive dechlorination by zvi a model for predicting pollutant concentrations using water quality indicators was defined it showed an average accuracy of 99 5 that model provides help in using a prb system to alleviate pollution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15347,iron and manganese contamination in the surface water is posing great challenges to the drinking water treatment supply especially in the complex cases of organics involvement gravity driven membrane gdm filtration equipped with the dual functions of ultrafiltration and biocake layer conferred promising potentials in the removals of iron and manganese this study evaluated the effects of organics concentrations on the removal performance of iron and manganese as well as on the flux stabilization during gdm long term filtration the results indicated that stable flux level and the removal efficiency of manganese initially increased with the increase of organics concentration in the feed water and then decreased the moderate concentration of organic compounds in the feed water would positively facilitate the microbial activities and benefit to engineering a heterogeneous and porous biocake layer on the membrane surface contributing to the highest improvements of stable flux 6 3 l m 2 h 1 while high concentration of organic compounds in the feed water would result in the increase in the thickness and eps concentration of the biocake layer leading to a flux reduction furthermore the moderate concentration of organic compounds in the feed water was also beneficial to the manganese removal 94 6 due to the more accumulation of auto catalytic oxidation manganese oxides mnox within the biocake layer and the improved biological degradation however further increase of organics concentration would deliver a negative impact on the manganese removal owing to the wrapping of mnox by the organic substances overall these findings provide practical and acceptable strategies to the selections of pre treatments prior to gdm and promote its extensive application in treating the iron and manganese containing surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity driven membrane gdm organics concentration biocake layer flux stabilization manganese removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently ever increasing attention are paid to the problem of manganese contamination in the surface water hoyland et al 2014 tian et al 2019 trueman et al 2019 the conventional drinking treatment process e g coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection could not effectively diminish the manganese contaminants resulting in the increasing risks of manganese contamination in the drinking water ultrafiltration uf possessing both the high water productivity and the effective rejection capability for particles colloids macromolecular organic matters bacteria giardia and cryptosporidium could meet the ever increasing requirements of high quality water supply xing et al 2019 zhu et al 2022 however the conventional uf process could not effectively remove the dissolved manganese due to its much larger membrane pore size than the size of manganese contaminants accounting to less than 10 of manganese removal choo et al 2007 furthermore the presence of manganese would cause severe membrane pore blocking and reduce the water production of uf process a novel uf technology gravity driven membrane gdm filtration developed by eawag could be operated continuously without any pretreatments aeration cross flow backwash and chemical cleaning and the membrane flux could be stabilized at a level of 4 8 l m 2 h 1 under an ultra low gravitational driven pressure of 2 7 kpa peter varbanets et al 2010 pronk et al 2019 as a consequence the gdm process achieved the inherent advantages of simple operation low maintenance and low energy consumption during long term filtration a biocake layer would be gradually formed on the membrane surface and the flux stabilization and stable flux level of gdm process were mainly affected by the structure and biochemical composition of the biocake layer derlon et al 2013 tang et al 2018a the more heterogeneous structures and less eps concentration of the biocake layer were the higher stable flux of gdm would be achieved furthermore the biocake layer formed on the membrane surface also endowed the gdm process with an excellent pre filtration capability and can significantly enhance the removal performance of contaminants derlon et al 2014 chen et al 2021 indicated that gdm system obtained an excellent removal performance of doc and nh4 n with average removal efficiency of approximately 24 and 91 respectively owing to the biocake layer formation interestingly based on the identification of manganese removal in the manganese containing groundwater through the auto catalytic oxidation mnox film it was found that the biocake layer attached on the membrane surface of gdm appeared full of resemblance to the mnox film which sparked the innovative idea using gdm to treat the manganese containing water resource supportively a previous study validated the feasibility of gdm process in treating the iron and manganese containing surface water and indicated that both iron and manganese were effectively diminished with an average removal efficiency of 90 and 58 respectively tang et al 2020 importantly the flux level of gdm process could remain stabilized during long term filtration in treating the manganese containing surface water and obtain a similar flux level 7 9 l m 2 h 1 compared with the gdm control in treating the water without manganese indicating that the presence of manganese would not significantly influence the flux level of gdm process which was significantly different from the conventional uf process tang et al 2020 another study further indicated that during the treatment of manganese containing surface water by gdm process the generated manganese oxides would be rejected on the membrane surface and benefit the formation of heterogeneous structures of biocake layer even contributing to achieving a higher stable flux level tang et al 2021b a further study even reported that pre coating mnox particles on the membrane surface of gdm could significantly enhance the removal efficiency of manganese and ammonia tang et al 2021a with respect to the mechanism of manganese removal it was reported that auto catalytic oxidation by the mnox served the fundamental role in the manganese removal during the treatment of manganese containing groundwater by gdm process however in the treatment of surface water the mechanism of manganese removal by gdm process was not systematically investigated yet in addition organic contamination was the main characteristics of the surface water and the concentrations of organic compounds in different regions differed significantly on the one hand the high concentration of organic compounds in the feed water would facilitate the increase in the thickness density and homogeneity of biocake layer attached on the membrane surface resulting in severe flux decline during the gdm long term filtration a gdm study in treating the surface water indicated that decreasing the concentration of doc by 50 70 would correspondingly contribute to an increase of stable flux from 2 l m 2 h 1 to 6 l m 2 h 1 tang et al 2018b other studies also indicated that the organic substances served an important role in the growth and activity of microbes which was beneficial to the formation of heterogeneous biocake layer chomiak et al 2015 wu et al 2017 on the other hand previous studies indicated that the presence of organics in the feed water would negatively influence the manganese removal cheng et al 2017 cheng et al 2020 potgieter et al 2005 however there was no report on the special roles of organic compounds on manganese removal in gdm filtration how the organics iron and manganese were simultaneously removed by gdm and how the iron manganese and organic substances influence the flux stabilization of gdm system required further investigation therefore the treatment of iron and manganese containing surface water with different concentrations of organic compounds using gdm process was investigated the effects of different concentrations of organic compounds on the flux development stabilized flux level iron and manganese removal nh4 n and organics removal were evaluated the structure composition and microbial community of the biocake layer were characterized with expects to estimate the mechanism of flux stabilization and pollutants removal in the co presence of organics and manganese the iron and manganese oxides were comprehensively analyzed to further elucidate the mechanism of manganese removal in gdm system this study was expected to provide a deep insight into gdm technique in treating iron and manganese containing surface water 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of feed water the four types of simulated iron and manganese containing surface water with different concentrations of organic compounds were prepared as follows the tap water was dechlorinated by aeration for 12 h and was defined as the feed water control then the pre filtered domestic wastewater was diluted using dechlorinated tap water with the ratios of 1 40 1 20 and 1 10 and such types of synthesized feed water were defined as low organics concentration feed water medium organics concentration feed water and high organics concentration feed water respectively finally the fecl2 and mncl2 were added to the four prepared feed water types the feed water was renewed daily thus the four lines of gdm system were mounted to treat the iron and manganese containing feed water with different organic concentration and the corresponding gdm systems were defined as gdm 1 gdm 2 gdm 3 and gdm 4 respectively the detailed characteristics of feed water are listed in table 1 and the water temperature was controlled at 20 1 c 2 2 experiment setup as shown in fig 1 the bench scale gdm system was mounted with feed water tank constant feed water sealed membrane modules water collection bottles and tubes the feed water gravitationally flowed into the constant water tank and sealed membrane module from the feed water tank the distance between the membrane module and the water level of feed water tank was 70 cm to generate a gravity driven pressure of 7 kpa the membrane permeate was collected using a permeate collection bottle for further flux quantification and water quality characterization the polyethersulfone pes flat sheet uf membrane up150 wiesbaden germany with nominal molecular weight cut off of 150 kda was adopted and the effective filtration area was 0 00768 m2 initially all the pes uf membranes were immersed into the naclo solution 10 mg l for 1 5 h with the assistance of a magnetic stirrer after that the membrane was rinsed by the ultrapure water for 3 times to remove the residual naclo solution subsequently the membrane was soaked into the ultrapure water for 24 h renewed every 8 h for each gdm line at least four same membrane modules were performed in parallel during the long term experiment 2 3 characterization of biocake layer attached on the membrane surface 2 3 1 morphology and structure of biocake layer the stereomicroscope olympus c 7070 germany was used to capture images of the morphology of biocake layer in order to in site visualize the cross section structure and 3d structures of biocake layer the optical coherence tomography oct thorlabs gmbh germany was employed at a central light source wavelength of 930 nm at the end of filtration experiment the iron and manganese elements in biocake layer were inspected by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250xi usa and the micro structure of biocake layer was visualized by a scanning electron microscope sem quanta 200feg usa the details can be found in the supplementary information si 2 3 2 microbial communities and compositions of biocake layer at the end of the gdm filtration the bacterial and eukaryotic communities were measured with 16s rrna and 18s rrna pyrosequencing technology respectively the extracellular polymeric substance eps accumulated within the biocake layer and deposited in the membrane pores was extracted and described as the soluble microbial products smps ex epss accumulated in biocake layer and in epss deposited in membrane pores the concentrations of eps in terms of the polysaccharides and protein were determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method and lowry protein assay kit method respectively the atp concentration was measured to identify the biological activity within the biocake layer an atp colouring agent of bactiter glo promega corporation usa and luminometer detector glomax turner biosystems sunnyvale usa be used to quantify the atp distribution in biocake layer the details about the water quality analyze sample preparation and microbial detection were provided in si 3 results and discussions 3 1 flux variation four lines of gdm system under the different conditions of organics concentration in the feed water were continuously operated for 75 days without any cleaning procedures fig 2 a b presents the flux and resistance variations of each gdm line and both could be divided into three stages in stage ⅰ 0 10 days a rapid decline of flux was observed owing to the severe accumulation of pollutants on membrane surface during the initial filtration the flux of gdm 1 gdm 2 gdm 3 and gdm 4 decreased from 43 0 l m 2 h 1 33 1 l m 2 h 1 26 1 l m 2 h 1 and 21 2 l m 2 h 1 to 9 4 l m 2 h 1 6 8 l m 2 h 1 5 8 l m 2 h 1 and 4 94 l m 2 h 1 respectively it was found that gdm 1 with the lowest concentration of organic substances exhibited the highest initial flux during the initial 10 day filtration while gdm 4 with the highest concentration of organics exerted the lowest initial flux and the highest rate of flux decline during stage ⅱ 11 40 days the flux tended to reach a stable stage with the features of flux decreasing slightly and gradually leveling off as shown in fig 2 c the stable fluxes of gdm 1 4 were 6 9 l m 2h 1 6 0 l m 2h 1 5 6 l m 2h 1 4 5 l m 2h 1 respectively which was positively in correlation with the concentration of organic compounds in the feed water nevertheless during stage ⅲ 41 80 days flux fluctuations were observed in gdm 2 4 and their average membrane flux also increased to a certain degree in contrast the flux of gdm 1 always remained constant without any significant fluctuations during this stage the flux levels of gdm 1 4 were 5 1 l m 2h 1 6 3 l m 2h 1 6 2 l m 2h 1 5 0 l m 2h 1 respectively and the details can be found in fig 2 d the flux of gdm 2 3 with higher concentrations of organic compounds in the feed water was higher than gdm 1 with lower organic concentration which was obviously against the scenario of conventional uf process and the advisable increase of organic substances in the feed water would facilitate the membrane fouling alleviation and flux improvements previous studies indicated the biological activity played a fundamental role in the flux stabilization and enhancing the biological activity would benefit to engineering a heterogeneous porous and rough structure of biocake layer to obtain a higher stable flux level chen et al 2021 an explanations attribute to the organic compounds was its added in feed water would serve as the carbon nutrients for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms to enhance the biological activity within the biocake layer in this study a more heterogeneous structure of biocake layer was also found in gdm 2 3 than the fact in gdm 1 and the details can be found in figs 5 and s1 2 besides the enhanced biological activity in the biocake layer would positively facilitate the biological hydrolysis of organic foulants deposited on the membrane surface to further alleviate the membrane fouling in terms of gdm 1 its relatively lower stable flux level was mainly due to the insufficiency of microbial activities and inorganic substances which would serve as the frameworks of heterogeneous biocake layer formation and the formation of dense biocake layer also verified it fig 5 3 2 removal of iron and manganese the effects of different organics concentrations on the removal of iron and manganese were investigated as illustrated in fig 3 it was found that all the gdm systems could efficiently eliminate the iron contaminants even during the initial filtration as shown in fig 3 a and the iron concentration in permeate could be reduced to less than 0 3 mg l in fig 3 b the removal rate of iron in gdm 1 4 after flux stabilization reached 93 4 94 5 93 9 and 94 2 respectively which illuminated that the organic compounds just conferred limited impacts on the removal of iron the manganese removal of four gdm lines is illustrated in fig 3 c d during the initial filtration the deduction of manganese in all gdm systems was negligible unlike the scenario of iron removal since the dissolved manganese contaminants were difficult to be directly oxidized by dissolved oxygen and would easily penetrate through the gdm system due to its smaller hydrated diameter than uf membrane pore size on day 5 30 as displayed in fig 3 c the concentrations of manganese in the gdm 2 4 gradually decreased relative to the feed water which indicated that manganese removal capability was progressively generated by contrast in gdm 1 the manganese concentration in the feed water was equaled to the membrane permeate and the manganese removal efficiency was less than 10 such results demonstrated that adding organic compounds into the feed water conduced to the generation of manganese removal capacity by gdm process supportively it was found that the manganese removal efficiencies of gdm 3 and gdm 4 were higher than that in gdm 1 and gdm 2 during the filtration stage of 5 30 days the explanation should be that the manganese tended to form large compound pollutants with organics by mutual interaction e g complexation adsorption cross linking which could be rejected by the uf membrane with the filtration further extending the manganese concentration in membrane permeates of the four gdm systems decreased ongoingly indicating that the capacity of manganese removal developed even in gdm 1 without the extra addition of organic compounds however the obvious difference in manganese removal efficiency among the four gdm systems was observed gdm 2 and gdm 3 conferred the highest removal efficiency of manganese and remained steady after 30 days both with manganese concentration in permeate less than 0 1 mg l and conferring manganese removal rates of approximately 94 6 and 94 9 respectively by contrast gdm 1 and gdm 4 conferred a relatively lower manganese removal with manganese removal rates of approximately 45 5 and 67 3 respectively such results indicated that the concentration of organic compounds played a fundamental role in the manganese removal performance the too low or too high concentrations of organics in the feed water were not beneficial to the rapid formation of manganese removal capability 3 3 removal of nh4 n and organics compounds the removals of nh4 n doc and fluorescent components were evaluated after flux stabilization as shown in fig 4 a the nh4 n concentration in the permeate of gdm 1 4 was significantly lower than their feed water with average removal rates of 80 3 94 5 95 8 and 95 1 respectively interestingly gdm 1 with the lowest concentration of organic compounds in the feed water exhibited the lowest removal rate of nh4 n than gdm 2 4 systems this result was related to the fact that nh4 n removal was mainly attributed to the biological nitrification process and the limited organics content would negatively impact biological degradation within the biocake layer supportively the 16s rna high throughput sequencing results further proved that the number of microorganisms increased with the increase of organics concentration in the feed water see fig 7 likewise as displayed in fig 4 b the removal efficiency of doc elevated with the increase of organics content in the feed water accounting to average removal efficiencies of 32 1 33 6 36 6 and 55 5 in gdm 1 4 respectively previous studies indicated that the uf membrane itself just exerted little removal of doc yu et al 2016 and thus the quantitative removal of doc in this study was mainly attributed to the formation of biocake layer on the membrane surface the efficient removals of uv254 with gdm were obtained while their removal rates slightly decreased with the increasing organics in the feed water as exhibited in fig 4 c a potential explanation was that the humus like and aromatic like organic compounds increased in the feed water and these organic matters were the main detection substance of uv254 and were difficult to be degraded by the microorganisms resulting in the reduction of uv254 removal rate kulovaara et al 1996 tian et al 2008 furthermore eem technology was employed to further analyze the removal of fluorescent matters as displayed in fig 4 e f four typical florescent peaks were observed and defined as peak a peak b peak c and peak d which were related to tryptophan protein like substances simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine humic acid like substances and fulvic acid like substances respectively qu et al 2014 apparently the intensities of peak a d in the feed water aggrandized with the increase of organics concentration after filtration the intensities of peak a d decreased significantly compared with the feed water indicating that the formation of biocake layer would enhance the removal of the fluorescent compounds which was in accordance with the scenarios of doc and uv254 removal the details of the summarized fluorescent intensity and excitation emission ex em wavelength of speak a d can be found in table s2 3 4 characterization of biocake layer 3 4 1 morphologies and structures of biocake layer the stereo microscope technology was used to visualize the morphology of biocake layer and track its developments at different filtration phases as shown in fig 5 the membrane surface morphology of the four gdm systems during the initial filtration day 1 was captured as a control with the ongoing filtration an obvious yellowish brown biocake layer formed on the membrane surface mainly due to the deposition of inorganic particles ferric manganese oxides organic compounds and microorganisms the biocake layer in gdm 1 with the lowest organics concentration appeared smoother and denser while the undulating and even shedding structures of biocake layer were observed in gdm 2 gdm 3 and gdm 4 especially on day 30 80 supportively as shown in fig s1 the sem images also suggested that the morphology of biocake layer in gdm 1 seemed dense flat and compact however a rough porosity biocake layer morphology was captured in gdm 2 4 such results indicated that the presence of organic compounds was beneficial to the formation of heterogeneous structures of biocake layer more importantly it was found that the difference in the structure of biocake layer was closely related to the flux variation complex and dense structures of biocake layer were along with the lower stable flux i e gdm 1 while heterogeneous and porous structures of biocake layer were responsible for higher stable flux achieved in gdm 2 3 additionally oct observation was employed to visualize the internal cross section structure and 3d morphology of the biocake layer attached on the membrane surface as illustrated in fig s2 the membrane surface of gdm 1 was apparently covered by the biocake layer with the rather smooth and dense characteristics while the structures of biocake layer in gdm 2 4 systems exhibited highly rough heterogeneous and porous therefore it can be inferred that the organics concentration in the feed water played a fundamental role in the structural characteristics of biocake layer which was obviously in accordance with the flux development on the other hand the presence of black bundle cluster morphology on the membrane surface of gdm 2 4 was visualized which was consistent with the formation of mnox and supportively the xps analysis also proved the existence of mnox within the biocake layer as provided in fig 8 in fig 5 the black mnox based bundle cluster structure becomes coarser and deeper and subsequently converted into a larger cluster structure especially in the gdm 2 3 15 80 days the continuous generation and accumulation of active mnox on the membrane surface played a substantial role in the efficient removal of manganese as a response gdm 2 3 exhibited a stable and efficient manganese removal during long term operation fig 3c d by contrast the accumulation of mnox in gdm 1 was hardly observed during the whole filtration period while the observation of mnox in gdm 4 was more blurred relative to the initial observation furthermore the microscopic structure of mnox was characterized by sem as shown in fig s1 similarly the distinct sponge like mnox were observed in gdm 2 and gdm 3 indicating effective mnox function in biocake layer of gdm 2 3 while not in gdm 1 and gdm 4 such results further supported the hypothesis that the extremely low organic compounds were adverse to the formation of mnox on the membrane surface while the excessive organic compounds would wrap the mnox to inhibit its auto catalytic oxidation of manganese 3 4 2 microorganism community analysis the bacterial and eukaryotic communities in the biocake layer attached on the membrane surface were analyzed by the high throughput sequencing technology and the results are presented in table 2 and fig 6 in table 2 the species number of bacterial and eukaryotic communities in gdm 1 was the lowest while that in the gdm 2 gdm 3 and gdm 4 increased to 59 7 55 2 50 2 and 45 9 63 8 74 1 respectively the values of chao and shannon were also significantly improved in gdm 2 4 which indicated that the microorganism community in gdm 2 4 was more abundant than gdm 1 the explanation should be that the organic compounds could serve as the necessary carbon source for the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and accordingly the higher concentration of organic substances in the feed water was spark fast proliferation of bacteria including mnob besides it was found that the species and chao values of bacteria decreased with the increase of organics concentration in gdm 2 4 while the facts of eukaryotic community trended the opposite such results further indicated that the higher concentrations of organics could positively support the eukaryote s growth and accordingly the amounts of bacteria would be negatively impacted due to the enhanced predation by the eukaryotes furthermore the omnifarious species and relative abundance of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities were further evaluated at the class level with hopes of gaining full insight into the microorganism s functionality and its relationship with the flux stabilization as shown in fig 6 the gammaproteobacteria and alphaproproteobacteria both belonging to the proteobacteria were the predominant bacteria in the four lines of gdm systems the relative abundance of total proteobacteria in gdm 1 was the highest 75 76 much higher than the results in gdm 2 34 74 gdm 3 46 0 and gdm 4 44 63 the previously reported typical manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob in the manganese removal filter including gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria were obviously found in the biocake layer implying that the biological degradation conferred the potential capability for the manganese removal casalini et al 2020 dick et al 2008 tang et al 2021b the subdominant species in gdm 1 was bacteroidia with relative abundance of 5 76 while the subdominant species in gdm 2 4 with higher concentrations of organics was saccharimonadia accounting to a relative abundance of 12 71 13 15 15 80 respectively in addition some other bacteria with relatively high abundance were found in gdm 2 4 such as the verrucomicrobiae 0 54 9 33 actinobacteria 3 02 5 95 bacteroidia 2 6 4 86 acidimicrobiia 1 35 3 60 clostridia 1 95 2 61 nitrospiria 3 04 3 96 etc which further demonstrated that adding organic compounds into the feed water would positively facilitate the microorganism growth noticeably the verrucomicrobiae actinobacteria bacteroidia were reported to play an important role in the proteins hydrolysis and decomposition of organic substances sebastian et al 2020 wang et al 2021 especially the nitrospiria with the ability for ammonia removal li et al 2019 as a consequence the presence of a high concentration of organic substances was beneficial to the growth of multifarious microorganisms within the biocake layer to enhance the pollutants removal and the higher removal efficiencies of contaminants in gdm 2 4 relative to gdm 1 further supported this hypothesis figs 3 and 4 regarding the main species and abundance of the eukaryotic community some differences were also observed due to the different conditions of organics in the feed water the predominant species at the class level in gdm 1 4 were demospongiae 20 59 demospongiae 26 54 chytridiomycetes 39 33 and clitellata 29 60 respectively besides the other subdominant eukaryotes in four gdm systems were rather different such as the gdm 1 with chytridiomycetes 14 17 gdm 2 with chytridiomycetes 20 13 and mortierellomycetes 12 90 gdm 3 with demospongiae 8 17 and eutardigrada 20 13 gdm 4 with chytridiomycetes 16 35 and saccharomycetes 15 84 respectively such results indicated that the higher organics content in the feed water could significantly drive the evolution of dominant eukaryotic community which resulted from the survival adaptation of eukaryotic in different water environments the demospongiae organisms could display rhythmic body contractions during their normal life activities nickel 2004 chytridiomycetes was a large and diverse group of flagellum protozoa that could move and predate in a larger range of water powell 1994 clitellata relied on the creeping way to forward or turn due to the annelid body structure erseus 2005 eutardigrada was a typical tardigrada metazoan accompanied by the morphological characteristics of the claws and or sucking disks to support activities guidetti et al 2010 the bdelloidea and litostomatea observed in gdm 2 3 could move and swim in water through the cilium or foot and also has stronger predation behavior for the upper microorganism or nutrients chen et al 2021 the presence of diverse eukaryotes with predation and movement ability was of great significance to the flux stabilization and improvements in the gdm system the higher organic content in the feed water of gdm 2 3 supported the eukaryotes movement and predator behavior and thus benefited the formation of a loose and heterogeneous biocake layer contributing to the improvements of stabilized flux level in gdm 2 3 relative to gdm 1 3 4 3 eps and atp quantification at the end of the experiment the concentrations of eps and atp in the biocake layer were determined as illustrated in fig 7 a b the total contents of proteins and polysaccharides increased from gdm 1 to gdm 4 indicating that the accumulation of eps in the gdm system elevated with the increase of organics concentration in feed water numerous studies also showed that the high concentration of eps would result in severe membrane fouling and low flux level tang et al 2018a wang et al 2009 supportively in the present study the level of stable flux was gdm 2 gdm 3 gdm 4 which was consistent with the total production of eps interestingly the gdm 1 had the lowest eps content while its stable flux was lower than that of gdm 2 3 the potential explanation should be that the dense structure of biocake layer served as another main reason for the low stable flux level of gdm 1 the distribution of proteins and polysaccharides showed a similar pattern in gdm 1 to gdm 4 with the concentration of smp higher than the ex eps followed by in eps such results indicated that most eps were accumulated within the biocake layer rather than deposited in the membrane pore which was beneficial to reducing the membrane pore blocking and achieving higher stable flux in addition the atp was quantified to evaluate the microorganism activities within the biocake layer adhered on the membrane surface compared to gdm 1 the atp signal response of biocake layer in gdm 2 4 significantly increased indicating that the bio activity within the biocake layer elevated with the increase of organics concentration in feed water the positive microbial activities would contribute to effectively removing organic contaminants and the higher removal efficiencies of doc and nh4 n also supported this hypothesis see fig 4 besides the heterogeneous and porous structures of biocake layer formed on the membrane surface were also positively impacted by the microbial activities and the higher biological activities would benefit the formation of more heterogeneous and porous biocake layer which was conducive to the improvements of stable flux during long term gdm operation the higher stable flux of gdm 2 3 compared to gdm 1 further verified this assumption 3 4 4 fe and mn element analysis in order to evaluate the mechanism of iron and manganese removal the biocake layer was measured using xps at the end of the experiment the iron and manganese narrow scan spectrum of gdm 1 4 were deconvoluted into different metal valences based on their binding energy location as illustrated in fig 8 a b as shown in fig 8 a the fe 2p spectra could be fitted into fe ii 708 7 ev 721 8 ev and fe iii 711 7 ev 724 8 ev and verified that the fe2 oxidation and the deposition of iron oxides occurred on uf membrane surface liu et al 2022 with respect to manganese the gdm 2 3 exhibited good peaks fitted with multivalent mn while the gdm 1 and gdm 4 with low peak spectrum did not complete the peak fitting especially gdm 4 as present in fig 8 b as previously reported the peaks of mn 2p3 2 ranged at 640 7 ev 641 7 ev and 643 7 ev which was related to the presence of mn ii mn iii and mn iv respectively ilton et al 2016 in gdm 2 and gdm 3 the higher intensities of mn 2p3 2 spectra were observed which indicated that more mnox e g mn ii mn iii and mn iv was generated as a consequence gdm 2 3 conferred a higher auto catalytic oxidation capacity for mn ii removal since the mn iv was conducing to the adsorption of mn ii and the intermediate valence of mn iii with strong oxidation activity could effectively oxidize the mn ii into high valence mn iv sun et al 2021 yang et al 2021 therefore the efficient and stable manganese removal performance of gdm 2 3 should be attributed to the accumulation of more mnox with auto catalytic oxidation capability in contrast the signal intensities of mnox in gdm 1 and gdm 4 were relatively weaker than in gdm 2 3 and consequently the manganese removal efficiencies were relatively lower as presented in fig 3 c d on the other hand as shown in table s1 the c o content proportion increased gradually in gdm 1 92 84 gdm 2 97 39 gdm 3 98 and gdm 4 98 54 indicating that organic matter accumulation on the membrane surface increased from gdm 1 to gdm 4 system nevertheless the excessive organic compounds would cover and wrap the iron and manganese oxides and thus the scan peak spectrum intensity of xps for iron and manganese weakened alongside and noise fluctuations occurred accordingly such as the iron in gdm 1 showed a stronger intensity spectrum than that of gdm 2 4 which further verified that the increase of organic matter would result in the reduction of the spectrum intensity similarly the peak intensity of manganese element in gdm 2 4 gradually declined especially the gdm 4 which could hardly detect a distinct mn peak spectrum such results indicated that the mnox in gdm 4 was covered by the excessive organic compounds which would inhibit the auto catalytic oxidation between mnox and mn2 and thus resulting in the reduction of manganese removal rate though gdm 1 had the least organic compounds interference its peak spectrum intensity of mn was much lower than that in gdm 2 3 since gdm 1 system could not form sufficient mnox and this phenomenon was consistent with the observation in fig 5 and s1 overall it can be inferred that organics substances played a fundamental role in the formation of mnox and then influenced the manganese removal 3 5 mechanism of manganese removal and flux stabilization during the long term filtration both flux stabilization and manganese removal of the gdm system showed differentiation under the different conditions of organics concentrations therefore it s full of relevance to elucidate the effects of organics concentration on the flux stabilization and manganese removal to obtain a systematic understanding of the gdm technique in treating the iron and manganese containing surface water meanwhile the mechanism of organics concentration influenced flux stabilization and manganese removal in gdm filtration was schematically presented in fig 9 3 5 1 effects of organics concentration on gdm flux stabilization previous studies pointed out that the flux stabilization of gdm system was mainly related to the structural characteristics of biocake layer attached on the membrane surface such as porosity double layer structure thickness homogeneity and coverage ding et al 2017 peter varbanets et al 2011 higher porosity and lower coverage of biocake layer were easier to obtain higher stable flux in gdm filtration noticeably the biological activities played an important role in the regulation of biocake layer structures in this study during the initial filtration period of 0 40 days the higher concentration of organic matter was the more serious the membrane fouling occurred which was well in correspondence with the typical theory of membrane fouling caused by organic pollutants on the other hand organic matter could serve as the nutrients to provide energy for the growth proliferation and biological activity of microorganisms to a certain extent liu et al 2002 tang et al 2018b consequently the enhanced biological activities of microorganisms in the gdm system would benefit the formation of biocake layer towards the characteristics of looseness porosity and heterogeneity the structure of biocake layer was in a dynamic equilibrium state due to the self regulation of microorganisms which played a crucial role in the flux stabilization and stabilized flux level during long term gdm operation therefore the advisable concentrations of organic substances would promote the biological activity to engineer a heterogeneous and porous structure of biocake layer which was conducive to achieving a higher stable flux level 3 5 2 effects of organics concentration on manganese removal in the treatment of manganese containing surface water by gdm process the impacts of organic matters on the manganese removal can be evaluated from both the auto catalytic oxidation and biological degradation during the initial filtration the gdm system with high concentration of organic compounds in the feed water conferred a higher manganese removal while the low organics concentration in the feed water resulted in a lower manganese removal efficiency by gdm process since the manganese would react with the organics and particles to form the manganese complex with larger size and then be rejected along with the latter which was in accordance with the typical removal mechanism of manganese in the conventional uf process during long term filtration with the increase of organics concentration in the feed water the manganese removal efficiency also increased significantly as shown in gdm 2 3 the potential explanations were related to i more freshly generated mnox with auto catalytic oxidation capability accumulated within the biocake layer to significantly promote the manganese oxidation and rejection see fig 8 ii the increased organic compounds could serve as the nutrients to facilitate proliferation of manganese oxidizing bacteria and promote the manganese bio oxidation however with the further increase of organics concentration in the feed water though the biological activity characterized by atp was enhanced the manganese removal efficiency reduced as displayed in gdm 4 since the mnox would be wrapped by the excessive organic substances as displayed in fig 8 and consequently resulted in its oxidation capability of manganese therefore the organic matters with a certain content in the feed water were necessary for gdm system regarding its long term stability and manganese removal capability 4 conclusion in summary the specific effects of organics concentration on the gdm technique in treating the iron and manganese containing surface water were investigated low concentration of organic substances in feed water was not beneficial to microbial activities resulting in a denser biocake layer formed on membrane surface and relatively lower stable flux moderate concentration of organic compounds would positively facilitate the microbial activities and benefit to engineering a heterogeneous and porous biocake layer on the membrane surface contributing to the improvements of stable flux at approximately 6 3 l m 2 h 1 while high concentration of organic compounds in the feed water would lead to the increase in the thickness and eps concentration of biocake layer resulting in a flux reduction instead furthermore the organics concentration also conferred a significant influence on the manganese removal increasing the organics concentration in feed water was beneficial to the more accumulation of both mnox and manganese oxidizing bacteria contributing to the improvement of manganese removal however excessive concentration of organic substances in the feed water would cause the wrapping of mnox by the organic foulants and result in a lower manganese removal besides efficient removals of iron doc uv254 nh4 n and fluorescent pollutants were achieved therefore these findings would benefit to the developments of new strategies in the treatment of iron and manganese containing surface water and

15347,iron and manganese contamination in the surface water is posing great challenges to the drinking water treatment supply especially in the complex cases of organics involvement gravity driven membrane gdm filtration equipped with the dual functions of ultrafiltration and biocake layer conferred promising potentials in the removals of iron and manganese this study evaluated the effects of organics concentrations on the removal performance of iron and manganese as well as on the flux stabilization during gdm long term filtration the results indicated that stable flux level and the removal efficiency of manganese initially increased with the increase of organics concentration in the feed water and then decreased the moderate concentration of organic compounds in the feed water would positively facilitate the microbial activities and benefit to engineering a heterogeneous and porous biocake layer on the membrane surface contributing to the highest improvements of stable flux 6 3 l m 2 h 1 while high concentration of organic compounds in the feed water would result in the increase in the thickness and eps concentration of the biocake layer leading to a flux reduction furthermore the moderate concentration of organic compounds in the feed water was also beneficial to the manganese removal 94 6 due to the more accumulation of auto catalytic oxidation manganese oxides mnox within the biocake layer and the improved biological degradation however further increase of organics concentration would deliver a negative impact on the manganese removal owing to the wrapping of mnox by the organic substances overall these findings provide practical and acceptable strategies to the selections of pre treatments prior to gdm and promote its extensive application in treating the iron and manganese containing surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity driven membrane gdm organics concentration biocake layer flux stabilization manganese removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently ever increasing attention are paid to the problem of manganese contamination in the surface water hoyland et al 2014 tian et al 2019 trueman et al 2019 the conventional drinking treatment process e g coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection could not effectively diminish the manganese contaminants resulting in the increasing risks of manganese contamination in the drinking water ultrafiltration uf possessing both the high water productivity and the effective rejection capability for particles colloids macromolecular organic matters bacteria giardia and cryptosporidium could meet the ever increasing requirements of high quality water supply xing et al 2019 zhu et al 2022 however the conventional uf process could not effectively remove the dissolved manganese due to its much larger membrane pore size than the size of manganese contaminants accounting to less than 10 of manganese removal choo et al 2007 furthermore the presence of manganese would cause severe membrane pore blocking and reduce the water production of uf process a novel uf technology gravity driven membrane gdm filtration developed by eawag could be operated continuously without any pretreatments aeration cross flow backwash and chemical cleaning and the membrane flux could be stabilized at a level of 4 8 l m 2 h 1 under an ultra low gravitational driven pressure of 2 7 kpa peter varbanets et al 2010 pronk et al 2019 as a consequence the gdm process achieved the inherent advantages of simple operation low maintenance and low energy consumption during long term filtration a biocake layer would be gradually formed on the membrane surface and the flux stabilization and stable flux level of gdm process were mainly affected by the structure and biochemical composition of the biocake layer derlon et al 2013 tang et al 2018a the more heterogeneous structures and less eps concentration of the biocake layer were the higher stable flux of gdm would be achieved furthermore the biocake layer formed on the membrane surface also endowed the gdm process with an excellent pre filtration capability and can significantly enhance the removal performance of contaminants derlon et al 2014 chen et al 2021 indicated that gdm system obtained an excellent removal performance of doc and nh4 n with average removal efficiency of approximately 24 and 91 respectively owing to the biocake layer formation interestingly based on the identification of manganese removal in the manganese containing groundwater through the auto catalytic oxidation mnox film it was found that the biocake layer attached on the membrane surface of gdm appeared full of resemblance to the mnox film which sparked the innovative idea using gdm to treat the manganese containing water resource supportively a previous study validated the feasibility of gdm process in treating the iron and manganese containing surface water and indicated that both iron and manganese were effectively diminished with an average removal efficiency of 90 and 58 respectively tang et al 2020 importantly the flux level of gdm process could remain stabilized during long term filtration in treating the manganese containing surface water and obtain a similar flux level 7 9 l m 2 h 1 compared with the gdm control in treating the water without manganese indicating that the presence of manganese would not significantly influence the flux level of gdm process which was significantly different from the conventional uf process tang et al 2020 another study further indicated that during the treatment of manganese containing surface water by gdm process the generated manganese oxides would be rejected on the membrane surface and benefit the formation of heterogeneous structures of biocake layer even contributing to achieving a higher stable flux level tang et al 2021b a further study even reported that pre coating mnox particles on the membrane surface of gdm could significantly enhance the removal efficiency of manganese and ammonia tang et al 2021a with respect to the mechanism of manganese removal it was reported that auto catalytic oxidation by the mnox served the fundamental role in the manganese removal during the treatment of manganese containing groundwater by gdm process however in the treatment of surface water the mechanism of manganese removal by gdm process was not systematically investigated yet in addition organic contamination was the main characteristics of the surface water and the concentrations of organic compounds in different regions differed significantly on the one hand the high concentration of organic compounds in the feed water would facilitate the increase in the thickness density and homogeneity of biocake layer attached on the membrane surface resulting in severe flux decline during the gdm long term filtration a gdm study in treating the surface water indicated that decreasing the concentration of doc by 50 70 would correspondingly contribute to an increase of stable flux from 2 l m 2 h 1 to 6 l m 2 h 1 tang et al 2018b other studies also indicated that the organic substances served an important role in the growth and activity of microbes which was beneficial to the formation of heterogeneous biocake layer chomiak et al 2015 wu et al 2017 on the other hand previous studies indicated that the presence of organics in the feed water would negatively influence the manganese removal cheng et al 2017 cheng et al 2020 potgieter et al 2005 however there was no report on the special roles of organic compounds on manganese removal in gdm filtration how the organics iron and manganese were simultaneously removed by gdm and how the iron manganese and organic substances influence the flux stabilization of gdm system required further investigation therefore the treatment of iron and manganese containing surface water with different concentrations of organic compounds using gdm process was investigated the effects of different concentrations of organic compounds on the flux development stabilized flux level iron and manganese removal nh4 n and organics removal were evaluated the structure composition and microbial community of the biocake layer were characterized with expects to estimate the mechanism of flux stabilization and pollutants removal in the co presence of organics and manganese the iron and manganese oxides were comprehensively analyzed to further elucidate the mechanism of manganese removal in gdm system this study was expected to provide a deep insight into gdm technique in treating iron and manganese containing surface water 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of feed water the four types of simulated iron and manganese containing surface water with different concentrations of organic compounds were prepared as follows the tap water was dechlorinated by aeration for 12 h and was defined as the feed water control then the pre filtered domestic wastewater was diluted using dechlorinated tap water with the ratios of 1 40 1 20 and 1 10 and such types of synthesized feed water were defined as low organics concentration feed water medium organics concentration feed water and high organics concentration feed water respectively finally the fecl2 and mncl2 were added to the four prepared feed water types the feed water was renewed daily thus the four lines of gdm system were mounted to treat the iron and manganese containing feed water with different organic concentration and the corresponding gdm systems were defined as gdm 1 gdm 2 gdm 3 and gdm 4 respectively the detailed characteristics of feed water are listed in table 1 and the water temperature was controlled at 20 1 c 2 2 experiment setup as shown in fig 1 the bench scale gdm system was mounted with feed water tank constant feed water sealed membrane modules water collection bottles and tubes the feed water gravitationally flowed into the constant water tank and sealed membrane module from the feed water tank the distance between the membrane module and the water level of feed water tank was 70 cm to generate a gravity driven pressure of 7 kpa the membrane permeate was collected using a permeate collection bottle for further flux quantification and water quality characterization the polyethersulfone pes flat sheet uf membrane up150 wiesbaden germany with nominal molecular weight cut off of 150 kda was adopted and the effective filtration area was 0 00768 m2 initially all the pes uf membranes were immersed into the naclo solution 10 mg l for 1 5 h with the assistance of a magnetic stirrer after that the membrane was rinsed by the ultrapure water for 3 times to remove the residual naclo solution subsequently the membrane was soaked into the ultrapure water for 24 h renewed every 8 h for each gdm line at least four same membrane modules were performed in parallel during the long term experiment 2 3 characterization of biocake layer attached on the membrane surface 2 3 1 morphology and structure of biocake layer the stereomicroscope olympus c 7070 germany was used to capture images of the morphology of biocake layer in order to in site visualize the cross section structure and 3d structures of biocake layer the optical coherence tomography oct thorlabs gmbh germany was employed at a central light source wavelength of 930 nm at the end of filtration experiment the iron and manganese elements in biocake layer were inspected by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250xi usa and the micro structure of biocake layer was visualized by a scanning electron microscope sem quanta 200feg usa the details can be found in the supplementary information si 2 3 2 microbial communities and compositions of biocake layer at the end of the gdm filtration the bacterial and eukaryotic communities were measured with 16s rrna and 18s rrna pyrosequencing technology respectively the extracellular polymeric substance eps accumulated within the biocake layer and deposited in the membrane pores was extracted and described as the soluble microbial products smps ex epss accumulated in biocake layer and in epss deposited in membrane pores the concentrations of eps in terms of the polysaccharides and protein were determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method and lowry protein assay kit method respectively the atp concentration was measured to identify the biological activity within the biocake layer an atp colouring agent of bactiter glo promega corporation usa and luminometer detector glomax turner biosystems sunnyvale usa be used to quantify the atp distribution in biocake layer the details about the water quality analyze sample preparation and microbial detection were provided in si 3 results and discussions 3 1 flux variation four lines of gdm system under the different conditions of organics concentration in the feed water were continuously operated for 75 days without any cleaning procedures fig 2 a b presents the flux and resistance variations of each gdm line and both could be divided into three stages in stage ⅰ 0 10 days a rapid decline of flux was observed owing to the severe accumulation of pollutants on membrane surface during the initial filtration the flux of gdm 1 gdm 2 gdm 3 and gdm 4 decreased from 43 0 l m 2 h 1 33 1 l m 2 h 1 26 1 l m 2 h 1 and 21 2 l m 2 h 1 to 9 4 l m 2 h 1 6 8 l m 2 h 1 5 8 l m 2 h 1 and 4 94 l m 2 h 1 respectively it was found that gdm 1 with the lowest concentration of organic substances exhibited the highest initial flux during the initial 10 day filtration while gdm 4 with the highest concentration of organics exerted the lowest initial flux and the highest rate of flux decline during stage ⅱ 11 40 days the flux tended to reach a stable stage with the features of flux decreasing slightly and gradually leveling off as shown in fig 2 c the stable fluxes of gdm 1 4 were 6 9 l m 2h 1 6 0 l m 2h 1 5 6 l m 2h 1 4 5 l m 2h 1 respectively which was positively in correlation with the concentration of organic compounds in the feed water nevertheless during stage ⅲ 41 80 days flux fluctuations were observed in gdm 2 4 and their average membrane flux also increased to a certain degree in contrast the flux of gdm 1 always remained constant without any significant fluctuations during this stage the flux levels of gdm 1 4 were 5 1 l m 2h 1 6 3 l m 2h 1 6 2 l m 2h 1 5 0 l m 2h 1 respectively and the details can be found in fig 2 d the flux of gdm 2 3 with higher concentrations of organic compounds in the feed water was higher than gdm 1 with lower organic concentration which was obviously against the scenario of conventional uf process and the advisable increase of organic substances in the feed water would facilitate the membrane fouling alleviation and flux improvements previous studies indicated the biological activity played a fundamental role in the flux stabilization and enhancing the biological activity would benefit to engineering a heterogeneous porous and rough structure of biocake layer to obtain a higher stable flux level chen et al 2021 an explanations attribute to the organic compounds was its added in feed water would serve as the carbon nutrients for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms to enhance the biological activity within the biocake layer in this study a more heterogeneous structure of biocake layer was also found in gdm 2 3 than the fact in gdm 1 and the details can be found in figs 5 and s1 2 besides the enhanced biological activity in the biocake layer would positively facilitate the biological hydrolysis of organic foulants deposited on the membrane surface to further alleviate the membrane fouling in terms of gdm 1 its relatively lower stable flux level was mainly due to the insufficiency of microbial activities and inorganic substances which would serve as the frameworks of heterogeneous biocake layer formation and the formation of dense biocake layer also verified it fig 5 3 2 removal of iron and manganese the effects of different organics concentrations on the removal of iron and manganese were investigated as illustrated in fig 3 it was found that all the gdm systems could efficiently eliminate the iron contaminants even during the initial filtration as shown in fig 3 a and the iron concentration in permeate could be reduced to less than 0 3 mg l in fig 3 b the removal rate of iron in gdm 1 4 after flux stabilization reached 93 4 94 5 93 9 and 94 2 respectively which illuminated that the organic compounds just conferred limited impacts on the removal of iron the manganese removal of four gdm lines is illustrated in fig 3 c d during the initial filtration the deduction of manganese in all gdm systems was negligible unlike the scenario of iron removal since the dissolved manganese contaminants were difficult to be directly oxidized by dissolved oxygen and would easily penetrate through the gdm system due to its smaller hydrated diameter than uf membrane pore size on day 5 30 as displayed in fig 3 c the concentrations of manganese in the gdm 2 4 gradually decreased relative to the feed water which indicated that manganese removal capability was progressively generated by contrast in gdm 1 the manganese concentration in the feed water was equaled to the membrane permeate and the manganese removal efficiency was less than 10 such results demonstrated that adding organic compounds into the feed water conduced to the generation of manganese removal capacity by gdm process supportively it was found that the manganese removal efficiencies of gdm 3 and gdm 4 were higher than that in gdm 1 and gdm 2 during the filtration stage of 5 30 days the explanation should be that the manganese tended to form large compound pollutants with organics by mutual interaction e g complexation adsorption cross linking which could be rejected by the uf membrane with the filtration further extending the manganese concentration in membrane permeates of the four gdm systems decreased ongoingly indicating that the capacity of manganese removal developed even in gdm 1 without the extra addition of organic compounds however the obvious difference in manganese removal efficiency among the four gdm systems was observed gdm 2 and gdm 3 conferred the highest removal efficiency of manganese and remained steady after 30 days both with manganese concentration in permeate less than 0 1 mg l and conferring manganese removal rates of approximately 94 6 and 94 9 respectively by contrast gdm 1 and gdm 4 conferred a relatively lower manganese removal with manganese removal rates of approximately 45 5 and 67 3 respectively such results indicated that the concentration of organic compounds played a fundamental role in the manganese removal performance the too low or too high concentrations of organics in the feed water were not beneficial to the rapid formation of manganese removal capability 3 3 removal of nh4 n and organics compounds the removals of nh4 n doc and fluorescent components were evaluated after flux stabilization as shown in fig 4 a the nh4 n concentration in the permeate of gdm 1 4 was significantly lower than their feed water with average removal rates of 80 3 94 5 95 8 and 95 1 respectively interestingly gdm 1 with the lowest concentration of organic compounds in the feed water exhibited the lowest removal rate of nh4 n than gdm 2 4 systems this result was related to the fact that nh4 n removal was mainly attributed to the biological nitrification process and the limited organics content would negatively impact biological degradation within the biocake layer supportively the 16s rna high throughput sequencing results further proved that the number of microorganisms increased with the increase of organics concentration in the feed water see fig 7 likewise as displayed in fig 4 b the removal efficiency of doc elevated with the increase of organics content in the feed water accounting to average removal efficiencies of 32 1 33 6 36 6 and 55 5 in gdm 1 4 respectively previous studies indicated that the uf membrane itself just exerted little removal of doc yu et al 2016 and thus the quantitative removal of doc in this study was mainly attributed to the formation of biocake layer on the membrane surface the efficient removals of uv254 with gdm were obtained while their removal rates slightly decreased with the increasing organics in the feed water as exhibited in fig 4 c a potential explanation was that the humus like and aromatic like organic compounds increased in the feed water and these organic matters were the main detection substance of uv254 and were difficult to be degraded by the microorganisms resulting in the reduction of uv254 removal rate kulovaara et al 1996 tian et al 2008 furthermore eem technology was employed to further analyze the removal of fluorescent matters as displayed in fig 4 e f four typical florescent peaks were observed and defined as peak a peak b peak c and peak d which were related to tryptophan protein like substances simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine humic acid like substances and fulvic acid like substances respectively qu et al 2014 apparently the intensities of peak a d in the feed water aggrandized with the increase of organics concentration after filtration the intensities of peak a d decreased significantly compared with the feed water indicating that the formation of biocake layer would enhance the removal of the fluorescent compounds which was in accordance with the scenarios of doc and uv254 removal the details of the summarized fluorescent intensity and excitation emission ex em wavelength of speak a d can be found in table s2 3 4 characterization of biocake layer 3 4 1 morphologies and structures of biocake layer the stereo microscope technology was used to visualize the morphology of biocake layer and track its developments at different filtration phases as shown in fig 5 the membrane surface morphology of the four gdm systems during the initial filtration day 1 was captured as a control with the ongoing filtration an obvious yellowish brown biocake layer formed on the membrane surface mainly due to the deposition of inorganic particles ferric manganese oxides organic compounds and microorganisms the biocake layer in gdm 1 with the lowest organics concentration appeared smoother and denser while the undulating and even shedding structures of biocake layer were observed in gdm 2 gdm 3 and gdm 4 especially on day 30 80 supportively as shown in fig s1 the sem images also suggested that the morphology of biocake layer in gdm 1 seemed dense flat and compact however a rough porosity biocake layer morphology was captured in gdm 2 4 such results indicated that the presence of organic compounds was beneficial to the formation of heterogeneous structures of biocake layer more importantly it was found that the difference in the structure of biocake layer was closely related to the flux variation complex and dense structures of biocake layer were along with the lower stable flux i e gdm 1 while heterogeneous and porous structures of biocake layer were responsible for higher stable flux achieved in gdm 2 3 additionally oct observation was employed to visualize the internal cross section structure and 3d morphology of the biocake layer attached on the membrane surface as illustrated in fig s2 the membrane surface of gdm 1 was apparently covered by the biocake layer with the rather smooth and dense characteristics while the structures of biocake layer in gdm 2 4 systems exhibited highly rough heterogeneous and porous therefore it can be inferred that the organics concentration in the feed water played a fundamental role in the structural characteristics of biocake layer which was obviously in accordance with the flux development on the other hand the presence of black bundle cluster morphology on the membrane surface of gdm 2 4 was visualized which was consistent with the formation of mnox and supportively the xps analysis also proved the existence of mnox within the biocake layer as provided in fig 8 in fig 5 the black mnox based bundle cluster structure becomes coarser and deeper and subsequently converted into a larger cluster structure especially in the gdm 2 3 15 80 days the continuous generation and accumulation of active mnox on the membrane surface played a substantial role in the efficient removal of manganese as a response gdm 2 3 exhibited a stable and efficient manganese removal during long term operation fig 3c d by contrast the accumulation of mnox in gdm 1 was hardly observed during the whole filtration period while the observation of mnox in gdm 4 was more blurred relative to the initial observation furthermore the microscopic structure of mnox was characterized by sem as shown in fig s1 similarly the distinct sponge like mnox were observed in gdm 2 and gdm 3 indicating effective mnox function in biocake layer of gdm 2 3 while not in gdm 1 and gdm 4 such results further supported the hypothesis that the extremely low organic compounds were adverse to the formation of mnox on the membrane surface while the excessive organic compounds would wrap the mnox to inhibit its auto catalytic oxidation of manganese 3 4 2 microorganism community analysis the bacterial and eukaryotic communities in the biocake layer attached on the membrane surface were analyzed by the high throughput sequencing technology and the results are presented in table 2 and fig 6 in table 2 the species number of bacterial and eukaryotic communities in gdm 1 was the lowest while that in the gdm 2 gdm 3 and gdm 4 increased to 59 7 55 2 50 2 and 45 9 63 8 74 1 respectively the values of chao and shannon were also significantly improved in gdm 2 4 which indicated that the microorganism community in gdm 2 4 was more abundant than gdm 1 the explanation should be that the organic compounds could serve as the necessary carbon source for the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and accordingly the higher concentration of organic substances in the feed water was spark fast proliferation of bacteria including mnob besides it was found that the species and chao values of bacteria decreased with the increase of organics concentration in gdm 2 4 while the facts of eukaryotic community trended the opposite such results further indicated that the higher concentrations of organics could positively support the eukaryote s growth and accordingly the amounts of bacteria would be negatively impacted due to the enhanced predation by the eukaryotes furthermore the omnifarious species and relative abundance of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities were further evaluated at the class level with hopes of gaining full insight into the microorganism s functionality and its relationship with the flux stabilization as shown in fig 6 the gammaproteobacteria and alphaproproteobacteria both belonging to the proteobacteria were the predominant bacteria in the four lines of gdm systems the relative abundance of total proteobacteria in gdm 1 was the highest 75 76 much higher than the results in gdm 2 34 74 gdm 3 46 0 and gdm 4 44 63 the previously reported typical manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob in the manganese removal filter including gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria were obviously found in the biocake layer implying that the biological degradation conferred the potential capability for the manganese removal casalini et al 2020 dick et al 2008 tang et al 2021b the subdominant species in gdm 1 was bacteroidia with relative abundance of 5 76 while the subdominant species in gdm 2 4 with higher concentrations of organics was saccharimonadia accounting to a relative abundance of 12 71 13 15 15 80 respectively in addition some other bacteria with relatively high abundance were found in gdm 2 4 such as the verrucomicrobiae 0 54 9 33 actinobacteria 3 02 5 95 bacteroidia 2 6 4 86 acidimicrobiia 1 35 3 60 clostridia 1 95 2 61 nitrospiria 3 04 3 96 etc which further demonstrated that adding organic compounds into the feed water would positively facilitate the microorganism growth noticeably the verrucomicrobiae actinobacteria bacteroidia were reported to play an important role in the proteins hydrolysis and decomposition of organic substances sebastian et al 2020 wang et al 2021 especially the nitrospiria with the ability for ammonia removal li et al 2019 as a consequence the presence of a high concentration of organic substances was beneficial to the growth of multifarious microorganisms within the biocake layer to enhance the pollutants removal and the higher removal efficiencies of contaminants in gdm 2 4 relative to gdm 1 further supported this hypothesis figs 3 and 4 regarding the main species and abundance of the eukaryotic community some differences were also observed due to the different conditions of organics in the feed water the predominant species at the class level in gdm 1 4 were demospongiae 20 59 demospongiae 26 54 chytridiomycetes 39 33 and clitellata 29 60 respectively besides the other subdominant eukaryotes in four gdm systems were rather different such as the gdm 1 with chytridiomycetes 14 17 gdm 2 with chytridiomycetes 20 13 and mortierellomycetes 12 90 gdm 3 with demospongiae 8 17 and eutardigrada 20 13 gdm 4 with chytridiomycetes 16 35 and saccharomycetes 15 84 respectively such results indicated that the higher organics content in the feed water could significantly drive the evolution of dominant eukaryotic community which resulted from the survival adaptation of eukaryotic in different water environments the demospongiae organisms could display rhythmic body contractions during their normal life activities nickel 2004 chytridiomycetes was a large and diverse group of flagellum protozoa that could move and predate in a larger range of water powell 1994 clitellata relied on the creeping way to forward or turn due to the annelid body structure erseus 2005 eutardigrada was a typical tardigrada metazoan accompanied by the morphological characteristics of the claws and or sucking disks to support activities guidetti et al 2010 the bdelloidea and litostomatea observed in gdm 2 3 could move and swim in water through the cilium or foot and also has stronger predation behavior for the upper microorganism or nutrients chen et al 2021 the presence of diverse eukaryotes with predation and movement ability was of great significance to the flux stabilization and improvements in the gdm system the higher organic content in the feed water of gdm 2 3 supported the eukaryotes movement and predator behavior and thus benefited the formation of a loose and heterogeneous biocake layer contributing to the improvements of stabilized flux level in gdm 2 3 relative to gdm 1 3 4 3 eps and atp quantification at the end of the experiment the concentrations of eps and atp in the biocake layer were determined as illustrated in fig 7 a b the total contents of proteins and polysaccharides increased from gdm 1 to gdm 4 indicating that the accumulation of eps in the gdm system elevated with the increase of organics concentration in feed water numerous studies also showed that the high concentration of eps would result in severe membrane fouling and low flux level tang et al 2018a wang et al 2009 supportively in the present study the level of stable flux was gdm 2 gdm 3 gdm 4 which was consistent with the total production of eps interestingly the gdm 1 had the lowest eps content while its stable flux was lower than that of gdm 2 3 the potential explanation should be that the dense structure of biocake layer served as another main reason for the low stable flux level of gdm 1 the distribution of proteins and polysaccharides showed a similar pattern in gdm 1 to gdm 4 with the concentration of smp higher than the ex eps followed by in eps such results indicated that most eps were accumulated within the biocake layer rather than deposited in the membrane pore which was beneficial to reducing the membrane pore blocking and achieving higher stable flux in addition the atp was quantified to evaluate the microorganism activities within the biocake layer adhered on the membrane surface compared to gdm 1 the atp signal response of biocake layer in gdm 2 4 significantly increased indicating that the bio activity within the biocake layer elevated with the increase of organics concentration in feed water the positive microbial activities would contribute to effectively removing organic contaminants and the higher removal efficiencies of doc and nh4 n also supported this hypothesis see fig 4 besides the heterogeneous and porous structures of biocake layer formed on the membrane surface were also positively impacted by the microbial activities and the higher biological activities would benefit the formation of more heterogeneous and porous biocake layer which was conducive to the improvements of stable flux during long term gdm operation the higher stable flux of gdm 2 3 compared to gdm 1 further verified this assumption 3 4 4 fe and mn element analysis in order to evaluate the mechanism of iron and manganese removal the biocake layer was measured using xps at the end of the experiment the iron and manganese narrow scan spectrum of gdm 1 4 were deconvoluted into different metal valences based on their binding energy location as illustrated in fig 8 a b as shown in fig 8 a the fe 2p spectra could be fitted into fe ii 708 7 ev 721 8 ev and fe iii 711 7 ev 724 8 ev and verified that the fe2 oxidation and the deposition of iron oxides occurred on uf membrane surface liu et al 2022 with respect to manganese the gdm 2 3 exhibited good peaks fitted with multivalent mn while the gdm 1 and gdm 4 with low peak spectrum did not complete the peak fitting especially gdm 4 as present in fig 8 b as previously reported the peaks of mn 2p3 2 ranged at 640 7 ev 641 7 ev and 643 7 ev which was related to the presence of mn ii mn iii and mn iv respectively ilton et al 2016 in gdm 2 and gdm 3 the higher intensities of mn 2p3 2 spectra were observed which indicated that more mnox e g mn ii mn iii and mn iv was generated as a consequence gdm 2 3 conferred a higher auto catalytic oxidation capacity for mn ii removal since the mn iv was conducing to the adsorption of mn ii and the intermediate valence of mn iii with strong oxidation activity could effectively oxidize the mn ii into high valence mn iv sun et al 2021 yang et al 2021 therefore the efficient and stable manganese removal performance of gdm 2 3 should be attributed to the accumulation of more mnox with auto catalytic oxidation capability in contrast the signal intensities of mnox in gdm 1 and gdm 4 were relatively weaker than in gdm 2 3 and consequently the manganese removal efficiencies were relatively lower as presented in fig 3 c d on the other hand as shown in table s1 the c o content proportion increased gradually in gdm 1 92 84 gdm 2 97 39 gdm 3 98 and gdm 4 98 54 indicating that organic matter accumulation on the membrane surface increased from gdm 1 to gdm 4 system nevertheless the excessive organic compounds would cover and wrap the iron and manganese oxides and thus the scan peak spectrum intensity of xps for iron and manganese weakened alongside and noise fluctuations occurred accordingly such as the iron in gdm 1 showed a stronger intensity spectrum than that of gdm 2 4 which further verified that the increase of organic matter would result in the reduction of the spectrum intensity similarly the peak intensity of manganese element in gdm 2 4 gradually declined especially the gdm 4 which could hardly detect a distinct mn peak spectrum such results indicated that the mnox in gdm 4 was covered by the excessive organic compounds which would inhibit the auto catalytic oxidation between mnox and mn2 and thus resulting in the reduction of manganese removal rate though gdm 1 had the least organic compounds interference its peak spectrum intensity of mn was much lower than that in gdm 2 3 since gdm 1 system could not form sufficient mnox and this phenomenon was consistent with the observation in fig 5 and s1 overall it can be inferred that organics substances played a fundamental role in the formation of mnox and then influenced the manganese removal 3 5 mechanism of manganese removal and flux stabilization during the long term filtration both flux stabilization and manganese removal of the gdm system showed differentiation under the different conditions of organics concentrations therefore it s full of relevance to elucidate the effects of organics concentration on the flux stabilization and manganese removal to obtain a systematic understanding of the gdm technique in treating the iron and manganese containing surface water meanwhile the mechanism of organics concentration influenced flux stabilization and manganese removal in gdm filtration was schematically presented in fig 9 3 5 1 effects of organics concentration on gdm flux stabilization previous studies pointed out that the flux stabilization of gdm system was mainly related to the structural characteristics of biocake layer attached on the membrane surface such as porosity double layer structure thickness homogeneity and coverage ding et al 2017 peter varbanets et al 2011 higher porosity and lower coverage of biocake layer were easier to obtain higher stable flux in gdm filtration noticeably the biological activities played an important role in the regulation of biocake layer structures in this study during the initial filtration period of 0 40 days the higher concentration of organic matter was the more serious the membrane fouling occurred which was well in correspondence with the typical theory of membrane fouling caused by organic pollutants on the other hand organic matter could serve as the nutrients to provide energy for the growth proliferation and biological activity of microorganisms to a certain extent liu et al 2002 tang et al 2018b consequently the enhanced biological activities of microorganisms in the gdm system would benefit the formation of biocake layer towards the characteristics of looseness porosity and heterogeneity the structure of biocake layer was in a dynamic equilibrium state due to the self regulation of microorganisms which played a crucial role in the flux stabilization and stabilized flux level during long term gdm operation therefore the advisable concentrations of organic substances would promote the biological activity to engineer a heterogeneous and porous structure of biocake layer which was conducive to achieving a higher stable flux level 3 5 2 effects of organics concentration on manganese removal in the treatment of manganese containing surface water by gdm process the impacts of organic matters on the manganese removal can be evaluated from both the auto catalytic oxidation and biological degradation during the initial filtration the gdm system with high concentration of organic compounds in the feed water conferred a higher manganese removal while the low organics concentration in the feed water resulted in a lower manganese removal efficiency by gdm process since the manganese would react with the organics and particles to form the manganese complex with larger size and then be rejected along with the latter which was in accordance with the typical removal mechanism of manganese in the conventional uf process during long term filtration with the increase of organics concentration in the feed water the manganese removal efficiency also increased significantly as shown in gdm 2 3 the potential explanations were related to i more freshly generated mnox with auto catalytic oxidation capability accumulated within the biocake layer to significantly promote the manganese oxidation and rejection see fig 8 ii the increased organic compounds could serve as the nutrients to facilitate proliferation of manganese oxidizing bacteria and promote the manganese bio oxidation however with the further increase of organics concentration in the feed water though the biological activity characterized by atp was enhanced the manganese removal efficiency reduced as displayed in gdm 4 since the mnox would be wrapped by the excessive organic substances as displayed in fig 8 and consequently resulted in its oxidation capability of manganese therefore the organic matters with a certain content in the feed water were necessary for gdm system regarding its long term stability and manganese removal capability 4 conclusion in summary the specific effects of organics concentration on the gdm technique in treating the iron and manganese containing surface water were investigated low concentration of organic substances in feed water was not beneficial to microbial activities resulting in a denser biocake layer formed on membrane surface and relatively lower stable flux moderate concentration of organic compounds would positively facilitate the microbial activities and benefit to engineering a heterogeneous and porous biocake layer on the membrane surface contributing to the improvements of stable flux at approximately 6 3 l m 2 h 1 while high concentration of organic compounds in the feed water would lead to the increase in the thickness and eps concentration of biocake layer resulting in a flux reduction instead furthermore the organics concentration also conferred a significant influence on the manganese removal increasing the organics concentration in feed water was beneficial to the more accumulation of both mnox and manganese oxidizing bacteria contributing to the improvement of manganese removal however excessive concentration of organic substances in the feed water would cause the wrapping of mnox by the organic foulants and result in a lower manganese removal besides efficient removals of iron doc uv254 nh4 n and fluorescent pollutants were achieved therefore these findings would benefit to the developments of new strategies in the treatment of iron and manganese containing surface water and

15348,when allocating water resources stakeholders such as water departments agricultural sector actors and farmers aim to maximize their benefits this leads to conflicts between water savings food security and profit growth causing major challenges for water managers a hydro economic model was developed to alleviate groundwater sustainability food security and economic growth gfe conflicts through crop pattern optimization this model combines groundwater agronomic and economic sub models to simulate spatiotemporal variations in groundwater level irrigation requirement crop production and net profit the nsga ii algorithm was used to maximize net profits while minimizing groundwater extraction and food reduction through crop pattern optimization in irrigation areas and under crop production constraints then using the baoding plain as the study area three scenarios with no external water supply and nine scenarios with an external water supply of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 km3 y were designed the present crop pattern caused a groundwater decline of 0 32 m y and an overdraft of 0 61 km3 y the three scenarios without external water supply showed different options for maximizing net profit minimizing groundwater extraction and minimizing food reduction without affecting food production food self sufficiency or groundwater sustainability all three scenarios cannot simultaneously satisfy the gfe target with an external water supply of 0 3 km3 y only one scenario met the gfe target with that of 0 6 km3 y all scenarios met the gfe target and with that of 0 9 km3 y groundwater levels increased profits overflowed and food overproduction occurred graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydro economic model crop pattern optimization groundwater food economy trade off external water diversion baoding plain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater provides approximately 70 of the water used in agriculture margat and gun 2013 making it the most important water source for irrigation in arid and semiarid regions aghaie et al 2020 increasing the food demand and dietary changes has led to an increase in agricultural production foley et al 2011 efforts have been made to reduce water stress by optimizing water use and crop patterns rad et al 2020 wang et al 2018 however conflicts remain among the primary stakeholders regional water departments agricultural industries and farmers thus resulting in non cooperative decisions nazari and ahmadi 2019 there is an urgent need to develop a systematic approach to ensure suitable trade offs among each stakeholder s concerns namely groundwater sustainability food security and economic development kahil et al 2015 sun and ren 2014 hydro economic models that combine economic hydrological and other science fields have proven applicable in plausible groundwater management planting adjustment and economic efficiency assessment of water use harou et al 2009 young et al 2021 integrated agronomic economic and hydrological models to assess the best irrigation practices and found that a change to soft cap flexible water use from hard cap in dry and wet years can improve farmers resilience to drought and profitability rad et al 2020 combined three components including agronomic economic and hydrological components into one model framework and testified that an increase in water tax could increase well capacity over time and increase the profitability of agricultural production as these models are primarily developed for groundwater sustainability and its effects on farmers benefits loss the bottom line of food security was not considered while most models can achieve excellent groundwater and profitability optimization few studies have achieved simultaneous optimization of groundwater food and economy gfe the north china plain ncp is a hotspot for groundwater depletion cao et al 2013 there is a constant conflict involving two governmental concerns food security and groundwater depletion ren et al 2018 from high irrigation demand wang and yu 2010 numerous countermeasures have been implemented primarily focusing on groundwater sustainability and food security from the government s viewpoint including optimizing planting structure ren et al 2019 irrigation water saving and wheat fallow zhang et al 2018 with farmers benefits loss covered by government subsidies however farmers are worrying that governmental subsidies may soon disappear therefore there is an urgent need to find an optimized solution for the gfe trade off and to answer the following 1 how much groundwater conservation and farmers profits can be achieved without affecting total food production 2 how much groundwater conservation farmers profits and food production can be achieved with food self dependent 3 how much food production and farmers profits can be remained to achieve groundwater sustainability to address the water shortage in ncp the south north water diversion snwd project was started to deliver water from the yangtze river to the ncp since 2014 barnett et al 2015 however research indicates that if water resources are not allocated efficiently increasing only external water diversion will not alleviate water shortages aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 thus with the increasing external water supply from snwd we should consider how to adjust crop patterns to achieve the best trade off between the minimization of groundwater extraction minimization of food reduction and maximization of farmers net profits based on the optimized crop patterns the changes in groundwater level food production and net profit under various external water diversions can be easily quantified considering the above questions a novel hydro economic model that integrates agronomic economic and groundwater sub models using the naga ii algorithm was proposed and developed to achieve suitable gfe trade offs through crop pattern optimization irrigation requirements and crop production were simulated using the crop model net profits were simulated using the economic model and groundwater exploitation and groundwater level were simulated using modflow a case study in the baoding plain was conducted to demonstrate its application and required procedures first groundwater exploitation crop production and net profit were quantified for actual crop patterns second three scenarios without external water diversion and nine scenarios with an external water supply of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 km3 y were designed finally optimal crop patterns were identified and analyzed in terms of their effects on groundwater use food production and net profit 2 hydro economic modeling framework fig 1 shows the modeling framework of the novel hydro economic model the hydro economic model proposed herein includes four modules nsga ii optimization three objective optimization sub model crop economic and groundwater sub models food water and profit were simultaneously analyzed by the nsga ii optimization sub model fig 1a fig 1b depicts the optimization process flow chart the total crop yield and irrigation requirement in the crop model net profit in the economic model and groundwater level changes in the groundwater model all provide feedback on crop pattern optimization to minimize food reduction and irrigation requirements while maximizing net profit with less spatial variation in groundwater decline the optimization was repeated until a satisfying crop pattern was finally achieved fig 1c depicts the simplified structure of the crop economic and groundwater sub models the modeling framework and formulas are shown below 2 1 crop model formulas irrigation requirements are frequently expressed by subtracting effective precipitation from crop water requirements which are then expressed in terms of potential evapotranspiration yang et al 2010 the equation is given as follows 1 i r i j k w e t c i j k w e p i j k w i a i j k 10 1 where i j k and w denote crop i j subregion k year and w month respectively i r i j k w m3 e t c i j k w mm and e p i j k w mm are the irrigation requirements evapotranspiration and effective precipitation of crop i in w month k year and j subregion respectively i a i j k w ha is the irrigated area of crop i in j subregion k year and w month an empirical formula was used to calculate the effective precipitation e p i j k w china 1993 the crop coefficient method was used to estimate e t c which is the crop evapotranspiration with ideal soil moisture conditions normal crop growth large growing area and high crop yield shen et al 2013 the penman monteith equation is typically used to calculate reference evapotranspiration e t 0 allen et al 1998 the equations are given as follows 2 e t c k c e t 0 3 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where k c e t 0 mm r n mj m2 d g mj m2 d γ kpa c and t c δ kpa c are the crop coefficient reference crop evapotranspiration net radiation on canopy surface soil heat flux psychrometric constant air temperature and saturated vapor pressure curve slope respectively e s kpa and e a kpa are saturated and actual vapor pressure respectively u 2 m s is the wind speed at 2 m above the ground surface the total production of crop i in k year and j subregion is the product of its per unit area yield and irrigation area the equation is given as follows 4 y i j k y i j k i a i j k where y i j k kg and y i j k kg ha are the total production and per unit area yield of crop i in k year and j subregion respectively 2 2 economic model formulas multiple costs and outputs were considered to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of the net profit of each crop the cost profit evaluation method included the following equations 5 n p i j k g p i j k c i j k 6 g p i j k y i j k p i j k 7 c i j k w a i j k i r i j k s i j k m c i j k l i j k f i j k p e i j k p f i j k i a i j k where n p i j k

respectively 2 3 groundwater model formulas a modflow model was established based on gms 10 4 to spatiotemporally simulate groundwater levels the groundwater flow partial differential equation is as follows 8 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s y h t where k x x k y y and k z z are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y and z coordinate axes m d respectively w d 1 is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing the sources and sinks of water with w 0 0 representing flow out of the aquifer system and w 0 0 representing flow into the aquifer system in addition s y m 1 h m and t d are the specific yield hydraulic head and time respectively 2 4 three objective optimization model formulas farmers water departments and agricultural sectors have different preferences for economic profit groundwater sustainability and food security the optimization model consists of the following three objectives 1 maximizing total net profits eq 9 which requires more groundwater to support increased crop production and a greater proportion of high profit crops such as fruits and vegetables 2 minimizing total irrigation requirement or groundwater extraction to achieve a slow groundwater decline eq 10 by decreasing crops irrigated area especially water intensive crops 3 minimizing the total food reduction or maximizing the total food increase rate for all crops eq 11 to improve food security the equations are as follows 9 m a x z 1 i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k n p i j k 10 m i n z 2 i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k i r i j k 11 m i n z 3 i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k y i j k r e a l j 1 j k 1 k y i j k j 1 j k 1 k y i j k r e a l where z 1 rmb z 2 m3 and z 3 m3 are the total net profit irrigation requirement and food reduction rate of all crops respectively i j and k are the total numbers of i j and k to ensure that the optimization results were within a reasonable range we used the extreme historical value of the irrigated area in each subregion and the crop production during the study period as constraints for each crop the constraints are given as follows 12 i a i j m i n i a i j k i a i j m a x 13 y i m i n j 1 j k 1 k y i j k y i m a x where i a i j m i n and i a i j m a x are the minimum and maximum irrigation areas respectively for crop i in the j subregion during the study period y i m i n and y i m a x are the minimum and maximum yields of crop i expected by the decision makers during the study period respectively the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga was one of the first evolutionary algorithms to be successfully applied to optimization problems with multiple objectives srinivas and deb 1994 nsga ii was used to generate pareto solutions for the three objective optimization scheme detailed information about this algorithm is provided in research by deb et al 2002 viekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje vikor is a method for compromising and ranking limited decision making schemes and is regarded as a suitable tool for multi objective decision making opricovic 1998 vikor was used in this study to select an optimal crop pattern with three objectives each weighing 1 3 to trade off gfe 2 5 hydro economic model simulation the hydro economic model simulation operates as follows first irrigation area constraints for each crop in each subregion and total production constraints for each crop in a specific scenario are defined in the nsga ii optimization to ensure the rationality of inputs and outputs fig 1b the decision variables irrigated area for each crop in each subregion and year are initialized under the irrigation area constraints and then input into the nsga ii optimization sub model fig 1a b eqs 9 11 during the optimization process the crop model is used to output the irrigation requirement and food production of different crops in each subregion and year eqs 1 and 4 fig 1c for a given crop pattern while the economic model is used to output the net profit eq 5 fig 1c the nsga ii algorithm is used to generate a set of optimal crop patterns pareto solutions with the goals of minimizing irrigation and food consumption while maximizing net profits fig 1a according to eq 8 the minimum irrigation requirement signifies the minimum groundwater decline after the nsga ii optimization vikor is then used to choose the best optimal crop pattern with gfe trade offs in other words the main objective of the nsga ii optimization is to determine the best irrigation area for each crop in each subregion and year thus in different subregions water use total yield and net profit for each crop change in accordance with the optimal irrigation areas decision next groundwater level variation m y is simulated by inputting the spatiotemporal irrigation requirement into the groundwater model eq 8 fig 1b c to avoid the excessive decline of groundwater levels in some subregions we used standard deviation σ to evaluate the spatial difference in groundwater variation if the σ value under the optimal crop pattern was greater than the actual crop pattern we reduced the maximum irrigation area of each crop in the corresponding subregions with rapid groundwater decline and then re executed nsga ii optimization fig 1b reduced maximum irrigation area constraints reduce irrigation water use and total yield for each crop in the corresponding subregions further slowing groundwater decline since each crop s total production constraint for the whole study region was unchanged during the re optimization the model increased the irrigated area in the subregions with slower groundwater decline to compensate for food reduction in groundwater overused subregions the optimization processes were continuously repeated until the groundwater level evaluation was satisfied standard deviation value lower than the actual crop pattern fig 1b 3 case study application baoding plain 3 1 study area the baoding plain is a typical semi arid agricultural area in the western region of the ncp 114 30 116 20 e 37 20 39 30 n it covers an area of 10 500 km2 and spans 21 counties fig 2 a from 2004 to 2018 an increasing trend in annual precipitation was observed with an average of 490 mm fig 2b over 80 of the annual precipitation occurred from july to september the dominant cropping pattern is winter wheat summer maize rotation followed by vegetables oilseeds and fruits under intensive irrigation yin et al 2022 intensive irrigation induces significant groundwater stress and aquifer depletion from 2004 to 2018 groundwater use declined from 2 66 to 2 04 km3 and irrigation declined from 2 24 to 1 71 km3 fig 2b while groundwater depth decreased from 18 23 m 2004 2018 the rate of groundwater level decline has slowed down since 2015 owing to the increased internal surface water recycled water and external water diversion fig 2c since 2014 great efforts have been made by the government to control groundwater depletion by increasing trans boundary water supply from snwd long et al 2020 and cutting the cultivation of high water consumptive wheat zhang et al 2018 when water and food production are the two major government concerns adjusting crop patterns without influencing farmers benefits is hardly considered moreover global experience strongly indicates that improving the economic efficiency of water use is also a significant technique to solve water shortages therefore a combinational solution to gfe is necessary 3 2 data and methods 3 2 1 irrigation water consumption and crop production in the hydrologic economic model case study we set the crop irrigated area of each subregion and each year of the baoding plain as the optimization decision variable total of 7560 24 21 15 as it is strongly relevant to farmer s economic benefit food security and irrigation water requirement the i r values calculated using eq 1 i j k and w were set at 24 21 15 and 12 represent irrigation consumption e t c and e t 0 were calculated separately by substituting k c and meteorological data table 1 into eqs 2 and 3 the wheat maize soybean peanut cotton vegetables and fruits k c values were based on the results in li et al 2021 and liu 2003 which were calculated based on experimental data from relevant stations similar to luo et al 2021 the k c coefficients of vegetables and fruits were simplified owing to their diversity and complexity during the crop pattern optimization process the yield per unit area y i j k in eq 4 was obtained from the ratio of historical production for crop i in k year and j subregion to its irrigation area based on statistical data from bureau 2018 this approach guarantees that the optimized total crop production y i j k suitably represents the actual per unit area yield levels of each subregion in various years 3 2 2 net profit calculation the net profit for crop i in the j subregion k year was the difference between gross profit and total operation costs eq 5 the government regulates the market prices of wheat maize and oilseeds which are affected by international supply and national demand for vegetables and fruits the prices are influenced by local production and production in neighboring provinces qian et al 2020 wei et al 2012 thus crop price fluctuations in china are relatively smooth making it reasonable to express p i j k in terms of multi year average prices and utilizing it to calculate g p i j k eq 6 to yield the optimized crop pattern the crop prices were converted to the 2019 price levels considering the annual price and producer price index found in the hebei rural statistical yearbook hebei provincial bureau of statistics 2019 and their multi year average was used to express p i j k in wangdu anguo and ding counties the representative agricultural counties we determined the average annual cost per unit area of local irrigation water use w a seed s mechanical cultivation m c labor l fertilizer f pesticide p e and plastic films p f of different crops through surveys with 368 farmers in 2019 ma et al 2022 the survey data showed that mechanical wells draw approximately 40 m3 of groundwater per hour consume approximately 11 rmb of electricity and the unit price of irrigation water withdrawal is 0 28 rmb m3 as irrigation requirement fig 5f calculated by eq 1 accounts for approximately 90 of the actual irrigation exploitation fig 2b from statistic data the irrigation leakage is estimated to be 10 thus the price of i r was considered 1 1 times that of the irrigation requirement e t c or groundwater extraction and equivalent to 0 3 rmb m3 for simplicity the survey results were taken as a representation of the baoding plain region and introduced to eq 7 to calculate the total cost of crop i in k year and j subregion in combination with i a i j k 3 2 3 groundwater simulation modflow was configured in gms10 4 for a three dimensional numerical simulation of transient groundwater flow with a time step of one month and spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 km the model settings of zhang et al 2009 were used to reference the division of phreatic confined aquifers rainfall and river infiltration coefficient and initial hydrological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity specific yield and storage coefficient the initial hydraulic conductivities were adjusted in gms10 4 using the pest package to allow the groundwater model to be more reasonable and reliable the source and sink items included precipitation recharge river and lake recharge lateral inflow and outflow phreatic evaporation groundwater exploitation and irrigation leakage for rainfall processing monthly precipitation point data from meteorological stations were first calculated table 1 then extrapolated by the kriging method to obtain spatial data precipitation recharge was expressed in the groundwater model as the product of spatiotemporal variations in rainfall mm and the rainfall infiltration coefficient which varies from 0 05 to 0 30 river recharge was expressed as the river water area and the river infiltration coefficient table 1 byd lake recharge was estimated from the relationship between lake water level and leakage kailin et al 2018 the lake water level was evaluated from the area of lake water bodies and dem table 1 the spatiotemporal water body boundaries were derived from the global remote sensing data set from pekel et al 2016 the inflow from the western mountains and outflow to the east downstream is determined by the hydraulic conductivity and the water head difference near the boundary using darcy s law phreatic evaporation was represented by et and the evaporation depth was set to 4 m as a reference according to kailin et al 2018 in the groundwater simulation aside from irrigation water pumping e t c calculated from eq 1 plus irrigation leakage groundwater explorations for industrial and domestic water and other water sources were obtained from the bureau 2019 wang 2020 defines the irrigation leakage coefficient as 2 3 of the rainfall infiltration coefficient which varies from 0 03 to 0 20 irrigation leakage in the actual scenario s0 was calculated by multiplying statistical irrigation exploitation by the irrigation infiltration coefficient groundwater extraction for irrigation was treated in crop pattern optimization by adding return flow 10 of i r in eq 1 to the irrigation requirement modflow was calibrated and validated with 15 long term and 88 short term water level observation wells fig 2a and then used to simulate the groundwater level 3 3 scenario configuration we evaluated 12 scenarios 3 with local water resources and 9 with external water supply from snwd the constraints of total crop yield and irrigation area for each scenario are listed in table 2 for convenience scenarios 1 2 and 3 are abbreviated as s1 s2 and s3 respectively then s1 s2 and s3 with an external water recharge of 0 3 r1 0 6 r2 and 0 9 r3 km3 y were respectively abbreviated as s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 s2r1 s2r2 s2r3 s3r1 s3r2 and s3r3 3 3 1 scenario 1 the first scenario was designed to maximize profit while using as little groundwater as possible without affecting total food production in the statistical data fig 2b total irrigation water consumption for crops did not increase or decrease according to the type of hydrological years in previous studies crop fallow crop rotation and irrigation are frequently set up continuously without adjustment in wet and dry years and in different sub regions luo et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 here the nsga ii algorithm increased the irrigation area of crops with lower irrigation consumption wet year higher yield per unit and higher profit under the constraints of total production and irrigation area in each subregion of each crop to find out crop patterns with the lowest water consumption least food reduction and highest net profit statistics show that the annual irrigated area varies from 2004 to 2018 with an average of 0 85 million ha y and a maximum of 1 02 million ha y bureau 2018 the gaps between the actual and maximum irrigation area provide room for crop pattern adjustment s1 is designed to demonstrate how much water saving and profit growth could be achieved through spatiotemporal optimization of crop patterns under the premise of constant food production therefore y i m i n and y i m a x in eq 12 were respectively set to 99 99 and 100 01 of the total yield of crop i in all subregions from 2004 to 2018 to maintain no decrease in total food production historical minimum and maximum irrigation area values for crop i in the j subregion are set as i a i j m i n and i a i j m a x respectively to allow adjustment for a better wue and higher profit table 2 3 3 2 scenario 2 the second scenario was designed for maximum profit minimal groundwater use and minimal food reduction without influencing food self sufficiency thus the crop adjustment allows water to reallocate from water intensive and low profit crops to the opposites which could significantly increase profits without increasing irrigation consumption nazari and ahmadi 2019 according to luo et al 2021 in the beijing tianjin hebei region 21 19 83 and 75 of wheat maize vegetables and fruits were respectively overproduced from 2013 to 2016 since oilseeds in baoding accounts for only a small proportion fig 5a of external purchases wang et al 2022 its lowest limit was set to zero according to the above analysis for the bottom line of food self sufficiency a minimum total yield of 75 of the actual level is set up for wheat and maize the food safety bottom lines of other crops are all lower than wheat but are still uniformly set at 75 to simplify parameter setting when the irrigated area of crop i in the j subregion k year equals its historical maximum the sown area was constrained and therefore the total yield did not increase fig 5a shows that the interannual irrigation area of each crop varies only slightly indicating that even if the irrigation area is set to the lowest value in historical years 100 of the lowest value in history total crop production cannot be reduced to the designed target for the scenario 75 of actual food production as farmers are unwilling to leave all of their land fallow and to avoid too drastic spatial crop pattern adjustment we set the minimum irrigated area constraint for each crop in each subregion as 50 of its lowest historical value 50 i a i j m i n h i s 3 3 3 scenario 3 the third scenario is designed to answer how much profit and crop production can remain by optimizing crop patterns with sustainable groundwater use according to macewan et al 2017 a strict physical definition of groundwater sustainability limits annual pumping to no more than the aquifer recharge to achieve spatiotemporal crop adjustment we defined groundwater sustainability as the average groundwater level that did not decline at the end of the study period in comparison with that of the beginning earlier research shows that in the piedmont region like the baoding plain to stop groundwater decline the minimum reduction in winter wheat will be approximately 47 5 ren et al 2019 or 50 gao et al 2015 of its present production therefore for the s3 purpose the self sufficiency policy for wheat the highest water consumptive crop must be abandoned here we set y i m i n of wheat as 50 of the actual lowest wheat production to avoid excessive reduction of the production in other crops their y i m i n were also set as 50 of the actual the values of i a i j m i n and i a i j m a x were the same as in s2 3 3 4 scenarios with external water supply according to the snwd project design the middle route will deliver approximately 0 55 km3 of water each year to the study area yang et al 2010 in its earlier years from 2015 to 2019 snwd only provided 1 0 km3 https m thepaper cn baijiahao 5230429 of water for the baoding plain in 2020 snwd increased its water delivery and delivered 0 997 km3 of water to the region of which 0 592 km3 was supplied to the rivers for increasing groundwater recharge http slj baoding gov cn content 2 7478 html the snwd provides an alternative source of water for reducing aquifer depletion long et al 2020 in the future external water diversion will contribute more to alleviating water shortages in northern china qin et al 2019 yang et al 2022 and according to the second term snwd design thus in our scenario design 0 3 r1 0 6 r2 and 0 9 r3 km3 y of water supply from snwd are considered three scenarios of external water supply to help stabilize aquifer depletion food security and farmers benefit growth simultaneously the combination scenarios of crop pattern optimization and groundwater recharge are represented as s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 s2r1 s2r2 s2r3 s3r1 s3r2 and s3r3 water diversion from snwd was used primarily to replace groundwater withdrawals of industrial domestic and urban water long et al 2020 which totaled approximately 0 62 km3 in 2017 bureau 2019 thus in modflow we treated the total water of r1 and r2 and 0 6 km3 y of r3 as a planar recharge without water loss and 0 3 km3 y of r3 as a river recharge with water loss the water allocation for each subregion was determined by the proportion of each county s industrial domestic and urban water use bureau 2019 given that there was no significant seasonal variation in the water use we set the monthly groundwater recharge to be equal such a recharge for external water could cause some degree of error for instance water loss in the recharging process but it is an effective way to jointly solve the recharge increase and pumping decrease for city sectors in modflow as for external water recharge through rivers it was carried out in seven selected rivers fig 2a including the juma tang fu sha bao yishui and xiaoyi rivers in the implementation plan of main river ecological water replenishment in baoding city http baoding gov cn content 1163 310709 html according to wang et al 2014 and zhu et al 2019 there is a 22 to 26 water loss during groundwater recharge by river infiltration it is difficult to assess the groundwater recharge of each river s water loss ratio owing to the complex riverbed environment thus the water loss ratio of river s groundwater recharge was unified as 23 and the water allocation of each river is determined by the proportion of each river s length to the length of total rivers in modflow the river package was used to simulate the river recharge with an external water supply of 0 3 km3 y evenly distributed over each month 4 results first we calibrated and verified the modflow and crop models second the spatiotemporal variation in irrigation area crop production net profit groundwater level and irrigation of s0 were characterized using statistical data then the hydro economic model was used to optimize scenarios s1 s2 and s3 to explain the functions of water saving gfe trade off and food economic carrying capacity finally scenarios s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 s2r1 s2r2 s2r3 s3r1 s3r2 and s3r3 were simulated to illustrate the impact of snwt on the gfe 4 1 calibration and validation 4 1 1 groundwater model based on the statistical data a groundwater model was established calibrated and verified using parameter adjustment and model validity verification in modflow 15 monitoring wells of groundwater levels from 2004 to 2006 2007 to 2015 and 2017 to 2018 were used as long term calibration verification points and 88 monitoring wells of groundwater levels in 2006 12 were used for flow field verification fig 2a the nash coefficients nse of long term calibration and validation were 0 31 to 0 93 and 0 34 to 0 76 and the determination coefficients r2 were 0 4 to 0 94 and 0 39 to 0 91 fig 3 a for flow field validation the nse and r2 were 0 91 and 0 97 the actual and simulated groundwater levels coincided fig 3b the error between the simulated and actual flow field for the calibrated model was minor at the start of the operation 2004 01 but gradually increased over time we chose the end of the calibration period 2006 12 the phase with the greatest error to demonstrate the acceptance of the simulated groundwater level in comparison with the observations fig 3b in the absence of long term flow field observation data long term observation wells from 2007 01 to 2018 12 were used to validate the model the calibration and validation results of the long term groundwater level monitoring wells and the flow field show that the simulation and prediction functions of the model are reliable 4 1 2 crop model in this study the k c coefficient observed at the experimental site was applied to the baoding plain scale to calculate the total irrigation consumption m3 there is still a need to testify to the reliability of the k c value for the irrigation requirement calculation in eq 1 the e t c validity for each crop from our study was compared with the results of liu 2003 k c coefficient method from experimental results and yang et al 2010 experimental based pan specific coefficient fig 4 shows that each crop s monthly variation in e t c is nearly consistent and implies the reliability of the method for estimation of water consumption the main cause for the gaps in cotton e t c is the difference in sowing date and plant density for the vegetables and fruits gaps it is caused by the difference in the mixture of species the total irrigation consumption for each year was calculated using eq 1 a r 2 of 0 72 between i r fig 5 f and statistical irrigation water use fig 2b verifies the inter annual consistency of the modeled ir i r is 0 19 km3 y or 10 9 lower than the statistical irrigation which is roughly equal to the irrigation leakage rate 10 to 13 zhang et al 2009 the annual i r calculated by the crop model is consistent with actual irrigation consumption which is critical for accurate groundwater simulation 4 2 spatiotemporal gfe trade offs of actual crop pattern s0 4 2 1 gfe temporal variation in the actual crop pattern s0 the annual average irrigation area under wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits was 35 0 35 4 8 2 15 6 and 5 8 of the total value respectively with no discernible variation except for 2017 to 2018 fig 5a in 2017 the irrigation area under oilseeds vegetables and fruits fell by 2 1 4 3 and 1 6 respectively compared to those in 2016 and remained essentially unchanged in 2018 fig 5a the annual irrigation amount varied significantly between years and had a significant negative correlation with rainfall r2 61 figs 2b and 5b wheat was the most water intensive crop followed by vegetables oilseeds maize and fruits with water uses of 0 96 0 24 0 12 0 12 and 0 11 km3 y respectively variations in irrigation areas had the strongest impact on the production and profit of vegetables total crop production and profit increased from 2004 to 2016 primarily owing to the increased output of wheat maize and vegetables fig 5c d wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits produced annual production of 2 13 2 48 0 27 7 67 and 1 28 million tons y respectively with earnings of 2 70 3 17 1 33 21 26 and 1 27 billion rmb y fig 5c d the ratio of total profit to irrigation water is termed economic water efficiency ewe ewe showed an upward trend with significant inter annual variation 2004 2008 and 2016 were significantly higher fig 5e according to the groundwater budget in s0 the average annual groundwater recharge discharge and balances were 1 62 2 23 and 0 61 km3 y respectively with the negative balance or groundwater depletion showing a downward trend after 2014 fig 5f precipitation and lateral flow accounted for 83 and 10 of the total recharge respectively while irrigation water accounted for 82 of the total discharge rivers and lakes played minor roles in groundwater recharge other water consumers include domestic and industrial applications and the cultivation of other crops 4 2 2 gfe spatial variation fig 6 a f show the spatial variation of all factors relevant to groundwater economy and food production in fig 6a the subregions were roughly divided into three zones based on crop proportions the annual average irrigation areas in zones i ii and iii were 19 161 64 079 and 33 674 ha y respectively from zones i to iii the proportion of irrigated areas for wheat 26 37 38 maize 32 36 40 and oilseeds 4 7 and 12 increased while that for economic crops vegetables 22 15 and 9 and fruits 15 3 2 decreased irrigation water consumption production and net profit of crops in regions i ii and iii and their total amount distribution are consistent with irrigation area indicating that irrigation area is the primary driving factor for the change in gfe fig 6a d furthermore by adjusting the irrigation area ratio between noneconomic crops and economic crops the net profit can be significantly increased shunping county for example had a lower irrigation area 2 261 ha y than rongcheng county its net profit however was 0 64 billion rmb y higher fig 6a d in fig 6e ewe varied significantly from county to county from 7 to 43 rmb m3 anxin and yi counties and declined from west to east with an average of 28 20 and 12 rmb m3 in zones i ii and iii respectively suggesting a considerable potential to increased farmer economic profit groundwater levels also changed vastly σ 0 3 from a slow decline in the northeast and quick depletion in the southwest fig 6f showing strong demand for groundwater regulation in scenario simulations for example the groundwater levels rose by 0 2 m y in anxin and rongcheng counties and remained unchanged in zhuo county but decreased by 0 79 and 0 95 m y in wangdu and ding counties respectively fig 6f 4 3 results of scenarios without external water supply table 3 shows food production from the optimized crop pattern and the corresponding irrigation water use net profit and ewe as a scenario designed not to influence the total yield of each crop s1 maintains crop production like s0 by reducing irrigation by 0 05 km3 y slightly increasing profits by 0 16 billion rmb y and ewe by 0 86 rmb m3 according to s2 wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits productions decreased by 0 53 0 55 0 07 0 67 and 0 28 million tons y resulting in a 0 34 km3 y decrease in irrigation a 0 05 billion rmb increase in profits and a 5 39 rmb m3 increase in ewe in s3 aiming to achieve groundwater sustainability irrigation decreases by 0 61 km3 y in contrast wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits productions decrease by 1 07 0 55 0 1 0 16 and 0 35 million tons y respectively with profits falling by 3 34 billion rmb y and ewe rising by 8 82 rmb m3 using s3 as a baseline the overexploitation of irrigation water in s0 s1 and s2 was 0 61 0 55 and 0 26 km3 y respectively under current water availability and object sets s1 s2 and s3 improve the trade off of water food profit under the target of no food influence food self dependence and groundwater sustainability however without an external water supply all scenarios cannot simultaneously achieve food security groundwater sustainability and profit growth 4 3 1 temporal variation of gfe in s1 s2 and s3 as shown in fig 7 changes in irrigation and crop production primarily caused by variations in the irrigation area for each crop affected groundwater levels and net profit the groundwater levels of s1 s2 and s3 were 0 64 2 48 and 4 22 m higher than that of s0 at the end of the study period 2018 12 respectively fig 7a c compared to s0 the annual irrigated area of s1 in wet dry and normal years changed by 62 9 116 5 and 17 6 thousand hectares s2 by 124 7 238 6 and 132 0 thousand hectares and s3 by 232 0 283 5 and 254 1 thousand hectares fig 7d f variation trends in irrigation crop production and profits fig 7g o were like those in irrigation areas the variation trends of irrigation crop production and net profit of each crop and their accumulated value were consistent with the irrigated area but the magnitude of change varied greatly fig 7d o taking s1 as an example compared to s0 the annual irrigation changed in wet dry and normal years by 0 09 0 29 and 0 01 km3 y respectively while crop production changed by 16 123 2 24 177 9 and 4 983 3 thousand tons y and net profit changed by 3 92 5 40 and 1 19 billion rmb y fig 7g j m in s2 and s3 the irrigation production and profit time trends were comparable to those in s1 for irrigation water conservation in s1 the irrigation reductions for wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits were 28 77 14 01 19 19 22 56 and 15 46 respectively fig 7g wheat conserved significantly more water in s2 and s3 than in the other crops making up 78 23 and 80 63 of the total irrigation reduction respectively fig 7h i vegetables were a significant factor in the economic benefit variations of s1 ranging from 8 78 to 7 54 billion rmb y fig 7m s2 decreased the production and profit of other crops while increasing the overall production and profit of vegetables fig 7k n excluding some years vegetables in 2008 2009 2017 and 2018 all crops in s3 saw a significant decline in production and profit fig 7l o 4 3 2 spatial variation of gfe in s1 s2 and s3 fig 8 shows the spatial results of the simulation for s1 s2 and s3 to facilitate spatial analysis subregions of s1 were divided into increased decreased and mixed irrigated zones based on the rise or fall of the irrigated area for most crops fig 8a spatially crop irrigation was adjusted based on groundwater depletion in fig 6f to balance the spatial groundwater level the crop irrigation area decreased in the southeast and increased in the northwest although the groundwater level in ding county continued to fall rapidly the optimized crop pattern alleviated water resource pressure in the southeastern area by transferring some water intensive crops such as wheat vegetables and fruits to water rich areas such as zhuo tang and wangdu counties fig 8a m the standard deviation of groundwater level fluctuation σ in s1 s2 and s3 is 0 28 0 25 and 0 24 which are all lower than in s0 the spatial variation trend of the irrigated area in s2 and s3 was like that in s1 but the adjustment range was significantly different due to the different scenario setting goals fig 8e i in s2 the irrigation areas of wheat and maize decreased in all zones except in wangdu county where wheat increased by 3 81 fig 8e moreover the irrigated oilseed area increased by 1 9 15 2 22 3 and 32 9 in xiong baoding mancheng and rongcheng counties respectively and the vegetable area increased while the fruit area decreased in most zones s3 reduced the irrigation areas for almost all crops in all zones to varying degrees fig 8i the spatial characteristics of irrigation crop production and net profit were consistent with the irrigation area but the adjustment ranges were different owing to the gaps in i r y and n p per unit area with a strong adjustment for irrigation water reduction the net profit in s3 can hardly increase which shows the negative impact of large crop reduction on crop food production and profit fig 8k l the optimal crop pattern increased groundwater extraction in the lightly exploited zones otherwise it decreased groundwater extraction fig 8m o 4 4 results of scenarios with external water supply differing external water supply amounts further increased groundwater availability food safety and agricultural net profit to various degrees based on scenarios s1 s2 and s3 table 4 fig 9 under new water supply conditions with an external water supply of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 km3 y the hydro economic model optimized the crop pattern the feedback effects on food profit and groundwater can be seen in table 4 fig 9 shows that aside from s1r1 nearly all scenarios can meet groundwater sustainability over the simulation period to guarantee no decrease in food production and groundwater at least 0 6 km3 y of external water should be provided fig 9a table 4 an external water supply of 0 3 km3 y can only provide enough water to guarantee local food self sufficiency with a slight groundwater level decline fig 9b table 4 considering the governmental concern on food only scenarios s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 and s3r3 can be selected table 4 specifically in the case of s3r3 an optimized combination of water food profit can be simultaneously met however s3r3 will significantly increase agricultural water use by 0 35 km3 y which water redline or water cap cannot accept from the point of farmers profit and no significant increase in total water use the best choices would be s2r2 and s3r2 table 4 of which the farmers profit would increase by 6 96 and 7 07 billion rmb y particularly for scenario s2r2 in comparison to s1r2 the net profit for 1 m3 of external water can be as high as 24 4 rmb m3 suggesting considerable potential for crop adjustment however in actuality there could be labor limitations in different counties 5 discussions 5 1 model s function improvement on the trade off of multi factors previous hydro economic models mostly focused on outcomes of groundwater and farmers profitability young et al 2021 irrigation and groundwater balance haacker et al 2019 water saving and grain rising sun and ren 2014 or mainly the trade off of two factors as there are increasing concerns relevant to groundwater use three major factors water food farmer s profit in ncp and the hydro economic model based on the coupling of agronomic hydrological and groundwater models become more significant in the decision making processes in our study the nsga ii algorithm an effective tool for optimization of multi objective deb et al 2002 luo et al 2021 nazari and ahmadi 2019 was used to determine the best crop pattern by regulating the irrigated area and crop compositions in each county and each year by changing the irrigated area and proportions of each crop in each subregion the total groundwater extraction food production and farmers profit are then regulated the optimization system is therefore able to not only construct the linkages among the gfe but also develop the feedback mechanism for example groundwater overdraft will provide feedback on the nsga ii to re optimize irrigated areas and decrease high water consumptive crops and then feedback on the food production and crop profit to avoid over adjustment on irrigation area and crop composition which may influence aspects such as local food security or food self dependence a series of constraints or preconditions is set up to limit the over reduction of total irrigated area total food production and proportional increase or decrease of each crop hence the model allows more preconditions to be set up for the optimization processes which increase the feasibility of the model s adjustment and improve the model s capability in multi objective decision making not limited to the water food profit nexus 5 2 reliability and limitations of the model taking baoding as an example the model is calibrated and validated to look at various crop adjustment options for groundwater management the simulation results of s0 for the current condition of crop pattern and water use show that the annual groundwater deficit from 2004 to 2018 is 0 61 km3 y fig 5f such overdraft is similar to 0 57 km3 y the result of wang 2020 through groundwater simulation and slightly lower than the result of 0 67 km3 y by moiwo et al 2010 as one of the most critical driving forces for groundwater simulation in s0 the total estimated irrigation water in fig 5b is similar to the irrigation result for baoding by bai et al 2019 in general the calibration and validation results of groundwater level water storage change spatial variation of the groundwater flow field and input and output variables all testify that the groundwater model has a good simulation function fig 3 while the model demonstrates various possibilities of gfe under the 12 designed scenarios it also has several limitations which may influence the model s results first the crop pattern is determined automatically through nsga ii optimization such ideal decisions for crop pattern adjustment may not be very suitable for farmers for various reasons for instance our profit setting was drawn from crop prices in the statistical book and production costs from the survey of 368 families ma et al 2022 this reflects the actual state of crop profit especially the profit differences between crop types the profit for main crops wheat and maize is less variable but not for vegetables or fruits also the cultivation of vegetables and fruits needs additional labor next we simplified our scenario for external water use from snwd by injecting water below and above 0 6 km3 into aquifers and river infiltration respectively for the external water for industrial and domestic water use which is the major purpose of snwd water use groundwater extraction will be simply replaced by snwd water in general groundwater replacement by snwd water in the city sector could be like our scenario design however there is thus far less evidence on how many percentages of external water supplies are recharged into the aquifer through river infiltration according to the available experimental data wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 water delivered to rivers for groundwater recharge has a very high efficiency owing to the strong infiltration rate in the natural river bed but there is still a lack of conclusive data on how much water is delivered into natural rivers and how much water is delivered into water bodies lined with concrete to stop leakage such a shortage in the scenario design is expected to be solved in the future when more updated observations are available 6 conclusion a novel hydro economic model was used to determine the best crop pattern options for groundwater sustainability food security and farmer benefit growth with and without snwd water supply for baoding in the north china plain the model constructed the linkage and feedback between water food profit by combining crop economic and groundwater models with an additional nsga ii algorithm for current conditions our simulation shows groundwater declines at a rate of 0 32 m y resulting in an overdraft of 0 61 km3 y the simulation shows that it is difficult to simultaneously achieve food security groundwater sustainability and profit growth under current groundwater conditions however gfe conflicts can be mitigated and traded off by optimizing crop patterns under the scenarios with food production unchanged food self sufficiency or groundwater sustainability farmers profits and food production will be heavily influenced to maintain groundwater sustainability scenario simulations also showed that snwd provides strong support for achieving groundwater sustainability food security and profit increase with an external water supply of 0 3 km3 y the groundwater and profit goals can be met in s2r1 with food self sufficiency when an external water supply of 0 6 or 0 9 km3 y is provided all gfe targets can potentially be achieved in the short term as an external water supply of 0 9 km3 y is only available in the second snwd expansion term both s1r2 and s2r2 with an external water supply of 0 6 km3 y may be the suitable choice for practical application data availability statement the

15348,when allocating water resources stakeholders such as water departments agricultural sector actors and farmers aim to maximize their benefits this leads to conflicts between water savings food security and profit growth causing major challenges for water managers a hydro economic model was developed to alleviate groundwater sustainability food security and economic growth gfe conflicts through crop pattern optimization this model combines groundwater agronomic and economic sub models to simulate spatiotemporal variations in groundwater level irrigation requirement crop production and net profit the nsga ii algorithm was used to maximize net profits while minimizing groundwater extraction and food reduction through crop pattern optimization in irrigation areas and under crop production constraints then using the baoding plain as the study area three scenarios with no external water supply and nine scenarios with an external water supply of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 km3 y were designed the present crop pattern caused a groundwater decline of 0 32 m y and an overdraft of 0 61 km3 y the three scenarios without external water supply showed different options for maximizing net profit minimizing groundwater extraction and minimizing food reduction without affecting food production food self sufficiency or groundwater sustainability all three scenarios cannot simultaneously satisfy the gfe target with an external water supply of 0 3 km3 y only one scenario met the gfe target with that of 0 6 km3 y all scenarios met the gfe target and with that of 0 9 km3 y groundwater levels increased profits overflowed and food overproduction occurred graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydro economic model crop pattern optimization groundwater food economy trade off external water diversion baoding plain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater provides approximately 70 of the water used in agriculture margat and gun 2013 making it the most important water source for irrigation in arid and semiarid regions aghaie et al 2020 increasing the food demand and dietary changes has led to an increase in agricultural production foley et al 2011 efforts have been made to reduce water stress by optimizing water use and crop patterns rad et al 2020 wang et al 2018 however conflicts remain among the primary stakeholders regional water departments agricultural industries and farmers thus resulting in non cooperative decisions nazari and ahmadi 2019 there is an urgent need to develop a systematic approach to ensure suitable trade offs among each stakeholder s concerns namely groundwater sustainability food security and economic development kahil et al 2015 sun and ren 2014 hydro economic models that combine economic hydrological and other science fields have proven applicable in plausible groundwater management planting adjustment and economic efficiency assessment of water use harou et al 2009 young et al 2021 integrated agronomic economic and hydrological models to assess the best irrigation practices and found that a change to soft cap flexible water use from hard cap in dry and wet years can improve farmers resilience to drought and profitability rad et al 2020 combined three components including agronomic economic and hydrological components into one model framework and testified that an increase in water tax could increase well capacity over time and increase the profitability of agricultural production as these models are primarily developed for groundwater sustainability and its effects on farmers benefits loss the bottom line of food security was not considered while most models can achieve excellent groundwater and profitability optimization few studies have achieved simultaneous optimization of groundwater food and economy gfe the north china plain ncp is a hotspot for groundwater depletion cao et al 2013 there is a constant conflict involving two governmental concerns food security and groundwater depletion ren et al 2018 from high irrigation demand wang and yu 2010 numerous countermeasures have been implemented primarily focusing on groundwater sustainability and food security from the government s viewpoint including optimizing planting structure ren et al 2019 irrigation water saving and wheat fallow zhang et al 2018 with farmers benefits loss covered by government subsidies however farmers are worrying that governmental subsidies may soon disappear therefore there is an urgent need to find an optimized solution for the gfe trade off and to answer the following 1 how much groundwater conservation and farmers profits can be achieved without affecting total food production 2 how much groundwater conservation farmers profits and food production can be achieved with food self dependent 3 how much food production and farmers profits can be remained to achieve groundwater sustainability to address the water shortage in ncp the south north water diversion snwd project was started to deliver water from the yangtze river to the ncp since 2014 barnett et al 2015 however research indicates that if water resources are not allocated efficiently increasing only external water diversion will not alleviate water shortages aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 thus with the increasing external water supply from snwd we should consider how to adjust crop patterns to achieve the best trade off between the minimization of groundwater extraction minimization of food reduction and maximization of farmers net profits based on the optimized crop patterns the changes in groundwater level food production and net profit under various external water diversions can be easily quantified considering the above questions a novel hydro economic model that integrates agronomic economic and groundwater sub models using the naga ii algorithm was proposed and developed to achieve suitable gfe trade offs through crop pattern optimization irrigation requirements and crop production were simulated using the crop model net profits were simulated using the economic model and groundwater exploitation and groundwater level were simulated using modflow a case study in the baoding plain was conducted to demonstrate its application and required procedures first groundwater exploitation crop production and net profit were quantified for actual crop patterns second three scenarios without external water diversion and nine scenarios with an external water supply of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 km3 y were designed finally optimal crop patterns were identified and analyzed in terms of their effects on groundwater use food production and net profit 2 hydro economic modeling framework fig 1 shows the modeling framework of the novel hydro economic model the hydro economic model proposed herein includes four modules nsga ii optimization three objective optimization sub model crop economic and groundwater sub models food water and profit were simultaneously analyzed by the nsga ii optimization sub model fig 1a fig 1b depicts the optimization process flow chart the total crop yield and irrigation requirement in the crop model net profit in the economic model and groundwater level changes in the groundwater model all provide feedback on crop pattern optimization to minimize food reduction and irrigation requirements while maximizing net profit with less spatial variation in groundwater decline the optimization was repeated until a satisfying crop pattern was finally achieved fig 1c depicts the simplified structure of the crop economic and groundwater sub models the modeling framework and formulas are shown below 2 1 crop model formulas irrigation requirements are frequently expressed by subtracting effective precipitation from crop water requirements which are then expressed in terms of potential evapotranspiration yang et al 2010 the equation is given as follows 1 i r i j k w e t c i j k w e p i j k w i a i j k 10 1 where i j k and w denote crop i j subregion k year and w month respectively i r i j k w m3 e t c i j k w mm and e p i j k w mm are the irrigation requirements evapotranspiration and effective precipitation of crop i in w month k year and j subregion respectively i a i j k w ha is the irrigated area of crop i in j subregion k year and w month an empirical formula was used to calculate the effective precipitation e p i j k w china 1993 the crop coefficient method was used to estimate e t c which is the crop evapotranspiration with ideal soil moisture conditions normal crop growth large growing area and high crop yield shen et al 2013 the penman monteith equation is typically used to calculate reference evapotranspiration e t 0 allen et al 1998 the equations are given as follows 2 e t c k c e t 0 3 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where k c e t 0 mm r n mj m2 d g mj m2 d γ kpa c and t c δ kpa c are the crop coefficient reference crop evapotranspiration net radiation on canopy surface soil heat flux psychrometric constant air temperature and saturated vapor pressure curve slope respectively e s kpa and e a kpa are saturated and actual vapor pressure respectively u 2 m s is the wind speed at 2 m above the ground surface the total production of crop i in k year and j subregion is the product of its per unit area yield and irrigation area the equation is given as follows 4 y i j k y i j k i a i j k where y i j k kg and y i j k kg ha are the total production and per unit area yield of crop i in k year and j subregion respectively 2 2 economic model formulas multiple costs and outputs were considered to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of the net profit of each crop the cost profit evaluation method included the following equations 5 n p i j k g p i j k c i j k 6 g p i j k y i j k p i j k 7 c i j k w a i j k i r i j k s i j k m c i j k l i j k f i j k p e i j k p f i j k i a i j k where n p i j k

respectively 2 3 groundwater model formulas a modflow model was established based on gms 10 4 to spatiotemporally simulate groundwater levels the groundwater flow partial differential equation is as follows 8 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s y h t where k x x k y y and k z z are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y and z coordinate axes m d respectively w d 1 is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing the sources and sinks of water with w 0 0 representing flow out of the aquifer system and w 0 0 representing flow into the aquifer system in addition s y m 1 h m and t d are the specific yield hydraulic head and time respectively 2 4 three objective optimization model formulas farmers water departments and agricultural sectors have different preferences for economic profit groundwater sustainability and food security the optimization model consists of the following three objectives 1 maximizing total net profits eq 9 which requires more groundwater to support increased crop production and a greater proportion of high profit crops such as fruits and vegetables 2 minimizing total irrigation requirement or groundwater extraction to achieve a slow groundwater decline eq 10 by decreasing crops irrigated area especially water intensive crops 3 minimizing the total food reduction or maximizing the total food increase rate for all crops eq 11 to improve food security the equations are as follows 9 m a x z 1 i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k n p i j k 10 m i n z 2 i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k i r i j k 11 m i n z 3 i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k y i j k r e a l j 1 j k 1 k y i j k j 1 j k 1 k y i j k r e a l where z 1 rmb z 2 m3 and z 3 m3 are the total net profit irrigation requirement and food reduction rate of all crops respectively i j and k are the total numbers of i j and k to ensure that the optimization results were within a reasonable range we used the extreme historical value of the irrigated area in each subregion and the crop production during the study period as constraints for each crop the constraints are given as follows 12 i a i j m i n i a i j k i a i j m a x 13 y i m i n j 1 j k 1 k y i j k y i m a x where i a i j m i n and i a i j m a x are the minimum and maximum irrigation areas respectively for crop i in the j subregion during the study period y i m i n and y i m a x are the minimum and maximum yields of crop i expected by the decision makers during the study period respectively the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga was one of the first evolutionary algorithms to be successfully applied to optimization problems with multiple objectives srinivas and deb 1994 nsga ii was used to generate pareto solutions for the three objective optimization scheme detailed information about this algorithm is provided in research by deb et al 2002 viekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje vikor is a method for compromising and ranking limited decision making schemes and is regarded as a suitable tool for multi objective decision making opricovic 1998 vikor was used in this study to select an optimal crop pattern with three objectives each weighing 1 3 to trade off gfe 2 5 hydro economic model simulation the hydro economic model simulation operates as follows first irrigation area constraints for each crop in each subregion and total production constraints for each crop in a specific scenario are defined in the nsga ii optimization to ensure the rationality of inputs and outputs fig 1b the decision variables irrigated area for each crop in each subregion and year are initialized under the irrigation area constraints and then input into the nsga ii optimization sub model fig 1a b eqs 9 11 during the optimization process the crop model is used to output the irrigation requirement and food production of different crops in each subregion and year eqs 1 and 4 fig 1c for a given crop pattern while the economic model is used to output the net profit eq 5 fig 1c the nsga ii algorithm is used to generate a set of optimal crop patterns pareto solutions with the goals of minimizing irrigation and food consumption while maximizing net profits fig 1a according to eq 8 the minimum irrigation requirement signifies the minimum groundwater decline after the nsga ii optimization vikor is then used to choose the best optimal crop pattern with gfe trade offs in other words the main objective of the nsga ii optimization is to determine the best irrigation area for each crop in each subregion and year thus in different subregions water use total yield and net profit for each crop change in accordance with the optimal irrigation areas decision next groundwater level variation m y is simulated by inputting the spatiotemporal irrigation requirement into the groundwater model eq 8 fig 1b c to avoid the excessive decline of groundwater levels in some subregions we used standard deviation σ to evaluate the spatial difference in groundwater variation if the σ value under the optimal crop pattern was greater than the actual crop pattern we reduced the maximum irrigation area of each crop in the corresponding subregions with rapid groundwater decline and then re executed nsga ii optimization fig 1b reduced maximum irrigation area constraints reduce irrigation water use and total yield for each crop in the corresponding subregions further slowing groundwater decline since each crop s total production constraint for the whole study region was unchanged during the re optimization the model increased the irrigated area in the subregions with slower groundwater decline to compensate for food reduction in groundwater overused subregions the optimization processes were continuously repeated until the groundwater level evaluation was satisfied standard deviation value lower than the actual crop pattern fig 1b 3 case study application baoding plain 3 1 study area the baoding plain is a typical semi arid agricultural area in the western region of the ncp 114 30 116 20 e 37 20 39 30 n it covers an area of 10 500 km2 and spans 21 counties fig 2 a from 2004 to 2018 an increasing trend in annual precipitation was observed with an average of 490 mm fig 2b over 80 of the annual precipitation occurred from july to september the dominant cropping pattern is winter wheat summer maize rotation followed by vegetables oilseeds and fruits under intensive irrigation yin et al 2022 intensive irrigation induces significant groundwater stress and aquifer depletion from 2004 to 2018 groundwater use declined from 2 66 to 2 04 km3 and irrigation declined from 2 24 to 1 71 km3 fig 2b while groundwater depth decreased from 18 23 m 2004 2018 the rate of groundwater level decline has slowed down since 2015 owing to the increased internal surface water recycled water and external water diversion fig 2c since 2014 great efforts have been made by the government to control groundwater depletion by increasing trans boundary water supply from snwd long et al 2020 and cutting the cultivation of high water consumptive wheat zhang et al 2018 when water and food production are the two major government concerns adjusting crop patterns without influencing farmers benefits is hardly considered moreover global experience strongly indicates that improving the economic efficiency of water use is also a significant technique to solve water shortages therefore a combinational solution to gfe is necessary 3 2 data and methods 3 2 1 irrigation water consumption and crop production in the hydrologic economic model case study we set the crop irrigated area of each subregion and each year of the baoding plain as the optimization decision variable total of 7560 24 21 15 as it is strongly relevant to farmer s economic benefit food security and irrigation water requirement the i r values calculated using eq 1 i j k and w were set at 24 21 15 and 12 represent irrigation consumption e t c and e t 0 were calculated separately by substituting k c and meteorological data table 1 into eqs 2 and 3 the wheat maize soybean peanut cotton vegetables and fruits k c values were based on the results in li et al 2021 and liu 2003 which were calculated based on experimental data from relevant stations similar to luo et al 2021 the k c coefficients of vegetables and fruits were simplified owing to their diversity and complexity during the crop pattern optimization process the yield per unit area y i j k in eq 4 was obtained from the ratio of historical production for crop i in k year and j subregion to its irrigation area based on statistical data from bureau 2018 this approach guarantees that the optimized total crop production y i j k suitably represents the actual per unit area yield levels of each subregion in various years 3 2 2 net profit calculation the net profit for crop i in the j subregion k year was the difference between gross profit and total operation costs eq 5 the government regulates the market prices of wheat maize and oilseeds which are affected by international supply and national demand for vegetables and fruits the prices are influenced by local production and production in neighboring provinces qian et al 2020 wei et al 2012 thus crop price fluctuations in china are relatively smooth making it reasonable to express p i j k in terms of multi year average prices and utilizing it to calculate g p i j k eq 6 to yield the optimized crop pattern the crop prices were converted to the 2019 price levels considering the annual price and producer price index found in the hebei rural statistical yearbook hebei provincial bureau of statistics 2019 and their multi year average was used to express p i j k in wangdu anguo and ding counties the representative agricultural counties we determined the average annual cost per unit area of local irrigation water use w a seed s mechanical cultivation m c labor l fertilizer f pesticide p e and plastic films p f of different crops through surveys with 368 farmers in 2019 ma et al 2022 the survey data showed that mechanical wells draw approximately 40 m3 of groundwater per hour consume approximately 11 rmb of electricity and the unit price of irrigation water withdrawal is 0 28 rmb m3 as irrigation requirement fig 5f calculated by eq 1 accounts for approximately 90 of the actual irrigation exploitation fig 2b from statistic data the irrigation leakage is estimated to be 10 thus the price of i r was considered 1 1 times that of the irrigation requirement e t c or groundwater extraction and equivalent to 0 3 rmb m3 for simplicity the survey results were taken as a representation of the baoding plain region and introduced to eq 7 to calculate the total cost of crop i in k year and j subregion in combination with i a i j k 3 2 3 groundwater simulation modflow was configured in gms10 4 for a three dimensional numerical simulation of transient groundwater flow with a time step of one month and spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 km the model settings of zhang et al 2009 were used to reference the division of phreatic confined aquifers rainfall and river infiltration coefficient and initial hydrological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity specific yield and storage coefficient the initial hydraulic conductivities were adjusted in gms10 4 using the pest package to allow the groundwater model to be more reasonable and reliable the source and sink items included precipitation recharge river and lake recharge lateral inflow and outflow phreatic evaporation groundwater exploitation and irrigation leakage for rainfall processing monthly precipitation point data from meteorological stations were first calculated table 1 then extrapolated by the kriging method to obtain spatial data precipitation recharge was expressed in the groundwater model as the product of spatiotemporal variations in rainfall mm and the rainfall infiltration coefficient which varies from 0 05 to 0 30 river recharge was expressed as the river water area and the river infiltration coefficient table 1 byd lake recharge was estimated from the relationship between lake water level and leakage kailin et al 2018 the lake water level was evaluated from the area of lake water bodies and dem table 1 the spatiotemporal water body boundaries were derived from the global remote sensing data set from pekel et al 2016 the inflow from the western mountains and outflow to the east downstream is determined by the hydraulic conductivity and the water head difference near the boundary using darcy s law phreatic evaporation was represented by et and the evaporation depth was set to 4 m as a reference according to kailin et al 2018 in the groundwater simulation aside from irrigation water pumping e t c calculated from eq 1 plus irrigation leakage groundwater explorations for industrial and domestic water and other water sources were obtained from the bureau 2019 wang 2020 defines the irrigation leakage coefficient as 2 3 of the rainfall infiltration coefficient which varies from 0 03 to 0 20 irrigation leakage in the actual scenario s0 was calculated by multiplying statistical irrigation exploitation by the irrigation infiltration coefficient groundwater extraction for irrigation was treated in crop pattern optimization by adding return flow 10 of i r in eq 1 to the irrigation requirement modflow was calibrated and validated with 15 long term and 88 short term water level observation wells fig 2a and then used to simulate the groundwater level 3 3 scenario configuration we evaluated 12 scenarios 3 with local water resources and 9 with external water supply from snwd the constraints of total crop yield and irrigation area for each scenario are listed in table 2 for convenience scenarios 1 2 and 3 are abbreviated as s1 s2 and s3 respectively then s1 s2 and s3 with an external water recharge of 0 3 r1 0 6 r2 and 0 9 r3 km3 y were respectively abbreviated as s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 s2r1 s2r2 s2r3 s3r1 s3r2 and s3r3 3 3 1 scenario 1 the first scenario was designed to maximize profit while using as little groundwater as possible without affecting total food production in the statistical data fig 2b total irrigation water consumption for crops did not increase or decrease according to the type of hydrological years in previous studies crop fallow crop rotation and irrigation are frequently set up continuously without adjustment in wet and dry years and in different sub regions luo et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 here the nsga ii algorithm increased the irrigation area of crops with lower irrigation consumption wet year higher yield per unit and higher profit under the constraints of total production and irrigation area in each subregion of each crop to find out crop patterns with the lowest water consumption least food reduction and highest net profit statistics show that the annual irrigated area varies from 2004 to 2018 with an average of 0 85 million ha y and a maximum of 1 02 million ha y bureau 2018 the gaps between the actual and maximum irrigation area provide room for crop pattern adjustment s1 is designed to demonstrate how much water saving and profit growth could be achieved through spatiotemporal optimization of crop patterns under the premise of constant food production therefore y i m i n and y i m a x in eq 12 were respectively set to 99 99 and 100 01 of the total yield of crop i in all subregions from 2004 to 2018 to maintain no decrease in total food production historical minimum and maximum irrigation area values for crop i in the j subregion are set as i a i j m i n and i a i j m a x respectively to allow adjustment for a better wue and higher profit table 2 3 3 2 scenario 2 the second scenario was designed for maximum profit minimal groundwater use and minimal food reduction without influencing food self sufficiency thus the crop adjustment allows water to reallocate from water intensive and low profit crops to the opposites which could significantly increase profits without increasing irrigation consumption nazari and ahmadi 2019 according to luo et al 2021 in the beijing tianjin hebei region 21 19 83 and 75 of wheat maize vegetables and fruits were respectively overproduced from 2013 to 2016 since oilseeds in baoding accounts for only a small proportion fig 5a of external purchases wang et al 2022 its lowest limit was set to zero according to the above analysis for the bottom line of food self sufficiency a minimum total yield of 75 of the actual level is set up for wheat and maize the food safety bottom lines of other crops are all lower than wheat but are still uniformly set at 75 to simplify parameter setting when the irrigated area of crop i in the j subregion k year equals its historical maximum the sown area was constrained and therefore the total yield did not increase fig 5a shows that the interannual irrigation area of each crop varies only slightly indicating that even if the irrigation area is set to the lowest value in historical years 100 of the lowest value in history total crop production cannot be reduced to the designed target for the scenario 75 of actual food production as farmers are unwilling to leave all of their land fallow and to avoid too drastic spatial crop pattern adjustment we set the minimum irrigated area constraint for each crop in each subregion as 50 of its lowest historical value 50 i a i j m i n h i s 3 3 3 scenario 3 the third scenario is designed to answer how much profit and crop production can remain by optimizing crop patterns with sustainable groundwater use according to macewan et al 2017 a strict physical definition of groundwater sustainability limits annual pumping to no more than the aquifer recharge to achieve spatiotemporal crop adjustment we defined groundwater sustainability as the average groundwater level that did not decline at the end of the study period in comparison with that of the beginning earlier research shows that in the piedmont region like the baoding plain to stop groundwater decline the minimum reduction in winter wheat will be approximately 47 5 ren et al 2019 or 50 gao et al 2015 of its present production therefore for the s3 purpose the self sufficiency policy for wheat the highest water consumptive crop must be abandoned here we set y i m i n of wheat as 50 of the actual lowest wheat production to avoid excessive reduction of the production in other crops their y i m i n were also set as 50 of the actual the values of i a i j m i n and i a i j m a x were the same as in s2 3 3 4 scenarios with external water supply according to the snwd project design the middle route will deliver approximately 0 55 km3 of water each year to the study area yang et al 2010 in its earlier years from 2015 to 2019 snwd only provided 1 0 km3 https m thepaper cn baijiahao 5230429 of water for the baoding plain in 2020 snwd increased its water delivery and delivered 0 997 km3 of water to the region of which 0 592 km3 was supplied to the rivers for increasing groundwater recharge http slj baoding gov cn content 2 7478 html the snwd provides an alternative source of water for reducing aquifer depletion long et al 2020 in the future external water diversion will contribute more to alleviating water shortages in northern china qin et al 2019 yang et al 2022 and according to the second term snwd design thus in our scenario design 0 3 r1 0 6 r2 and 0 9 r3 km3 y of water supply from snwd are considered three scenarios of external water supply to help stabilize aquifer depletion food security and farmers benefit growth simultaneously the combination scenarios of crop pattern optimization and groundwater recharge are represented as s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 s2r1 s2r2 s2r3 s3r1 s3r2 and s3r3 water diversion from snwd was used primarily to replace groundwater withdrawals of industrial domestic and urban water long et al 2020 which totaled approximately 0 62 km3 in 2017 bureau 2019 thus in modflow we treated the total water of r1 and r2 and 0 6 km3 y of r3 as a planar recharge without water loss and 0 3 km3 y of r3 as a river recharge with water loss the water allocation for each subregion was determined by the proportion of each county s industrial domestic and urban water use bureau 2019 given that there was no significant seasonal variation in the water use we set the monthly groundwater recharge to be equal such a recharge for external water could cause some degree of error for instance water loss in the recharging process but it is an effective way to jointly solve the recharge increase and pumping decrease for city sectors in modflow as for external water recharge through rivers it was carried out in seven selected rivers fig 2a including the juma tang fu sha bao yishui and xiaoyi rivers in the implementation plan of main river ecological water replenishment in baoding city http baoding gov cn content 1163 310709 html according to wang et al 2014 and zhu et al 2019 there is a 22 to 26 water loss during groundwater recharge by river infiltration it is difficult to assess the groundwater recharge of each river s water loss ratio owing to the complex riverbed environment thus the water loss ratio of river s groundwater recharge was unified as 23 and the water allocation of each river is determined by the proportion of each river s length to the length of total rivers in modflow the river package was used to simulate the river recharge with an external water supply of 0 3 km3 y evenly distributed over each month 4 results first we calibrated and verified the modflow and crop models second the spatiotemporal variation in irrigation area crop production net profit groundwater level and irrigation of s0 were characterized using statistical data then the hydro economic model was used to optimize scenarios s1 s2 and s3 to explain the functions of water saving gfe trade off and food economic carrying capacity finally scenarios s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 s2r1 s2r2 s2r3 s3r1 s3r2 and s3r3 were simulated to illustrate the impact of snwt on the gfe 4 1 calibration and validation 4 1 1 groundwater model based on the statistical data a groundwater model was established calibrated and verified using parameter adjustment and model validity verification in modflow 15 monitoring wells of groundwater levels from 2004 to 2006 2007 to 2015 and 2017 to 2018 were used as long term calibration verification points and 88 monitoring wells of groundwater levels in 2006 12 were used for flow field verification fig 2a the nash coefficients nse of long term calibration and validation were 0 31 to 0 93 and 0 34 to 0 76 and the determination coefficients r2 were 0 4 to 0 94 and 0 39 to 0 91 fig 3 a for flow field validation the nse and r2 were 0 91 and 0 97 the actual and simulated groundwater levels coincided fig 3b the error between the simulated and actual flow field for the calibrated model was minor at the start of the operation 2004 01 but gradually increased over time we chose the end of the calibration period 2006 12 the phase with the greatest error to demonstrate the acceptance of the simulated groundwater level in comparison with the observations fig 3b in the absence of long term flow field observation data long term observation wells from 2007 01 to 2018 12 were used to validate the model the calibration and validation results of the long term groundwater level monitoring wells and the flow field show that the simulation and prediction functions of the model are reliable 4 1 2 crop model in this study the k c coefficient observed at the experimental site was applied to the baoding plain scale to calculate the total irrigation consumption m3 there is still a need to testify to the reliability of the k c value for the irrigation requirement calculation in eq 1 the e t c validity for each crop from our study was compared with the results of liu 2003 k c coefficient method from experimental results and yang et al 2010 experimental based pan specific coefficient fig 4 shows that each crop s monthly variation in e t c is nearly consistent and implies the reliability of the method for estimation of water consumption the main cause for the gaps in cotton e t c is the difference in sowing date and plant density for the vegetables and fruits gaps it is caused by the difference in the mixture of species the total irrigation consumption for each year was calculated using eq 1 a r 2 of 0 72 between i r fig 5 f and statistical irrigation water use fig 2b verifies the inter annual consistency of the modeled ir i r is 0 19 km3 y or 10 9 lower than the statistical irrigation which is roughly equal to the irrigation leakage rate 10 to 13 zhang et al 2009 the annual i r calculated by the crop model is consistent with actual irrigation consumption which is critical for accurate groundwater simulation 4 2 spatiotemporal gfe trade offs of actual crop pattern s0 4 2 1 gfe temporal variation in the actual crop pattern s0 the annual average irrigation area under wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits was 35 0 35 4 8 2 15 6 and 5 8 of the total value respectively with no discernible variation except for 2017 to 2018 fig 5a in 2017 the irrigation area under oilseeds vegetables and fruits fell by 2 1 4 3 and 1 6 respectively compared to those in 2016 and remained essentially unchanged in 2018 fig 5a the annual irrigation amount varied significantly between years and had a significant negative correlation with rainfall r2 61 figs 2b and 5b wheat was the most water intensive crop followed by vegetables oilseeds maize and fruits with water uses of 0 96 0 24 0 12 0 12 and 0 11 km3 y respectively variations in irrigation areas had the strongest impact on the production and profit of vegetables total crop production and profit increased from 2004 to 2016 primarily owing to the increased output of wheat maize and vegetables fig 5c d wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits produced annual production of 2 13 2 48 0 27 7 67 and 1 28 million tons y respectively with earnings of 2 70 3 17 1 33 21 26 and 1 27 billion rmb y fig 5c d the ratio of total profit to irrigation water is termed economic water efficiency ewe ewe showed an upward trend with significant inter annual variation 2004 2008 and 2016 were significantly higher fig 5e according to the groundwater budget in s0 the average annual groundwater recharge discharge and balances were 1 62 2 23 and 0 61 km3 y respectively with the negative balance or groundwater depletion showing a downward trend after 2014 fig 5f precipitation and lateral flow accounted for 83 and 10 of the total recharge respectively while irrigation water accounted for 82 of the total discharge rivers and lakes played minor roles in groundwater recharge other water consumers include domestic and industrial applications and the cultivation of other crops 4 2 2 gfe spatial variation fig 6 a f show the spatial variation of all factors relevant to groundwater economy and food production in fig 6a the subregions were roughly divided into three zones based on crop proportions the annual average irrigation areas in zones i ii and iii were 19 161 64 079 and 33 674 ha y respectively from zones i to iii the proportion of irrigated areas for wheat 26 37 38 maize 32 36 40 and oilseeds 4 7 and 12 increased while that for economic crops vegetables 22 15 and 9 and fruits 15 3 2 decreased irrigation water consumption production and net profit of crops in regions i ii and iii and their total amount distribution are consistent with irrigation area indicating that irrigation area is the primary driving factor for the change in gfe fig 6a d furthermore by adjusting the irrigation area ratio between noneconomic crops and economic crops the net profit can be significantly increased shunping county for example had a lower irrigation area 2 261 ha y than rongcheng county its net profit however was 0 64 billion rmb y higher fig 6a d in fig 6e ewe varied significantly from county to county from 7 to 43 rmb m3 anxin and yi counties and declined from west to east with an average of 28 20 and 12 rmb m3 in zones i ii and iii respectively suggesting a considerable potential to increased farmer economic profit groundwater levels also changed vastly σ 0 3 from a slow decline in the northeast and quick depletion in the southwest fig 6f showing strong demand for groundwater regulation in scenario simulations for example the groundwater levels rose by 0 2 m y in anxin and rongcheng counties and remained unchanged in zhuo county but decreased by 0 79 and 0 95 m y in wangdu and ding counties respectively fig 6f 4 3 results of scenarios without external water supply table 3 shows food production from the optimized crop pattern and the corresponding irrigation water use net profit and ewe as a scenario designed not to influence the total yield of each crop s1 maintains crop production like s0 by reducing irrigation by 0 05 km3 y slightly increasing profits by 0 16 billion rmb y and ewe by 0 86 rmb m3 according to s2 wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits productions decreased by 0 53 0 55 0 07 0 67 and 0 28 million tons y resulting in a 0 34 km3 y decrease in irrigation a 0 05 billion rmb increase in profits and a 5 39 rmb m3 increase in ewe in s3 aiming to achieve groundwater sustainability irrigation decreases by 0 61 km3 y in contrast wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits productions decrease by 1 07 0 55 0 1 0 16 and 0 35 million tons y respectively with profits falling by 3 34 billion rmb y and ewe rising by 8 82 rmb m3 using s3 as a baseline the overexploitation of irrigation water in s0 s1 and s2 was 0 61 0 55 and 0 26 km3 y respectively under current water availability and object sets s1 s2 and s3 improve the trade off of water food profit under the target of no food influence food self dependence and groundwater sustainability however without an external water supply all scenarios cannot simultaneously achieve food security groundwater sustainability and profit growth 4 3 1 temporal variation of gfe in s1 s2 and s3 as shown in fig 7 changes in irrigation and crop production primarily caused by variations in the irrigation area for each crop affected groundwater levels and net profit the groundwater levels of s1 s2 and s3 were 0 64 2 48 and 4 22 m higher than that of s0 at the end of the study period 2018 12 respectively fig 7a c compared to s0 the annual irrigated area of s1 in wet dry and normal years changed by 62 9 116 5 and 17 6 thousand hectares s2 by 124 7 238 6 and 132 0 thousand hectares and s3 by 232 0 283 5 and 254 1 thousand hectares fig 7d f variation trends in irrigation crop production and profits fig 7g o were like those in irrigation areas the variation trends of irrigation crop production and net profit of each crop and their accumulated value were consistent with the irrigated area but the magnitude of change varied greatly fig 7d o taking s1 as an example compared to s0 the annual irrigation changed in wet dry and normal years by 0 09 0 29 and 0 01 km3 y respectively while crop production changed by 16 123 2 24 177 9 and 4 983 3 thousand tons y and net profit changed by 3 92 5 40 and 1 19 billion rmb y fig 7g j m in s2 and s3 the irrigation production and profit time trends were comparable to those in s1 for irrigation water conservation in s1 the irrigation reductions for wheat maize oilseeds vegetables and fruits were 28 77 14 01 19 19 22 56 and 15 46 respectively fig 7g wheat conserved significantly more water in s2 and s3 than in the other crops making up 78 23 and 80 63 of the total irrigation reduction respectively fig 7h i vegetables were a significant factor in the economic benefit variations of s1 ranging from 8 78 to 7 54 billion rmb y fig 7m s2 decreased the production and profit of other crops while increasing the overall production and profit of vegetables fig 7k n excluding some years vegetables in 2008 2009 2017 and 2018 all crops in s3 saw a significant decline in production and profit fig 7l o 4 3 2 spatial variation of gfe in s1 s2 and s3 fig 8 shows the spatial results of the simulation for s1 s2 and s3 to facilitate spatial analysis subregions of s1 were divided into increased decreased and mixed irrigated zones based on the rise or fall of the irrigated area for most crops fig 8a spatially crop irrigation was adjusted based on groundwater depletion in fig 6f to balance the spatial groundwater level the crop irrigation area decreased in the southeast and increased in the northwest although the groundwater level in ding county continued to fall rapidly the optimized crop pattern alleviated water resource pressure in the southeastern area by transferring some water intensive crops such as wheat vegetables and fruits to water rich areas such as zhuo tang and wangdu counties fig 8a m the standard deviation of groundwater level fluctuation σ in s1 s2 and s3 is 0 28 0 25 and 0 24 which are all lower than in s0 the spatial variation trend of the irrigated area in s2 and s3 was like that in s1 but the adjustment range was significantly different due to the different scenario setting goals fig 8e i in s2 the irrigation areas of wheat and maize decreased in all zones except in wangdu county where wheat increased by 3 81 fig 8e moreover the irrigated oilseed area increased by 1 9 15 2 22 3 and 32 9 in xiong baoding mancheng and rongcheng counties respectively and the vegetable area increased while the fruit area decreased in most zones s3 reduced the irrigation areas for almost all crops in all zones to varying degrees fig 8i the spatial characteristics of irrigation crop production and net profit were consistent with the irrigation area but the adjustment ranges were different owing to the gaps in i r y and n p per unit area with a strong adjustment for irrigation water reduction the net profit in s3 can hardly increase which shows the negative impact of large crop reduction on crop food production and profit fig 8k l the optimal crop pattern increased groundwater extraction in the lightly exploited zones otherwise it decreased groundwater extraction fig 8m o 4 4 results of scenarios with external water supply differing external water supply amounts further increased groundwater availability food safety and agricultural net profit to various degrees based on scenarios s1 s2 and s3 table 4 fig 9 under new water supply conditions with an external water supply of 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 km3 y the hydro economic model optimized the crop pattern the feedback effects on food profit and groundwater can be seen in table 4 fig 9 shows that aside from s1r1 nearly all scenarios can meet groundwater sustainability over the simulation period to guarantee no decrease in food production and groundwater at least 0 6 km3 y of external water should be provided fig 9a table 4 an external water supply of 0 3 km3 y can only provide enough water to guarantee local food self sufficiency with a slight groundwater level decline fig 9b table 4 considering the governmental concern on food only scenarios s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 and s3r3 can be selected table 4 specifically in the case of s3r3 an optimized combination of water food profit can be simultaneously met however s3r3 will significantly increase agricultural water use by 0 35 km3 y which water redline or water cap cannot accept from the point of farmers profit and no significant increase in total water use the best choices would be s2r2 and s3r2 table 4 of which the farmers profit would increase by 6 96 and 7 07 billion rmb y particularly for scenario s2r2 in comparison to s1r2 the net profit for 1 m3 of external water can be as high as 24 4 rmb m3 suggesting considerable potential for crop adjustment however in actuality there could be labor limitations in different counties 5 discussions 5 1 model s function improvement on the trade off of multi factors previous hydro economic models mostly focused on outcomes of groundwater and farmers profitability young et al 2021 irrigation and groundwater balance haacker et al 2019 water saving and grain rising sun and ren 2014 or mainly the trade off of two factors as there are increasing concerns relevant to groundwater use three major factors water food farmer s profit in ncp and the hydro economic model based on the coupling of agronomic hydrological and groundwater models become more significant in the decision making processes in our study the nsga ii algorithm an effective tool for optimization of multi objective deb et al 2002 luo et al 2021 nazari and ahmadi 2019 was used to determine the best crop pattern by regulating the irrigated area and crop compositions in each county and each year by changing the irrigated area and proportions of each crop in each subregion the total groundwater extraction food production and farmers profit are then regulated the optimization system is therefore able to not only construct the linkages among the gfe but also develop the feedback mechanism for example groundwater overdraft will provide feedback on the nsga ii to re optimize irrigated areas and decrease high water consumptive crops and then feedback on the food production and crop profit to avoid over adjustment on irrigation area and crop composition which may influence aspects such as local food security or food self dependence a series of constraints or preconditions is set up to limit the over reduction of total irrigated area total food production and proportional increase or decrease of each crop hence the model allows more preconditions to be set up for the optimization processes which increase the feasibility of the model s adjustment and improve the model s capability in multi objective decision making not limited to the water food profit nexus 5 2 reliability and limitations of the model taking baoding as an example the model is calibrated and validated to look at various crop adjustment options for groundwater management the simulation results of s0 for the current condition of crop pattern and water use show that the annual groundwater deficit from 2004 to 2018 is 0 61 km3 y fig 5f such overdraft is similar to 0 57 km3 y the result of wang 2020 through groundwater simulation and slightly lower than the result of 0 67 km3 y by moiwo et al 2010 as one of the most critical driving forces for groundwater simulation in s0 the total estimated irrigation water in fig 5b is similar to the irrigation result for baoding by bai et al 2019 in general the calibration and validation results of groundwater level water storage change spatial variation of the groundwater flow field and input and output variables all testify that the groundwater model has a good simulation function fig 3 while the model demonstrates various possibilities of gfe under the 12 designed scenarios it also has several limitations which may influence the model s results first the crop pattern is determined automatically through nsga ii optimization such ideal decisions for crop pattern adjustment may not be very suitable for farmers for various reasons for instance our profit setting was drawn from crop prices in the statistical book and production costs from the survey of 368 families ma et al 2022 this reflects the actual state of crop profit especially the profit differences between crop types the profit for main crops wheat and maize is less variable but not for vegetables or fruits also the cultivation of vegetables and fruits needs additional labor next we simplified our scenario for external water use from snwd by injecting water below and above 0 6 km3 into aquifers and river infiltration respectively for the external water for industrial and domestic water use which is the major purpose of snwd water use groundwater extraction will be simply replaced by snwd water in general groundwater replacement by snwd water in the city sector could be like our scenario design however there is thus far less evidence on how many percentages of external water supplies are recharged into the aquifer through river infiltration according to the available experimental data wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 water delivered to rivers for groundwater recharge has a very high efficiency owing to the strong infiltration rate in the natural river bed but there is still a lack of conclusive data on how much water is delivered into natural rivers and how much water is delivered into water bodies lined with concrete to stop leakage such a shortage in the scenario design is expected to be solved in the future when more updated observations are available 6 conclusion a novel hydro economic model was used to determine the best crop pattern options for groundwater sustainability food security and farmer benefit growth with and without snwd water supply for baoding in the north china plain the model constructed the linkage and feedback between water food profit by combining crop economic and groundwater models with an additional nsga ii algorithm for current conditions our simulation shows groundwater declines at a rate of 0 32 m y resulting in an overdraft of 0 61 km3 y the simulation shows that it is difficult to simultaneously achieve food security groundwater sustainability and profit growth under current groundwater conditions however gfe conflicts can be mitigated and traded off by optimizing crop patterns under the scenarios with food production unchanged food self sufficiency or groundwater sustainability farmers profits and food production will be heavily influenced to maintain groundwater sustainability scenario simulations also showed that snwd provides strong support for achieving groundwater sustainability food security and profit increase with an external water supply of 0 3 km3 y the groundwater and profit goals can be met in s2r1 with food self sufficiency when an external water supply of 0 6 or 0 9 km3 y is provided all gfe targets can potentially be achieved in the short term as an external water supply of 0 9 km3 y is only available in the second snwd expansion term both s1r2 and s2r2 with an external water supply of 0 6 km3 y may be the suitable choice for practical application data availability statement the

15349,current riverine plastic monitoring best practices mainly consider surface observations thus neglecting the underlying distribution of plastics in the water column bias on plastic budgets estimations hinders advances on modelling and prediction of plastics fate here we experimentally disclose the structure of plastics transport in surface water flows by investigating how thousands of samples of plastics commonly found in fluvial environments travel in turbulent river flows we show for the first time that surface tension plays a key role in the transport of plastics since its effects can be of the same magnitude as buoyancy and turbulence therefore holding a part of the dispersed buoyant plastics captive by the water surface we investigate two types of transport surfaced plastics surface tension turbulence buoyancy dominated in contact with the free surface and suspended plastics turbulence buoyancy dominated we prove that this duality in transport modes is a major source of error in the estimation of plastic budgets which can be underestimated by 90 following current well established monitoring protocols if sampling is conducted solely in the water surface based on our empirical findings we optimize physics driven monitoring strategies for plastic fluxes in rivers thereby achieving over a ten fold reduction of the bias and uncertainty of riverine

environment geyer et al 2017 jambeck et al 2015 thompson et al 2009 geyer et al 2017 estimated a global 381 million tons year of plastics production with 79 of plastics ending up in landfills or the environment meijer et al 2021 suggested that 0 8 2 7 million metric tons per year are diffusively delivered by rivers into the sea which is in order of magnitude agreement with other studies lebreton

and water can also be impaired by plastic waste bergmann et al 2015 derraik 2002 thompson et al 2009 anthropogenic activities involve large amounts of plastics that can potentially enter the freshwater network lechthaler et al 2020 given that only a small percentage of mismanaged plastic waste reaches the marine environment lechthaler et al 2020 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 efforts should be put into quantifying the transport and retention in the river catchment rivers undeniably can enable fast and far reaching conveyance of plastics hence serving as highways of plastic litter pollution however little is known about detailed transport mechanisms within built and natural water networks waldschläger et al 2022 plastics in rivers can be observed travelling well within the water column herein suspended or afloat at the free surface surfaced however river surveys frequently sample plastics only at the free surface geraeds et al 2019 kataoka and nihei 2020 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 vriend et al 2020 thereby enclosing considerable uncertainty and systematic biases since they overlook a great part of the water column cowger et al 2021 van der wal et al 2015 most exhaustive studies conducted on plastic hydrodynamic mechanisms have focused on quiescent water conditions waldschläger et al 2020 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 only zaat 2020 has addressed plastics transport in a turbulent flow under laboratory conditions but suspension was assumed to be the only mode of transport in the water column thus not addressing distinctive mechanics of surface transport detailed knowledge on plastic water dynamics is still scarce and may prevent accurate prediction of the fate of plastics in riverine environments under different fluvial conditions in this study we identify and characterize a near surface layer in which surfaced transport namely plastics protruding the free surface coexists with a modulated suspended transport we statistically infer for the first time that suspended transport in the remaining water column can be explained by classic suspended particle theories likewise natural sediments see cowger et al 2021 waldschläger et al 2022 zaat 2020 whereas we describe a newly devised and often dominant mode of transport occurring at the water surface in which surface tension plays a major role we reconstruct three dimensional trajectories at millimeter to sub millimeter accuracy for over 3 400 macroplastic samples being transported by fluvial type flow conditions finally we assess the bias and uncertainty of common riverine plastic monitoring best practices and provide strategies that yield over a ten fold reduction of errors in the quantification of plastic budgets 2 theory plastic transport processes in the

considered in eq 2 crowe et al 2012 hohermuth et al 2021 but are deemed less relevant under steady flow conditions in the upper water column detailed expressions for the forces of eq 2 are presented in appendix a 2 2 ratios of dominant forces depending on which forces dominate the force balance different transport regimes may be expected the most commonly studied mode of particles transport is suspension which is explained by the ratio of buoyant to turbulent forces it is well established that small particles in suspension are driven by the ratio of buoyancy and turbulence forces which can be expressed by the rouse number rouse 1961 3 β w κ u with w being the rising velocity of the suspended particles or the settling velocity for sediments κ 0 41 the von kármán constant and u the flow shear velocity the parameter β determines the shape of the rouse profile which is a theoretical profile for suspended particles in turbulent water flows under the assumption of parabolic and symmetric eddy diffusivity distribution across the water column eq 245 of rouse 1961 4 c c a 1 η η 0 1 η a β where c a is the concentration at a reference level a 0 below the free surface or above the channel bed for settling particles and η the distance starting at the level a in downwards direction for rising particles and upwards for settling particles c is the suspended concentration and η 0 the distance from the level a to the channel bed or to the free surface for settling particles for positively buoyant plastics and downward η the rising velocity is positive and hence β 0 here we used quiescent transport experiments repeated three times to determine w for each plastic sample considered in sediment transport β may also be used to determine the dominant mode of sediment transport for instance see table 1 of cowger et al 2021 and eq 5 1c p 262 and p 403 of dey 2014 bed load suspended load β 1 5 to 2 5 and wash load β 0 8 eq 3 and eq 4 consider a turbulent schmidt number of 1 i e turbulent momentum diffusivity equal to the turbulent mass diffusivity see gualtieri et al 2017 and eq 3 of waldschläger et al 2022 bubbles attached to the plastic particle can represent an additional source of buoyancy and thus the total buoyancy may be better expressed as f ρ f b provided that w is determined from rising settling velocities of particles in quiescent water attached bubbles may also be present similar to the transport in turbulent flows therefore it is here assumed that β is representative of the total buoyant force this also implies that experiments in quiescent flows to determine w should be comparable to the protocols used for turbulent transport testing in appendix a and appendix b we show that bubbles attached to the plastic samples cannot explain the surface concentrations observed in experiments since the contribution of bubbles to the total buoyancy commonly remains at least one order of magnitude smaller than the buoyancy or surface tension appendix b based on laboratory observations of bubbles attachment f b is disregarded in the following another relationship of forces can be expressed as the ratio of surface tension explained by the vertical projection sin θ of the surface tension σ acting over the air water plastic contact line length l σ to turbulent forces due to the turbulent drag of water with density ρ w explained by a relative velocity difference δ u a drag coefficient c d and a plastic area exposed a differently from buoyancy this is only active in the upper layer of the concentration profile and when the plastic element protrudes through the water surface appendix a 5 f σ f d l σ σ sin θ 1 2 ρ w c d a δ u δ u we assume that l σ can be expressed by the two main orthogonal dimensions l max and l maximum main axis of a particle and its orthogonal counterpart see materials and methods this implies 6 ℓ σ 2 ℓ max ℓ we further assume that the contact angle vertical projection may remain constant across the interfacial contact line and the following term will be approximated as sin θ sin 30 1 2 for the drag forces appendix a we also assume that the vertical transport drag will be driven by turbulent fluctuations and consequently 7 δ u δ u u 2 the drag coefficient is however variable and reynolds dependent and different plastic element geometries may show different plastic water coupling however we assume here a representative value of c d 0 5 the area of the particle projected in the direction of the dragging flow can be expressed as a fraction f a of the area enclosing the object which can be written as 8 a f a l max l where f a may depend on the shape and deformability of the object for the sake of simplicity we assume a representative value to be in the order of f a 0 5 bringing together eq 5 to eq 8 a ratio for the surface tension to turbulent forces acting on a particle can be introduced which takes a form similar to an inverse plastic based weber number 9 γ σ l max l 1 2 3 ρ w l max l u 2 8 σ ρ w u 2 l max l l max l in eq 9 the numerator is proportional to the interfacial contact line whereas the denominator increases with the area of plastic exposed to turbulence this implies that surface tension effects become more important greater γ when the element is small or the flow velocity decreases besides although not captured in γ plastics with a corrugated shape or high fractal dimension would represent larger interfacial contact lines than considered in eq 9 thus subject to a stronger surface tension influence appendix a also presents the derivation of a plastic based bond number buoyancy to surface tension ratio but we deem more convenient to present the results based on β and γ since buoyancy and surface tension both act in the same direction in this study 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental setup experiments were conducted in the hydraulic engineering laboratory of the delft university of technology the plastic turbulent transport experiments took place in a rectangular flume fig 2 a e with main dimensions 14 40 m long 40 cm deep 40 cm wide and bed slope estimated at 0 00026 a 9 58 m long rough bed was installed to enhance turbulence in the flow the rough plates included closely packed sand grains with median diameter of 0 67 cm the granulometry curve is also included in fig 2c for completeness rising tests were conducted in a separate flume to characterize the rising velocity of the plastic samples under quiescent conditions the samples were introduced with a long grabbing arm and were released after the water surface seemed undisturbed for this test phase a static water tank was prepared in the middle of a horizontal flume after closing both ends with wood boards and water proofing both ends the dimensions of this water tank are 84 cm in depth and 77 cm width with over a meter in length a wooden frame was used to position four gopro hero9 cameras and record the rising process of the introduced samples velocities were obtained at 10 different levels during the rising process and tests were repeated three times 3 2 flow hydrodynamic characterization five different flow conditions are considered in the plastic transport experiments these discharges are used for all plastic classes considered in the experiments all discharges represent subcritical flows with high reynolds number table 1 water levels in the flume were controlled by a downstream gate the flow depth was both estimated in the flume with a point gauge for each experiment obtaining a mean value of 0 278 m 1 mm gauge resolution several camera recordings were analyzed obtaining a mean water depth of 0 278 m 1 2 mm as std of 10 estimations the flow characterization is carried out through velocity measurements at 2 cm vertical intervals using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vectrino version 1 24 00 and upstream hydrogen bubble seeding blanckaert and lemmin 2006 each point was sampled for at least 2 minutes which was determined as long enough recording based on preliminary longer samplings the sampling frequency was adjusted between 100 and 200 hz and transmit lengths between 1 8 and 2 4 mm depending on local signal quality each adv time series was analyzed following the protocol of appendix c the water discharge was obtained by fitting a theoretical velocity profile log wake law and potential flow outside of the boundary layer to the water velocity measurements and integrating them using a trapezoidal rule from bed level to water surface this was done for all five discharges in three different cross sections fig 2b with the farther downstream cross section sampled twice the latter time with 1 cm vertical resolution to assess sensitivity to vertical spacing in the measurements this resulted in roughly identical discharge estimations several redundant estimations of the discharge at different cross sections allowed estimating an uncertainty level for this variable ε q 100 std mean of 2 4 3 3 plastic samples we consider different clean positively buoyant macroplastic samples for the water transport experiments fig 3 and table 2 these are selected to be representative of riverine plastic litter observations while including different mechanical properties i rigid 3d objects cup shaped fig 3a d ii quasi 2d rigid fragments fig 3e f iii plastic bag films fig 3g j and iv face masks fig 3k m samples iii and iv are subject to deformations by hydrodynamic stresses and when inserted in a turbulent flow the plastic elements buckle and warp fig 3h j l m according to observations of van emmerik et al 2020 samples i iii belong to the 20 most widely found plastic elements in the rhine meuse delta riverbanks and are also representative of previous monitoring campaigns in asia van emmerik et al 2018 masks are also considered in our study given their sudden increase in the pollution share experienced during the covid 19 period 80 fold observed increase of masks in litter according to roberts et al 2021 further characteristics of the samples used in the experiments are presented in appendix d materials composing the experimental samples include polypropylene pp for cup samples and high density poly ethylene hdpe for films a material common in riverine litter not directly considered here is expanded polyestyrine eps given its low density between 0 016 to 0 640 g cm3 following van emmerik and schwarz 2020 similar buoyant characteristics may be expected for the masks by size all samples can be categorized as macro under all classification frameworks see hartmann et al 2019 which is the dominant category by weight in plastic pollution eriksen et al 2014 all face masks contain porous materials and were submerged for 72 hours prior to testing 3 4 plastics characterization three different sources of plastic elements were considered to produce the plastic elements samples plastic cups plastic films supermarket bags and disposable face masks fig 3 these three types of sources were manipulated to generate different plastic classes these are presented in fig 3 table 2 and appendix d the densities of prepared plastic samples are tested using a 50 ml pycnometer in the deltares geo lab for this distilled water was used as an immersion liquid 997 98 kg m3 at 21 c estimated using the same pycnometer from each sample small fragments are prepared to allow insertion into the pycnometer and carry out the measurements the density of these samples was tested and estimated according to the specifications of iso 1183 1 2019 e for pycnometer tests iso 2019 each density estimation was repeated 5 times thus allowing estimation of the method s uncertainty appendix d the samples material was determined based on the recycling codes found in the packaging which showed a good match with the expected density s range of each material and that here determined the plastic cups included size classes ranging from original form to fragmented parts including full 3d objects and quasi 2d fragments in addition manually damaged cups are also included in these sample groups crashed against the floor using human weight size classes of rectangular plastic films are similarly prepared after cutting out the handles of procured shopping bags hence obtaining near rectangular objects size measurements and rising velocities are presented in table 2 and appendix d 3 5 insertion protocol the insertion point is set at the beginning of the experimental flume fig 2 the plastic sample is carefully introduced inside the water using a 1 5 m long grabbing arm the newly submerged sample is either cleared from bubbles by hand deformable plastics or shaken 3 times for rigid samples while impacting the grabbing arm against the flume s metal structure this prevents most of the bubbles from remaining attached to the plastic body although a few may remain yet their contribution to buoyancy is deemed negligible as we discuss in appendix b the sample is released after holding it still with the grabbing arm for 5 seconds at around 20 30 of the water depth h the number of samples tested was designed based upon a combined monte carlo analysis and a two sided kolmogorov smirnov ks test appendix e analyzing the expected difference between a rouse profile sampled with a limited number of particles n from a reference true rouse suspended transport concentration profile eq 4 therefore n 150 was set as target for each experiment although some samples were lost during transport stuck in the channel glass for instance or may remain undetected 3 6 3d tracking of the plastic samples four gopro hero9 cameras were used to record the macroplastic samples at the downstream section of our test flume fig 2b three cameras were placed in a vertical plane in front of the observation window fig 2f and one camera was placed on a wooden frame over the top of the flume allowing a top view of the free surface the camera distortion radial tangential model and intrinsic camera parameters were calibrated using 15 images of a chess calibration board at different orientations to overcome possible changes of camera orientation throughout the measurement campaign fiduciary markers aruco markers see garrido jurado et al 2014 were used to continuously reconstruct the relative position of the cameras see fig 2e and supplementary material cameras recorded at 60 frames per second and were initiated by a common ir remote trigger an external flash light was used to perform cross camera time synchronization all cameras used a sony imx677 cmos sensor an automated detection routine was built to delineate the macroplastic element contours per frame from the cameras video sequence this is based on a background subtraction an hsv color space filter and different topological filters based on the expected shape and size of macro plastics the script was developed using the opencv python library bradski 2000 a stereo camera configuration was used to reconstruct the 3d location of the suspended object first the detected object centroid is transformed from camera coordinates to real world coordinates intrinsic and extrinsic transformations secondly the ray refraction at the air to water phase change is estimated see duinmeijer et al 2019 the minimum crossing distance between the stereo rays is used to estimate the 3d location of the detected object within the water channel the point reconstruction error was estimated by comparing the estimated 3d location from the stereo camera system and the measured position of the inside channel aruco markers suppl mat table s5 additionally camera 1 was used to automatically classify macroplastics that are transported in a suspended manner and those attached to the water surface in each frame the plastic perimeter is identified and its center of gravity c o g estimated a plastic element with at least one point pixel of the perimeter in contact with the free surface is considered a surfaced plastic to this end camera 1 was carefully placed such that the view is aligned with the channel water surface plane 4 results 4 1 open channel flume hydrodynamics plastic transport experiments were conducted in a laboratory flume under five fully controlled flow conditions table 1 and strict plastic insertion protocols instantaneous flow velocities were sampled for the five flow conditions table 1 across three different sections in an experimental rough bed flume fig 2 the flow reproduced in the flume features a boundary layer which is the most common flow present in rivers franca et al 2021 in fig 4 we show that our open channel flow follows classic theories for canonic river turbulence downstream cross section in the observation window see fig 2b the mean velocity profiles closely follow a log wake law with conventional log wake law parameters and reynolds normal stresses profiles following the expected decay with increasing distance to the wall further to the water hydrodynamics in the plastic observation window fig 4 we also present mean and turbulent flow quantities at an upstream location in the supplementary material fig s1 our sampled mean velocity profiles at all cross sections follow a log wake law as expected for a boundary layer flow see eq 1 of castro orgaz 2010 we use default parameters from literature for the log wake profile castro orgaz 2010 nezu and rodi 1986 including the recommended values of castro orgaz 2010 i e 8 5 for the constant of integration 0 2 for the wake strength parameter and 0 41 for the von kármán constant κ sand roughness was assumed as the value obtained through imaging of the roughness plates with these parameters fixed we obtain the boundary layer thickness δ and the shear velocity u using a least squares procedure in order to cross verify the turbulence quantities obtained we obtain the reynolds shear stress u x u z profile which is then used to estimate the shear velocity u τ and the boundary layer thickness δ τ we do so by fitting a line via the siegel slopes method median slope across point pairs which is a robust alternative to error reducing line fitting the zero crossing of this line allows direct estimation of u τ and δ τ with the fit of the mean velocity profiles and assuming a uniform velocity out of the boundary layer upper edge we numerically integrate the profile to obtain the specific discharge q predictions of the discharge across different cross sections is in good agreement and differences in the estimation of the shear velocity between both methods used mean velocity and turbulent shear stress are minor which suggests that low uncertainty is held in our hydrodynamic estimations 4 2 thickness of the surface tension dominated transport the centers of gravity c o g of plastics and their trajectories are estimated based on synchronous multi camera detection and reconstruction fig 5 a b all the detected plastics in contact with the water surface are classified as surface transport all surfaced plastics c o g are confined into a layer of thickness a in the near surface region which is here defined as the deepest point at which a surfaced plastic s c o g is detected we observe that the near surface region thickness a depends on the plastic elements travelling orientation which is either driven by i turbulence β or ii buoyancy β and it is however not affected by surface tension i e γ independent hence estimations of a values show a bimodal distribution each related to one of these two regimes i and ii plastics subject to intense turbulence regime i travel in arbitrary orientations within the water column when they touch the free surface the rest of the body is still affected by turbulence plastics can either crease or unfold if the mechanical properties allow any c o g of a sample can extend up to half of the distance between the two most separated points of a plastic element i e a 0 5 λ fig 5e appendix f with λ l max 2 l 2 1 2 nonetheless with increasing buoyancy regime ii samples are pushed up against the free surface turbulence may pull the plastic elements downward but it is insufficient to disturb their transport configuration hence the plastic elements rest against the free surface in a stable equilibrium position while being conveyed by the free stream flow the surface transport thickness a in regime ii corresponds to the configuration with minimum potential energy accounting for both i turbulence and ii buoyancy dominated regimes the lower limit of the surface transport layer can be estimated by a r2 0 59 rmse 0 012 m median abs err 0 0046 m fig 5e 10 a λ 0 36 0 14 tanh 3 2 β for 0 2 β 11 7 to ascertain significance to the existence of a transport layer that differs from turbulent suspension we conduct a statistical test specifically a two sided kolmogorov smirnov ks test appendix g the ks test is iteratively applied to the count profiles of each experiment this statistical methodology consists on the comparison of the observed vertical distribution of c o g of the plastic elements to a reference suspended transport profile herein a rouse suspended concentration profile rouse 1961 given by eq 4 instead of using best fit parameters as for instance zaat 2020 the reference rouse profile is estimated purely based on physical parameters β namely the rising velocity of the samples table 2 and the shear velocity of the flow table 1 the ks test is applied to an increasing number of points fig 5f starting from the sampling point nearest to the channel bed and gradually moving up until the free surface when reaching the upper layers of the water column the experimental observations start differing more significantly from the reference rouse profile this deviation of the empirical and theoretical profiles suggests that other physical mechanisms beyond a turbulent buoyant force balance may be driving the concentration in the near surface layer for the ks test a pronounced concavity in the concentration profile is usually marking the lower limit of the surface transport fig 5c and supplementary material this concavity is caused by the missing samples at this level which might have remained attached to the free surface fig 5c at z h 7 5 cm for instance a second mechanism triggering a significant p value is due to an overshooting of concentrations close to the surface fig 5d we note that a limited number of samples may lead to larger ks stats although this is well identified by the p value for completeness we include a monte carlo simulation with 85 000 pairs of reference suspended transport profiles in the background of fig 5f together with median and 5th 95th percentiles for a given number of samples considering a p value of 10 3 73 of the analyzed concentration profiles show distributions significantly deviating from suspended transport i e solely turbulence buoyancy dominated the depth at which this occurs a k s fig 5c d follows on average terms the thickness a explained by direct identification of the deepest plastic elements in contact with the free surface appendix f 4 4 transport of plastics in the near surface the total number of plastic elements detected in one experiment at a given cross section is here denoted as n p and is made of the particles in the lower suspended transport region n β and the particles in the near surface region n γ i e n p n β n γ fig 6 a within the near surface layer we observe plastic elements travelling in suspension n γ sus and surfaced plastics captured by the free surface and hence affected by surface tension n γ surf a plastic is counted within n γ surf when in contact with the free surface within the thickness a but not satisfying the prior condition the plastic element is counted as n γ sus plastics below the thickness a are all considered part of n β fig 6 and appendix f for the full dataset the relative frequency of surfaced plastics c γ surf n γ surf n p can be estimated by the following relationship c γ surf r2 0 71 rmse 0 17 median abs err 0 066 fig 6b d 11 c γ surf 1 k p 0 exp β β surf c exp γ γ surf c 1 for 0 2 β 11 7 and 2 5 γ 75 1 with k p 0 6 66 β surf c 0 64 and γ surf c 2 37 provided that surfaced plastics in the field can be readily observed by direct top view observation e g from high resolution satellite data automated cctv or manual counting eq 11 allows an estimation of the expected total plastic count for the complete water column n p n γ surf c γ surf the relative count of plastics in suspension in the lower water column can be explained by the following relationship c β n β n p r2 0 75 rmse 0 14 median abs err 0 067 fig 6c e 12 c β exp β β sus c exp γ γ sus c for 0 2 β 11 7 and 2 5 γ 75 1 with β sus c 1 61 and γ sus c 38 08 if n γ is available in a river section via visual observation or surface sampling with nets eq 12 allows the estimation of the total plastic count following n p n γ 1 c β and may hold lesser uncertainty than eq 11 for the sake of completeness we also estimate the non stationarity of these estimations by computing the of change of c β per unit meter within the observation window table f2 on average terms this amounts to 1 2 m positive and negative tend to compensate whereas the average absolute value i e expected intensity of the of change of c β per unit meter for a random experiment amounts to 8 5 we observe that surface tension effects on the concentration profile can be as intense as buoyancy for instance over 90 of plastics for γ 10 and β 2 are travelling as surfaced load fig 6b and appendix f our results suggest that in the near surface layer the role of suspension is diminished when compared to the remaining water column fig 5c d this modulation of the suspended count may be explained by the reduced number of samples available to travel in suspension after some being trapped at the free surface thus a suspended concentration profile alone cannot explain the near surface layer of thickness a and the lower water region of thickness h a together 5 discussion 5 1 plastics monitoring in rivers most common methods for the monitoring of plastics in rivers include van emmerik and schwarz 2020 1 visual counting using rivers infrastructure mounted cameras or satellite topouzelis et al 2019 and 2 sampling the flow using nets at different depths water surface monitoring alone or combined with limited net sampling are standardized monitoring methodologies gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 van emmerik et al 2018 although they can introduce bias in the total plastic budget cowger et al 2021 van der wal et al 2015 in the light of our findings we assess the bias and uncertainty related to four plastic monitoring strategies targeting the estimation of the plastic budget n p in the water column which reflect both common practices and upgraded procedures herein optimized two strategies str based on common practices are first considered str a the count at the free surface is considered as the estimate of the total plastic n p n γ surf the surface count corresponds to floating plastics that emerge through the free surface surfaced transport which are detectable independently of the water turbidity levels str b we consider the same monitoring of str a but with improved visibility conditions allowing identification of plastics in the upper 20 of the water column n p n γ this strategy assumes favorable visibility conditions in the field with plastics visually accessible up to a certain depth for instance 10 cm in the saigon river according to van emmerik et al 2018 or the use of nets that allow sampling down to a limited depth beneath the free surface both str a and str b are currently the common practice for plastics monitoring gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 lebreton et al 2017 topouzelis et al 2019 van emmerik et al 2018 and represent pessimistic and optimistic field conditions respectively the main inconvenience of these strategies is that they neglect most plastics transported in suspension which are a significant fraction for β 3 for this reason we propose two additional strategies str c we expand str b by estimating the suspended transport concentration through eq 12 n p n γ 1 c β this strategy acknowledges the existence of two transport layers and builds on the herein disclosed hydrodynamic behavior of plastics str d we expand str b by sampling the suspended transport concentration using nets at a given depth within the suspended transport layer n p n β n γ the sampled suspended concentration is used to infer a physically based rouse profile β defined which is integrated over the lower 80 water column the suspended sampling location is proposed at 60 of the water depth based on protocol optimization appendix h we show that basic monitoring practices only focusing on the water surface and near surface str a and str b can underestimate the total amount of plastic by up to 90 see fig 7 when β 1 which is consistent with discussion of van der wal et al 2015 and cowger et al 2021 regarding the need for sampling plastics in suspension str a and b can be a valid practice when the buoyant characteristics of the samples dominate over the flow turbulence β 3 distinctly two different regimes can dominate plastic transport depending on the values of β and γ by introducing str c fig 7 and table 3 we show that monitoring one layer while incorporating a point estimation for the plastics in the remaining water column with eq 12 leads to over a ten fold reduction of the bias and reduces uncertainty by half when compared to str b furthermore str d shares the improvement of str c in terms of bias but also achieves over a ten fold reduction of the uncertainty when compared to str b which nonetheless accounts for favorable visibility conditions in the application of a best practices monitoring protocol when adopting str c or d two relevant physically based parameters the rouse number β and γ are required which depend on the plastic element and flow conditions other optimized monitoring protocols independent of β and γ are also presented in the appendix h together with an assessment of their bias and uncertainty 5 2 implications for plastic removal we observe that besides buoyancy plastic related the vertical distribution of buoyant plastics is controlled by two other factors turbulence and surface tension for instance river reaches of low turbulence e g β 2 and γ 10 can offer an opportunity for efficient cleanup targeting the water surface since the surface count n γ dominates the plastic budget we also suggest that the free surface collection of plastics may be altered through hydrophobic coating or specific surface treatment of the plastic elements which can result in a positive impact on removal efforts although other chemical and toxicological implications should be carefully considered this can be achieved by targeting an increase of the air water plastic contact angle or the interfacial contact line contrastingly the presence of surfactants may impair plastic removal efforts 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the transport of macroplastics in turbulent river like flows by using laboratory experiments and physics based descriptors which include the ratio of buoyancy to turbulent forces β and the ratio of surface tension to turbulent diffusion γ we showed that in the upper water column two transport regimes can coexist regime i which is driven by the balance between buoyancy surface tension and turbulence surfaced transport and regime ii which is driven by the balance of buoyancy and turbulence suspended transport we note that in our experiments bubbles had a minor effect appendix b the near surface region thickness is defined by the maximum dimension of the plastic elements transported by the flow fig 5e eq 10 and appendix f suspended transport did not significantly deviate in statistical terms from a physically based without calibration rouse theoretical suspended transport profile eq 4 as shown in fig 5f this may hold true for microplastics and smaller size particles where large size effects of the plastic particles should be less important eq 3 and eq 4 were used considering a turbulent schmidt number of 1 gualtieri et al 2017 waldschläger et al 2022 calibrating this turbulent schmidt number should allow reducing deviations from the rouse profile in the suspended transport region where derivation hypotheses hold true in riverine monitoring campaigns failing to account for suspended transport can have major implications str a and b in fig 7 and table 3 this is relevant for small β and large γ values when only considering the surfaced plastic budget as representative of the total budget eq 11 can provide an estimation of the missing plastic budget fig 7 or allow an uncertainty estimation related to local flow conditions captured via β our results also suggest that eq 12 together with sampling in the near surface is a better suited monitoring option str c in fig 7 and table 3 although two points sampling combined with eq 4 still remains more robust str d in fig 7 and table 3 whereas the top performing monitoring strategy is str d in fig 7 and table 3 additional monitoring strategies are studied in appendix h advantages of these alternative monitoring techniques are the reduced information needed from the

corresponds to the reynolds stress contribution to the drag eq a4 requires knowledge on pressures and turbulent stresses acting over the control volume surface alternative approaches to the flow plastic interaction include i distinguishing between undisturbed flow and disturbed flow forces see chap 4 of crowe et al 2012 or ii distinguishing between quasi steady drag and unsteady forces i e added mass and basset forces see chap 4 of clift et al 1978 the undisturbed flow considers changes in pressure and velocities of the flow due to reasons exogenous to the element itself for instance local accelerations in a contraction and hence depend on the water flow through the channel for the disturbed flow forces an integral approach is based on the use of a quasi steady drag f d approach which can be brought together with the following unsteady forces the added mass force f v m and basset force f b a5 f w f d f vm f b considering an integral approach and disregarding unsteady forces

γ plastic based inverse weber number a third ratio of relevant forces can be given by the buoyancy to surface tension forces ratio both of these forces are acting in the positive direction but the

the three parameters β γ and λ should suffice to describe the turbulent transport at the free surface it is here judged convenient to use β as it is well established and most useful for the study of suspended transport and use γ as complementary parameter since it better represents the balance between positive and negative forces surface tension keeping at upper levels the plastic body whereas turbulence dragging it away from the free surface in analogy to β furthermore ρ p is not available for masks and interpretation of λ is not straightforward an increase of λ means that plastics will be more often in contact with the free surface as well where surface tension is activated and a decrease of λ means that surface tension becomes more intense than buoyancy yet lesser plastics will approach the free surface besides both buoyancy and surface tension act in the same direction in this study appendix b relative contribution of surface tension bubbles and buoyancy to plastic dynamics surface tension when plastics protrude the free surface surface tension acts over the contact line the contact angle of pp is estimated by vlaeva et al 2012 at 97 0 0 8 at 25 c while for hdpe de luna et al 2014 estimated 96 5 3 4 at 25 c different temperatures or surface treatments can alter the contact angle for reference accu dyne test 2009b compiles contact angles from different studies for pp with values commonly ranging between 95 and 117 for pe both low and high density pe accu dyne test 2009a lists values commonly ranging between 93 and 105 bubbles bubbles can be attached to the plastic samples the insertion protocol leads to the detachment of most of the bubbles but some may inadvertently remain at the plastic surface we observed the number of bubbles in 20 different samples following our insertion protocol for the following plastic classes table 2 cup pp 100 cup pp 05 and film hdpe 15 under the lowest and highest discharges considered in the transport experiments v1 and v5 see table 1 we held the plastic samples close to the channel glassed wall without releasing them and we identified the number of bubbles attached to the plastic element the diameter could not be accurately determined but it was classified within the following groups small medium and large which roughly correspond to 1 mm 1 mm and 1 mm the bubbles counts are presented in the available data we observe that mainly small bubbles remain attached to the plastics surface i e bubbles of 1 mm or lesser where surface tension stabilizes them more effectively we rarely observed more than one 1 mm bubble attached to the plastic sample and never more than five 1 mm bubbles relative contribution in order to assess the relevance of the added buoyancy contributed by attached bubbles we consider an idealized sample based on cup pp 100 fig b1a this idealized sample is formed by a cylinder with one cover in one end hence a simplistic plastic cup the height of this idealized plastic cup is 83 mm l max and the diameter constant across height differently from cup pp 100 is 55 2 mm l based on cup pp 100 properties see table 2 considering the total volume of cup pp 100 table 2 and its idealized dimensions the mean thickness of this virtual sample corresponds to 130 μm considering the pp plastic density estimated with pycnometer table 2 and a given number of bubbles n b we estimate the forces for quiescent water conditions and a static plastic element f w 0 n and different submergence levels percentage of cup within the water of a horizontal cup i e axis parallel to the water surface the forces evaluated on the control volume are shown in fig b1 we observe that even for extreme unrealistic conditions n b 25 d b 2 mm fig b1c the effect of bubbles is smaller than any surface tension scenario considered contact angles 97 105 and 115 fig b1b e we consider here that the contact angle can yield a variable vertical projection sin θ either in the inner and outer faces of the cup fig b1a accounting for other factors such as the dynamic surface tension which can be up to 40 larger than the static one hauner et al 2017 would reinforce the hypothesis that surface tension force is significantly larger than the remaining bubbles contribution we also observe that the contact line inside and outside of the cup is reasonably insensitive to the submergence level for this plastic orientation since it is dominated by l max yet in our calculations surface tension nulls when submergence approaches 0 and 1 0 because of symmetry of forces between inner and outer faces in reality right before detachment from the surface only the outer face is in contact with the free surface we call this situation the maximum surface tension state max sigma state which we analyze separately below upward positive surface tension forces represent a jump condition escape over a barrier condition amir 2021 to be overcome by an extreme turbulence event bubbles different from surface tension effects would affect the plastic elements at all depths and not only in the near free surface thus modifying the rouse profile from bed to surface maximum surface tension state max sigma state we consider now the state of maximum surface tension max sigma state table b1 possible during the plastic transport experiments fig b1f for cups this is the last contact before detachment with only its external face in contact with the free surface note that in fig b1b e the inner face of the cup can present downward surface tension partially compensating the outer face of the cup for films the max sigma state is horizontally extended at the free surface while only the lower face is wet the contact angles considered correspond to that of vlaeva et al 2012 for pp and de luna et al 2014 for hdpe although in this state the resultant does not change significantly for contact angles between 75 to 110 and thus is less sensitive to the material appendix c water velocimetry filtering each adv time series was analyzed following the protocol detailed below instantaneous velocity samples with cor 80 correlation and snr 10 db signal to noise ratio were filtered out replaced by a nan a mean flow velocity was estimated for each point of the profile the median misalignment of each profile based on x and y mean velocities u x and u y respectively was estimated and then instantaneous velocity estimations were corrected rotation to null u y all misalignments remained below 1 9 degrees with an average value of the absolute rotations of 0 9 degrees an statistical filtering was applied to each time series based on the phase space thresholding method of goring and nikora 2002 as modified by wahl 2003 no spike replacement was performed but instead a nan value was considered for the position of the outlier the percentage of nan for each u x u y and u z time series was estimated when the maximum of these three surpassed 40 the point recording was discarded from the profile data acceptance rate are summarized in the supplemental material table s1 appendix d plastic samples properties main physical and geometrical properties of the plastic samples are presented in table d1 table d2 and table d3 appendix e statistical test for the determination of the number of samples used in the experiments the uncertainty analysis for the suspended particles concentration included generating 1 000 synthetic experiments for each of the 85 different levels of n sample size considered which varied between 10 and 1 000 samples i e a total of 85 000 simulations the inverse transform sampling method was used to draw random samples from eq 4 a sample 1 with a limited n number of particles drawn was compared to a control sample with much larger number of samples 9 999 particles drawn which is regarded as reference true rouse profile the kolmogorov smirnov statistic fig 5f background shows the maximum difference between the cumulative density functions of sample 1 and the control sample differences can be expected decreasing with n as a part of the stochastic nature of the experiments a total number of 150 samples was considered sufficient to keep uncertainty reasonable while allowing ample testing in laboratory appendix f detected plastics statistics the thickness of the surface transport layer is presented in table f1 and the count per transport region in table f2 appendix g statistical test for the detection of the surface transport layer in addition to the direct classification of plastic elements touching the water surface a second method is used to identify the near surface layer in this layer not all plastics are transported in suspension β dependent the transport of those plastics in contact with the free surface is controlled by surface tension γ dependent to ascertain significance to the existence of a transport layer where plastics dispersion does not behave solely based on turbulence and buoyancy we conduct a statistical test specifically a two sided kolmogorov smirnov ks test this consists on the comparison of the observed vertical distribution of plastic elements concentration of c o g to a reference theoretical suspended transport profile given eq 4 the reference rouse profile is estimated purely based on physical parameters β namely the rising velocity of the samples table 2 and the shear velocity of the flow table 1 and hence does not correspond to a best fit calibration as in previous studies the ks test ks stat see fig 5f and p value is iteratively applied with increasing number of samples starting from the channel bed up to the water surface inside the layer defined by a k s the vertical distribution of the plastics counting in the experiments and the reference suspended profiles significantly differ p value 10 3 appendix h alternative riverine monitoring techniques and performance when adopting str 4 or 8 table h1 or str c or d in the manuscript two relevant physically based parameters the rouse number β and γ are required which depend on the plastic element and flow conditions for that purpose local hydrodynamic quantities u can be estimated based on discharge and river bed roughness cowger et al 2021 whereas plastic main geometry l max l needs to be determined as well as the rising velocity w if the rising velocity is not available literature estimations such as those proposed by waldschläger et al 2020 can be used together with the density estimated based on the material type in case of clean plastic samples van emmerik and schwarz 2020 alternatively optimized monitoring protocols independent of β and γ are also presented in table h1 in all strategies where sampling of the suspended layer is performed it is considered that the net would capture a layer of 10 the water depth this is extrapolated afterwards following different strategies str 5 8 to the whole water column or a portion of it the performance of each monitoring strategy is presented in table h1 and detailed in table h6 and fig h1 optimisations of the sampling point are supported by table h2 table h3 table h4 and table h5 and a summary of the bias and uncertainty of all monitoring strategies is presented in table h6 
15349,current riverine plastic monitoring best practices mainly consider surface observations thus neglecting the underlying distribution of plastics in the water column bias on plastic budgets estimations hinders advances on modelling and prediction of plastics fate here we experimentally disclose the structure of plastics transport in surface water flows by investigating how thousands of samples of plastics commonly found in fluvial environments travel in turbulent river flows we show for the first time that surface tension plays a key role in the transport of plastics since its effects can be of the same magnitude as buoyancy and turbulence therefore holding a part of the dispersed buoyant plastics captive by the water surface we investigate two types of transport surfaced plastics surface tension turbulence buoyancy dominated in contact with the free surface and suspended plastics turbulence buoyancy dominated we prove that this duality in transport modes is a major source of error in the estimation of plastic budgets which can be underestimated by 90 following current well established monitoring protocols if sampling is conducted solely in the water surface based on our empirical findings we optimize physics driven monitoring strategies for plastic fluxes in rivers thereby achieving over a ten fold reduction of the bias and uncertainty of riverine

upon reasonable request 1 introduction the presence of plastic polymers in industry products intensified over the past decades geyer 2020 which was also accompanied by growing leakages into the environment geyer et al 2017 jambeck et al 2015 thompson et al 2009 geyer et al 2017 estimated a global 381 million tons year of plastics production with 79 of plastics ending up in landfills or the environment meijer et al 2021 suggested that 0 8 2 7 million metric tons per year are diffusively delivered by rivers into the sea which is in order of magnitude agreement with other studies lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 the spatial extent of plastic pollution dispersion is unprecedented andrade et al 2021 napper et al 2020 as well as its capacity to act as supporting vectors for different hazardous species cole et al 2011 grossart et al 2019 haram et al 2021 li et al 2018 in addition to potential impacts on human health jenner et al 2022 leslie et al 2022 other life on land and water can also be impaired by plastic waste bergmann et al 2015 derraik 2002 thompson et al 2009 anthropogenic activities involve large amounts of plastics that can potentially enter the freshwater network lechthaler et al 2020 given that only a small percentage of mismanaged plastic waste reaches the marine environment lechthaler et al 2020 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 efforts should be put into quantifying the transport and retention in the river catchment rivers undeniably can enable fast and far reaching conveyance of plastics hence serving as highways of plastic litter pollution however little is known about detailed transport mechanisms within built and natural water networks waldschläger et al 2022 plastics in rivers can be observed travelling well within the water column herein suspended or afloat at the free surface surfaced however river surveys frequently sample plastics only at the free surface geraeds et al 2019 kataoka and nihei 2020 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 vriend et al 2020 thereby enclosing considerable uncertainty and systematic biases since they overlook a great part of the water column cowger et al 2021 van der wal et al 2015 most exhaustive studies conducted on plastic hydrodynamic mechanisms have focused on quiescent water conditions waldschläger et al 2020 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 only zaat 2020 has addressed plastics transport in a turbulent flow under laboratory conditions but suspension was assumed to be the only mode of transport in the water column thus not addressing distinctive mechanics of surface transport detailed knowledge on plastic water dynamics is still scarce and may prevent accurate prediction of the fate of plastics in riverine environments under different fluvial conditions in this study we identify and characterize a near surface layer in which surfaced transport namely plastics protruding the free surface coexists with a modulated suspended transport we statistically infer for the first time that suspended transport in the remaining water column can be explained by classic suspended particle theories likewise natural sediments see cowger et al 2021 waldschläger et al 2022 zaat 2020 whereas we describe a newly devised and often dominant mode of transport occurring at the water surface in which surface tension plays a major role we reconstruct three dimensional trajectories at millimeter to sub millimeter accuracy for over 3 400 macroplastic samples being transported by fluvial type flow conditions finally we assess the bias and uncertainty of common riverine plastic monitoring best practices and provide strategies that yield over a ten fold reduction of errors in the quantification of plastic budgets 2 theory plastic transport processes in the upper water column 2 1 balance of forces we consider a 3d control volume including a plastic element anywhere in the upper water column and any attached bubbles fig 1 we apply the second newton s law in the vertical direction for a constant mass control volume 1 f z m d u p z d t with m the total mass of the control volume water air and plastic and u p z its instantaneous vertical velocity at a time t the sum of gravity turbulence and surface tension forces includes crowe et al 2012 hohermuth et al 2021 2 f z f ρ f b f w f σ with f ρ including the weight and buoyancy forces f b the added buoyancy force given by bubbles attached to the plastic elements f w the force due to the plastic element coupling with the water flow and f σ the surface tension force occurring in the plastic water air contact line when the plastic protrudes the water surface for the water plastic coupling we assume that the drag force is a reasonable approximation f w f d see appendix a other forces could be considered in eq 2 crowe et al 2012 hohermuth et al 2021 but are deemed less relevant under steady flow conditions in the upper water column detailed expressions for the forces of eq 2 are presented in appendix a 2 2 ratios of dominant forces depending on which forces dominate the force balance different transport regimes may be expected the most commonly studied mode of particles transport is suspension which is explained by the ratio of buoyant to turbulent forces it is well established that small particles in suspension are driven by the ratio of buoyancy and turbulence forces which can be expressed by the rouse number rouse 1961 3 β w κ u with w being the rising velocity of the suspended particles or the settling velocity for sediments κ 0 41 the von kármán constant and u the flow shear velocity the parameter β determines the shape of the rouse profile which is a theoretical profile for suspended particles in turbulent water flows under the assumption of parabolic and symmetric eddy diffusivity distribution across the water column eq 245 of rouse 1961 4 c c a 1 η η 0 1 η a β where c a is the concentration at a reference level a 0 below the free surface or above the channel bed for settling particles and η the distance starting at the level a in downwards direction for rising particles and upwards for settling particles c is the suspended concentration and η 0 the distance from the level a to the channel bed or to the free surface for settling particles for positively buoyant plastics and downward η the rising velocity is positive and hence β 0 here we used quiescent transport experiments repeated three times to determine w for each plastic sample considered in sediment transport β may also be used to determine the dominant mode of sediment transport for instance see table 1 of cowger et al 2021 and eq 5 1c p 262 and p 403 of dey 2014 bed load suspended load β 1 5 to 2 5 and wash load β 0 8 eq 3 and eq 4 consider a turbulent schmidt number of 1 i e turbulent momentum diffusivity equal to the turbulent mass diffusivity see gualtieri et al 2017 and eq 3 of waldschläger et al 2022 bubbles attached to the plastic particle can represent an additional source of buoyancy and thus the total buoyancy may be better expressed as f ρ f b provided that w is determined from rising settling velocities of particles in quiescent water attached bubbles may also be present similar to the transport in turbulent flows therefore it is here assumed that β is representative of the total buoyant force this also implies that experiments in quiescent flows to determine w should be comparable to the protocols used for turbulent transport testing in appendix a and appendix b we show that bubbles attached to the plastic samples cannot explain the surface concentrations observed in experiments since the contribution of bubbles to the total buoyancy commonly remains at least one order of magnitude smaller than the buoyancy or surface tension appendix b based on laboratory observations of bubbles attachment f b is disregarded in the following another relationship of forces can be expressed as the ratio of surface tension explained by the vertical projection sin θ of the surface tension σ acting over the air water plastic contact line length l σ to turbulent forces due to the turbulent drag of water with density ρ w explained by a relative velocity difference δ u a drag coefficient c d and a plastic area exposed a differently from buoyancy this is only active in the upper layer of the concentration profile and when the plastic element protrudes through the water surface appendix a 5 f σ f d l σ σ sin θ 1 2 ρ w c d a δ u δ u we assume that l σ can be expressed by the two main orthogonal dimensions l max and l maximum main axis of a particle and its orthogonal counterpart see materials and methods this implies 6 ℓ σ 2 ℓ max ℓ we further assume that the contact angle vertical projection may remain constant across the interfacial contact line and the following term will be approximated as sin θ sin 30 1 2 for the drag forces appendix a we also assume that the vertical transport drag will be driven by turbulent fluctuations and consequently 7 δ u δ u u 2 the drag coefficient is however variable and reynolds dependent and different plastic element geometries may show different plastic water coupling however we assume here a representative value of c d 0 5 the area of the particle projected in the direction of the dragging flow can be expressed as a fraction f a of the area enclosing the object which can be written as 8 a f a l max l where f a may depend on the shape and deformability of the object for the sake of simplicity we assume a representative value to be in the order of f a 0 5 bringing together eq 5 to eq 8 a ratio for the surface tension to turbulent forces acting on a particle can be introduced which takes a form similar to an inverse plastic based weber number 9 γ σ l max l 1 2 3 ρ w l max l u 2 8 σ ρ w u 2 l max l l max l in eq 9 the numerator is proportional to the interfacial contact line whereas the denominator increases with the area of plastic exposed to turbulence this implies that surface tension effects become more important greater γ when the element is small or the flow velocity decreases besides although not captured in γ plastics with a corrugated shape or high fractal dimension would represent larger interfacial contact lines than considered in eq 9 thus subject to a stronger surface tension influence appendix a also presents the derivation of a plastic based bond number buoyancy to surface tension ratio but we deem more convenient to present the results based on β and γ since buoyancy and surface tension both act in the same direction in this study 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental setup experiments were conducted in the hydraulic engineering laboratory of the delft university of technology the plastic turbulent transport experiments took place in a rectangular flume fig 2 a e with main dimensions 14 40 m long 40 cm deep 40 cm wide and bed slope estimated at 0 00026 a 9 58 m long rough bed was installed to enhance turbulence in the flow the rough plates included closely packed sand grains with median diameter of 0 67 cm the granulometry curve is also included in fig 2c for completeness rising tests were conducted in a separate flume to characterize the rising velocity of the plastic samples under quiescent conditions the samples were introduced with a long grabbing arm and were released after the water surface seemed undisturbed for this test phase a static water tank was prepared in the middle of a horizontal flume after closing both ends with wood boards and water proofing both ends the dimensions of this water tank are 84 cm in depth and 77 cm width with over a meter in length a wooden frame was used to position four gopro hero9 cameras and record the rising process of the introduced samples velocities were obtained at 10 different levels during the rising process and tests were repeated three times 3 2 flow hydrodynamic characterization five different flow conditions are considered in the plastic transport experiments these discharges are used for all plastic classes considered in the experiments all discharges represent subcritical flows with high reynolds number table 1 water levels in the flume were controlled by a downstream gate the flow depth was both estimated in the flume with a point gauge for each experiment obtaining a mean value of 0 278 m 1 mm gauge resolution several camera recordings were analyzed obtaining a mean water depth of 0 278 m 1 2 mm as std of 10 estimations the flow characterization is carried out through velocity measurements at 2 cm vertical intervals using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vectrino version 1 24 00 and upstream hydrogen bubble seeding blanckaert and lemmin 2006 each point was sampled for at least 2 minutes which was determined as long enough recording based on preliminary longer samplings the sampling frequency was adjusted between 100 and 200 hz and transmit lengths between 1 8 and 2 4 mm depending on local signal quality each adv time series was analyzed following the protocol of appendix c the water discharge was obtained by fitting a theoretical velocity profile log wake law and potential flow outside of the boundary layer to the water velocity measurements and integrating them using a trapezoidal rule from bed level to water surface this was done for all five discharges in three different cross sections fig 2b with the farther downstream cross section sampled twice the latter time with 1 cm vertical resolution to assess sensitivity to vertical spacing in the measurements this resulted in roughly identical discharge estimations several redundant estimations of the discharge at different cross sections allowed estimating an uncertainty level for this variable ε q 100 std mean of 2 4 3 3 plastic samples we consider different clean positively buoyant macroplastic samples for the water transport experiments fig 3 and table 2 these are selected to be representative of riverine plastic litter observations while including different mechanical properties i rigid 3d objects cup shaped fig 3a d ii quasi 2d rigid fragments fig 3e f iii plastic bag films fig 3g j and iv face masks fig 3k m samples iii and iv are subject to deformations by hydrodynamic stresses and when inserted in a turbulent flow the plastic elements buckle and warp fig 3h j l m according to observations of van emmerik et al 2020 samples i iii belong to the 20 most widely found plastic elements in the rhine meuse delta riverbanks and are also representative of previous monitoring campaigns in asia van emmerik et al 2018 masks are also considered in our study given their sudden increase in the pollution share experienced during the covid 19 period 80 fold observed increase of masks in litter according to roberts et al 2021 further characteristics of the samples used in the experiments are presented in appendix d materials composing the experimental samples include polypropylene pp for cup samples and high density poly ethylene hdpe for films a material common in riverine litter not directly considered here is expanded polyestyrine eps given its low density between 0 016 to 0 640 g cm3 following van emmerik and schwarz 2020 similar buoyant characteristics may be expected for the masks by size all samples can be categorized as macro under all classification frameworks see hartmann et al 2019 which is the dominant category by weight in plastic pollution eriksen et al 2014 all face masks contain porous materials and were submerged for 72 hours prior to testing 3 4 plastics characterization three different sources of plastic elements were considered to produce the plastic elements samples plastic cups plastic films supermarket bags and disposable face masks fig 3 these three types of sources were manipulated to generate different plastic classes these are presented in fig 3 table 2 and appendix d the densities of prepared plastic samples are tested using a 50 ml pycnometer in the deltares geo lab for this distilled water was used as an immersion liquid 997 98 kg m3 at 21 c estimated using the same pycnometer from each sample small fragments are prepared to allow insertion into the pycnometer and carry out the measurements the density of these samples was tested and estimated according to the specifications of iso 1183 1 2019 e for pycnometer tests iso 2019 each density estimation was repeated 5 times thus allowing estimation of the method s uncertainty appendix d the samples material was determined based on the recycling codes found in the packaging which showed a good match with the expected density s range of each material and that here determined the plastic cups included size classes ranging from original form to fragmented parts including full 3d objects and quasi 2d fragments in addition manually damaged cups are also included in these sample groups crashed against the floor using human weight size classes of rectangular plastic films are similarly prepared after cutting out the handles of procured shopping bags hence obtaining near rectangular objects size measurements and rising velocities are presented in table 2 and appendix d 3 5 insertion protocol the insertion point is set at the beginning of the experimental flume fig 2 the plastic sample is carefully introduced inside the water using a 1 5 m long grabbing arm the newly submerged sample is either cleared from bubbles by hand deformable plastics or shaken 3 times for rigid samples while impacting the grabbing arm against the flume s metal structure this prevents most of the bubbles from remaining attached to the plastic body although a few may remain yet their contribution to buoyancy is deemed negligible as we discuss in appendix b the sample is released after holding it still with the grabbing arm for 5 seconds at around 20 30 of the water depth h the number of samples tested was designed based upon a combined monte carlo analysis and a two sided kolmogorov smirnov ks test appendix e analyzing the expected difference between a rouse profile sampled with a limited number of particles n from a reference true rouse suspended transport concentration profile eq 4 therefore n 150 was set as target for each experiment although some samples were lost during transport stuck in the channel glass for instance or may remain undetected 3 6 3d tracking of the plastic samples four gopro hero9 cameras were used to record the macroplastic samples at the downstream section of our test flume fig 2b three cameras were placed in a vertical plane in front of the observation window fig 2f and one camera was placed on a wooden frame over the top of the flume allowing a top view of the free surface the camera distortion radial tangential model and intrinsic camera parameters were calibrated using 15 images of a chess calibration board at different orientations to overcome possible changes of camera orientation throughout the measurement campaign fiduciary markers aruco markers see garrido jurado et al 2014 were used to continuously reconstruct the relative position of the cameras see fig 2e and supplementary material cameras recorded at 60 frames per second and were initiated by a common ir remote trigger an external flash light was used to perform cross camera time synchronization all cameras used a sony imx677 cmos sensor an automated detection routine was built to delineate the macroplastic element contours per frame from the cameras video sequence this is based on a background subtraction an hsv color space filter and different topological filters based on the expected shape and size of macro plastics the script was developed using the opencv python library bradski 2000 a stereo camera configuration was used to reconstruct the 3d location of the suspended object first the detected object centroid is transformed from camera coordinates to real world coordinates intrinsic and extrinsic transformations secondly the ray refraction at the air to water phase change is estimated see duinmeijer et al 2019 the minimum crossing distance between the stereo rays is used to estimate the 3d location of the detected object within the water channel the point reconstruction error was estimated by comparing the estimated 3d location from the stereo camera system and the measured position of the inside channel aruco markers suppl mat table s5 additionally camera 1 was used to automatically classify macroplastics that are transported in a suspended manner and those attached to the water surface in each frame the plastic perimeter is identified and its center of gravity c o g estimated a plastic element with at least one point pixel of the perimeter in contact with the free surface is considered a surfaced plastic to this end camera 1 was carefully placed such that the view is aligned with the channel water surface plane 4 results 4 1 open channel flume hydrodynamics plastic transport experiments were conducted in a laboratory flume under five fully controlled flow conditions table 1 and strict plastic insertion protocols instantaneous flow velocities were sampled for the five flow conditions table 1 across three different sections in an experimental rough bed flume fig 2 the flow reproduced in the flume features a boundary layer which is the most common flow present in rivers franca et al 2021 in fig 4 we show that our open channel flow follows classic theories for canonic river turbulence downstream cross section in the observation window see fig 2b the mean velocity profiles closely follow a log wake law with conventional log wake law parameters and reynolds normal stresses profiles following the expected decay with increasing distance to the wall further to the water hydrodynamics in the plastic observation window fig 4 we also present mean and turbulent flow quantities at an upstream location in the supplementary material fig s1 our sampled mean velocity profiles at all cross sections follow a log wake law as expected for a boundary layer flow see eq 1 of castro orgaz 2010 we use default parameters from literature for the log wake profile castro orgaz 2010 nezu and rodi 1986 including the recommended values of castro orgaz 2010 i e 8 5 for the constant of integration 0 2 for the wake strength parameter and 0 41 for the von kármán constant κ sand roughness was assumed as the value obtained through imaging of the roughness plates with these parameters fixed we obtain the boundary layer thickness δ and the shear velocity u using a least squares procedure in order to cross verify the turbulence quantities obtained we obtain the reynolds shear stress u x u z profile which is then used to estimate the shear velocity u τ and the boundary layer thickness δ τ we do so by fitting a line via the siegel slopes method median slope across point pairs which is a robust alternative to error reducing line fitting the zero crossing of this line allows direct estimation of u τ and δ τ with the fit of the mean velocity profiles and assuming a uniform velocity out of the boundary layer upper edge we numerically integrate the profile to obtain the specific discharge q predictions of the discharge across different cross sections is in good agreement and differences in the estimation of the shear velocity between both methods used mean velocity and turbulent shear stress are minor which suggests that low uncertainty is held in our hydrodynamic estimations 4 2 thickness of the surface tension dominated transport the centers of gravity c o g of plastics and their trajectories are estimated based on synchronous multi camera detection and reconstruction fig 5 a b all the detected plastics in contact with the water surface are classified as surface transport all surfaced plastics c o g are confined into a layer of thickness a in the near surface region which is here defined as the deepest point at which a surfaced plastic s c o g is detected we observe that the near surface region thickness a depends on the plastic elements travelling orientation which is either driven by i turbulence β or ii buoyancy β and it is however not affected by surface tension i e γ independent hence estimations of a values show a bimodal distribution each related to one of these two regimes i and ii plastics subject to intense turbulence regime i travel in arbitrary orientations within the water column when they touch the free surface the rest of the body is still affected by turbulence plastics can either crease or unfold if the mechanical properties allow any c o g of a sample can extend up to half of the distance between the two most separated points of a plastic element i e a 0 5 λ fig 5e appendix f with λ l max 2 l 2 1 2 nonetheless with increasing buoyancy regime ii samples are pushed up against the free surface turbulence may pull the plastic elements downward but it is insufficient to disturb their transport configuration hence the plastic elements rest against the free surface in a stable equilibrium position while being conveyed by the free stream flow the surface transport thickness a in regime ii corresponds to the configuration with minimum potential energy accounting for both i turbulence and ii buoyancy dominated regimes the lower limit of the surface transport layer can be estimated by a r2 0 59 rmse 0 012 m median abs err 0 0046 m fig 5e 10 a λ 0 36 0 14 tanh 3 2 β for 0 2 β 11 7 to ascertain significance to the existence of a transport layer that differs from turbulent suspension we conduct a statistical test specifically a two sided kolmogorov smirnov ks test appendix g the ks test is iteratively applied to the count profiles of each experiment this statistical methodology consists on the comparison of the observed vertical distribution of c o g of the plastic elements to a reference suspended transport profile herein a rouse suspended concentration profile rouse 1961 given by eq 4 instead of using best fit parameters as for instance zaat 2020 the reference rouse profile is estimated purely based on physical parameters β namely the rising velocity of the samples table 2 and the shear velocity of the flow table 1 the ks test is applied to an increasing number of points fig 5f starting from the sampling point nearest to the channel bed and gradually moving up until the free surface when reaching the upper layers of the water column the experimental observations start differing more significantly from the reference rouse profile this deviation of the empirical and theoretical profiles suggests that other physical mechanisms beyond a turbulent buoyant force balance may be driving the concentration in the near surface layer for the ks test a pronounced concavity in the concentration profile is usually marking the lower limit of the surface transport fig 5c and supplementary material this concavity is caused by the missing samples at this level which might have remained attached to the free surface fig 5c at z h 7 5 cm for instance a second mechanism triggering a significant p value is due to an overshooting of concentrations close to the surface fig 5d we note that a limited number of samples may lead to larger ks stats although this is well identified by the p value for completeness we include a monte carlo simulation with 85 000 pairs of reference suspended transport profiles in the background of fig 5f together with median and 5th 95th percentiles for a given number of samples considering a p value of 10 3 73 of the analyzed concentration profiles show distributions significantly deviating from suspended transport i e solely turbulence buoyancy dominated the depth at which this occurs a k s fig 5c d follows on average terms the thickness a explained by direct identification of the deepest plastic elements in contact with the free surface appendix f 4 4 transport of plastics in the near surface the total number of plastic elements detected in one experiment at a given cross section is here denoted as n p and is made of the particles in the lower suspended transport region n β and the particles in the near surface region n γ i e n p n β n γ fig 6 a within the near surface layer we observe plastic elements travelling in suspension n γ sus and surfaced plastics captured by the free surface and hence affected by surface tension n γ surf a plastic is counted within n γ surf when in contact with the free surface within the thickness a but not satisfying the prior condition the plastic element is counted as n γ sus plastics below the thickness a are all considered part of n β fig 6 and appendix f for the full dataset the relative frequency of surfaced plastics c γ surf n γ surf n p can be estimated by the following relationship c γ surf r2 0 71 rmse 0 17 median

can be readily observed by direct top view observation e g from high resolution satellite data automated cctv or manual counting eq 11 allows an estimation of the expected total plastic count for the complete water column n p n γ surf c γ surf the relative count of plastics in suspension in the lower water column can be explained by the following relationship c β n β n p r2 0 75 rmse 0 14 median

sampling with nets eq 12 allows the estimation of the total plastic count following n p n γ 1 c β and may hold lesser uncertainty than eq 11 for the sake of completeness we also estimate the non stationarity of these estimations by computing the of change of c β per unit meter within the observation window table f2 on average terms this amounts to 1 2 m positive and negative tend to compensate whereas the average absolute value i e expected intensity of the of change of c β per unit meter for a random experiment amounts to 8 5 we observe that surface tension effects on the concentration profile can be as intense as buoyancy for instance over 90 of plastics for γ 10 and β 2 are travelling as surfaced load fig 6b and appendix f our results suggest that in the near surface layer the role of suspension is diminished when compared to the remaining water column fig 5c d this modulation of the suspended count may be explained by the reduced number of samples available to travel in suspension after some being trapped at the free surface thus a suspended concentration profile alone cannot explain the near surface layer of thickness a and the lower water region of thickness h a together 5 discussion 5 1 plastics monitoring in rivers most common methods for the monitoring of plastics in rivers include van emmerik and schwarz 2020 1 visual counting using rivers infrastructure mounted cameras or satellite topouzelis et al 2019 and 2 sampling the flow using nets at different depths water surface monitoring alone or combined with limited net sampling are standardized monitoring methodologies gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 van emmerik et al 2018 although they can introduce bias in the total plastic budget cowger et al 2021 van der wal et al 2015 in the light of our findings we assess the bias and uncertainty related to four plastic monitoring strategies targeting the estimation of the plastic budget n p in the water column which reflect both common practices and upgraded procedures herein optimized two strategies str based on common practices are first considered str a the count at the free surface is considered as the estimate of the total plastic n p n γ surf the surface count corresponds to floating plastics that emerge through the free surface surfaced transport which are detectable independently of the water turbidity levels str b we consider the same monitoring of str a but with improved visibility conditions allowing identification of plastics in the upper 20 of the water column n p n γ this strategy assumes favorable visibility conditions in the field with plastics visually accessible up to a certain depth for instance 10 cm in the saigon river according to van emmerik et al 2018 or the use of nets that allow sampling down to a limited depth beneath the free surface both str a and str b are currently the common practice for plastics monitoring gonzález fernández and hanke 2017 lebreton et al 2017 topouzelis et al 2019 van emmerik et al 2018 and represent pessimistic and optimistic field conditions respectively the main inconvenience of these strategies is that they neglect most plastics transported in suspension which are a significant fraction for β 3 for this reason we propose two additional strategies str c we expand str b by estimating the suspended transport concentration through eq 12 n p n γ 1 c β this strategy acknowledges the existence of two transport layers and builds on the herein disclosed hydrodynamic behavior of plastics str d we expand str b by sampling the suspended transport concentration using nets at a given depth within the suspended transport layer n p n β n γ the sampled suspended concentration is used to infer a physically based rouse profile β defined which is integrated over the lower 80 water column the suspended sampling location is proposed at 60 of the water depth based on protocol optimization appendix h we show that basic monitoring practices only focusing on the water surface and near surface str a and str b can underestimate the total amount of plastic by up to 90 see fig 7 when β 1 which is consistent with discussion of van der wal et al 2015 and cowger et al 2021 regarding the need for sampling plastics in suspension str a and b can be a valid practice when the buoyant characteristics of the samples dominate over the flow turbulence β 3 distinctly two different regimes can dominate plastic transport depending on the values of β and γ by introducing str c fig 7 and table 3 we show that monitoring one layer while incorporating a point estimation for the plastics in the remaining water column with eq 12 leads to over a ten fold reduction of the bias and reduces uncertainty by half when compared to str b furthermore str d shares the improvement of str c in terms of bias but also achieves over a ten fold reduction of the uncertainty when compared to str b which nonetheless accounts for favorable visibility conditions in the application of a best practices monitoring protocol when adopting str c or d two relevant physically based parameters the rouse number β and γ are required which depend on the plastic element and flow conditions other optimized monitoring protocols independent of β and γ are also presented in the appendix h together with an assessment of their bias and uncertainty 5 2 implications for plastic removal we observe that besides buoyancy plastic related the vertical distribution of buoyant plastics is controlled by two other factors turbulence and surface tension for instance river reaches of low turbulence e g β 2 and γ 10 can offer an opportunity for efficient cleanup targeting the water surface since the surface count n γ dominates the plastic budget we also suggest that the free surface collection of plastics may be altered through hydrophobic coating or specific surface treatment of the plastic elements which can result in a positive impact on removal efforts although other chemical and toxicological implications should be carefully considered this can be achieved by targeting an increase of the air water plastic contact angle or the interfacial contact line contrastingly the presence of surfactants may impair plastic removal efforts 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the transport of macroplastics in turbulent river like flows by using laboratory experiments and physics based descriptors which include the ratio of buoyancy to turbulent forces β and the ratio of surface tension to turbulent diffusion γ we showed that in the upper water column two transport regimes can coexist regime i which is driven by the balance between buoyancy surface tension and turbulence surfaced transport and regime ii which is driven by the balance of buoyancy and turbulence suspended transport we note that in our experiments bubbles had a minor effect appendix b the near surface region thickness is defined by the maximum dimension of the plastic elements transported by the flow fig 5e eq 10 and appendix f suspended transport did not significantly deviate in statistical terms from a physically based without calibration rouse theoretical suspended transport profile eq 4 as shown in fig 5f this may hold true for microplastics and smaller size particles where large size effects of the plastic particles should be less important eq 3 and eq 4 were used considering a turbulent schmidt number of 1 gualtieri et al 2017 waldschläger et al 2022 calibrating this turbulent schmidt number should allow reducing deviations from the rouse profile in the suspended transport region where derivation hypotheses hold true in riverine monitoring campaigns failing to account for suspended transport can have major implications str a and b in fig 7 and table 3 this is relevant for small β and large γ values when only considering the surfaced plastic budget as representative of the total budget eq 11 can provide an estimation of the missing plastic budget fig 7 or allow an uncertainty estimation related to local flow conditions captured via β our results also suggest that eq 12 together with sampling in the near surface is a better suited monitoring option str c in fig 7 and table 3 although two points sampling combined with eq 4 still remains more robust str d in fig 7 and table 3 whereas the top performing monitoring strategy is str d in fig 7 and table 3 additional monitoring strategies are studied in appendix h advantages of these alternative monitoring techniques are the reduced information needed from the

appendix i supplementary materials image application 1 image video 2 appendix a hydrodynamic forces over the plastic centered control volume the weight buoyancy force f ρ can be estimated through the archimedes principle corresponding to the difference between the weight of the plastic element and the weight of the displaced water such as a1 f ρ ρ w g v b ρ p g v p with ρ w being the density of the water ρ p the particle density v b and v p the submerged volume and the element s volume respectively and g 9 81 m s2 the gravity acceleration the added buoyancy force f b can be written as a2 f b i n b ρ w ρ a g v d b i with ρ a the air density and v d b i the volume of a bubble i out of n b total bubbles of diameter d b i given by a3 v d b i 1 6 π d b i 3 the flowing water exerts stresses and pressure over the control volume which can be defined as a4 f w e z p d i τ n d s with e z 0 0 1 the vertical unit vector given that the sum of forces is established for the vertical direction z n n x n y n z the outward vector normal to d s the infinitesimal element of surface enclosing the 3d control volume p d the dynamic pressure deviation from the hydrostatic component i is the unit diagonal tensor and τ the reynolds stress tensor τ τ i j with i j x z y the first term p d i represents the form drag resulting from non hydrostatic pressure surrounding the plastic element and the second term corresponds to the reynolds stress contribution to the drag eq a4 requires knowledge on pressures and turbulent stresses acting over the control volume surface alternative approaches to the flow plastic interaction include i distinguishing between undisturbed flow and disturbed flow forces see chap 4 of crowe et al 2012 or ii distinguishing between quasi steady drag and unsteady forces i e added mass and basset forces see chap 4 of clift et al 1978 the undisturbed flow considers changes in pressure and velocities of the flow due to reasons exogenous to the element itself for instance local accelerations in a contraction and hence depend on the water flow through the channel for the disturbed flow forces an integral approach is based on the use of a quasi steady drag f d approach which can be brought together with the following unsteady forces the added mass force f v m and basset force f b a5 f w f d f vm f b considering an integral approach and disregarding unsteady forces a6 f w f d for the quasi steady drag f d we consider that the plastic particle is dragged by a velocity difference between the instantaneous water and particle velocities δ u a7 f d 1 2 ρ w c d a δ u δ u with c d the drag coefficient commonly obtained empirically in quiescent water conditions i e free falling or free raising particles and a is the frontal area of the object when a plastic element is only partly submerged an air water plastic contact line exists in this interfacial contact line the free surface bends thus leading to a vertical component of the surface tension force see fig 1d the surface tension force can be expressed in terms of the capillary action over the interfacial contact line white 2016 a8 f σ σ sin θ d ℓ ℓ σ σ sin θ with σ 0 073 n m the surface tension white 2006 and sin θ accounts for the vertical projection of the force and d l is a differential segment in the interfacial contact line eq a8 assumes that surface tension has an equally distributed effect over the contact length l σ the contact angle depends on the air water plastic physico chemical conditions white 2016 and the plastic water air contact geometry the previous equations allow obtaining β and γ plastic based inverse weber number a third ratio of relevant forces can be given by the buoyancy to surface tension forces ratio both of these forces are acting in the positive direction but the second one is only present in the upper region of the water column the maximum magnitude of f ρ for a buoyant particle occurs when the object is fully submerged v b v p and thus a9 f ρ f σ ρ w ρ p g v p ℓ σ σ sin θ due to experimental constraints it may arise more feasible to estimate the mass of a plastic element than its volume and it may thus be convenient to write v p m ρ p following the previous approximations the ratio between buoyancy and surface tension forces can be expressed as a10 λ ρ w ρ p 1 gm σ l max l which is a plastic based bond or eötvös number a combination of two of the three parameters β γ and λ should suffice to describe the turbulent transport at the free surface it is here judged convenient to use β as it is well established and most useful for the study of suspended transport and use γ as complementary parameter since it better represents the balance between positive and negative forces surface tension keeping at upper levels the plastic body whereas turbulence dragging it away from the free surface in analogy to β furthermore ρ p is not available for masks and interpretation of λ is not straightforward an increase of λ means that plastics will be more often in contact with the free surface as well where surface tension is activated and a decrease of λ means that surface tension becomes more intense than buoyancy yet lesser plastics will approach the free surface besides both buoyancy and surface tension act in the same direction in this study appendix b relative contribution of surface tension bubbles and buoyancy to plastic dynamics surface tension when plastics protrude the free surface surface tension acts over the contact line the contact angle of pp is estimated by vlaeva et al 2012 at 97 0 0 8 at 25 c while for hdpe de luna et al 2014 estimated 96 5 3 4 at 25 c different temperatures or surface treatments can alter the contact angle for reference accu dyne test 2009b compiles contact angles from different studies for pp with values commonly ranging between 95 and 117 for pe both low and high density pe accu dyne test 2009a lists values commonly ranging between 93 and 105 bubbles bubbles can be attached to the plastic samples the insertion protocol leads to the detachment of most of the bubbles but some may inadvertently remain at the plastic surface we observed the number of bubbles in 20 different samples following our insertion protocol for the following plastic classes table 2 cup pp 100 cup pp 05 and film hdpe 15 under the lowest and highest discharges considered in the transport experiments v1 and v5 see table 1 we held the plastic samples close to the channel glassed wall without releasing them and we identified the number of bubbles attached to the plastic element the diameter could not be accurately determined but it was classified within the following groups small medium and large which roughly correspond to 1 mm 1 mm and 1 mm the bubbles counts are presented in the available data we observe that mainly small bubbles remain attached to the plastics surface i e bubbles of 1 mm or lesser where surface tension stabilizes them more effectively we rarely observed more than one 1 mm bubble attached to the plastic sample and never more than five 1 mm bubbles relative contribution in order to assess the relevance of the added buoyancy contributed by attached bubbles we consider an idealized sample based on cup pp 100 fig b1a this idealized sample is formed by a cylinder with one cover in one end hence a simplistic plastic cup the height of this idealized plastic cup is 83 mm l max and the diameter constant across height differently from cup pp 100 is 55 2 mm l based on cup pp 100 properties see table 2 considering the total volume of cup pp 100 table 2 and its idealized dimensions the mean thickness of this virtual sample corresponds to 130 μm considering the pp plastic density estimated with pycnometer table 2 and a given number of bubbles n b we estimate the forces for quiescent water conditions and a static plastic element f w 0 n and different submergence levels percentage of cup within the water of a horizontal cup i e axis parallel to the water surface the forces evaluated on the control volume are shown in fig b1 we observe that even for extreme unrealistic conditions n b 25 d b 2 mm fig b1c the effect of bubbles is smaller than any surface tension scenario considered contact angles 97 105 and 115 fig b1b e we consider here that the contact angle can yield a variable vertical projection sin θ either in the inner and outer faces of the cup fig b1a accounting for other factors such as the dynamic surface tension which can be up to 40 larger than the static one hauner et al 2017 would reinforce the hypothesis that surface tension force is significantly larger than the remaining bubbles contribution we also observe that the contact line inside and outside of the cup is reasonably insensitive to the submergence level for this plastic orientation since it is dominated by l max yet in our calculations surface tension nulls when submergence approaches 0 and 1 0 because of symmetry of forces between inner and outer faces in reality right before detachment from the surface only the outer face is in contact with the free surface we call this situation the maximum surface tension state max sigma state which we analyze separately below upward positive surface tension forces represent a jump condition escape over a barrier condition amir 2021 to be overcome by an extreme turbulence event bubbles different from surface tension effects would affect the plastic elements at all depths and not only in the near free surface thus modifying the rouse profile from bed to surface maximum surface tension state max sigma state we consider now the state of maximum surface tension max sigma state table b1 possible during the plastic transport experiments fig b1f for cups this is the last contact before detachment with only its external face in contact with the free surface note that in fig b1b e the inner face of the cup can present downward surface tension partially compensating the outer face of the cup for films the max sigma state is horizontally extended at the free surface while only the lower face is wet the contact angles considered correspond to that of vlaeva et al 2012 for pp and de luna et al 2014 for hdpe although in this state the resultant does not change significantly for contact angles between 75 to 110 and thus is less sensitive to the material appendix c water velocimetry filtering each adv time series was analyzed following the protocol detailed below instantaneous velocity samples with cor 80 correlation and snr 10 db signal to noise ratio were filtered out replaced by a nan a mean flow velocity was estimated for each point of the profile the median misalignment of each profile based on x and y mean velocities u x and u y respectively was estimated and then instantaneous velocity estimations were corrected rotation to null u y all misalignments remained below 1 9 degrees with an average value of the absolute rotations of 0 9 degrees an statistical filtering was applied to each time series based on the phase space thresholding method of goring and nikora 2002 as modified by wahl 2003 no spike replacement was performed but instead a nan value was considered for the position of the outlier the percentage of nan for each u x u y and u z time series was estimated when the maximum of these three surpassed 40 the point recording was discarded from the profile data acceptance rate are summarized in the supplemental material table s1 appendix d plastic samples properties main physical and geometrical properties of the plastic samples are presented in table d1 table d2 and table d3 appendix e statistical test for the determination of the number of samples used in the experiments the uncertainty analysis for the suspended particles concentration included generating 1 000 synthetic experiments for each of the 85 different levels of n sample size considered which varied between 10 and 1 000 samples i e a total of 85 000 simulations the inverse transform sampling method was used to draw random samples from eq 4 a sample 1 with a limited n number of particles drawn was compared to a control sample with much larger number of samples 9 999 particles drawn which is regarded as reference true rouse profile the kolmogorov smirnov statistic fig 5f background shows the maximum difference between the cumulative density functions of sample 1 and the control sample differences can be expected decreasing with n as a part of the stochastic nature of the experiments a total number of 150 samples was considered sufficient to keep uncertainty reasonable while allowing ample testing in laboratory appendix f detected plastics statistics the thickness of the surface transport layer is presented in table f1 and the count per transport region in table f2 appendix g statistical test for the detection of the surface transport layer in addition to the direct classification of plastic elements touching the water surface a second method is used to identify the near surface layer in this layer not all plastics are transported in suspension β dependent the transport of those plastics in contact with the free surface is controlled by surface tension γ dependent to ascertain significance to the existence of a transport layer where plastics dispersion does not behave solely based on turbulence and buoyancy we conduct a statistical test specifically a two sided kolmogorov smirnov ks test this consists on the comparison of the observed vertical distribution of plastic elements concentration of c o g to a reference theoretical suspended transport profile given eq 4 the reference rouse profile is estimated purely based on physical parameters β namely the rising velocity of the samples table 2 and the shear velocity of the flow table 1 and hence does not correspond to a best fit calibration as in previous studies the ks test ks stat see fig 5f and p value is iteratively applied with increasing number of samples starting from the channel bed up to the water surface inside the layer defined by a k s the vertical distribution of the plastics counting in the experiments and the reference suspended profiles significantly differ p value 10 3 appendix h alternative riverine monitoring techniques and performance when adopting str 4 or 8 table h1 or str c or d in the manuscript two relevant physically based parameters the rouse number β and γ are required which depend on the plastic element and flow conditions for that purpose local hydrodynamic quantities u can be estimated based on discharge and river bed roughness cowger et al 2021 whereas plastic main geometry l max l needs to be determined as well as the rising velocity w if the rising velocity is not available literature estimations such as those proposed by waldschläger et al 2020 can be used together with the density estimated based on the material type in case of clean plastic samples van emmerik and schwarz 2020 alternatively optimized monitoring protocols independent of β and γ are also presented in table h1 in all strategies where sampling of the suspended layer is performed it is considered that the net would capture a layer of 10 the water depth this is extrapolated afterwards following different strategies str 5 8 to the whole water column or a portion of it the performance of each monitoring strategy is presented in table h1 and detailed in table h6 and fig h1 optimisations of the sampling point are supported by table h2 table h3 table h4 and table h5 and a summary of the bias and uncertainty of all monitoring strategies is presented in table h6
