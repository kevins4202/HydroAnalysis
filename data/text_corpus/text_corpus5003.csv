25015,the ability to classify habitats and movement pathways as sources or sinks is an important part of the decision making process for the conservation of spatially structured populations diverse approaches have been used to quantify the importance of habitats and pathways in a spatial network however these approaches have been limited by a lack of general applicability across life histories and movement strategies in this paper we develop a generalized per capita contribution metric the c metric for quantifying habitat and pathway quality this metric is novel in that it can be applied broadly to both metapopulations and migratory species it allows for any number of age and sex classes unlimited number of seasons or time intervals within the annual cycle and for density dependent parameters we demonstrate the flexibility of the metric with four case studies a hypothetical metapopulation elk of the greater yellowstone ecosystem northern pintail ducks in north america and the eastern population of the monarch butterfly general computer code to calculate the per capita contribution metric is provided we demonstrate that the c metric is useful for identifying source and sink habitats in a network and suggest that the c metric could be supplemented by some measure of network structure for a more robust description of habitat or pathway importance keywords migration network model habitat quality spatial ecology metric ecological traps 1 introduction understanding the movement of individuals across space and time is fundamental to making management decisions migratory species and some species showing metapopulation dynamics can be difficult to conserve and manage because they use multiple habitat types across geographies that span political boundaries behrens et al 2008 wilcove and wikelski 2008 visser et al 2009 runge et al 2017 tucker et al 2018 a crucial part of developing conservation strategies for such species is assessing the relative importance of the habitats they occupy over the course of their full annual cycle martin et al 2007 kölzsch and blasius 2008 sawyer and kauffman 2011 it is therefore worth developing metrics that account for both habitat connectivity and demography johnson et al 2018 robertson et al 2018 zamberletti et al 2018 although several habitat contribution metrics exist for spatially structured populations nicol et al 2016 these metrics were not designed to account for seasonal migration applying these metrics to a migratory population can therefore be problematic recently several approaches have been developed to address the question of habitat importance for migratory populations the metric c r originally developed by runge et al 2006 for non migratory but spatially structured populations is the per capita contribution to the next generation by individuals that occur in a particular habitat r wiederholt et al 2018 adapted this per capita contribution metric for migratory species which accounts for seasonal movement between multiple breeding and non breeding habitats and for both resident and migratory cohorts this metric however is limited to a two season population of juveniles and adults erickson et al 2018 considered per capita contribution metrics for a migratory network but only for the case of a single class of individuals the usefulness of per capita contribution metrics is that they allow managers to compare habitat node and pathway edge values and thus compare locations and routes across an entire migratory network for a species nodes and edges can be classified as sources or sinks erickson et al 2018 and prioritized for management actions based on their relative values the relative importance of different habitats has also been used to spatially allocate the value of ecosystem services provided by migratory species semmens et al 2011 2018 although per capita contribution metrics have been recognized as important tools for understanding dynamics of spatially structured populations until now there has been no generalized method that accounts for the full range of life history strategies in this paper we generalize an existing per capita contribution metric wiederholt et al 2018 which we will refer to as the c metric the c metric is novel in that it can be applied to any number of seasons non equal season lengths varied class structures and the full range of movement strategies we illustrate the c metric by applying our model to four example species the first is a simple hypothetical metapopulation for demonstrating the calculation and illustrating that the metric can be applied to non migratory metapopulations we then apply the metric to existing models sample et al 2018 of a partially migratory population cervus canadensis elk a complete migratory population anas acuta northern pintail and a population exhibiting a stepping stone migration strategy danaus plexippus monarch butterflies these cases represent a diversity of age and stage structures along with alternate types of migration our generalization which relies on mathematics from matrix algebra includes general r code for calculating the c metric to more easily allow use by managers and decision makers bieri et al 2019 we draw several new insights about population dynamics revealed in each of the case studies 2 materials and methods borrowing from the matrix population models that are used widely to study age and size structured populations rogers 1966 pascarella and horvitz 1998 caswell 2001 hunter and caswell 2005 we construct a time dependent projection matrix a t that contains the demographic and movement information required to calculate the c metric in doing so we represent the spatial structure of a population as a network in which habitats are nodes and movement pathways are edges taylor and norris 2010 sample et al 2018 symbols used throughout this paper are given in tables 1 3 we consider a population of c age classes or life stages in a network of n nodes and s seasons individuals are classified by both their class and location one time step from t to t 1 represents one season in the annual cycle seasons do not have to be equal in duration and s time steps from t to t s represents one year we define a t as an nc nc matrix that projects the population in all classes and nodes from one time step to the next each entry in a t gives the probability that an individual in a given node and class at time t will contribute to that class or become another class in the same or another node by time t 1 to ease the construction of this matrix we write it as the product of two matrices 1 a t ℚ t f t the block matrix f t contains demographic update information at the nodes such as fecundity class transition and survival rates see eqs 2 and 3 and block matrix ℚ t contains update information along the pathways such as movement and survival probabilities see eqs 4 and 5 f t is defined as 2 f t i 1 n e n i i f i t t where represents the kronecker product e n ii is an n n zero matrix with a 1 at position ii and f i t is a c c demographic projection matrix for node i 3 f i t f i t 11 f i t 12 f i t 1 c f i t 21 f i t 22 f i t 2 c f i t c 1 f i t cc element f i t x y represents individuals transitioning from class x to class y at node i and time t and f i t x x represents individuals remaining in class x these elements may be given as survival probabilities and may also include births so their values may be greater than 1 matrix ℚ t is defined as 4 ℚ t x 1 c q t x t e c x x where q t x is an n n movement matrix 5 q t x q 11 t x q 12 t x q 1 n t x q 21 t x q 22 t x q 2 n t x q n 1 t x q n n t x elements are of the form q i j t x p i j t x s i j t x which represents the proportion of individuals of class x that move p i j t x and survive s i j t x the transition from node i to node j at time t each element is a product of two probabilities and must therefore be a non negative number less than or equal to 1 the population projected over an entire annual cycle beginning at any time t is given by the seasonal product matrix a ˆ t a t s 1 a t 1 a t the transpose of this product matrix 6 a ˆ t t τ t t s 1 a τ t a t t a t 1 t a t s 1 t will be used to calculate the per capita contribution metric it is important to note two features of our model first we have chosen in the formulation of a t to apply demographic updates after each dispersal event switching this order would modify a t hunter and caswell 2005 second our framework is flexible to handle population models that have density dependent reproduction survival and movement probabilities for example if the survival rates of a migration model are seasonal and density dependent then f t f n t t ℚ t ℚ n t t and a t a n t t will be time and density dependent matrices as such population abundance at the beginning of the time step can be determined by solving the following recurrence relation 7 n t 1 a t n t where n t is an nc 1 block vector whose c 1 subvectors n i t give the class distribution within each node i at time t furthermore n t s a ˆ t n t will give the population size after one annual cycle provided n t and the annual population growth rate for anniversary date t can be defined as λ t w t a ˆ t t 1 n c here w t n t t n t tot is the population proportion at time t where n t tot is the network population size summed across all nodes and all classes during time step t and 1 n c is a nc 1 vector of ones more details on model construction can be found in the supplementary material 2 1 habitat contribution metric wiederholt et al 2018 following runge et al 2006 defined the per capita contribution c r of a focal habitat r as the expected number of individuals generated from an adult individual occupying the focal habitat in a given year the value of this metric depends on the anniversary season which we define as the season from which c r is calculated c r can differ for example if it is calculated from spring to spring vs fall to fall in the same network the c r metric is specific for a system of two classes adults and juveniles and two seasons so that their formulation only considered two time steps in the annual cycle this metric assumes juveniles and adults have the same movement transition probabilities it also assumes juveniles born in the breeding season remain juveniles in the subsequent migratory period furthermore although the metric accounted for differing survival rates between adults and juveniles the per capita contribution metric was only calculated for adults we begin by extending c r in several ways first given a focal habitat and anniversary date we define a per capita contribution metric c that can be calculated for any class our notation of this metric differs from previous works runge et al 2006 wiederholt et al 2018 in that the focal node and time step are given as subscripts and the class is a superscript for instance c r t j is the number of individuals that are generated after one annual cycle by time t s from a single juvenile individual occupying the focal habitat r in the previous year with anniversary date t we also generalize the metric for class specific movement transition probabilities transitions between ages or stages and breeding may occur at any time and possibly multiple times during the annual cycle furthermore the c metric can account for any number of seasons and any number of classes or stages formally c r t x is the expected contribution of a single individual of class x and its offspring starting at node r and time t to the whole population after one annual cycle c r t x is calculated by summing the contributions from all possible demographic and movement transitions that may happen to an individual moving forward through one annual cycle we will use matrix algebra to calculate the c metric for every node class and anniversary season we define c t as a block vector whose elements are c r t x c t c 1 t 1 c 1 t 2 c 1 t c c 2 t 1 c 2 t 2 c n t c the data required to calculate the values of this vector are contained in the annual projection matrix defined in eqs 1 6 we solve for c t by taking the product of the transpose of the annual projection matrix and an nc 1 vector of ones 8 c t τ t t s 1 a τ t 1 n c a ˆ t t 1 n c this matrix product sums across possible annual pathways that migrants can take throughout the annual cycle if c r t x is greater than one a single individual of class x starting at time t and node r is expected to replace itself and add to the size of the population if c r t x is less than one individuals do not replace themselves and thus their contribution reduces overall population size a diagram of how the c metric is calculated is given in fig 1 to use the c metric for assessing the quality of habitats regardless of class we must average we use a class population weighted average to obtain a single metric for each habitat and anniversary season 9 c r t x 1 c n r t x n r t c r t x where n r t is the population size of node r at time t and n r t x n r t is the proportion of individuals of class x at the node this results in a single per capita contribution value for each node r beginning in time step t this metric indicates whether the focal node is a source c r t 1 or a sink c r t 1 at time t next since c r t depends on the anniversary season to obtain a single node metric regardless of anniversary season we use a seasonal population weighted average 10 c r τ t t s 1 n r τ c r τ τ t t s 1 n r τ this calculation gives more weight to a season in which the node s population size is large relative to the other seasons similar to the contribution metrics developed by runge et al 2006 and wiederholt et al 2018 the generalized metric presented here when weighted by the fraction of the population they represent sums to the annual population growth rate for each anniversary date λ t w t c t where w t is the population proportion 2 2 pathway contribution metric we extend the work of wiederholt et al 2018 and provide a generalized formulation of the per capita contribution of edge or pathway transitions the annual per capita contribution of an individual of class x starting at node r and traveling to node d at time t is 11 c r d t x 1 n c t p r d t x a t t e n r d h c x τ t 1 t s 1 a τ t 1 n c where is the hadamard entrywise product p r d t x is the proportion of individuals of class x at node r that will travel to node d at time t contained in movement matrix q t x of eq 5 and h c x is a c c zero matrix with ones in column x recall that e n rd is an n n zero matrix with a 1 at position rd if at time t no individuals of class x use edge rd p r d t x 0 then c r d t x 0 while the equation for pathway contribution is more cumbersome the generalized calculation remains straightforward for any number of classes or stages a variety of migration strategies and any number of seasons similar to averaging the metric for habitat contribution given an anniversary season we construct a single metric for pathway contribution we weight each c r d t x by the number of migrants of class x that use edge rd at time t to obtain 12 c r d t x 1 c p r d t x n r t x c r d t x x 1 c p r d t x n r t x then by averaging across classes and seasons we obtain a single metric for each edge 13 c r d τ t t s 1 x 1 c p r d t x n r τ x c r d τ x τ t t s 1 x 1 c p r d t x n r τ x 3 case studies in this section we show that the c metric can be calculated for populations representing a diverse range of life histories movement patterns and carrying capacities we first apply our model to a simple hypothetical metapopulation to demonstrate matrix construction and illustrate results and then to three migratory populations the simpler example of seasonal partial migration of elk the more complicated seasonal complete migration of northern pintails and finally the stepping stone migration of monarch butterflies we note that the parametrization and modeling of these migratory populations have been developed previously sample et al 2018 the results presented in this paper are in the application of the c metric for ease of discussion in each example we simulate population dynamics until equilibrium or steady state is reached however the metric does not require the equilibrium assumption variables used in our calculations of the c metric are determined by their values at the end of these numerical simulations we assume equilibrium has been reached when the population is within 0 01 individuals from one year to the next comparing like seasons we note that the c metric can be calculated using non equilibrium parameter values that change from one annual cycle to the next this would lead to network growth rates that are greater or less than one and c metric values that change from one year to the next see the supplementary information for details of model setup and bieri et al 2019 for parameter values and code developed in r to calculate these metrics for each example 3 1 hypothetical metapopulation we begin with a simple hypothetical metapopulation model in this network fig 2 there are two nodes two classes and two seasons the two classes are juveniles j and adults a and the two seasons are breeding b and wintering w in one time step one season individuals can either remain in the same node or disperse to the other node by traveling along weighted and directed edges in the network in this hypothetical network node 2 is of lower quality e g lower carrying capacity compared to node 1 at the beginning of the breeding season the population sizes rounded to the nearest whole number of juveniles and adults are n 1 b j 115 n 1 b a 245 at node 1 and n 2 b j 50 and n 2 b a 105 at node 2 juveniles then transition to adults with some survival probability adults survive and surviving adults produce new juveniles survival rates are the same across seasons and are given by s 1 a 0 9 s 1 j 0 8 s 2 a 0 7 and s 2 j 0 6 we assume node 1 is closer to its carrying capacity than node 2 and set the reproductive rates as r 1 0 6665 and r 2 0 5813 at the end of the breeding season individuals disperse within the network the post breeding wintering populations are n 1 w j 155 n 1 w a 290 n 2 w j 70 and n 2 w a 125 individuals survive the winter season with the same probabilities as in the breeding season in our calculations we sort by nodes then classes so that the population vector is given by n t t n 1 t j n 1 t a n 2 t j n 2 t a t to formulate a t we begin by constructing matrices f t and ℚ t we create these matrices for the breeding t b and wintering t w seasons at steady state during the breeding season the demographic matrix of eq 3 is f i b 0 s i j r i s i a i 1 2 here the elements in the top row represent juvenile survival and juvenile transition to adults respectively note that all surviving juveniles transition to adults in this season the bottom row represents reproduction adults creating juveniles and adult survival respectively during the wintering season there are no class transitions and only survival within the classes f i w s i j 0 0 s i a i 1 2 the demographic block matrices of eq 2 for the breeding and wintering seasons are f b f 1 b t 0 0 f 2 b t 0 0 6665 0 0 0 8 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 5813 0 0 0 6 0 7 f w f 1 w t 0 0 f 2 w t 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 7 we now set up the matrices of eq 5 in this hypothetical model movement does not depend on class or season and individuals are more likely to remain residents than disperse to the other node individuals have an 80 probability of remaining at node 1 and a 60 probability of remaining at node 2 therefore the matrices of eq 5 which are class and time independent in this model are q j q a 0 8 0 2 0 4 0 6 thus the movement block matrices of eq 4 are ℚ b ℚ w q j t 1 0 0 0 q a t 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 4 0 0 0 8 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 6 0 0 0 2 0 0 6 from eq 1 we have the following projection matrices for the breeding and wintering seasons a b ℚ b f b 0 0 5332 0 0 2325 0 6400 0 7200 0 2400 0 2800 0 0 1333 0 0 3488 0 1600 0 1800 0 3600 0 4200 a w ℚ w f w 0 6400 0 0 2400 0 0 0 7200 0 0 2800 0 1600 0 0 3600 0 0 0 1800 0 0 4200 we calculated the per capita contributions for each node class and anniversary season using the matrix multiplication defined in eq 8 at equilibrium the per capita contribution equations for the breeding and wintering seasons are c b a b t a w t 1 4 c w a w t a b t 1 4 we then use eq 9 to average across classes and eq 10 to average across seasons adults who contribute to the population through reproduction have higher c values than juveniles table 4 after averaging across classes our results indicate that an individual at node 1 is expected to contribute more individuals to the network than an individual from node 2 we categorize node 1 as a source c r 1 and node 2 as a sink c r 1 the pathway that represents node 1 s resident population c 11 has a higher contribution value and the pathway representing node 2 s resident population c 22 has a lower value table 5 3 2 elk in the greater yellowstone ecosystem we apply our model of habitat and pathway contribution to a population of elk located in the greater yellowstone ecosystem henceforth yellowstone to parameterize the model we begin with the modeling framework presented in sample et al 2018 with model parameters and density dependent assumptions based on the literature singer et al 1997 taper and gogan 2002 middleton et al 2013 values of the parameters at equilibrium were used to calculate the c metric elk partially migrate among three geographical locations fig 3 one location node 3 is near cody wyoming where two groups of elk reside one that remains resident year round and another that migrates to yellowstone the elk that remain resident year round in node 3 breed there in the summer season yellowstone node 1 is the summering location where migrating elk breed and the location between cody and yellowstone node 2 is where migrating elk winter all elk in this location migrate to yellowstone during the summer for breeding middleton et al 2013 one annual cycle comprises two seasons season 1 includes winter and spring migration and season 2 includes summer and fall migration we modeled female elk of two classes juveniles j and adults a during season 1 juveniles and adults survive at class specific survival rates during season 2 all surviving juveniles transition into adults surviving adults reproduce and create juveniles and adults survive we obtained the per capita contributions for each class at each node and average across classes and seasons at equilibrium according to eqs 9 and 10 the average per capita contributions were close to 1 for every node table 6 node 2 had a slightly higher per capita contribution than the other nodes this indicates that an individual starting in the wintering node is expected on average to contribute more individuals to the population compared to the breeding and year round nodes however as the per capita contributions were near 1 c r 0 8 within 1 none of the nodes could be clearly classified as a source or sink results for the pathway metric presented in table 7 demonstrate that the fall migration paths from node 1 to node 2 and from node 1 to node 3 have the largest per capita contribution the other three edges have per capita contributions close to 1 with the spring migration route from node 3 to node 1 as the only path considered a sink 3 3 northern pintail northern pintail is widely distributed in wetland regions it breeds in the northern areas of north america europe and asia and winters from southern temperate to tropical regions of the northern hemisphere birdlife international 2019 the population model in sample et al 2018 which used the parameter values and model assumptions from mattsson et al 2012 has four classes three seasons and five nodes the four population classes are adult males am adult females af juvenile males jm and juvenile females jf the annual cycle is divided into three seasons breeding wintering and spring flyover nodes 1 through 3 i e alaska ak prairie potholes pr and northwest unsurveyed nu are breeding habitats whereas nodes 4 and 5 i e california ca and gulf coast gc are wintering habitats fig 4 in the wintering season 2 all juveniles transition to adults no births deaths or age transitions occur during the flyover season 3 rather migrants decide whether to stay in pr or continue flyover to ak or nu in the model proportion of flyovers is density dependent and evaluated at population equilibrium we calculate the per capita contributions averaged across classes and seasons at equilibrium table 8 on average a single individual starting in nodes 2 pr or 5 gc is expected to contribute more individuals to the population than it loses whereas the opposite is true for an individual starting at nodes 1 ak 3 nu and 4 ca as such pr and gc are sources and the remaining habitats are sinks the spring migratory paths from the wintering nodes ca and gc had the largest contribution table 9 the fall migratory pathways from the breeding nodes ak pr and nu to the wintering nodes ca and gc had the smallest contributions 3 4 monarch butterfly monarch butterfly in eastern north america migrate from breeding areas in the northern u s and southern canada to a non breeding area in central mexico the population model developed in flockhart et al 2015 was converted to a network based model using the framework presented in sample et al 2018 there is one class adult females seven seasons and four nodes the seven seasons of the annual cycle are winter october through may april may june july august and september breeding occurs april through september the four nodes represent regions of eastern north america mexico m south s central c and north n enumerated 1 through 4 respectively fig 5 mexico is considered a wintering node and the other three nodes are breeding nodes seasonal edge transition and survival probabilities are assumed to be constant from year to year based on the c metric an individual starting in the north node 4 is expected to contribute the least to the population whereas an individual starting in the central region node 3 is expected to contribute the most table 10 note that all individuals reside in mexico node 1 and the south node 2 during winter and april respectively therefore the per capita contributions of mexico and south are equivalent to the network growth rate λ 1 during these seasons this is true even when the network is out of equilibrium thus given a c metric of 1 each individual wintering in mexico or residing in the south in april is expected to replace itself over the annual cycle considering the per capita contributions of the pathways the resident transition in the central node contributes the most whereas the spring migration from south to north contributes the least table 11 4 discussion we have shown how the demographic contributions of individuals from discrete habitats can be quantified by a generalized c metric and that this generalization can describe populations exhibiting a diversity of movement strategies the metric can be applied to a wide range of spatially structured populations with any number of classes seasons or types of movement strategies including simple two patch systems complex metapopulations and complete seasonal migration this metric is simple to calculate as long as estimates for seasonal demographic and movement parameters are available it does not require density dependent functions although these can be incorporated in the projection matrix it also does not require the population to be at equilibrium while the metric is sufficiently general to be applied to metapopulation networks as in the simple example we provided and as shown in more complex examples e g strasser et al 2012 we found it particularly useful for gaining a better understanding about the roles of discrete habitats in migratory networks in the elk example middleton et al 2013 found that elk migrating each spring into yellowstone national park had declining calf recruitment and pregnancy rates this process was captured through the low pathway contribution value for the spring edge from 3 to 1 and with the overall lower node contribution value for node 3 these findings indicate that the year round cody wy area was potentially a minor sink subpopulation in 2009 given the c r values slightly below 1 and that the role of this region in the overall population has shifted as habitat quality declined from 1989 to 2009 results from the pintail example matched some expectations but not others the prairie pothole region pr is recognized as providing crucial breeding habitat for many migratory waterfowl species including the pintail podruzny et al 2002 doherty et al 2016 pr had the highest c r value among regions and serves as a strong source c r 5 above 1 in alignment with expectations the role of wintering areas has until now been viewed as secondary miller et al 2003 but we found that at equilibrium an individual overwintering in the gulf coast habitat contributed nearly the same number of individuals to the population as did an individual that bred in the pr this contradicts findings of a perturbation analysis which showed that increasing reproduction in the pr by 10 had a larger effect on continental scale carrying capacity than did increasing habitat area by 10 in the gulf coast habitat mattsson et al 2012 there was a disparity between the two wintering regions in terms of their per capita contributions which we did not expect although the habitat in california supports more overwintering individuals at carrying capacity it acts like a weak sink c r is 5 below 1 due to most california birds migrating to alaska where reproduction is insufficient to maintain a growing population on its own we also found that the northern unsurveyed habitat serves as a strong sink c r is 5 below 1 this is in line with our expectation that this habitat plays a minor role in continental population dynamics due to having substantially lower reproduction compared to the other breeding habitats the northern unsurveyed habitat serves as a spillover habitat when the population nears carrying capacity in the pr comparing c r values among core breeding and wintering habitats used by pintails provides additional insight and perspectives on the relative importance of these habitats to the population at a continental scale in the monarch case study we found that the central region had the highest seasonally averaged c r and the north had the lowest this qualitative prioritization of the central region matches the sensitivity analyses done by flockhart et al 2015 and oberhauser et al 2017 flockhart et al 2015 performed an elasticity analysis of demographic and migration parameters in their matrix model and summed these elasticities across geographic regions to compare regional contributions to population size their analyses showed the central region had the highest summed elasticity followed by the south then mexico then the north c r ranked mexico slightly higher than the south while elasticities were higher for the south than mexico an important area of future work would include a more thorough analysis of and comparison between results from elasticity analysis and more direct metrics like the c metric furthermore it would be interesting to extend the elasticity analysis of population abundance flockhart et al 2015 by examining the sensitivity of c r to uncertainties in the demographic parameters the c metric for edges describes how individuals traveling along an edge contribute to the population insight about the source or sink value of the edge can be gained when comparing edges within the same season for example in the elk model individuals traveling along the edge between the breeding and nonbreeding nodes during fall migration contribute more to the population than are lost meaning that the pathway is a source individuals choosing to migrate from cody year round node to yellowstone breeding node in the spring contribute less to the population than individuals choosing to remain in cody or to migrate along a shorter path considering the pintail pathway rankings spring migration pathways act as sources whereas fall migration pathways serve as sinks we see similar results with monarchs pathways with strong connections with the central node a strong source have higher c rd values meaning that individuals flowing along these paths contribute more to the population than are lost due to mortality in general the pathway metric for fall edges are larger than for spring edges this can be accounted for by the census date census dates are an important part of understanding c metric values when calculating c r at the nodes the census is taken at the beginning of the season which is before reproduction and habitat survival occurs for the pathway metric the census is taken after reproduction and habitat survival occurs right before individuals move along the pathway thus direct comparison between node and edge values is complicated because of this difference in census date this discordance means that c metric values are highly dependent on both the census date and the focal season and more work is needed to understand the consequence of these differences on implications for management the per capita contribution metric is useful for identifying source and sink nodes or pathways erickson et al 2018 and for providing information about the reproductive potential of an individual at the node or pathway however the c metric has limitations it does not include information about network structure for example a node could be rather unimportant in terms of its demographic contribution sink yet vital to the connectivity of the network given the complexity of spatially structured populations and the numerous ways by which existence or quality of a node or edge can influence the population as a whole developing a single metric that indicates all dimensions of importance for population dynamics remains elusive using multiple metrics is therefore a more reliable way of assessing quality of nodes and pathways in a spatially structured population furthermore the calculation of per capita contribution metrics requires demographic data survival rates transition rates between nodes and reproductive rates and relative distribution of the population among its constituent habitats it can be challenging to parameterize models with existing monitoring programs that provide access to data such as ebird sullivan et al 2009 movebank wikelski and kays 2019 and monitoring avian productivity and survival desante et al 2015 reverse time multi state capture recapture models can be used in combination with per capita metrics to estimate the demographic importance of local populations to metapopulation growth sanderlin et al 2011 but if limited or no demographic data are available then graph based metrics may be more appropriate nicol et al 2016 bieri et al 2018 to accommodate the full range of life histories expressed by spatially structured populations contribution metrics should account for different age and stage classes and the anniversary season thus the number of per capita contribution metrics to compute for a given population amounts to the product of the number of habitats classes and seasons this may be too much information for managers who wish to have one metric per habitat when assessing habitat importance for this reason we presented a population weighted average of the per capita contributions across classes and seasons for a given habitat or patch we caution that this may hide ecologically important disparities and the component metrics should be made available in addition to the weighted averages although it is not required by the formulation the examples in this paper assume equilibrium in calculating the c metric as such these examples do not represent populations that are increasing or decreasing assuming equilibrium is unrealistic for populations undergoing long term increases or decreases in abundance equilibrium assumptions are however commonly used in population ecology such as the assumption of a stable age distribution in eigen analyses of leslie lefkovitch matrices caswell 2001 as of yet it is not well understood how equilibrium assumptions might affect the ranking of importance of habitats as indicated by the c metric that is the habitat with the highest per capita contribution at equilibrium could be superseded by another habitat when the population is growing or declining this question is worthy of future exploration as in spatially unstructured models gamelon et al 2014 we anticipate that the study of transient dynamics in spatially structured populations could lead to a rich body of knowledge about how per capita contributions shift in response to natural disturbance or management actions and how these effects percolate through a network a future extension of the generalized c metric would allow for estimating the per capita contribution along a series of pathways erickson et al 2018 wiederholt et al 2018 rather than restricting the metric to single interseasonal transitions for example waterfowl biologists and managers might be interested in comparing contributions among flyways that encompass habitats used during spring and fall along a migratory route kirby et al 2008 convention on migratory species 2017 considering the pintail case we could then compare the per capita contribution of birds using the pacific flyway to those using the central flyway of north america buhnerkempe et al 2016 under environmental change we may see shifts in the proportion of the population using these pathways that would also affect per capita contributions among flyways another important area of future work includes the utility and robustness of the c metric comparing the c metric to other approaches that rank importance of habitats like parameter perturbation and simulation might give a better idea of the true management utility of the c metric also testing the sensitivity of the c metric to changes in network or parameter assumptions would give managers a better idea of error tolerance in and robustness of the c metric ranking generalizing the c metric opens up diverse research questions how does per capita contribution vary among life history strategies and can this be used to understand the evolution of particular movement strategies such as migration and nomadism is c r a good indicator of the effects of perturbing a habitat or path in a migratory network are there ways of using citizen science observations e g from ebird to estimate c r our generalized modeling framework and computer code will enable population ecologists to pursue these avenues which will lead to a richer understanding of spatially structured populations furthermore the c metric as an estimate of per capita contributions is an indicator of individual fitness in an area and may be useful to researchers studying eco evolutionary dynamics in fragmented landscapes

25015,the ability to classify habitats and movement pathways as sources or sinks is an important part of the decision making process for the conservation of spatially structured populations diverse approaches have been used to quantify the importance of habitats and pathways in a spatial network however these approaches have been limited by a lack of general applicability across life histories and movement strategies in this paper we develop a generalized per capita contribution metric the c metric for quantifying habitat and pathway quality this metric is novel in that it can be applied broadly to both metapopulations and migratory species it allows for any number of age and sex classes unlimited number of seasons or time intervals within the annual cycle and for density dependent parameters we demonstrate the flexibility of the metric with four case studies a hypothetical metapopulation elk of the greater yellowstone ecosystem northern pintail ducks in north america and the eastern population of the monarch butterfly general computer code to calculate the per capita contribution metric is provided we demonstrate that the c metric is useful for identifying source and sink habitats in a network and suggest that the c metric could be supplemented by some measure of network structure for a more robust description of habitat or pathway importance keywords migration network model habitat quality spatial ecology metric ecological traps 1 introduction understanding the movement of individuals across space and time is fundamental to making management decisions migratory species and some species showing metapopulation dynamics can be difficult to conserve and manage because they use multiple habitat types across geographies that span political boundaries behrens et al 2008 wilcove and wikelski 2008 visser et al 2009 runge et al 2017 tucker et al 2018 a crucial part of developing conservation strategies for such species is assessing the relative importance of the habitats they occupy over the course of their full annual cycle martin et al 2007 kölzsch and blasius 2008 sawyer and kauffman 2011 it is therefore worth developing metrics that account for both habitat connectivity and demography johnson et al 2018 robertson et al 2018 zamberletti et al 2018 although several habitat contribution metrics exist for spatially structured populations nicol et al 2016 these metrics were not designed to account for seasonal migration applying these metrics to a migratory population can therefore be problematic recently several approaches have been developed to address the question of habitat importance for migratory populations the metric c r originally developed by runge et al 2006 for non migratory but spatially structured populations is the per capita contribution to the next generation by individuals that occur in a particular habitat r wiederholt et al 2018 adapted this per capita contribution metric for migratory species which accounts for seasonal movement between multiple breeding and non breeding habitats and for both resident and migratory cohorts this metric however is limited to a two season population of juveniles and adults erickson et al 2018 considered per capita contribution metrics for a migratory network but only for the case of a single class of individuals the usefulness of per capita contribution metrics is that they allow managers to compare habitat node and pathway edge values and thus compare locations and routes across an entire migratory network for a species nodes and edges can be classified as sources or sinks erickson et al 2018 and prioritized for management actions based on their relative values the relative importance of different habitats has also been used to spatially allocate the value of ecosystem services provided by migratory species semmens et al 2011 2018 although per capita contribution metrics have been recognized as important tools for understanding dynamics of spatially structured populations until now there has been no generalized method that accounts for the full range of life history strategies in this paper we generalize an existing per capita contribution metric wiederholt et al 2018 which we will refer to as the c metric the c metric is novel in that it can be applied to any number of seasons non equal season lengths varied class structures and the full range of movement strategies we illustrate the c metric by applying our model to four example species the first is a simple hypothetical metapopulation for demonstrating the calculation and illustrating that the metric can be applied to non migratory metapopulations we then apply the metric to existing models sample et al 2018 of a partially migratory population cervus canadensis elk a complete migratory population anas acuta northern pintail and a population exhibiting a stepping stone migration strategy danaus plexippus monarch butterflies these cases represent a diversity of age and stage structures along with alternate types of migration our generalization which relies on mathematics from matrix algebra includes general r code for calculating the c metric to more easily allow use by managers and decision makers bieri et al 2019 we draw several new insights about population dynamics revealed in each of the case studies 2 materials and methods borrowing from the matrix population models that are used widely to study age and size structured populations rogers 1966 pascarella and horvitz 1998 caswell 2001 hunter and caswell 2005 we construct a time dependent projection matrix a t that contains the demographic and movement information required to calculate the c metric in doing so we represent the spatial structure of a population as a network in which habitats are nodes and movement pathways are edges taylor and norris 2010 sample et al 2018 symbols used throughout this paper are given in tables 1 3 we consider a population of c age classes or life stages in a network of n nodes and s seasons individuals are classified by both their class and location one time step from t to t 1 represents one season in the annual cycle seasons do not have to be equal in duration and s time steps from t to t s represents one year we define a t as an nc nc matrix that projects the population in all classes and nodes from one time step to the next each entry in a t gives the probability that an individual in a given node and class at time t will contribute to that class or become another class in the same or another node by time t 1 to ease the construction of this matrix we write it as the product of two matrices 1 a t ℚ t f t the block matrix f t contains demographic update information at the nodes such as fecundity class transition and survival rates see eqs 2 and 3 and block matrix ℚ t contains update information along the pathways such as movement and survival probabilities see eqs 4 and 5 f t is defined as 2 f t i 1 n e n i i f i t t where represents the kronecker product e n ii is an n n zero matrix with a 1 at position ii and f i t is a c c demographic projection matrix for node i 3 f i t f i t 11 f i t 12 f i t 1 c f i t 21 f i t 22 f i t 2 c f i t c 1 f i t cc element f i t x y represents individuals transitioning from class x to class y at node i and time t and f i t x x represents individuals remaining in class x these elements may be given as survival probabilities and may also include births so their values may be greater than 1 matrix ℚ t is defined as 4 ℚ t x 1 c q t x t e c x x where q t x is an n n movement matrix 5 q t x q 11 t x q 12 t x q 1 n t x q 21 t x q 22 t x q 2 n t x q n 1 t x q n n t x elements are of the form q i j t x p i j t x s i j t x which represents the proportion of individuals of class x that move p i j t x and survive s i j t x the transition from node i to node j at time t each element is a product of two probabilities and must therefore be a non negative number less than or equal to 1 the population projected over an entire annual cycle beginning at any time t is given by the seasonal product matrix a ˆ t a t s 1 a t 1 a t the transpose of this product matrix 6 a ˆ t t τ t t s 1 a τ t a t t a t 1 t a t s 1 t will be used to calculate the per capita contribution metric it is important to note two features of our model first we have chosen in the formulation of a t to apply demographic updates after each dispersal event switching this order would modify a t hunter and caswell 2005 second our framework is flexible to handle population models that have density dependent reproduction survival and movement probabilities for example if the survival rates of a migration model are seasonal and density dependent then f t f n t t ℚ t ℚ n t t and a t a n t t will be time and density dependent matrices as such population abundance at the beginning of the time step can be determined by solving the following recurrence relation 7 n t 1 a t n t where n t is an nc 1 block vector whose c 1 subvectors n i t give the class distribution within each node i at time t furthermore n t s a ˆ t n t will give the population size after one annual cycle provided n t and the annual population growth rate for anniversary date t can be defined as λ t w t a ˆ t t 1 n c here w t n t t n t tot is the population proportion at time t where n t tot is the network population size summed across all nodes and all classes during time step t and 1 n c is a nc 1 vector of ones more details on model construction can be found in the supplementary material 2 1 habitat contribution metric wiederholt et al 2018 following runge et al 2006 defined the per capita contribution c r of a focal habitat r as the expected number of individuals generated from an adult individual occupying the focal habitat in a given year the value of this metric depends on the anniversary season which we define as the season from which c r is calculated c r can differ for example if it is calculated from spring to spring vs fall to fall in the same network the c r metric is specific for a system of two classes adults and juveniles and two seasons so that their formulation only considered two time steps in the annual cycle this metric assumes juveniles and adults have the same movement transition probabilities it also assumes juveniles born in the breeding season remain juveniles in the subsequent migratory period furthermore although the metric accounted for differing survival rates between adults and juveniles the per capita contribution metric was only calculated for adults we begin by extending c r in several ways first given a focal habitat and anniversary date we define a per capita contribution metric c that can be calculated for any class our notation of this metric differs from previous works runge et al 2006 wiederholt et al 2018 in that the focal node and time step are given as subscripts and the class is a superscript for instance c r t j is the number of individuals that are generated after one annual cycle by time t s from a single juvenile individual occupying the focal habitat r in the previous year with anniversary date t we also generalize the metric for class specific movement transition probabilities transitions between ages or stages and breeding may occur at any time and possibly multiple times during the annual cycle furthermore the c metric can account for any number of seasons and any number of classes or stages formally c r t x is the expected contribution of a single individual of class x and its offspring starting at node r and time t to the whole population after one annual cycle c r t x is calculated by summing the contributions from all possible demographic and movement transitions that may happen to an individual moving forward through one annual cycle we will use matrix algebra to calculate the c metric for every node class and anniversary season we define c t as a block vector whose elements are c r t x c t c 1 t 1 c 1 t 2 c 1 t c c 2 t 1 c 2 t 2 c n t c the data required to calculate the values of this vector are contained in the annual projection matrix defined in eqs 1 6 we solve for c t by taking the product of the transpose of the annual projection matrix and an nc 1 vector of ones 8 c t τ t t s 1 a τ t 1 n c a ˆ t t 1 n c this matrix product sums across possible annual pathways that migrants can take throughout the annual cycle if c r t x is greater than one a single individual of class x starting at time t and node r is expected to replace itself and add to the size of the population if c r t x is less than one individuals do not replace themselves and thus their contribution reduces overall population size a diagram of how the c metric is calculated is given in fig 1 to use the c metric for assessing the quality of habitats regardless of class we must average we use a class population weighted average to obtain a single metric for each habitat and anniversary season 9 c r t x 1 c n r t x n r t c r t x where n r t is the population size of node r at time t and n r t x n r t is the proportion of individuals of class x at the node this results in a single per capita contribution value for each node r beginning in time step t this metric indicates whether the focal node is a source c r t 1 or a sink c r t 1 at time t next since c r t depends on the anniversary season to obtain a single node metric regardless of anniversary season we use a seasonal population weighted average 10 c r τ t t s 1 n r τ c r τ τ t t s 1 n r τ this calculation gives more weight to a season in which the node s population size is large relative to the other seasons similar to the contribution metrics developed by runge et al 2006 and wiederholt et al 2018 the generalized metric presented here when weighted by the fraction of the population they represent sums to the annual population growth rate for each anniversary date λ t w t c t where w t is the population proportion 2 2 pathway contribution metric we extend the work of wiederholt et al 2018 and provide a generalized formulation of the per capita contribution of edge or pathway transitions the annual per capita contribution of an individual of class x starting at node r and traveling to node d at time t is 11 c r d t x 1 n c t p r d t x a t t e n r d h c x τ t 1 t s 1 a τ t 1 n c where is the hadamard entrywise product p r d t x is the proportion of individuals of class x at node r that will travel to node d at time t contained in movement matrix q t x of eq 5 and h c x is a c c zero matrix with ones in column x recall that e n rd is an n n zero matrix with a 1 at position rd if at time t no individuals of class x use edge rd p r d t x 0 then c r d t x 0 while the equation for pathway contribution is more cumbersome the generalized calculation remains straightforward for any number of classes or stages a variety of migration strategies and any number of seasons similar to averaging the metric for habitat contribution given an anniversary season we construct a single metric for pathway contribution we weight each c r d t x by the number of migrants of class x that use edge rd at time t to obtain 12 c r d t x 1 c p r d t x n r t x c r d t x x 1 c p r d t x n r t x then by averaging across classes and seasons we obtain a single metric for each edge 13 c r d τ t t s 1 x 1 c p r d t x n r τ x c r d τ x τ t t s 1 x 1 c p r d t x n r τ x 3 case studies in this section we show that the c metric can be calculated for populations representing a diverse range of life histories movement patterns and carrying capacities we first apply our model to a simple hypothetical metapopulation to demonstrate matrix construction and illustrate results and then to three migratory populations the simpler example of seasonal partial migration of elk the more complicated seasonal complete migration of northern pintails and finally the stepping stone migration of monarch butterflies we note that the parametrization and modeling of these migratory populations have been developed previously sample et al 2018 the results presented in this paper are in the application of the c metric for ease of discussion in each example we simulate population dynamics until equilibrium or steady state is reached however the metric does not require the equilibrium assumption variables used in our calculations of the c metric are determined by their values at the end of these numerical simulations we assume equilibrium has been reached when the population is within 0 01 individuals from one year to the next comparing like seasons we note that the c metric can be calculated using non equilibrium parameter values that change from one annual cycle to the next this would lead to network growth rates that are greater or less than one and c metric values that change from one year to the next see the supplementary information for details of model setup and bieri et al 2019 for parameter values and code developed in r to calculate these metrics for each example 3 1 hypothetical metapopulation we begin with a simple hypothetical metapopulation model in this network fig 2 there are two nodes two classes and two seasons the two classes are juveniles j and adults a and the two seasons are breeding b and wintering w in one time step one season individuals can either remain in the same node or disperse to the other node by traveling along weighted and directed edges in the network in this hypothetical network node 2 is of lower quality e g lower carrying capacity compared to node 1 at the beginning of the breeding season the population sizes rounded to the nearest whole number of juveniles and adults are n 1 b j 115 n 1 b a 245 at node 1 and n 2 b j 50 and n 2 b a 105 at node 2 juveniles then transition to adults with some survival probability adults survive and surviving adults produce new juveniles survival rates are the same across seasons and are given by s 1 a 0 9 s 1 j 0 8 s 2 a 0 7 and s 2 j 0 6 we assume node 1 is closer to its carrying capacity than node 2 and set the reproductive rates as r 1 0 6665 and r 2 0 5813 at the end of the breeding season individuals disperse within the network the post breeding wintering populations are n 1 w j 155 n 1 w a 290 n 2 w j 70 and n 2 w a 125 individuals survive the winter season with the same probabilities as in the breeding season in our calculations we sort by nodes then classes so that the population vector is given by n t t n 1 t j n 1 t a n 2 t j n 2 t a t to formulate a t we begin by constructing matrices f t and ℚ t we create these matrices for the breeding t b and wintering t w seasons at steady state during the breeding season the demographic matrix of eq 3 is f i b 0 s i j r i s i a i 1 2 here the elements in the top row represent juvenile survival and juvenile transition to adults respectively note that all surviving juveniles transition to adults in this season the bottom row represents reproduction adults creating juveniles and adult survival respectively during the wintering season there are no class transitions and only survival within the classes f i w s i j 0 0 s i a i 1 2 the demographic block matrices of eq 2 for the breeding and wintering seasons are f b f 1 b t 0 0 f 2 b t 0 0 6665 0 0 0 8 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 5813 0 0 0 6 0 7 f w f 1 w t 0 0 f 2 w t 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 7 we now set up the matrices of eq 5 in this hypothetical model movement does not depend on class or season and individuals are more likely to remain residents than disperse to the other node individuals have an 80 probability of remaining at node 1 and a 60 probability of remaining at node 2 therefore the matrices of eq 5 which are class and time independent in this model are q j q a 0 8 0 2 0 4 0 6 thus the movement block matrices of eq 4 are ℚ b ℚ w q j t 1 0 0 0 q a t 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 4 0 0 0 8 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 6 0 0 0 2 0 0 6 from eq 1 we have the following projection matrices for the breeding and wintering seasons a b ℚ b f b 0 0 5332 0 0 2325 0 6400 0 7200 0 2400 0 2800 0 0 1333 0 0 3488 0 1600 0 1800 0 3600 0 4200 a w ℚ w f w 0 6400 0 0 2400 0 0 0 7200 0 0 2800 0 1600 0 0 3600 0 0 0 1800 0 0 4200 we calculated the per capita contributions for each node class and anniversary season using the matrix multiplication defined in eq 8 at equilibrium the per capita contribution equations for the breeding and wintering seasons are c b a b t a w t 1 4 c w a w t a b t 1 4 we then use eq 9 to average across classes and eq 10 to average across seasons adults who contribute to the population through reproduction have higher c values than juveniles table 4 after averaging across classes our results indicate that an individual at node 1 is expected to contribute more individuals to the network than an individual from node 2 we categorize node 1 as a source c r 1 and node 2 as a sink c r 1 the pathway that represents node 1 s resident population c 11 has a higher contribution value and the pathway representing node 2 s resident population c 22 has a lower value table 5 3 2 elk in the greater yellowstone ecosystem we apply our model of habitat and pathway contribution to a population of elk located in the greater yellowstone ecosystem henceforth yellowstone to parameterize the model we begin with the modeling framework presented in sample et al 2018 with model parameters and density dependent assumptions based on the literature singer et al 1997 taper and gogan 2002 middleton et al 2013 values of the parameters at equilibrium were used to calculate the c metric elk partially migrate among three geographical locations fig 3 one location node 3 is near cody wyoming where two groups of elk reside one that remains resident year round and another that migrates to yellowstone the elk that remain resident year round in node 3 breed there in the summer season yellowstone node 1 is the summering location where migrating elk breed and the location between cody and yellowstone node 2 is where migrating elk winter all elk in this location migrate to yellowstone during the summer for breeding middleton et al 2013 one annual cycle comprises two seasons season 1 includes winter and spring migration and season 2 includes summer and fall migration we modeled female elk of two classes juveniles j and adults a during season 1 juveniles and adults survive at class specific survival rates during season 2 all surviving juveniles transition into adults surviving adults reproduce and create juveniles and adults survive we obtained the per capita contributions for each class at each node and average across classes and seasons at equilibrium according to eqs 9 and 10 the average per capita contributions were close to 1 for every node table 6 node 2 had a slightly higher per capita contribution than the other nodes this indicates that an individual starting in the wintering node is expected on average to contribute more individuals to the population compared to the breeding and year round nodes however as the per capita contributions were near 1 c r 0 8 within 1 none of the nodes could be clearly classified as a source or sink results for the pathway metric presented in table 7 demonstrate that the fall migration paths from node 1 to node 2 and from node 1 to node 3 have the largest per capita contribution the other three edges have per capita contributions close to 1 with the spring migration route from node 3 to node 1 as the only path considered a sink 3 3 northern pintail northern pintail is widely distributed in wetland regions it breeds in the northern areas of north america europe and asia and winters from southern temperate to tropical regions of the northern hemisphere birdlife international 2019 the population model in sample et al 2018 which used the parameter values and model assumptions from mattsson et al 2012 has four classes three seasons and five nodes the four population classes are adult males am adult females af juvenile males jm and juvenile females jf the annual cycle is divided into three seasons breeding wintering and spring flyover nodes 1 through 3 i e alaska ak prairie potholes pr and northwest unsurveyed nu are breeding habitats whereas nodes 4 and 5 i e california ca and gulf coast gc are wintering habitats fig 4 in the wintering season 2 all juveniles transition to adults no births deaths or age transitions occur during the flyover season 3 rather migrants decide whether to stay in pr or continue flyover to ak or nu in the model proportion of flyovers is density dependent and evaluated at population equilibrium we calculate the per capita contributions averaged across classes and seasons at equilibrium table 8 on average a single individual starting in nodes 2 pr or 5 gc is expected to contribute more individuals to the population than it loses whereas the opposite is true for an individual starting at nodes 1 ak 3 nu and 4 ca as such pr and gc are sources and the remaining habitats are sinks the spring migratory paths from the wintering nodes ca and gc had the largest contribution table 9 the fall migratory pathways from the breeding nodes ak pr and nu to the wintering nodes ca and gc had the smallest contributions 3 4 monarch butterfly monarch butterfly in eastern north america migrate from breeding areas in the northern u s and southern canada to a non breeding area in central mexico the population model developed in flockhart et al 2015 was converted to a network based model using the framework presented in sample et al 2018 there is one class adult females seven seasons and four nodes the seven seasons of the annual cycle are winter october through may april may june july august and september breeding occurs april through september the four nodes represent regions of eastern north america mexico m south s central c and north n enumerated 1 through 4 respectively fig 5 mexico is considered a wintering node and the other three nodes are breeding nodes seasonal edge transition and survival probabilities are assumed to be constant from year to year based on the c metric an individual starting in the north node 4 is expected to contribute the least to the population whereas an individual starting in the central region node 3 is expected to contribute the most table 10 note that all individuals reside in mexico node 1 and the south node 2 during winter and april respectively therefore the per capita contributions of mexico and south are equivalent to the network growth rate λ 1 during these seasons this is true even when the network is out of equilibrium thus given a c metric of 1 each individual wintering in mexico or residing in the south in april is expected to replace itself over the annual cycle considering the per capita contributions of the pathways the resident transition in the central node contributes the most whereas the spring migration from south to north contributes the least table 11 4 discussion we have shown how the demographic contributions of individuals from discrete habitats can be quantified by a generalized c metric and that this generalization can describe populations exhibiting a diversity of movement strategies the metric can be applied to a wide range of spatially structured populations with any number of classes seasons or types of movement strategies including simple two patch systems complex metapopulations and complete seasonal migration this metric is simple to calculate as long as estimates for seasonal demographic and movement parameters are available it does not require density dependent functions although these can be incorporated in the projection matrix it also does not require the population to be at equilibrium while the metric is sufficiently general to be applied to metapopulation networks as in the simple example we provided and as shown in more complex examples e g strasser et al 2012 we found it particularly useful for gaining a better understanding about the roles of discrete habitats in migratory networks in the elk example middleton et al 2013 found that elk migrating each spring into yellowstone national park had declining calf recruitment and pregnancy rates this process was captured through the low pathway contribution value for the spring edge from 3 to 1 and with the overall lower node contribution value for node 3 these findings indicate that the year round cody wy area was potentially a minor sink subpopulation in 2009 given the c r values slightly below 1 and that the role of this region in the overall population has shifted as habitat quality declined from 1989 to 2009 results from the pintail example matched some expectations but not others the prairie pothole region pr is recognized as providing crucial breeding habitat for many migratory waterfowl species including the pintail podruzny et al 2002 doherty et al 2016 pr had the highest c r value among regions and serves as a strong source c r 5 above 1 in alignment with expectations the role of wintering areas has until now been viewed as secondary miller et al 2003 but we found that at equilibrium an individual overwintering in the gulf coast habitat contributed nearly the same number of individuals to the population as did an individual that bred in the pr this contradicts findings of a perturbation analysis which showed that increasing reproduction in the pr by 10 had a larger effect on continental scale carrying capacity than did increasing habitat area by 10 in the gulf coast habitat mattsson et al 2012 there was a disparity between the two wintering regions in terms of their per capita contributions which we did not expect although the habitat in california supports more overwintering individuals at carrying capacity it acts like a weak sink c r is 5 below 1 due to most california birds migrating to alaska where reproduction is insufficient to maintain a growing population on its own we also found that the northern unsurveyed habitat serves as a strong sink c r is 5 below 1 this is in line with our expectation that this habitat plays a minor role in continental population dynamics due to having substantially lower reproduction compared to the other breeding habitats the northern unsurveyed habitat serves as a spillover habitat when the population nears carrying capacity in the pr comparing c r values among core breeding and wintering habitats used by pintails provides additional insight and perspectives on the relative importance of these habitats to the population at a continental scale in the monarch case study we found that the central region had the highest seasonally averaged c r and the north had the lowest this qualitative prioritization of the central region matches the sensitivity analyses done by flockhart et al 2015 and oberhauser et al 2017 flockhart et al 2015 performed an elasticity analysis of demographic and migration parameters in their matrix model and summed these elasticities across geographic regions to compare regional contributions to population size their analyses showed the central region had the highest summed elasticity followed by the south then mexico then the north c r ranked mexico slightly higher than the south while elasticities were higher for the south than mexico an important area of future work would include a more thorough analysis of and comparison between results from elasticity analysis and more direct metrics like the c metric furthermore it would be interesting to extend the elasticity analysis of population abundance flockhart et al 2015 by examining the sensitivity of c r to uncertainties in the demographic parameters the c metric for edges describes how individuals traveling along an edge contribute to the population insight about the source or sink value of the edge can be gained when comparing edges within the same season for example in the elk model individuals traveling along the edge between the breeding and nonbreeding nodes during fall migration contribute more to the population than are lost meaning that the pathway is a source individuals choosing to migrate from cody year round node to yellowstone breeding node in the spring contribute less to the population than individuals choosing to remain in cody or to migrate along a shorter path considering the pintail pathway rankings spring migration pathways act as sources whereas fall migration pathways serve as sinks we see similar results with monarchs pathways with strong connections with the central node a strong source have higher c rd values meaning that individuals flowing along these paths contribute more to the population than are lost due to mortality in general the pathway metric for fall edges are larger than for spring edges this can be accounted for by the census date census dates are an important part of understanding c metric values when calculating c r at the nodes the census is taken at the beginning of the season which is before reproduction and habitat survival occurs for the pathway metric the census is taken after reproduction and habitat survival occurs right before individuals move along the pathway thus direct comparison between node and edge values is complicated because of this difference in census date this discordance means that c metric values are highly dependent on both the census date and the focal season and more work is needed to understand the consequence of these differences on implications for management the per capita contribution metric is useful for identifying source and sink nodes or pathways erickson et al 2018 and for providing information about the reproductive potential of an individual at the node or pathway however the c metric has limitations it does not include information about network structure for example a node could be rather unimportant in terms of its demographic contribution sink yet vital to the connectivity of the network given the complexity of spatially structured populations and the numerous ways by which existence or quality of a node or edge can influence the population as a whole developing a single metric that indicates all dimensions of importance for population dynamics remains elusive using multiple metrics is therefore a more reliable way of assessing quality of nodes and pathways in a spatially structured population furthermore the calculation of per capita contribution metrics requires demographic data survival rates transition rates between nodes and reproductive rates and relative distribution of the population among its constituent habitats it can be challenging to parameterize models with existing monitoring programs that provide access to data such as ebird sullivan et al 2009 movebank wikelski and kays 2019 and monitoring avian productivity and survival desante et al 2015 reverse time multi state capture recapture models can be used in combination with per capita metrics to estimate the demographic importance of local populations to metapopulation growth sanderlin et al 2011 but if limited or no demographic data are available then graph based metrics may be more appropriate nicol et al 2016 bieri et al 2018 to accommodate the full range of life histories expressed by spatially structured populations contribution metrics should account for different age and stage classes and the anniversary season thus the number of per capita contribution metrics to compute for a given population amounts to the product of the number of habitats classes and seasons this may be too much information for managers who wish to have one metric per habitat when assessing habitat importance for this reason we presented a population weighted average of the per capita contributions across classes and seasons for a given habitat or patch we caution that this may hide ecologically important disparities and the component metrics should be made available in addition to the weighted averages although it is not required by the formulation the examples in this paper assume equilibrium in calculating the c metric as such these examples do not represent populations that are increasing or decreasing assuming equilibrium is unrealistic for populations undergoing long term increases or decreases in abundance equilibrium assumptions are however commonly used in population ecology such as the assumption of a stable age distribution in eigen analyses of leslie lefkovitch matrices caswell 2001 as of yet it is not well understood how equilibrium assumptions might affect the ranking of importance of habitats as indicated by the c metric that is the habitat with the highest per capita contribution at equilibrium could be superseded by another habitat when the population is growing or declining this question is worthy of future exploration as in spatially unstructured models gamelon et al 2014 we anticipate that the study of transient dynamics in spatially structured populations could lead to a rich body of knowledge about how per capita contributions shift in response to natural disturbance or management actions and how these effects percolate through a network a future extension of the generalized c metric would allow for estimating the per capita contribution along a series of pathways erickson et al 2018 wiederholt et al 2018 rather than restricting the metric to single interseasonal transitions for example waterfowl biologists and managers might be interested in comparing contributions among flyways that encompass habitats used during spring and fall along a migratory route kirby et al 2008 convention on migratory species 2017 considering the pintail case we could then compare the per capita contribution of birds using the pacific flyway to those using the central flyway of north america buhnerkempe et al 2016 under environmental change we may see shifts in the proportion of the population using these pathways that would also affect per capita contributions among flyways another important area of future work includes the utility and robustness of the c metric comparing the c metric to other approaches that rank importance of habitats like parameter perturbation and simulation might give a better idea of the true management utility of the c metric also testing the sensitivity of the c metric to changes in network or parameter assumptions would give managers a better idea of error tolerance in and robustness of the c metric ranking generalizing the c metric opens up diverse research questions how does per capita contribution vary among life history strategies and can this be used to understand the evolution of particular movement strategies such as migration and nomadism is c r a good indicator of the effects of perturbing a habitat or path in a migratory network are there ways of using citizen science observations e g from ebird to estimate c r our generalized modeling framework and computer code will enable population ecologists to pursue these avenues which will lead to a richer understanding of spatially structured populations furthermore the c metric as an estimate of per capita contributions is an indicator of individual fitness in an area and may be useful to researchers studying eco evolutionary dynamics in fragmented landscapes

25016,dynamic energy budget theory deb and the metabolic theory of ecology mte both seek to quantify the processes of resource acquisition and use but differ in their underlying mechanisms and assumptions some in depth comparisons of the theories have been conducted in the literature but require a level of knowledge that is likely to be beyond most newcomers to the topic we reduce the theories to their simplest forms their models for growth under optimal conditions and present a side by side comparison of the model equations and key assumptions this shows considerable overlap in how both theories characterise growth rate while also highlighting fundamental differences such as mte s use of taxon specific parameters comparing deb and mte in this way provides an accessible platform to help beginners gain a better understanding from the existing literature keywords metabolic theory of ecology dynamic energy budget mathematical modelling processed based modelling 1 introduction the dynamic energy budget deb kooijman 2000 theory and the metabolic theory of ecology mte brown et al 2004b are both well known theories which aim to quantify the processes of acquisition and use of resources to explain biological patterns these theories differ fundamentally in their underlying assumptions and mechanisms deb assumes that resource assimilation scales with the surface area over which resources are absorbed into the body leading to a ⅔ scaling relationship between energetic supply and body mass within a species kooijman 2000 mte meanwhile proposes that fractally branched vascular networks possessed by plants and many animals deliver resources to cells at a rate which scales with body mass to the ¾ power brown et al 2004b brown and sibly 2012 this scaling relationship and its underlying mechanism faced strong biological and mathematical criticism kozlowski and konarzewski 2004 however it was contended that this criticism was based on a misunderstanding of the theory s assumptions brown et al 2005 in any case neither mechanism precludes the other maino et al 2014 it is possible perhaps likely that vascular supply networks and the surface area to volume ratio both play a role in limiting energetic supply rates the two theories have rarely been directly compared maino et al 2014 leading to a lack of understanding across them and researchers often working only with one or the other kearney and white 2012 this situation is somewhat at odds with the vision of mte s creators that the theories should be complementary since they have different strengths and applications brown et al 2004a those comparisons that have been carried out focus on theoretical differences and inconsistencies kearney and white 2012 marquet et al 2014 van der meer 2006 inspiring spirited debate between proponents of the theories houlahan et al 2015 kearney et al 2015 marquet et al 2015 the conversation however is often inaccessible for newcomers to the topic we suggest that a different approach may be beneficial in this regard focusing first on the similarity between the theories the theories are most similar to one another when used to predict growth under constant conditions we therefore use their most basic growth model as a starting point to clearly highlight the similarities and then isolate the core differences between them 2 common ground the growth models of both theories produce a sigmoid curve as is observed in many species and follow very similar biological rationale the central equation of mte states that metabolic rate b scales with total body mass w brown and sibly 2012 1 b b 0 w α where b 0 is the metabolic scaling coefficient and α is the exponent usually ¾ with which metabolic rate scales allometrically assuming constant temperature and ad libitum food availability the resulting growth model is expressed as 2 d w d t 1 e m b 0 w α b m w where b m is the maintenance rate per unit mass and e m represents the energetic cost per unit growth kerkhoff 2012 the energetic supply term in this model is the metabolic rate defined in eq 1 since this represents energy that must be supplied for survival and growth unlike that of mte the deb growth model explicitly divides biomass into reserve stored resources and structure functional body mass kooijman 2000 therefore debkiss jager et al 2013 a simplified version of deb which does not consider reserve is a better choice to illustrate the parallels with mte under the same constant conditions the basic growth model is 3 d w d t y v a k j a a m w 2 3 j v m w where yva represents conversion efficiency of assimilates to structure k is the portion of assimilates allocated to structural maintenance and growth ja am is the maximum assimilation rate per unit area and jv m the maintenance rate per unit mass it is clear at this point that both models can be characterised in the same way illustrated in fig 1 both models describe the conversion of resources into body mass though their dimensions differ while mte considers the energy content of assimilates from food debkiss considers their mass since food consumption is typically measured in terms of mass rather than energy however debkiss assumes constant composition of structure and therefore a constant conversion factor between mass and energy so both theories ultimately consider energy fluxes regardless of the units this difference is somewhat trivial then but important to note before comparing the model parameters a full description of the model parameters can be found in table 1 except for k and α both dimensionless parameters relating to resource supply maintenance or conversion efficiency have equivalent dimensions differing only in how resources are measured much discourse has concerned whether metabolic rate scales with body size to the power of ⅔ or ¾ brown and sibly 2012 white and kearney 2014 white and seymour 2003 while mte suggests an α value of ¾ this is not fixed brown and sibly 2012 kerkhoff 2012 moses et al 2008 it has been noted that setting α to ⅔ actually makes little difference to the growth curve produced kerkhoff 2012 and may be considered preferable in terms of mathematical simplicity sibly et al 2013 this means that the ultimate body mass w can be expressed 4 w b 0 b m 3 substituting this into eq 2 means that the growth rate can be expressed in the form of the von bertalanffy growth equation 5 d w d t 1 e m b m w w w 1 3 1 in debkiss the ultimate body mass is calculated as 6 w k j a a m j v m 3 by combining eqs 3 and 6 the debkiss growth model can also be expressed in the form 7 d w d t y v a j v m w w w 1 3 1 eqs 5 and 7 are mathematically and conceptually equivalent further demonstrating the considerable overlap between the two growth models 3 what differences remain the growth models may have a great deal in common but even at this most basic level important differences remain the parameters of deb are generally species specific and full parameter estimation requires growth and reproduction data preferably under varying conditions kooijman et al 2008 lika et al 2011 a growing curated database containing deb parameters for around over 1000 species as of march 2018 has been made freely available marques et al 2018 as has software to carry out parameter estimation martin et al 2012 nevertheless an understanding of the underlying equations and how parameter values are derived still requires significant investment jager et al 2013 one of the goals of mte was to make this process simpler and less data demanding brown and sibly 2012 but the devil is in the detail it was initially suggested that the cost of growth in mte em should be measured as the energy content of tissue west et al 2001 however such a simple measure negates any additional overhead energy cost of growth new estimation methods were subsequently developed by moses et al 2008 using the growth curves of animals in early life stages when it is assumed that maintenance costs are negligible as virtually all energy is devoted to growth such data requirements are not dissimilar to those of deb kooijman et al 2008 so the energetic cost of tissue synthesis remains a property that is not easily measured or estimated instead to simplify the process generic values of em are recommended for taxa such as mammals birds and fish on the basis that alternative methods moses et al 2008 sibly and calow 1986 have produced similar estimates for these groups sibly et al 2013 as a taxon specific measure mte s metabolic scaling coefficient b0 is derived by fitting eq 1 to data on the metabolic rates measured as respiration of related species ranging in size brown and sibly 2012 as such the value of b0 does not scale with the ultimate size of a species for some this is an oversimplification as it assumes that variation in ultimate mass between species results solely from interspecific differences in maintenance rate bm eq 4 by extension this means that the maintenance costs of a lizard are much higher than those of a baby crocodile of the same size van der meer 2006 instead deb suggests that the maintenance rate per unit of structure is probably very similar among related species therefore differences in the ultimate mass of species are influenced more by interspecific variability in assimilation rate van der meer 2006 finally the kappa rule in deb states that for any species a constant proportion k ranging from 0 to 1 of available resources are allocated to maintenance and growth the remainder 1 k is invested toward maturation and reproduction kooijman 2000 an equivalent parameter would be redundant in the mte growth model as the supply term describes only the energy delivered to cells for growth and maintenance rather than the total assimilated as a wider theory mte does have a similar rule assuming that resources are allocated in ﬁxed proportions to maintenance growth and reproduction however unlike in deb it is also assumed that these proportions are constant across all species sibly 2012 a simplification which has major implications as a species specific parameter in deb k plays an important role in capturing interspecific variability in ultimate mass eq 6 and reproductive output when this is included model predictions 4 conclusions ultimately all models exist to provide a simplified representation of complex processes and this requires compromise between realism and ease of use deb provides a powerful framework for modelling organism life cycles but the data requirements for full parameterisation are substantial as is the investment needed to fully understand model equations jager et al 2013 mte aimed to simplify further by utilising interspecific patterns to derive taxon specific parameters the only species specific parameter in mte s growth model the maintenance rate bm can be calculated from the ultimate weight of a new species of interest however subsequent work has detailed how deb parameters can also be estimated using only the ultimate size of a species if necessary by scaling the parameter values for a related species kooijman et al 2008 in both cases though such simplicity comes at a cost in terms of accuracy since parameter values are in reality individual specific and vary within and between species while our comparison has focused on growth the purpose of these theories is not simply to mimic observed patterns for which the von bertalanffy equation would suffice but to provide a mechanistic basis for predictions in novel scenarios and at higher levels of biological organisation implementation within individual based models ibms of populations has highlighted the scope for model development in both theories mte successfully predicted observed patterns in the mass density of tree seedlings provided there was little competition for nutrients and water but not when these resources were limited lin et al 2014 deb meanwhile has been used to successfully predict population level patterns observed in daphnia magna but it was found that predictions were just as accurate if reserve was omitted martin et al 2013 subsequently the debkiss model was developed jager et al 2013 which as we have demonstrated offers comparable simplicity to mte in addition the debtox framework kooijman and bedaux 1996 uses deb as the basis for predicting the effects of toxic exposure on biological processes this has now been used to predict observed effects in several invertebrate ashauer and jager 2018 and vertebrate species desforges et al 2017 zimmer et al 2018 demonstrating the ability of deb to realistically respond to environmental change the aim of this article was to compare deb and mte in a way that is targeted to beginners and currently missing in the literature while deb is indeed a complex theoretical framework since the creation of mte it has been developed to offer similar simplicity both in terms of model equations and parameter estimation at this point the distinction between the two theories hinges on the underlying mechanisms and assumptions we hope that by providing an accessible introduction to

25017,the principle of maximum entropy maxent promises a novel approach for understanding community assembly despite reproducing a variety of observed species abundance patterns maxent models in ecology have been hampered by disparate model assumptions and interpretations a recurring challenge is that maxent predictions are highly sensitive to the level of detail used to describe the community being modeled and there seems to be no reason to prefer one level of detail over another here we present of formal unification of two previously developed maxent models which differ in their level of detail but which are otherwise mathematically similar the less detailed model maximum entropy theory of ecology mete does not resolve species identity or explicitly represent species specific traits the more detailed model very entropic growth veg defines each separate species by its per capita metabolic rate ε and assumes a density of species function ρ ε representing the distribution of ε in the metacommunity a formal comparison of mete and veg then highlights ρ ε as a key determinant of local community assembly in particular appropriate choice of ρ ε in veg can produce more realistic predictions for the metabolic rank distribution of local communities than mete which does not explicitly account for metacommunity structure this opens new avenues of inquiry about what determines metacommunity structure in nature and suggests possible ways to improve mete keywords community assembly macroecology metabolic requirements resource partitioning species abundance distribution statistical aggregation 1 introduction one of the central aims of ecology is to understand the determinants of community assembly many studies of community assembly involve summaries of community structure such as the species abundance distribution sad species area relationship sar and analogous metabolic rate distributions we will refer to these summary distributions collectively as community structure distributions csds csds particularly the sad have attracted attention because their shapes are strikingly similar across different communities representing a possible example of universality in community ecology mcgill et al 2007 the existence of universal features in csds is intriguing because these could reflect universal aspects of the biological processes responsible for structuring communities however csds could also be universal for statistical reasons tokeshi 1993 ulrich et al 2010 similar to how the normal distribution is ubiquitous because many measured quantities involve statistical averaging the central limit theorem csds could be universal simply because community specific details disappear in aggregating patterns to the level of species counts fig 1 or other forms of averaging since statistical universality would make csds considerably less valuable for understanding the biological determinants of community assembly it is important to understand the relative contributions of biological versus statistical factors to csds a promising approach for achieving this understanding is to use the statistical principle of maximum entropy maxent maxent models seek to identify minimal sets of assumptions required to reproduce empirical patterns like csds all maxent models have two major components and may differ from one another in the assumptions made for each component component i the ecological variables used to describe a community are specified crucially this entails assumptions about the level of detail that will be used for instance species counts might be used rather than species abundances fig 1 component ii constraints are imposed on the community by assuming that the probability distribution for the ecological variables i is consistent with specified community level expectations with i and ii in place the maxent principle is used to select from among all the probability distributions consistent with the constraints ii the distribution that has the greatest uncertainty about the values of the ecological variables jaynes 1957 dewar 2009 intuitively maxent effectively treats all mechanistic details not expressed in the constraints as completely random in the sense that the ecological variables i have been made as unpredictable as possible consistent with the constraints ii the constraints thus represent non random factors including biological ones underlying the predicted maxent probability distribution by comparing empirical with maxent predicted distributions for different choices of i and ii we thus have a way to resolve the contributions of biological versus statistical factors to observed ecological patterns dewar 2009 o dwyer et al 2017 note that maxent models are distinct from statistical models which aim to quantify statistical relationships between variables like process based models in ecology maxent models in ecology seek to describe how ecological processes shape ecological communities with the difference that those processes are described indirectly in the form of constraints a number of maxent models have been developed to reproduce observed csds e g shipley et al 2006 pueyo et al 2007 harte et al 2008 dewar and porté 2008 banavar et al 2010 bertram and dewar 2015 and many of these have done so successfully however interpreting these results in terms of familiar ecological processes like dispersal disturbance and interactions between organisms has proved difficult one of the main sources of difficulty is the sensitivity of maxent predictions to different choices of ecological variables in i even though those variables may only differ in that they describe the community at different levels of detail haegeman and etienne 2010 he 2010 favretti 2017 for instance the species abundance composition of a community can be described using the number of species with each abundance less detailed this is the sad or by resolving the abundance of each separate species more detailed fig 1 maxent effectively assumes maximal randomness subject to constraints at whichever level of detail is chosen which can make a big difference to the predicted maxent distribution yet there seems to be no a priori reason why we should describe communities at one level of detail but not another despite extensive debates about the prospects and pitfalls of the maxent approach triggered in part by this issue dewar 2009 mcgill and nekola 2010 shipley 2010 supp et al 2012 harte and newman 2014 harte et al 2015 so far little consensus has emerged a major obstacle to forging such a consensus is that it is often hard to see the connections between the variety of different maxent models that have been developed particularly when models differ at step i in their choice of ecological variables here we derive a formal relationship between two maxent models which differ in the level of detail with which they describe ecological communities but otherwise assume similar constraints on total community abundance and metabolic requirement the models we compare are mete maximum entropy theory of ecology harte et al 2008 2009 harte 2011 harte and newman 2014 and veg very entropic growth dewar and porté 2008 bertram and dewar 2013 2015 mete describes communities at the same coarse grained level of detail as the sad fig 1 whereas veg is more detailed in that it separately resolves the abundance of each species a comparison between the two models then allows us to determine how differences in the level of detail with which ecosystem states are described affect predicted csds in particular we highlight the role played by the density of species function ρ ε in the more detailed veg model where ρ ε d ε is the probability that a species functional type selected at random from the metacommunity has metabolic rates in the range ε ε d ε the function ρ ε represents the distribution of metabolic rates ε in the metacommunity from which the local community is assembled in veg mete does not explicitly account for properties of the metacommunity and only concerns itself with the post assembly metabolic structure in the local community we show that if ρ ε takes a power law form the exponent can be chosen such that the metabolic predictions of veg match empirical observations better than mete suggesting possible avenues for improving mete in contrast we show that sads are relatively insensitive to ρ ε the determination of ρ ε thus emerges as a key area for further study and we discuss prospects for doing so 2 materials and methods 2 1 two maxent models of community assembly 2 1 1 mete here we give a brief overview of the core mete theory we will not consider the area scaling component of the full mete theory harte et al 2009 harte 2011 nor any other extensions that have since been made to mete the central quantity predicted by mete is a joint probability distribution r m n ε called the ecosystem structure function by definition r m n ε d ε is the joint probability that a species selected at random from a community has abundance n and that an individual selected at random from a species with abundance n has a metabolic requirement between ε and ε d ε harte et al 2008 harte 2011 bertram 2015 favretti 2017 appendix a the ecosystem structure function is closely related to the sad if we add together all of the possible metabolic requirements ε we obtain the probability distribution for the abundance of a randomly selected species r m n r m n ε d ε the sad is then simply s r m n where s is the total number of species present in the community thus r m n ε is a sad that has been extended to incorporate information about community metabolic structure mete assumes that r m n ε satisfies two constraints 1 n 1 n ε 1 e n r m n ε d ε n s 2 n 1 n ε 1 e n ε r m n ε d ε e s these constraints imply that the total number of individuals in the community given by s n 1 n ε 1 e n r m n ε d ε is equal to n and the total community metabolic requirement given by s n 1 n ε 1 e n ε r m n ε d ε is equal to e the triplet of values n e and s are the inputs to mete r m n ε is then obtained by maximizing the shannon entropy n r m ln r m d ε subject to constraints 1 and 2 as well as the constraint that r m n ε sums to 1 since it is a probability distribution this maximization procedure gives 3 r m n ε e λ 1 n λ 2 n ε where λ 1 and λ 2 are constants lagrange multipliers with values chosen such that constraints 1 and 2 hold harte 2011 explicit derivations in brummer and newman 2019 mete has been justified and interpreted in terms of information theory harte 2011 constraints 1 and 2 express knowledge about the variables n and ε as specified by the assumed values of n e and s by maximizing the information entropy n r m ln r m d ε we ensure that eq 3 expresses precisely that knowledge about n and ε no more and no less dewar 2009 2 1 2 veg veg is like mete in that it uses maxent to predict community properties from a few constraints moreover as shown below the veg constraints are mathematically similar to those of mete although their interpretation is somewhat different the major feature that differentiates veg is that it represents community structure in more detail in veg species are distinguishable whereas mete only specifies the proportion of species with each abundance n via the ecosystem structure function table 1 veg uses maxent to predict the probability p n that when we take a snapshot of the community we observe the species abundances n n 1 n 2 n c i e the species labeled 1 has abundance n 1 and so on the species abundances in veg may be zero the number of species present in a snapshot s is equal to the number of nonzero elements of n each species in veg is also assigned a distinct trait the individuals of species i are assumed to have a metabolic requirement of ε i where the species labels are chosen such that ε 1 ε 2 ε c veg represents a special case in which there is no trait variation within species a veg species is thus more appropriately interpreted as a functional type than a taxonomic unit bertram and dewar 2013 like mete veg assumes total abundance and total metabolic requirement constraints 4 n i n i p n n 5 n i n i ε i p n e however in contrast to mete veg adopts a frequency interpretation of p n rather than an information theory one which admits a more transparent ecological interpretation of the constraints 4 and 5 specifically since p n represents the probability of observing the snapshot n p n can be interpreted as a sample frequency representing the proportion of time that the community spends with abundance composition n the sums on the left hand sides of eqs 4 and 5 thus represent time averages consequently constraints 4 and 5 are explicit ecological assumptions rather than knowledge they imply a time averaged community steady state in which community abundance and total metabolic requirement maintain average values of n and e respectively over some time period of interest for instance these assumptions may not be justified if there is a trend in n or e over the period that the snapshots are taken e g due to changes in resource availability again similarly to mete p n is obtained by maximizing the shannon entropy n p n ln p n subject to constraints 4 5 and the constraint that p n sums to 1 this maximization procedure gives 6 p n e i μ 1 μ 2 ε i n i where μ 1 and μ 2 are the lagrange multipliers corresponding to constraints 4 and 5 respectively within the frequency interpretation the maximum entropy prediction for p n in eq 6 represents the most likely distribution of species abundances n that would be observed over many snapshots if the abundances n are completely random in each snapshot apart from satisfying constraints 4 and 5 details in bertram and dewar 2015 in eq 6 p n depends on the spectrum of metabolic requirements available to the community ε 1 ε 2 ε c thus the inputs of veg are n e and the full spectrum of values ε i table 1 in contrast to mete the number of species s present in the community in a snapshot is a prediction of veg rather than an input 3 results 3 1 the density of species ρ ε and the veg ecosystem structure function in this section we give an intuitive derivation of the ecosystem structure function implied by veg which will be denoted r v n ε a more rigorous derivation is given in appendix b this allows us to directly compare the predictions of mete and veg when we sample a species at random from a community all species present have the same probability of being selected however the metabolic requirement ε of the selected species is more likely to take some values than others due to two effects 1 trait availability in the metacommunity among the species currently inhabiting the community s broader geographic region some values of ε are more likely to occur than others due both to intrinsic biophysical constraints on the traits determining ε and the region s history 2 environmental filtering in the local community shipley et al 2006 from the distribution of possible metabolic rates some values of ε are more likely to be present in the community due to local environmental factors in veg all individuals in species i have the same metabolic requirement ε i consequently the first effect above trait availability in the metacommunity is represented by the fact that the metabolic spectrum ε 1 ε 2 ε c may be more densely packed at some values of ε than at others for comparison with mete in which ε is a continuous variable we introduce the continuous density of species distribution ρ ε ρ ε d ε is the probability that a species functional type selected at random from the metacommunity has metabolic requirement in the interval ε ε d ε in the present analysis we assume that the metabolic requirement spectrum in the metacommunity is sufficiently dense that we can approximate ρ ε as a smooth function ε once a species has been sampled from the metacommunity and its metabolic requirement has been found to be ε the probability that it has abundance n in the local community denoted p n ε can then be straightforwardly calculated in veg from eq 6 as detailed in appendix b p n ε e μ 1 μ 2 ε n veg also explicitly accounts for the second effect above environmental filtering in the local community through the lagrange multipliers μ 1 and μ 2 that reflect the environmental constraints eqs 4 and 5 to construct r v n ε which only refers to species that are present we restrict our attention to n 1 the joint probability of sampling a species with abundance n from the community and of sampling an individual from such a species with metabolic requirement ε is then simply proportional to ρ ε p n ε where n 1 this gives full equation in appendix b eq b4 7 r v n ε ρ ε p n ε ρ ε e μ 1 n μ 2 n ε to be compared with the corresponding ecosystem structure function of mete r m n ε given by eq 3 the above argument leading to eq 7 for r v and the more rigorous argument given in appendix b is quite general it derives the ecosystem structure function for any model which predicts abundance probabilities conditional on the trait values p n ε and in which we know the density of species ρ ε a comparison of eqs 3 and 7 shows an extra dependence of the veg ecosystem structure function on ρ ε compared with mete in the following sections we examine how this difference affects the metabolic and sad predictions of veg and mete we assume for illustration that the metabolic requirement spectrum has a power law form dewar and porté 2008 8 ρ ε ε α where α is a free parameter fig 2 our motivation for eq 8 is to have a simple one parameter function in which we can adjust the relative density of species at low versus high ε α 0 corresponds to a uniformly spaced spectrum the upper limit of ε in eq 8 ε c will depend on the history of the metacommunity or biophysical constraints on possible trait values in the following we assume that ε c is sufficiently large that the corresponding functional types are almost certainly absent from the local community p n ε c 0 in this case the predictions of veg are independent of the value of ε c see bertram and dewar 2013 for an example where the value of ε c is important 3 2 metabolic rank distributions in this section we compare the metabolic dependence of the mete and veg structure functions r v n ε and r m n ε using the relationship eq 7 derived in the previous section as eq 7 shows the veg ecosystem structure function is sensitive to the shape of ρ ε we thus vary the shape of ρ ε to see what is needed to match metabolic data and compare this with the predictions of mete to vary the shape of ρ ε we took α in eq 8 as a free parameter to be fitted to three metabolic datasets barro colorado island trees condit 1998 hubbell et al 1999 2005 hawaiian island arthropods gruner 2007 and rocky mountain subalpine meadow plants newman et al 2014 our fitting procedure is inspired by the metabolic analysis of harte et al 2017 which is based on the rank distribution of individual metabolic rates this distribution is related to the ecosystem structure function as follows first we introduce the individual level energy distribution ied ψ ε s n n n r n ε harte 2011 newman et al 2014 ψ ε is the probability that a randomly sampled individual has metabolic requirement ε the cumulative distribution ε e ψ ε d ε thus gives the proportion of individuals in the community with metabolic requirement greater than ε and so r ε n ε e ψ ε d ε is the number of such individuals the latter quantity r ε is also the rank of an individual with metabolic rate ε when the individuals in the community are ordered from greatest to smallest ε harte et al 2017 plot log ε on the vertical axis and log r ε on the horizontal axis to compare the predictions of mete with observations accordingly we calculate the sum of square differences between the predicted and observed values of log ε at 20 evenly spaced intervals along the rank axis and optimize α to minimize the sum of square differences the resultant best fit predictions of veg are shown in the top three panels of fig 3 in the bci and rmbl datasets we found values of α that give superior ψ ε fits to mete for bci s s e v e g s s e m e t e 0 26 for rmbl s s e v e g s s e m e t e 0 72 but mete performed better in the hawaii dataset s s e v e g s s e m e t e 2 00 these results are not intended to suggest that in practical applications veg should be used in place of mete when situations like bci and rmbl are obtained because veg requires that we specify an entire additional distribution ρ ε which in this case had to be fitted to observations mete did not require such fitting this would be hard to justify from a model parsimony perspective however our results do confirm that the power law form for the metacommunity distribution ρ ε gives plausible metabolic predictions note that in veg ψ ε is technically a probability mass function over the discrete values ε 1 ε c which would in general lead to a step like rank ε relationship but since we have assumed a dense spectrum section 3 1 these steps are too small to be noticeable in fig 3 the upper panels of fig 3 show that mete and veg both track the middle and higher ranks closely but bigger discrepancies are found at lower ranks higher metabolic rates where the veg metabolic rates are too low and the mete predictions are too high these rank ε curves do not give us any sense of how important these discrepancies are relative to the overall metabolic requirement of the community are the highest ε individuals ecologically important or are there too few of them to address this question in the middle panels of fig 3 we show the fraction of total community metabolic requirement e contributed by individuals with metabolic requirement ε or lower that is n ε 1 ε ε ψ ε d ε plotted as a function of log ε this shows that higher ε individuals make a substantial contribution to total community e in spite of their relatively low abundance for instance bci individuals with ε 10 3 contribute about half of total community e coinciding with the region of greatest divergence between predictions and observations particularly for mete therefore high ε predictions are important for the overall validity of models of community metabolic structure in the lower three panels of fig 3 we show the marginal distribution for individual metabolic rates r ε n r n ε while this mathematical definition is very simple r ε is not usually considered in mete because ψ ε is a more intuitive description of community metabolic structure r ε is the probability that if we randomly sample a species from the community and then randomly sample an individual from that species the individual has metabolic rate ε however the marginal distribution r ε does capture important information about the ecosystem structure function r n ε in veg r v ε is more intuitive it is simply the probability that a randomly sampled species functional type in the local community has metabolic requirement ε r v ε allows us to see how the local community filters functional types using the fact that r v ε ρ ε n 1 p n ε ρ ε 1 p 0 ε where we have used eq 7 the second term in this expression 1 p 0 ε is the probability that the functional type with metabolic requirement ε is locally present the lower three panels in fig 3 confirm that mete consistently assigns higher probabilities to the highest values of ε meaning that r m ε has a longer tail compared to both observations and our best fitting veg r v ε 3 3 the weak test property of species abundance distributions having compared the metabolic predictions of mete and veg we now briefly discuss their sad predictions the purpose of this section is not to discriminate between mete and veg since sad comparisons are known to only have weak discriminatory power this has led to sad comparisons being dubbed weak tests mcgill 2003 mcgill et al 2007 it has been shown elsewhere that both mete and veg are able to reproduce observed sads harte et al 2008 bertram and dewar 2015 our focus in this section is rather to show explicitly how the weak test property arises in mete and veg to illustrate how sad universality might emerge as a statistical phenomenon rather than being a consequence of universal biological processes the sad is obtained by integrating the ecosystem structure function over ε the sad is proportional to r n r n ε d ε in mete the metabolic constraint eq 2 is necessary to get a fisher log series form for the sad r m n r m n ε d ε e λ 1 n n however the mete predicted sad is almost entirely independent of the value of e s in the metabolic constraint eq 2 for many of the most heavily studied sad datasets i e r m n is independent of λ 2 harte et al 2008 the mete sad thus relies on the existence of a metabolic constraint but is largely independent of the constrained metabolic value analogous to mete in veg eqs 7 and 8 imply 9 r v n r v n ε d ε e μ 1 n n α 1 for all but the lowest abundance species details in appendix c thus although the exact quantitative shape of r v n depends on α both explicitly in eq 9 and implicitly via the fact that μ 1 and μ 2 depend on α r v n will qualitatively have the familiar hollow curve shape mcgill et al 2007 regardless of the particular choice of α in particular α 0 gives the fisher log series predicted by mete thus in both mete and veg the sad is quantitatively insensitive to the predicted metabolic structure of the population the ε dependence of the structure function is integrated out to obtain the sad but the qualitative existence of the metabolic structure that induced by a community level metabolic constraint is essential for obtaining the 1 n factor that gives sad functional forms close to the fisher log series 4 discussion we have shown that despite employing rather different community descriptions the mete and veg ecosystem structure functions are closely related as revealed by a comparison of eqs 3 and 7 see also eq b4 in appendix b from this comparison we see that the key assumption of veg distinguishing it from mete is the metacommunity density of species function ρ ε ecologically the reason for this difference is the following the core mete theory addresses the following question what are the distributions of abundances between and metabolic rates within the s species known to be present in the local community veg on the other hand addresses a rather different question what are the relative abundances of functional types distinguished by metabolic rate in the local community given that metabolic rate has distribution ρ ε in the metacommunity mete thus takes species richness s as an input whereas veg predicts the total number of species functional types in the local community sec 2 2 although as expected the veg predicted s is sensitive to the input metacommunity distribution ρ ε section 3 3 shows that sads are relatively insensitive to ρ ε while section 3 2 shows that metabolic rank distributions depend more sensitively on ρ ε this begs the question of what determines the form of ρ ε assumed in veg there are at least two answers i on short timescales ρ ε may reflect the actual mix of species functional types present in the metacommunity at any given time as in biodiversity manipulation experiments where a given restricted set of species is thrown together and left to assemble a community this short term ρ ε could be highly contingent on the recent history of the region e g abiotic disturbance invasive migrants which could in turn have a strong effect on local metabolic patterns ii on longer timescales ρ ε may more generically reflect the totality of conceivable functional types present in the metacommunity biophysical and long term trait evolution would then be important determinants of ρ ε for instance the value of α in eq 8 may reflect metabolic scaling laws dewar and porté 2008 the upper panels in fig 3 give some insight into what shape ρ ε might take in nature since ecological communities generally have a large proportion of individuals with low metabolic requirement the corresponding functional types are rarely absent implying r ε ρ ε for low ε see the convergence of r ε and ρ ε in veg in the upper panels of fig 3 fig 3 suggests that the marginal distribution for ε among abundant low ε functional types may indeed take a power law form although mete and veg are mathematically similar their chosen interpretation of maxent is conceptually quite different see materials and methods the root of this difference is the use of bayesian probability in mete probability as knowledge versus frequentist probability in veg probability as sample frequency it would be straightforward to reinterpret veg in information theoretic terms but it is not clear how mete might be interpreted in terms of time averaged community states analogous to veg our formal comparison allows the predictions of mete to be interpreted indirectly in terms of sample frequencies time averages via veg the similarity of the csds both metabolic and sad predicted by mete and veg is remarkable because qualitatively similar forms for the sad occur even though mete and veg assume that the contribution of statistical noise to the sad operates at different levels of detail in the case of sads α can be negative or positive corresponding to qualitatively different assumptions about the distribution of metabolic traits in the metacommunity fig 2 and the veg sad can still have a qualitatively similar form provided that the magnitude of α isn t comparable to or larger than 1 yet in both mete and veg the existence of a metabolic constraint is essential for obtaining realistic predictions one of mete s great strengths is that it only requires three parameters s n and e for all its predictions how might the above insights be used to improve the predictions of mete without damaging this exceptional parsimony the answer may lie in the inclusion of a prior distribution for ε representing a contribution from the density of species ρ ε in the metacommunity the upper panels of fig 3 suggest that this trait distribution should give less weight to the higher values of ε and also to the lower values of ε in the barro colorado and hawaiian communities the key role played by the density of species function ρ ε revealed by this study is not surprising ρ ε is analogous to the density of states function in physics which describes the distribution in energy space of available quantum mechanical particle states and which is known to be a key determinant of the statistical properties of macroscopic physical systems tolman 1938 just as ρ ε provides a link between the microscopic and macroscopic properties of physical systems as revealed by maxent in the context of statistical physics its ecological analogue plays a similar role

workers have contributed appendix a note on the definition of the ecosystem structure function our definition of the ecosystem structure function differs slightly from that given in harte et al 2008 which reads the ecosystem structure function is the probability that if a species is picked at random then it has abundance n and if an individual is picked at random from that species then its metabolic requirement is in the range ε ε d ε our italics the harte et al 2008 definition suggests that mete keeps track of species identity in fact r m n ε depends only on n and ε and not species identity thus r m ε n r m n ε n r m n ε is the probability of picking an individual with metabolic requirement ε conditional on it coming from a species with abundance n there is no way within mete to distinguish between different species with the same abundance n and therefore there is no reason to specify which species the individual is selected from in the definition of the ecosystem structure function bertram 2015 favretti 2017 appendix b deriving the ecosystem structure function from distinguishable species in section 2 1 the mete structure function r m was inferred directly from community level constraints here we derive an analogous veg structure function r v n ε we start by defining the probability distribution p n ε i n as follows p n ε i n d ε is the joint probability that the community has species abundances n that a species picked at random from the community has species label i that this chosen species has abundance n i n and that an individual from this chosen species has metabolic requirement in the interval ε ε d ε r v n ε is then obtained by marginalizing with respect to i and n i e r v n ε i n p n ε i n where n 1 to marginalize p we first write it as a product of conditional distributions p n ε i n p ε n i n p n i n p i n p n here p n p n is the probability that the community has abundance vector n p i n 1 δ n i 0 s n is the probability that a species picked from a community with abundances n has species label i i e 0 if species i is absent 1 s n if present p n i n δ n i n is the probabilty that species i has abundance n given the species abundances are n and p ε n i n d ε is the probability that an individual picked from species i has metabolic requirement in the interval ε ε d ε given species i has abundance n and the community abundances are n we thus obtain r v n ε i n p ε n i n δ n i n 1 δ n i 0 p n s n b1 i n p ε n i n δ n i n p n s n where we have used the fact that δ n i n 1 δ n i 0 δ n i n for n 1 in the case of veg all individuals in species i have the same metabolic requirement ε i and so p ε n i n δ ε ε i where δ is the delta function i e the probability that a randomly selected individual from species i has metabolic requirement ε is 1 in the immediate vicinity of ε i and is 0 otherwise thus from b1 we have b2 r v n ε i δ ε ε i n δ n i n p n s n an ecologically important special case of b2 occurs when the variation in the number of species present from one snapshot to the next is small relative to the expected number of species such that s n is approximately constant with value given by s n s n p n eq b2 then simplifies to b3 r v n ε 1 s i n i 0 δ ε ε i p n i n where p n i n n δ n i n p n is the probability that species i has abundance n in veg we have from eq 6 bertram and dewar 2015 p n i n 1 e μ 1 μ 2 ε i e μ 1 μ 2 ε i n to make it explicit that this probability depends on the metabolic requirement of species i we use the notation p n ε i p n i n that is p n i n in veg is the probability that a species has abundance n given that its metabolic requirement is ε i since the ecosystem structure function is a probability density in the continuous variable ε we introduce a spectral density c ρ ε d ε that counts the number of metabolic requirement levels ε i in each interval ε ε d ε here c is the total number of functional types in the metacommunity and ρ ε is the probability density of ε over the domain ε 1 ε c defined by the metabolic requirement spectrum ε 1 ε c from eq b3 r v n ε can then be written in the form b4 r v n ε c s ρ ε p n ε appendix c the veg species abundance distribution assuming a power law density of states ρ ε ε α we have from eq 7 r n 0 r n ε d ε 0 ε α 1 e μ 1 μ 2 ε e μ 1 μ 2 ε n d ε by making the substitution x μ 2 ε n the integral is found to be 0 ε

25017,the principle of maximum entropy maxent promises a novel approach for understanding community assembly despite reproducing a variety of observed species abundance patterns maxent models in ecology have been hampered by disparate model assumptions and interpretations a recurring challenge is that maxent predictions are highly sensitive to the level of detail used to describe the community being modeled and there seems to be no reason to prefer one level of detail over another here we present of formal unification of two previously developed maxent models which differ in their level of detail but which are otherwise mathematically similar the less detailed model maximum entropy theory of ecology mete does not resolve species identity or explicitly represent species specific traits the more detailed model very entropic growth veg defines each separate species by its per capita metabolic rate ε and assumes a density of species function ρ ε representing the distribution of ε in the metacommunity a formal comparison of mete and veg then highlights ρ ε as a key determinant of local community assembly in particular appropriate choice of ρ ε in veg can produce more realistic predictions for the metabolic rank distribution of local communities than mete which does not explicitly account for metacommunity structure this opens new avenues of inquiry about what determines metacommunity structure in nature and suggests possible ways to improve mete keywords community assembly macroecology metabolic requirements resource partitioning species abundance distribution statistical aggregation 1 introduction one of the central aims of ecology is to understand the determinants of community assembly many studies of community assembly involve summaries of community structure such as the species abundance distribution sad species area relationship sar and analogous metabolic rate distributions we will refer to these summary distributions collectively as community structure distributions csds csds particularly the sad have attracted attention because their shapes are strikingly similar across different communities representing a possible example of universality in community ecology mcgill et al 2007 the existence of universal features in csds is intriguing because these could reflect universal aspects of the biological processes responsible for structuring communities however csds could also be universal for statistical reasons tokeshi 1993 ulrich et al 2010 similar to how the normal distribution is ubiquitous because many measured quantities involve statistical averaging the central limit theorem csds could be universal simply because community specific details disappear in aggregating patterns to the level of species counts fig 1 or other forms of averaging since statistical universality would make csds considerably less valuable for understanding the biological determinants of community assembly it is important to understand the relative contributions of biological versus statistical factors to csds a promising approach for achieving this understanding is to use the statistical principle of maximum entropy maxent maxent models seek to identify minimal sets of assumptions required to reproduce empirical patterns like csds all maxent models have two major components and may differ from one another in the assumptions made for each component component i the ecological variables used to describe a community are specified crucially this entails assumptions about the level of detail that will be used for instance species counts might be used rather than species abundances fig 1 component ii constraints are imposed on the community by assuming that the probability distribution for the ecological variables i is consistent with specified community level expectations with i and ii in place the maxent principle is used to select from among all the probability distributions consistent with the constraints ii the distribution that has the greatest uncertainty about the values of the ecological variables jaynes 1957 dewar 2009 intuitively maxent effectively treats all mechanistic details not expressed in the constraints as completely random in the sense that the ecological variables i have been made as unpredictable as possible consistent with the constraints ii the constraints thus represent non random factors including biological ones underlying the predicted maxent probability distribution by comparing empirical with maxent predicted distributions for different choices of i and ii we thus have a way to resolve the contributions of biological versus statistical factors to observed ecological patterns dewar 2009 o dwyer et al 2017 note that maxent models are distinct from statistical models which aim to quantify statistical relationships between variables like process based models in ecology maxent models in ecology seek to describe how ecological processes shape ecological communities with the difference that those processes are described indirectly in the form of constraints a number of maxent models have been developed to reproduce observed csds e g shipley et al 2006 pueyo et al 2007 harte et al 2008 dewar and porté 2008 banavar et al 2010 bertram and dewar 2015 and many of these have done so successfully however interpreting these results in terms of familiar ecological processes like dispersal disturbance and interactions between organisms has proved difficult one of the main sources of difficulty is the sensitivity of maxent predictions to different choices of ecological variables in i even though those variables may only differ in that they describe the community at different levels of detail haegeman and etienne 2010 he 2010 favretti 2017 for instance the species abundance composition of a community can be described using the number of species with each abundance less detailed this is the sad or by resolving the abundance of each separate species more detailed fig 1 maxent effectively assumes maximal randomness subject to constraints at whichever level of detail is chosen which can make a big difference to the predicted maxent distribution yet there seems to be no a priori reason why we should describe communities at one level of detail but not another despite extensive debates about the prospects and pitfalls of the maxent approach triggered in part by this issue dewar 2009 mcgill and nekola 2010 shipley 2010 supp et al 2012 harte and newman 2014 harte et al 2015 so far little consensus has emerged a major obstacle to forging such a consensus is that it is often hard to see the connections between the variety of different maxent models that have been developed particularly when models differ at step i in their choice of ecological variables here we derive a formal relationship between two maxent models which differ in the level of detail with which they describe ecological communities but otherwise assume similar constraints on total community abundance and metabolic requirement the models we compare are mete maximum entropy theory of ecology harte et al 2008 2009 harte 2011 harte and newman 2014 and veg very entropic growth dewar and porté 2008 bertram and dewar 2013 2015 mete describes communities at the same coarse grained level of detail as the sad fig 1 whereas veg is more detailed in that it separately resolves the abundance of each species a comparison between the two models then allows us to determine how differences in the level of detail with which ecosystem states are described affect predicted csds in particular we highlight the role played by the density of species function ρ ε in the more detailed veg model where ρ ε d ε is the probability that a species functional type selected at random from the metacommunity has metabolic rates in the range ε ε d ε the function ρ ε represents the distribution of metabolic rates ε in the metacommunity from which the local community is assembled in veg mete does not explicitly account for properties of the metacommunity and only concerns itself with the post assembly metabolic structure in the local community we show that if ρ ε takes a power law form the exponent can be chosen such that the metabolic predictions of veg match empirical observations better than mete suggesting possible avenues for improving mete in contrast we show that sads are relatively insensitive to ρ ε the determination of ρ ε thus emerges as a key area for further study and we discuss prospects for doing so 2 materials and methods 2 1 two maxent models of community assembly 2 1 1 mete here we give a brief overview of the core mete theory we will not consider the area scaling component of the full mete theory harte et al 2009 harte 2011 nor any other extensions that have since been made to mete the central quantity predicted by mete is a joint probability distribution r m n ε called the ecosystem structure function by definition r m n ε d ε is the joint probability that a species selected at random from a community has abundance n and that an individual selected at random from a species with abundance n has a metabolic requirement between ε and ε d ε harte et al 2008 harte 2011 bertram 2015 favretti 2017 appendix a the ecosystem structure function is closely related to the sad if we add together all of the possible metabolic requirements ε we obtain the probability distribution for the abundance of a randomly selected species r m n r m n ε d ε the sad is then simply s r m n where s is the total number of species present in the community thus r m n ε is a sad that has been extended to incorporate information about community metabolic structure mete assumes that r m n ε satisfies two constraints 1 n 1 n ε 1 e n r m n ε d ε n s 2 n 1 n ε 1 e n ε r m n ε d ε e s these constraints imply that the total number of individuals in the community given by s n 1 n ε 1 e n r m n ε d ε is equal to n and the total community metabolic requirement given by s n 1 n ε 1 e n ε r m n ε d ε is equal to e the triplet of values n e and s are the inputs to mete r m n ε is then obtained by maximizing the shannon entropy n r m ln r m d ε subject to constraints 1 and 2 as well as the constraint that r m n ε sums to 1 since it is a probability distribution this maximization procedure gives 3 r m n ε e λ 1 n λ 2 n ε where λ 1 and λ 2 are constants lagrange multipliers with values chosen such that constraints 1 and 2 hold harte 2011 explicit derivations in brummer and newman 2019 mete has been justified and interpreted in terms of information theory harte 2011 constraints 1 and 2 express knowledge about the variables n and ε as specified by the assumed values of n e and s by maximizing the information entropy n r m ln r m d ε we ensure that eq 3 expresses precisely that knowledge about n and ε no more and no less dewar 2009 2 1 2 veg veg is like mete in that it uses maxent to predict community properties from a few constraints moreover as shown below the veg constraints are mathematically similar to those of mete although their interpretation is somewhat different the major feature that differentiates veg is that it represents community structure in more detail in veg species are distinguishable whereas mete only specifies the proportion of species with each abundance n via the ecosystem structure function table 1 veg uses maxent to predict the probability p n that when we take a snapshot of the community we observe the species abundances n n 1 n 2 n c i e the species labeled 1 has abundance n 1 and so on the species abundances in veg may be zero the number of species present in a snapshot s is equal to the number of nonzero elements of n each species in veg is also assigned a distinct trait the individuals of species i are assumed to have a metabolic requirement of ε i where the species labels are chosen such that ε 1 ε 2 ε c veg represents a special case in which there is no trait variation within species a veg species is thus more appropriately interpreted as a functional type than a taxonomic unit bertram and dewar 2013 like mete veg assumes total abundance and total metabolic requirement constraints 4 n i n i p n n 5 n i n i ε i p n e however in contrast to mete veg adopts a frequency interpretation of p n rather than an information theory one which admits a more transparent ecological interpretation of the constraints 4 and 5 specifically since p n represents the probability of observing the snapshot n p n can be interpreted as a sample frequency representing the proportion of time that the community spends with abundance composition n the sums on the left hand sides of eqs 4 and 5 thus represent time averages consequently constraints 4 and 5 are explicit ecological assumptions rather than knowledge they imply a time averaged community steady state in which community abundance and total metabolic requirement maintain average values of n and e respectively over some time period of interest for instance these assumptions may not be justified if there is a trend in n or e over the period that the snapshots are taken e g due to changes in resource availability again similarly to mete p n is obtained by maximizing the shannon entropy n p n ln p n subject to constraints 4 5 and the constraint that p n sums to 1 this maximization procedure gives 6 p n e i μ 1 μ 2 ε i n i where μ 1 and μ 2 are the lagrange multipliers corresponding to constraints 4 and 5 respectively within the frequency interpretation the maximum entropy prediction for p n in eq 6 represents the most likely distribution of species abundances n that would be observed over many snapshots if the abundances n are completely random in each snapshot apart from satisfying constraints 4 and 5 details in bertram and dewar 2015 in eq 6 p n depends on the spectrum of metabolic requirements available to the community ε 1 ε 2 ε c thus the inputs of veg are n e and the full spectrum of values ε i table 1 in contrast to mete the number of species s present in the community in a snapshot is a prediction of veg rather than an input 3 results 3 1 the density of species ρ ε and the veg ecosystem structure function in this section we give an intuitive derivation of the ecosystem structure function implied by veg which will be denoted r v n ε a more rigorous derivation is given in appendix b this allows us to directly compare the predictions of mete and veg when we sample a species at random from a community all species present have the same probability of being selected however the metabolic requirement ε of the selected species is more likely to take some values than others due to two effects 1 trait availability in the metacommunity among the species currently inhabiting the community s broader geographic region some values of ε are more likely to occur than others due both to intrinsic biophysical constraints on the traits determining ε and the region s history 2 environmental filtering in the local community shipley et al 2006 from the distribution of possible metabolic rates some values of ε are more likely to be present in the community due to local environmental factors in veg all individuals in species i have the same metabolic requirement ε i consequently the first effect above trait availability in the metacommunity is represented by the fact that the metabolic spectrum ε 1 ε 2 ε c may be more densely packed at some values of ε than at others for comparison with mete in which ε is a continuous variable we introduce the continuous density of species distribution ρ ε ρ ε d ε is the probability that a species functional type selected at random from the metacommunity has metabolic requirement in the interval ε ε d ε in the present analysis we assume that the metabolic requirement spectrum in the metacommunity is sufficiently dense that we can approximate ρ ε as a smooth function ε once a species has been sampled from the metacommunity and its metabolic requirement has been found to be ε the probability that it has abundance n in the local community denoted p n ε can then be straightforwardly calculated in veg from eq 6 as detailed in appendix b p n ε e μ 1 μ 2 ε n veg also explicitly accounts for the second effect above environmental filtering in the local community through the lagrange multipliers μ 1 and μ 2 that reflect the environmental constraints eqs 4 and 5 to construct r v n ε which only refers to species that are present we restrict our attention to n 1 the joint probability of sampling a species with abundance n from the community and of sampling an individual from such a species with metabolic requirement ε is then simply proportional to ρ ε p n ε where n 1 this gives full equation in appendix b eq b4 7 r v n ε ρ ε p n ε ρ ε e μ 1 n μ 2 n ε to be compared with the corresponding ecosystem structure function of mete r m n ε given by eq 3 the above argument leading to eq 7 for r v and the more rigorous argument given in appendix b is quite general it derives the ecosystem structure function for any model which predicts abundance probabilities conditional on the trait values p n ε and in which we know the density of species ρ ε a comparison of eqs 3 and 7 shows an extra dependence of the veg ecosystem structure function on ρ ε compared with mete in the following sections we examine how this difference affects the metabolic and sad predictions of veg and mete we assume for illustration that the metabolic requirement spectrum has a power law form dewar and porté 2008 8 ρ ε ε α where α is a free parameter fig 2 our motivation for eq 8 is to have a simple one parameter function in which we can adjust the relative density of species at low versus high ε α 0 corresponds to a uniformly spaced spectrum the upper limit of ε in eq 8 ε c will depend on the history of the metacommunity or biophysical constraints on possible trait values in the following we assume that ε c is sufficiently large that the corresponding functional types are almost certainly absent from the local community p n ε c 0 in this case the predictions of veg are independent of the value of ε c see bertram and dewar 2013 for an example where the value of ε c is important 3 2 metabolic rank distributions in this section we compare the metabolic dependence of the mete and veg structure functions r v n ε and r m n ε using the relationship eq 7 derived in the previous section as eq 7 shows the veg ecosystem structure function is sensitive to the shape of ρ ε we thus vary the shape of ρ ε to see what is needed to match metabolic data and compare this with the predictions of mete to vary the shape of ρ ε we took α in eq 8 as a free parameter to be fitted to three metabolic datasets barro colorado island trees condit 1998 hubbell et al 1999 2005 hawaiian island arthropods gruner 2007 and rocky mountain subalpine meadow plants newman et al 2014 our fitting procedure is inspired by the metabolic analysis of harte et al 2017 which is based on the rank distribution of individual metabolic rates this distribution is related to the ecosystem structure function as follows first we introduce the individual level energy distribution ied ψ ε s n n n r n ε harte 2011 newman et al 2014 ψ ε is the probability that a randomly sampled individual has metabolic requirement ε the cumulative distribution ε e ψ ε d ε thus gives the proportion of individuals in the community with metabolic requirement greater than ε and so r ε n ε e ψ ε d ε is the number of such individuals the latter quantity r ε is also the rank of an individual with metabolic rate ε when the individuals in the community are ordered from greatest to smallest ε harte et al 2017 plot log ε on the vertical axis and log r ε on the horizontal axis to compare the predictions of mete with observations accordingly we calculate the sum of square differences between the predicted and observed values of log ε at 20 evenly spaced intervals along the rank axis and optimize α to minimize the sum of square differences the resultant best fit predictions of veg are shown in the top three panels of fig 3 in the bci and rmbl datasets we found values of α that give superior ψ ε fits to mete for bci s s e v e g s s e m e t e 0 26 for rmbl s s e v e g s s e m e t e 0 72 but mete performed better in the hawaii dataset s s e v e g s s e m e t e 2 00 these results are not intended to suggest that in practical applications veg should be used in place of mete when situations like bci and rmbl are obtained because veg requires that we specify an entire additional distribution ρ ε which in this case had to be fitted to observations mete did not require such fitting this would be hard to justify from a model parsimony perspective however our results do confirm that the power law form for the metacommunity distribution ρ ε gives plausible metabolic predictions note that in veg ψ ε is technically a probability mass function over the discrete values ε 1 ε c which would in general lead to a step like rank ε relationship but since we have assumed a dense spectrum section 3 1 these steps are too small to be noticeable in fig 3 the upper panels of fig 3 show that mete and veg both track the middle and higher ranks closely but bigger discrepancies are found at lower ranks higher metabolic rates where the veg metabolic rates are too low and the mete predictions are too high these rank ε curves do not give us any sense of how important these discrepancies are relative to the overall metabolic requirement of the community are the highest ε individuals ecologically important or are there too few of them to address this question in the middle panels of fig 3 we show the fraction of total community metabolic requirement e contributed by individuals with metabolic requirement ε or lower that is n ε 1 ε ε ψ ε d ε plotted as a function of log ε this shows that higher ε individuals make a substantial contribution to total community e in spite of their relatively low abundance for instance bci individuals with ε 10 3 contribute about half of total community e coinciding with the region of greatest divergence between predictions and observations particularly for mete therefore high ε predictions are important for the overall validity of models of community metabolic structure in the lower three panels of fig 3 we show the marginal distribution for individual metabolic rates r ε n r n ε while this mathematical definition is very simple r ε is not usually considered in mete because ψ ε is a more intuitive description of community metabolic structure r ε is the probability that if we randomly sample a species from the community and then randomly sample an individual from that species the individual has metabolic rate ε however the marginal distribution r ε does capture important information about the ecosystem structure function r n ε in veg r v ε is more intuitive it is simply the probability that a randomly sampled species functional type in the local community has metabolic requirement ε r v ε allows us to see how the local community filters functional types using the fact that r v ε ρ ε n 1 p n ε ρ ε 1 p 0 ε where we have used eq 7 the second term in this expression 1 p 0 ε is the probability that the functional type with metabolic requirement ε is locally present the lower three panels in fig 3 confirm that mete consistently assigns higher probabilities to the highest values of ε meaning that r m ε has a longer tail compared to both observations and our best fitting veg r v ε 3 3 the weak test property of species abundance distributions having compared the metabolic predictions of mete and veg we now briefly discuss their sad predictions the purpose of this section is not to discriminate between mete and veg since sad comparisons are known to only have weak discriminatory power this has led to sad comparisons being dubbed weak tests mcgill 2003 mcgill et al 2007 it has been shown elsewhere that both mete and veg are able to reproduce observed sads harte et al 2008 bertram and dewar 2015 our focus in this section is rather to show explicitly how the weak test property arises in mete and veg to illustrate how sad universality might emerge as a statistical phenomenon rather than being a consequence of universal biological processes the sad is obtained by integrating the ecosystem structure function over ε the sad is proportional to r n r n ε d ε in mete the metabolic constraint eq 2 is necessary to get a fisher log series form for the sad r m n r m n ε d ε e λ 1 n n however the mete predicted sad is almost entirely independent of the value of e s in the metabolic constraint eq 2 for many of the most heavily studied sad datasets i e r m n is independent of λ 2 harte et al 2008 the mete sad thus relies on the existence of a metabolic constraint but is largely independent of the constrained metabolic value analogous to mete in veg eqs 7 and 8 imply 9 r v n r v n ε d ε e μ 1 n n α 1 for all but the lowest abundance species details in appendix c thus although the exact quantitative shape of r v n depends on α both explicitly in eq 9 and implicitly via the fact that μ 1 and μ 2 depend on α r v n will qualitatively have the familiar hollow curve shape mcgill et al 2007 regardless of the particular choice of α in particular α 0 gives the fisher log series predicted by mete thus in both mete and veg the sad is quantitatively insensitive to the predicted metabolic structure of the population the ε dependence of the structure function is integrated out to obtain the sad but the qualitative existence of the metabolic structure that induced by a community level metabolic constraint is essential for obtaining the 1 n factor that gives sad functional forms close to the fisher log series 4 discussion we have shown that despite employing rather different community descriptions the mete and veg ecosystem structure functions are closely related as revealed by a comparison of eqs 3 and 7 see also eq b4 in appendix b from this comparison we see that the key assumption of veg distinguishing it from mete is the metacommunity density of species function ρ ε ecologically the reason for this difference is the following the core mete theory addresses the following question what are the distributions of abundances between and metabolic rates within the s species known to be present in the local community veg on the other hand addresses a rather different question what are the relative abundances of functional types distinguished by metabolic rate in the local community given that metabolic rate has distribution ρ ε in the metacommunity mete thus takes species richness s as an input whereas veg predicts the total number of species functional types in the local community sec 2 2 although as expected the veg predicted s is sensitive to the input metacommunity distribution ρ ε section 3 3 shows that sads are relatively insensitive to ρ ε while section 3 2 shows that metabolic rank distributions depend more sensitively on ρ ε this begs the question of what determines the form of ρ ε assumed in veg there are at least two answers i on short timescales ρ ε may reflect the actual mix of species functional types present in the metacommunity at any given time as in biodiversity manipulation experiments where a given restricted set of species is thrown together and left to assemble a community this short term ρ ε could be highly contingent on the recent history of the region e g abiotic disturbance invasive migrants which could in turn have a strong effect on local metabolic patterns ii on longer timescales ρ ε may more generically reflect the totality of conceivable functional types present in the metacommunity biophysical and long term trait evolution would then be important determinants of ρ ε for instance the value of α in eq 8 may reflect metabolic scaling laws dewar and porté 2008 the upper panels in fig 3 give some insight into what shape ρ ε might take in nature since ecological communities generally have a large proportion of individuals with low metabolic requirement the corresponding functional types are rarely absent implying r ε ρ ε for low ε see the convergence of r ε and ρ ε in veg in the upper panels of fig 3 fig 3 suggests that the marginal distribution for ε among abundant low ε functional types may indeed take a power law form although mete and veg are mathematically similar their chosen interpretation of maxent is conceptually quite different see materials and methods the root of this difference is the use of bayesian probability in mete probability as knowledge versus frequentist probability in veg probability as sample frequency it would be straightforward to reinterpret veg in information theoretic terms but it is not clear how mete might be interpreted in terms of time averaged community states analogous to veg our formal comparison allows the predictions of mete to be interpreted indirectly in terms of sample frequencies time averages via veg the similarity of the csds both metabolic and sad predicted by mete and veg is remarkable because qualitatively similar forms for the sad occur even though mete and veg assume that the contribution of statistical noise to the sad operates at different levels of detail in the case of sads α can be negative or positive corresponding to qualitatively different assumptions about the distribution of metabolic traits in the metacommunity fig 2 and the veg sad can still have a qualitatively similar form provided that the magnitude of α isn t comparable to or larger than 1 yet in both mete and veg the existence of a metabolic constraint is essential for obtaining realistic predictions one of mete s great strengths is that it only requires three parameters s n and e for all its predictions how might the above insights be used to improve the predictions of mete without damaging this exceptional parsimony the answer may lie in the inclusion of a prior distribution for ε representing a contribution from the density of species ρ ε in the metacommunity the upper panels of fig 3 suggest that this trait distribution should give less weight to the higher values of ε and also to the lower values of ε in the barro colorado and hawaiian communities the key role played by the density of species function ρ ε revealed by this study is not surprising ρ ε is analogous to the density of states function in physics which describes the distribution in energy space of available quantum mechanical particle states and which is known to be a key determinant of the statistical properties of macroscopic physical systems tolman 1938 just as ρ ε provides a link between the microscopic and macroscopic properties of physical systems as revealed by maxent in the context of statistical physics its ecological analogue plays a similar role

workers have contributed appendix a note on the definition of the ecosystem structure function our definition of the ecosystem structure function differs slightly from that given in harte et al 2008 which reads the ecosystem structure function is the probability that if a species is picked at random then it has abundance n and if an individual is picked at random from that species then its metabolic requirement is in the range ε ε d ε our italics the harte et al 2008 definition suggests that mete keeps track of species identity in fact r m n ε depends only on n and ε and not species identity thus r m ε n r m n ε n r m n ε is the probability of picking an individual with metabolic requirement ε conditional on it coming from a species with abundance n there is no way within mete to distinguish between different species with the same abundance n and therefore there is no reason to specify which species the individual is selected from in the definition of the ecosystem structure function bertram 2015 favretti 2017 appendix b deriving the ecosystem structure function from distinguishable species in section 2 1 the mete structure function r m was inferred directly from community level constraints here we derive an analogous veg structure function r v n ε we start by defining the probability distribution p n ε i n as follows p n ε i n d ε is the joint probability that the community has species abundances n that a species picked at random from the community has species label i that this chosen species has abundance n i n and that an individual from this chosen species has metabolic requirement in the interval ε ε d ε r v n ε is then obtained by marginalizing with respect to i and n i e r v n ε i n p n ε i n where n 1 to marginalize p we first write it as a product of conditional distributions p n ε i n p ε n i n p n i n p i n p n here p n p n is the probability that the community has abundance vector n p i n 1 δ n i 0 s n is the probability that a species picked from a community with abundances n has species label i i e 0 if species i is absent 1 s n if present p n i n δ n i n is the probabilty that species i has abundance n given the species abundances are n and p ε n i n d ε is the probability that an individual picked from species i has metabolic requirement in the interval ε ε d ε given species i has abundance n and the community abundances are n we thus obtain r v n ε i n p ε n i n δ n i n 1 δ n i 0 p n s n b1 i n p ε n i n δ n i n p n s n where we have used the fact that δ n i n 1 δ n i 0 δ n i n for n 1 in the case of veg all individuals in species i have the same metabolic requirement ε i and so p ε n i n δ ε ε i where δ is the delta function i e the probability that a randomly selected individual from species i has metabolic requirement ε is 1 in the immediate vicinity of ε i and is 0 otherwise thus from b1 we have b2 r v n ε i δ ε ε i n δ n i n p n s n an ecologically important special case of b2 occurs when the variation in the number of species present from one snapshot to the next is small relative to the expected number of species such that s n is approximately constant with value given by s n s n p n eq b2 then simplifies to b3 r v n ε 1 s i n i 0 δ ε ε i p n i n where p n i n n δ n i n p n is the probability that species i has abundance n in veg we have from eq 6 bertram and dewar 2015 p n i n 1 e μ 1 μ 2 ε i e μ 1 μ 2 ε i n to make it explicit that this probability depends on the metabolic requirement of species i we use the notation p n ε i p n i n that is p n i n in veg is the probability that a species has abundance n given that its metabolic requirement is ε i since the ecosystem structure function is a probability density in the continuous variable ε we introduce a spectral density c ρ ε d ε that counts the number of metabolic requirement levels ε i in each interval ε ε d ε here c is the total number of functional types in the metacommunity and ρ ε is the probability density of ε over the domain ε 1 ε c defined by the metabolic requirement spectrum ε 1 ε c from eq b3 r v n ε can then be written in the form b4 r v n ε c s ρ ε p n ε appendix c the veg species abundance distribution assuming a power law density of states ρ ε ε α we have from eq 7 r n 0 r n ε d ε 0 ε α 1 e μ 1 μ 2 ε e μ 1 μ 2 ε n d ε by making the substitution x μ 2 ε n the integral is found to be 0 ε

is inhabited by different fish species one of them is the athabasca rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss a unique native ecotype of trout confined mainly to the upper athabasca river and tributaries including the mcleod berland wildhay and freeman rivers the athabasca rainbow trout art has a high commercial and recreational value for the region making it lucrative for sport fishing and farming the biology of the art differs from the non native rainbow trout in that the native trout spawns later in spring grow more slowly and mature at a smaller size than the their introduced counterpart rasmussen and taylor 2009 the art inhabits cold river waters from 2nd to 4th order streams between 900 and 1500 m above sea level in spring the art spawns in streams with fine gravel free of silts and clays and moderate flow rates and over winter they inhabit streams with large deep pools the art spawns annually but the time varies with elevation at high elevations spawning begins in late june and fry emerge as late as september whereas in low elevations spawning usually occurs between late april and may e g sterling 1993 in 2014 the art was designated as endangered by the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada cosewic cosewic 2014 and currently it is considered as a species at risk by the alberta athabasca rainbow trout recovery team caskenette and koops 2018 data on art habitat occupancy from fwmis 2018 show a decrease of the fish s occupancy in lowland reaches likely due to warmer water temperatures cosewic 2014 indicated that climate change will affect between 31 and 70 of the art habitat in the next 10 years therefore the athabasca rainbow trout was selected as the study species because 1 of their susceptibility to shifting species distributions and

beauty and significance for river recreation the athabasca river section within jasper national park is designated as a canadian heritage river goc 2011 the river is important in sustaining aquatic habitat with its rapids re aerating the water in winter and its various reaches serving at seasonal habitat 2 2 modelling framework we coupled fig a 10 a semi distributed physically based land surface hydrological modelling system mesh pietroniro et al 2007 see section a 1 to the river basin model rbm a mechanistic one dimensional stream temperature model yearsley 2012 see section a 2 to first simulate hydrological processes and then stream water temperature along the athabasca river system our model coupling approach requires running both mesh and rbm models independently with data from mesh being transferred to rbm mesh and rbm were both set up on the same orthogonal grid with a spatial resolution of 0 1250 10 10 km resulting in 1326 grid cells and channels that comprehend the athabasca river and tributaries firstly mesh was run at a 3 h time step to simulate streamflow water depth width and averaged water velocity in every channel these hydrological and hydraulic variables in a second step were aggregated and introduced into rbm at daily time steps similarly to mesh rbm requires meteorological variables at daily time steps however because meteorological observations are rarely discretized at the resolution of each segment node meteorological data were interpolated onto the river network additionally river network topology information necessary for computations were also introduced into rbm finally rbm was run at daily time steps to compute water depth averaged temperatures at every channel of the stream network 2 3 mesh calibration and validation procedure though mesh was run at a 3 hour time step output streamflow s were generated for a daily time step for comparison and analysis against flows recorded at gauging station athabasca river below mcmurray 07da001 see fig 1 for the station location the meteorological forcing data from 1983 to 2000 produced by the canadian regional climate model crcm caya and laprise 1999 and the reanalysis model ncep doe amip ii reanalysis ncep kanamitsu et al 2002 crcm ncep were used in model calibration and validation see table 1 four land cover parameters and four hydraulic parameters representing exchange of energy and water balance between land surface and atmosphere and four parameters from flow routing were calibrated see tables 2 and 3 the model was first calibrated for the 1992 2000 period where the year 1992 was considered a spin up period then the model was validated for 9 years from 1983 to 1991 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse see eq b 1 was estimated to evaluate the model performance since nse leads to an overestimation of the model performance during peak flows and an underestimation during low flow condition the logarithm of the nse log ns was estimated in order to evaluate the model integrally 2 4 rbm validation procedure stream water temperature data is very limited in the catchment and most water temperature data has been only recorded during the last two decades to implement rbm mesh was firstly calibrated and validated during the 01 january 2002 to 31 december 2012 period using precipitation data obtained from the canadian precipitation analysis capa database which is operationally run by the canadian meteorological centre cmc the cmc produces accumulated precipitation for 6 h and 12 h time intervals over all of north america on a 10 km 10 km grid fortin et al 2015 the rest of the gridded meteorological forcing data were obtained from the global environmental multiscale model gem which is an integrated forecasting and data assimilation system developed by environment canada côté et al 1998 available at spatial and temporal resolutions of 15 km and 1 h respectively a detailed description of mesh model calibration and validation for the this period is described in morales marin et al 2019 rbm was forced using the same meteorological forcing datasets for the 01 january 2002 to 31 december 2012 period and the hydrological variables needed for rbm were estimated using mesh see table 1 to validate rbm the daily water temperature simulations were compared to instantaneous water temperature observations unevenly obtained from alberta environment and parks http aep alberta ca water reports data surface water quality data at three different stations located on the athabasca river see fig 1 for station locations these water temperature observations are instantaneous measurements taken approximately between 0 m and 1 m below the water surface around mid day during the validation processes the coefficients of the rbm boundary conditions defined by the non linear water temperature regression model described by mohseni et al 1998 see eq a 6 were adjusted for highland and lowland headwater streams morales marin et al 2019 2 5 climate change scenarios hydrological and water temperature simulations were performed using the mesh rbm modelling system forced by gridded meteorological data retrieved from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2009 2012 narccap consists of simulations from six regional climate models over consistent periods 1971 2000 and 2041 2070 and spatial domains of equal resolution 50 km weller et al 2013 it uses the a2 emission scenario since it was one of the marker scenarios developed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change included in the special report on emission scenarios sres nakicenovic et al 2000 a2 is at the higher end of the emission scenarios documented in sres but not the highest and it is the most relevant based on the impact and adaptation view narccap 2016 projections of meteorological forcing data at the temporal and spatial resolution required by mesh rbm are difficult to obtain narccap data were selected due to their higher temporal resolution 3 hourly which is essential for mesh as it runs at 30 min time steps unlike many hydrological models mesh performs both water and energy balances and requires seven meteorological forcing files i e precipitation humidity wind pressure temperature incoming longwave radiation and shortwave radiation which are all available from narccap narccap has different suites of regional climate models rcms each driven by two different atmosphere ocean general circulation models gcms and one reanalysis model ncep doe amip ii reanalysis ncep a retrospective model of the atmosphere based on observed data kanamitsu et al 2002 among available rcms the canadian regional climate model crcm caya and laprise 1999 driven by the community climate system model ccsm and the third generation coupled climate model cgcm3 were chosen for this study to simulate future conditions mearns et al 2012 compared climate change scenarios projected using regional climate models rcms forced by different global climate models gcm for north america the authors found that crcm performed reasonably well in estimating temperature and precipitation mearns et al 2012 also reported that among other rcms crcm has the lowest total rmse for the full domain in all of the seasons the comparison of average daily air temperature between different rcms gcms for the 2041 2070 period for fort mcmurray s meteorological station by rokaya 2018 also revealed that crcm ccsm and crcm cgcm3 are comparatively closer to the median of the multi model ensemble crcm ccsm and crcm cgcm3 have also been previously applied by rokaya et al in press to successfully generate future flows for the athabasca river basin fig 2 conceptualises the modelling framework to predict streamflow and water temperature using the mesh rbm modelling system forced by climate change scenarios and their implementation to asses the impact on art water tolerances and habitat table 1 summarizes the data sets used to calibrate and validate the models and to predict future scenarios of streamflow and water temperature 2 6 streamflow and water temperature indexes gridded daily streamflows and water temperatures were estimated for the 1971 2000 base line period using the crcm ncep data set and for the two a2 sres scenarios crcm ccsm and crcm cgcm3 for the period 2041 2070 in order to analyse the impact of climate change on streamflow and water temperature the following ecologically relevant indices e g richter et al 1996 eaton and scheller 1996 gibson et al 2005 were analysed mean streamflow q mean and mean water temperature tw mean e g xenopoulos et al 2005 döll and zhang 2010 95th percentile daily flow q high represents high flows and water temperature exceeding 5 of the time tw high represents high water temperatures 10th percentile daily flow q low represent low flows the water temperature exceeded 90 of the time tw low represents low water temperatures seasonal amplitude of streamflow δq a and water temperature δtw a represented as the difference between annual 30 day average minimum and maximum values and the timing of 30 day average maximum streamflow percent changes of the predicted stremflow and water temperature indices were calculated with respect to the indices calculated for the base line period 2 7 fish tolerances to water temperature different tolerances of rainbow trout to water temperature are analysed here water temperature preferences for art vary with life stage for example adult art prefer water temperatures between 7 and 18 c whereas fry and juvenile prefer temperatures between 10 and 15 c spawning typically occurs when water temperatures are between 7 and 10 c adult mortality increases at temperatures above 22 c whereas embryos mortality is likely if incubation temperatures fall below 3 c or rise above 18 5 c table 4 scott and crossman 1979 aartrt 2014 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of mesh mesh was calibrated between 1992 and 2000 and validated during the 1983 1991 period using crcm ncep data base for both periods an acceptable agreement between simulated and observed flows see fig 3 was obtained multiple statistical metrics of model accuracy were calculated to asses the model performance see section b nse 0 70 log nse 0 72 r 2 0 72 and pbias 10 were achieved for the calibration years whereas for the validation years nse 0 62 log nse 0 64 r 2 0 67 and pbias 10 were obtained slight discrepancies between observed and simulated flows during the hydrograph falling limbs and the low flow periods which can be related to the insufficient complexity of the baseflow algorithms in mesh 3 2 changes in streamflow indexes a decline of mean streamflows q mean are expected to occur according to both climate change scenarios see fig 4 a larger decreases of q mean are predicted according to crcm ccsm across the basin and maximum decreases occur in the northern and western areas and near the rocky mountains foothills were q mean reduces by more than 60 similarly q mean predictions with crcm cgcm3 indicate flow reductions of more than 40 in the south western areas of the basin but slight flow increases of 2 in the rocky mountains and in the north eastern areas of the basin high streamflows q high and the seasonal streamflow amplitude δq a coincide with the patterns of changes in q mean see fig 4b and d for both scenarios it is expected that large reductions in high flow and seasonal flow amplitude of more than 40 will occur in the western areas of the basin but important increases of these two magnitudes of around 50 are predicted for the north eastern areas and in some headwater subbasins in the rocky mountains low flows fig 4c are expected to decrease by more than 60 across the basin except in some areas toward the east and the west where reductions are around 20 overall climate change will trigger reductions in streamflow particularly toward the western areas of the basin but some increases of high flow toward the east and earlier onset of high flow in the north of the basin are also expected fig 4e 3 3 changes of water temperature large changes of the annual average water temperature regime are expected in the future particularly during the river s ice free months from march to october fig 5 the highest percentage tw increases of 25 predicted by crcm ccsm is expected during april also large increases of tw around 10 are also expected between may and july where increases can be greater than 2 c in contrast slight reductions of 5 1 c in annual average tw are expected during september and october whereas changes in winter temperatures are insignificant when the river is frozen changes of water temperature indices are expected to occur according to the climate change scenarios fig 6 mean water temperatures are expected to increase across the basin and higher increases are predicted for the western and eastern areas of the basin where tw mean rises between 0 2 c and 1 0 c can occur according primarily to crcm ccsm in contrast slight reductions of 0 23 c are noted in some headwater streams in the rocky mountains and in the northern region of the basin similar patterns were noted for high water temperatures and seasonal water temperature amplitudes tw high could increase between 0 5 c and 3 0 c in large areas along the western and the eastern portions of the basin and δtw a may increase substantially toward the north eastern areas by more than 2 c and decrease by 0 5 c in the southern areas the rise in low water temperatures is quite uniform and equal to 0 1 c in the basin except for some streams in the rocky mountains where small decreases of 0 1 c are predicted 3 4 frequency analysis and changes of fish tolerance to water temperatures the frequency distributions of seasonal average water temperature are predicted to change in the future fig 7 in general we observe that in spring the water temperature mean and the standard deviation will increase slightly from 1 38 to 1 41 c and from 0 48 to 0 51 c respectively in contrast a decrease of the mean and an increase of the standard deviation are noted for water temperature in the fall in summer large increases in the water temperature mean from 12 3 c to 14 7 c particularly for crcm ccsm scenario and higher standard deviation from 0 49 to 0 55 are expected in the future these changes in the frequency distributions will affect the probability of occurrence of art tolerant water temperature ranges table 4 using the probability density and cumulative distribution functions given in fig 7 we calculated the probability of occurrence of the water temperature ranges see table 5 and obtained values for tw prf tw spa tw frj which increase slightly in spring but decrease in summer and fall in contrast whereas frequency decreases of tw tha and tw the are expected in spring slight increases of these tw ranges are expected during summer and fall the average number of days per year in which daily water temperature is within the range of thermal tolerance of art are shown in fig 8 reductions of up to 40 days in the frequency of tw prf and tw frj particularly along the main reaches and across the centre region are expected in the basin however increases of over 20 days in the frequency of tw prf and tw frj are expected in headwater streams located at the rocky mountains the frequency of tw spa declines across the basin and greater reductions of 15 days occur toward the western areas whereas at the central and eastern areas of the basin the frequency declines by 5 days increases in the frequency of tw spa occur in some headwater streams located at the rocky mountains and across central and north eastern areas of the basin water temperatures in the range of tw tha do not occur very often in the basin so that they change very little across the basin with the exception of some north eastern reaches and main steam reaches where its frequency increase by 5 days slight decreases in frequency of tw tha are noted in tributaries located in the north and in the south of the basin similarly the frequency of tw the will increase by more than 15 days in reaches located in the rocky mountains the main stem river network and in reaches located in the south and central areas of the basin decreases in tw the frequency by 5 days are expected on the western and north eastern areas of the basin 3 5 frequency changes of fish tolerances to water temperatures changes in the frequency of water temperature within the range of art tolerances were analysed with respect to latitude longitude and altitude fig 9 changes of tw prf tw spa and tw frj frequency are very similar with respect to latitude and longitude in spring the frequency of tw prf tw spa and tw frj increased northward and eastward with a maximum between 5 and 10 days in the north eastern areas in contrast whereas a 5 days increase in tw the frequency is observed in the south western areas decreases of 10 days in tw the frequency is noted in the central and north eastern areas large changes in the frequency of tw tolerances occur in summer the frequency of tw prf and tw frj are expected to increase by 15 days in the south western areas however large decreases in frequency of up to 20 days are expected in central and north eastern areas similarly in summer decreases in tw spa frequency are going to be greater in the south western areas than in the north eastern areas in contrast whereas a 5 day decrease in tw the frequency is expected in the south western areas maximum increases of about 15 days will occur in central and north eastern areas in fall whereas uniform decreases between 2 and 8 days in tw prf tw spa and tw frj frequencies is expected 5 days uniform increases of tw the frequency are predicted with respect to latitude and longitude only slight increases of tw tha frequency in summer were predicted toward the north eastern areas changes in frequency of water temperatures within art tolerances with respect to basin altitude were analysed in spring changes in tw prf tw spa and tw frj frequency are small with a slight tendency to decrease when altitude increases however decreases in tw the frequency is expected in low lands but for mid and high lands an increase in frequency is expected in spring in summer decreases of 5 days in tw prf and tw frj frequency will occur in the low lands but increases of 10 days will occur in the high lands near the rocky mountains in contrast whereas a reduction of tw spa frequency is expected in low and even more in mid lands increases in frequency are expected in high lands located above 2500 m in summer increases in tw the frequency is expected in the low lands but slight decreases in the mid and high lands slight decreases in tw prf tw spa and tw frj frequency is expected in fall with higher changes in the mid and high lands in contrast tw the frequency increases linearly from low to high altitudes where it increases of five days no meaningful changes of tw tha frequency were detected at any altitude 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on streamflow and fish habitat and ecosystems global climate change is a major concern to freshwater fisheries in canada with altered flow and temperature regimes anticipated to impact fish physiology distribution and survival poesch et al 2016 cold water species with limited distribution such as the art may be particularly susceptible to climate change altered flows can have multiple impacts on fish resulting from changes to physical habitat habitat access prey availability behaviour community composition energy expenditure and population dynamics rytwinski et al 2017 peak discharge and q mean are predicted to decrease between 40 and 60 respectively in the western portion of the arb peak flows are critical to creating and maintaining channel features i e riffle pool run sequences that fish depend on for habitat foraging and carrying out their life cycle decreases of this magnitude may compromise the formation maintenance of habitat features necessary to support the art e g rasmussen and taylor 2009 aartrt 2014 the potential effects of flow alterations on fish productivity are not well understood because of uncertainties regarding flow fish productivity relationships rytwinski et al 2017 art spawn from late may to early june during the ascending limp of flow hydrographs at the crest sterling 1993 cosewic 2014 reductions in the frequency and magnitude of peak flows may delay preparedness for spawning due to the lack of cue provision e g richter et al 1996 poff and zimmerman 2010 our predictions of flow decreases in most of the basin means that flow velocities and water depths may render art habitat as suboptimal e g papadaki et al 2016 in order to cope with low flows during spawning period redds may have to be relocated toward the thalweg of the channel putting them at risk of becoming scoured during the summer flow surge peak flows are predicted to increase in the north eastern areas of the arb greater spring flows may reduce egg to fry survival through the scouring of redds crushing eggs through bed gravel mobilization or suffocating eggs through sediment deposition e g montgomery et al 1996 devries 1997 increases in high flows also reduce slow water habitats displacing fry and juveniles e g latterell et al 1998 mantua et al 2010 however the distribution of art is concentrated to the western headwaters of the arb where greater flows are not predicted to occur thus it is likely art will not be impacted minimum flows are predicted to decrease between 20 and 60 across the basin with the greatest reductions in the west other studies have predicted similar reductions in flow for the arb 21 4 and 41 reductions in mean maximum and minimum annual flow respectively kerkhoven and gan 2011 decreases in snow cover depth and duration lack of summer precipitation and increases air temperature are the main drivers of these changes e g eum et al 2017 art overwinter in deep pools that gradually lose 75 of their volume over the winter sterling and cox 2013 although minimum flow is predicted to decrease winter flows are predicted to increase and may enhance overwintering conditions for art 4 2 impact of climate change on water temperature and fish habitat and ecosystems our modeling predicts stream water temperature may increase during the ice free season by as much as 2 5 c by the second half of the 21st century our predictions align with those of a previous study where williams et al 2015 predicted increases of 2 4 c in stream water temperature by mid century in western canada the magnitude of these changes varies across the basin with the greatest increases in western areas of the arb near the foothills of the rocky mountains and in the eastern and central areas the greater increases in water temperature for these areas are likely driven by greater local increases in air temperature and earlier snowmelts e g schindler and donahue 2006 eum et al 2017 art habitat is constricted to the cold unproductive headwaters in the western portion of the arb cosewic 2014 the predicted increases in water temperature in the foothills region of the arb are likely to constrict art further upstream into the headwaters vacating the foothills may create opportunity for invasion by other competing species such as brook trout and non native rainbow trout that may be more tolerant to the changing conditions rasmussen and taylor 2009 cosewic 2014 for example wenger et al 2011 modeled the effects of increasing water temperature under the 2080s a1b emissions scenario and forecasted a mean 47 decline in total suitable habitat for all trout species on a finer scale habitat for cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarkii brook trout salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout salmo trutta was predicted to decline by 58 77 and 48 respectively rainbow trout experienced the least habitat loss at 33 as greater winter flows offset negative impacts of increases in temperature wenger et al 2011 our models similarly predict greater winter flows which likely will benefit the non native rainbow trout understanding interspecific responses to climate change and alterations to interspecific interactions i e shifts in competitive dominance should be a focus of future modeling to fully understand climate change impacts the contraction of habitat also concentrates the art population a reduction in their area of occupancy increases their susceptibility to a population collapse if a catastrophic event was to occur e g chemical spill landslide severe prolonged drought greater densities of fish also increase their susceptibility to disease and parasite transmission e g williams et al 2015 our model predicts spring habitat conditions will generally improve as the frequency of favourable temperatures for incubation and growth increase while the probability of experiencing lethal temperatures decreases table 5 the forecast for summer conditions is less clear as the probability of experiencing favorable optimal for growth and lethal for incubation temperatures varies depending on the model crcm ccsm versus crcm cgcm3 on a finer scale the probability of experiencing favorable versus sub optimal or lethal conditions varies spatially fig 8 and art may seek refuge in other reaches of the arb when conditions are unfavourable however the ability of art to migrate to areas with more favorable conditions would likely be limited by competition from non indigenous species rasmussen and taylor 2009 and size limited mobility i e fry would have limited ability to migrate but are most susceptible to deteriorating conditions radinger and wolter 2014 waterfalls and anthropogenic barriers cosewic 2014 5 conclusions this paper to the best of our knowledge presented the first research to estimate the effects of stream flow and water temperature changes in the context of climate change on fish habitat in the athabasca river catchment our modeling approach integrates a physically based semi distributed hydrological model and a 1d stream water temperature model forced by climate change scenarios model predictions can support decision making to mitigate the effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems the main conclusions of this research are predictions of flow decreases in most of the catchment will reduce flow velocities and water depths causing current art habitat to be suboptimal predicted increases of high flows in some north eastern areas may reduce egg to fry survival rates either by scouring redds and crushing eggs after bed gravel mobilization or suffocating eggs through sediment deposition increases in winter flow may enhance overwintering habitat for art predicted increases in water temperature will result in habitat contraction concentrating art in the upper headwater of the arb contraction of art habitat may open niches for non native trout species to colonize new areas and limit the ability of art to utilize that habitat when conditions are favorable art habitat can potentially be reduced as the frequency of occurrence of life threatening and lethal water temperatures tend to increase particularly in summer appendix a description of mesh and rbm

hydrological routing across grid cells dependent on inflow outflow and water stored in depressions soulis et al 2000 comprehensive physically based hydrological models such as mesh require a large number of parameters and most of them employ the grouped response unit gru approach which is capable of handling several land covers in a catchment efficiently and with less computational expense gru combines areas of similar land cover types so that a grid cell represents a small number of specific grus or land cover tiles kouwen et al 1993 this approach allows the calibration of a set of parameters for each land cover type in the study area but the simulation does not account for sub grid land cover spatial distribution pohl et al 2005 for example two grid cells in mesh with the same precipitation temperature and percentage of different land covers produce the same amount of runoff regardless of how the land covers are distributed within the cells pietroniro et al 2007 additionally the class model can be run on each tile independently to account for variability in land cover within a grid and an aggregation step is performed at the end to calculate the total change in fluxes through the tile connector dornes et al 2008b the hydrological processes represented in mesh consist of three components i vertical exchange of water between soil plants and atmosphere within a grid cell ii generation of surface and subsurface runoff within a grid cell and iii routing of lateral fluxes within the stream network mekonnen et al 2014 the horizontal flow for each gru consists of three components overland flow interflow and baseflow overland flow is calculated using manning s approximation of the kinematic wave propagation interflow which accounts for the downward hill slope flow is estimated from the bulk saturation of each soil layer calculated at each time step baseflow is simply treated as any water that percolates out of the bottom of a soil column in a

different approaches such as equalizing water temperature with simulated daily soil temperature from land surface numerical models and estimating water temperature as a function of air temperature

25018,changes to natural flow and air temperature in the context of climate change can have impacts on physiology distribution and survival of fish of particular interest is the athabasca river basin a highly biologically productive basin that includes one of the largest boreal freshwater inland river deltas in the world and serves as habitat for many fish species earlier melt events higher winter and spring flows and lower summer flows are expected as a consequence of climate change in this basin here we model changes in river flow and water temperature under changing climate scenarios through the integration of a physically based semi distributed hydrological model and a 1d stream water temperature model forced by climate change scenarios the modeled changes in streamflow and water temperature are used to predict changes in habitat suitability for the athabasca rainbow trout art oncorhynchus mykiss a unique ecotype of trout considered as a species at risk the results indicate that future flow decreases in most of the basin can lead to reduced flow velocities and water depths making current art habitat suboptimal also warming low land habitats and increasing water temperatures will increase metabolic rates and stress fish forcing them to migrate upstream to cooler waters confining their habitat range keywords fish habitat water temperature streamflow climate change athabasca river 1 introduction it is well known that climate change is going to affect the hydrological and the thermal regimes in river basins according to döll and zhang 2010 climate change will impact the hydraulic regime of approximately 90 of the world s watercourses converting streamflows to hydrographs that are more similar to those of regulated rivers mantua et al 2010 in snow dominated basins the seasonality of flows is expected to change as a consequence of increased winter air temperature accelerating snow melt nijssen et al 2001 schindler 2001 schindler and donahue 2006 döll and zhang 2010 in these basins it is predicted that summer and autumn runoff will be reduced while winter flooding and flow spates will increase barnett et al 2008 similarly changes of thermal regimes may be more pronounced in snow dominated basins e g van vliet et al 2013 reductions of ice cover and albedo effects will trigger faster increases of water temperature hansen et al 2006 karl et al 2009 for example van vliet et al 2013 reported that globally mean and maximum stream temperatures are predicted to increase between 0 8 c and 1 6 c and between 1 0 c and 2 2 c respectively by the end of the century decreases in streamflow reduces the thermal capacity of water exposing fish to higher temperatures e g mohseni et al 2003 climate change impact on stream flow and water temperature will affect many fish species as these depend on cyclical patterns of flow and water temperature for the completion of their life cycle decreases in stream flows will confine fish to pools affecting community composition diversity spawning and size structure of fish populations poff et al 1997 lake 2003 mantua et al 2010 increases in winter flows could reduce egg to fry survival rates of fall spawning fish as eggs are scoured from river bed gravel seegrist and gard 1972 fausch et al 2001 mantua et al 2010 similarly flow spates can cause direct mortality of both juvenile e g schlosser 1985 harvey 1987 and adult toth et al 1982 fishes seasonal increases in flow can trigger spawning migrations nesler et al 1988 lytle and poff 2004 and enhance access to foraging and spawning habitat ficke et al 2007 on the other hand fish physiology is inextricably linked to the temperature of their surrounding environment ficke et al 2007 thermal conditions regulate aspects of fish physiology such as growth reproduction and activity franklin et al 1995 schmidt nielsen 1997 although fish can select thermally heterogeneous habitats they are constrained to a range under which they can survive neverman and wurtsbaugh 1994 biro 1998 changes in natural flow and temperature patterns due to climate change can have impacts on physiology distribution and survival of fish e g poff and allan 1995 dudgeon et al 2006 of particular interest is the athabasca river basin arb a highly biologically productive basin that includes one of the largest boreal freshwater inland river deltas in the world and serves as habitat for many fish species e g goc 2011 prowse et al 2006 earlier melt events higher winter and spring flows and lower summer flows are expected as a consequence of climate change in this basin e g prowse et al 2006 eum et al 2017 gradual declines of runoff from 28 at the headwaters to 7 near the basin outlet toth et al 2006 are anticipated shrestha et al 2017 increases between 1 6 and 3 6 c in the basin water temperature are expected by the end of the century in the climate change context du et al 2019 these changes in hydraulic regime and water temperature are expected to favour generalist often exotic over specialist often natives fish species as conditions change and habitat availability contracts rasmussen and taylor 2009 poesch et al 2016 the athabasca river basin is inhabited by different fish species one of them is the athabasca rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss a unique native ecotype of trout confined mainly to the upper athabasca river and tributaries including the mcleod berland wildhay and freeman rivers the athabasca rainbow trout art has a high commercial and recreational value for the region making it lucrative for sport fishing and farming the biology of the art differs from the non native rainbow trout in that the native trout spawns later in spring grow more slowly and mature at a smaller size than the their introduced counterpart rasmussen and taylor 2009 the art inhabits cold river waters from 2nd to 4th order streams between 900 and 1500 m above sea level in spring the art spawns in streams with fine gravel free of silts and clays and moderate flow rates and over winter they inhabit streams with large deep pools the art spawns annually but the time varies with elevation at high elevations spawning begins in late june and fry emerge as late as september whereas in low elevations spawning usually occurs between late april and may e g sterling 1993 in 2014 the art was designated as endangered by the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada cosewic cosewic 2014 and currently it is considered as a species at risk by the alberta athabasca rainbow trout recovery team caskenette and koops 2018 data on art habitat occupancy from fwmis 2018 show a decrease of the fish s occupancy in lowland reaches likely due to warmer water temperatures cosewic 2014 indicated that climate change will affect between 31 and 70 of the art habitat in the next 10 years therefore the athabasca rainbow trout was selected as the study species because 1 of their susceptibility to shifting species distributions and competition with non native species 2 they are a cold water specialist and may experience habitat loss as water warms and 3 spawning activities may be susceptible to summer floods although the effects of climate change on the hydrology of the athabasca river basin has been studied e g eum et al 2017 dibike et al 2018 du et al 2019 the linkage between changes in streamflow water temperature and fish habitat suitability remains unknown the aim of this research is to investigate the effects of climate change on stream flow and water temperature and their consequences on the art habitat here we integrate a physically based semi distributed hydrological model and a 1d stream water temperature model forced by climate change scenarios to investigate changes in river flow and water temperature simulated changes in streamflow and water temperature are used to predict changes of habitat suitability for the art spatial and temporal changes of the art habitat with respect to the base line period are presented this research will contribute to a general understanding of the effects of climate change on freshwater fish habitat in north america and can support decision making to mitigate the effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems and improve adaptive management approaches 2 methods 2 1 basin description flowing from the rocky mountain glaciers of jasper national park to lake athabasca in wood buffalo national park the athabasca river is the longest river in the province of alberta canada the river drains an area of 150 000 km2 see fig 1 and is the largest unregulated river system in the province the athabasca river passes the towns of jasper hinton town of athabasca and fort mcmurray and is a vital hydro system for the population in these towns the basin area is mostly covered by forest 78 and agriculture land 9 2 in terms of hydrology the annual average precipitation in the basin varies from 300 mm in the low lands to 1000 mm in the rocky mountains and the athabasca river discharges annually 2 1 109 m3 at fort mcmurray station the annual average air temperature oscillates between 1 8 c in the upper basin and 3 5 c in the lower basin whereas the average water temperature oscillate between 1 0 c in winter and 36 0 c in summer according to measurements from environment and climate change canada dibike et al 2018 du et al 2019 because of its natural beauty and significance for river recreation the athabasca river section within jasper national park is designated as a canadian heritage river goc 2011 the river is important in sustaining aquatic habitat with its rapids re aerating the water in winter and its various reaches serving at seasonal habitat 2 2 modelling framework we coupled fig a 10 a semi distributed physically based land surface hydrological modelling system mesh pietroniro et al 2007 see section a 1 to the river basin model rbm a mechanistic one dimensional stream temperature model yearsley 2012 see section a 2 to first simulate hydrological processes and then stream water temperature along the athabasca river system our model coupling approach requires running both mesh and rbm models independently with data from mesh being transferred to rbm mesh and rbm were both set up on the same orthogonal grid with a spatial resolution of 0 1250 10 10 km resulting in 1326 grid cells and channels that comprehend the athabasca river and tributaries firstly mesh was run at a 3 h time step to simulate streamflow water depth width and averaged water velocity in every channel these hydrological and hydraulic variables in a second step were aggregated and introduced into rbm at daily time steps similarly to mesh rbm requires meteorological variables at daily time steps however because meteorological observations are rarely discretized at the resolution of each segment node meteorological data were interpolated onto the river network additionally river network topology information necessary for computations were also introduced into rbm finally rbm was run at daily time steps to compute water depth averaged temperatures at every channel of the stream network 2 3 mesh calibration and validation procedure though mesh was run at a 3 hour time step output streamflow s were generated for a daily time step for comparison and analysis against flows recorded at gauging station athabasca river below mcmurray 07da001 see fig 1 for the station location the meteorological forcing data from 1983 to 2000 produced by the canadian regional climate model crcm caya and laprise 1999 and the reanalysis model ncep doe amip ii reanalysis ncep kanamitsu et al 2002 crcm ncep were used in model calibration and validation see table 1 four land cover parameters and four hydraulic parameters representing exchange of energy and water balance between land surface and atmosphere and four parameters from flow routing were calibrated see tables 2 and 3 the model was first calibrated for the 1992 2000 period where the year 1992 was considered a spin up period then the model was validated for 9 years from 1983 to 1991 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse see eq b 1 was estimated to evaluate the model performance since nse leads to an overestimation of the model performance during peak flows and an underestimation during low flow condition the logarithm of the nse log ns was estimated in order to evaluate the model integrally 2 4 rbm validation procedure stream water temperature data is very limited in the catchment and most water temperature data has been only recorded during the last two decades to implement rbm mesh was firstly calibrated and validated during the 01 january 2002 to 31 december 2012 period using precipitation data obtained from the canadian precipitation analysis capa database which is operationally run by the canadian meteorological centre cmc the cmc produces accumulated precipitation for 6 h and 12 h time intervals over all of north america on a 10 km 10 km grid fortin et al 2015 the rest of the gridded meteorological forcing data were obtained from the global environmental multiscale model gem which is an integrated forecasting and data assimilation system developed by environment canada côté et al 1998 available at spatial and temporal resolutions of 15 km and 1 h respectively a detailed description of mesh model calibration and validation for the this period is described in morales marin et al 2019 rbm was forced using the same meteorological forcing datasets for the 01 january 2002 to 31 december 2012 period and the hydrological variables needed for rbm were estimated using mesh see table 1 to validate rbm the daily water temperature simulations were compared to instantaneous water temperature observations unevenly obtained from alberta environment and parks http aep alberta ca water reports data surface water quality data at three different stations located on the athabasca river see fig 1 for station locations these water temperature observations are instantaneous measurements taken approximately between 0 m and 1 m below the water surface around mid day during the validation processes the coefficients of the rbm boundary conditions defined by the non linear water temperature regression model described by mohseni et al 1998 see eq a 6 were adjusted for highland and lowland headwater streams morales marin et al 2019 2 5 climate change scenarios hydrological and water temperature simulations were performed using the mesh rbm modelling system forced by gridded meteorological data retrieved from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2009 2012 narccap consists of simulations from six regional climate models over consistent periods 1971 2000 and 2041 2070 and spatial domains of equal resolution 50 km weller et al 2013 it uses the a2 emission scenario since it was one of the marker scenarios developed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change included in the special report on emission scenarios sres nakicenovic et al 2000 a2 is at the higher end of the emission scenarios documented in sres but not the highest and it is the most relevant based on the impact and adaptation view narccap 2016 projections of meteorological forcing data at the temporal and spatial resolution required by mesh rbm are difficult to obtain narccap data were selected due to their higher temporal resolution 3 hourly which is essential for mesh as it runs at 30 min time steps unlike many hydrological models mesh performs both water and energy balances and requires seven meteorological forcing files i e precipitation humidity wind pressure temperature incoming longwave radiation and shortwave radiation which are all available from narccap narccap has different suites of regional climate models rcms each driven by two different atmosphere ocean general circulation models gcms and one reanalysis model ncep doe amip ii reanalysis ncep a retrospective model of the atmosphere based on observed data kanamitsu et al 2002 among available rcms the canadian regional climate model crcm caya and laprise 1999 driven by the community climate system model ccsm and the third generation coupled climate model cgcm3 were chosen for this study to simulate future conditions mearns et al 2012 compared climate change scenarios projected using regional climate models rcms forced by different global climate models gcm for north america the authors found that crcm performed reasonably well in estimating temperature and precipitation mearns et al 2012 also reported that among other rcms crcm has the lowest total rmse for the full domain in all of the seasons the comparison of average daily air temperature between different rcms gcms for the 2041 2070 period for fort mcmurray s meteorological station by rokaya 2018 also revealed that crcm ccsm and crcm cgcm3 are comparatively closer to the median of the multi model ensemble crcm ccsm and crcm cgcm3 have also been previously applied by rokaya et al in press to successfully generate future flows for the athabasca river basin fig 2 conceptualises the modelling framework to predict streamflow and water temperature using the mesh rbm modelling system forced by climate change scenarios and their implementation to asses the impact on art water tolerances and habitat table 1 summarizes the data sets used to calibrate and validate the models and to predict future scenarios of streamflow and water temperature 2 6 streamflow and water temperature indexes gridded daily streamflows and water temperatures were estimated for the 1971 2000 base line period using the crcm ncep data set and for the two a2 sres scenarios crcm ccsm and crcm cgcm3 for the period 2041 2070 in order to analyse the impact of climate change on streamflow and water temperature the following ecologically relevant indices e g richter et al 1996 eaton and scheller 1996 gibson et al 2005 were analysed mean streamflow q mean and mean water temperature tw mean e g xenopoulos et al 2005 döll and zhang 2010 95th percentile daily flow q high represents high flows and water temperature exceeding 5 of the time tw high represents high water temperatures 10th percentile daily flow q low represent low flows the water temperature exceeded 90 of the time tw low represents low water temperatures seasonal amplitude of streamflow δq a and water temperature δtw a represented as the difference between annual 30 day average minimum and maximum values and the timing of 30 day average maximum streamflow percent changes of the predicted stremflow and water temperature indices were calculated with respect to the indices calculated for the base line period 2 7 fish tolerances to water temperature different tolerances of rainbow trout to water temperature are analysed here water temperature preferences for art vary with life stage for example adult art prefer water temperatures between 7 and 18 c whereas fry and juvenile prefer temperatures between 10 and 15 c spawning typically occurs when water temperatures are between 7 and 10 c adult mortality increases at temperatures above 22 c whereas embryos mortality is likely if incubation temperatures fall below 3 c or rise above 18 5 c table 4 scott and crossman 1979 aartrt 2014 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of mesh mesh was calibrated between 1992 and 2000 and validated during the 1983 1991 period using crcm ncep data base for both periods an acceptable agreement between simulated and observed flows see fig 3 was obtained multiple statistical metrics of model accuracy were calculated to asses the model performance see section b nse 0 70 log nse 0 72 r 2 0 72 and pbias 10 were achieved for the calibration years whereas for the validation years nse 0 62 log nse 0 64 r 2 0 67 and pbias 10 were obtained slight discrepancies between observed and simulated flows during the hydrograph falling limbs and the low flow periods which can be related to the insufficient complexity of the baseflow algorithms in mesh 3 2 changes in streamflow indexes a decline of mean streamflows q mean are expected to occur according to both climate change scenarios see fig 4 a larger decreases of q mean are predicted according to crcm ccsm across the basin and maximum decreases occur in the northern and western areas and near the rocky mountains foothills were q mean reduces by more than 60 similarly q mean predictions with crcm cgcm3 indicate flow reductions of more than 40 in the south western areas of the basin but slight flow increases of 2 in the rocky mountains and in the north eastern areas of the basin high streamflows q high and the seasonal streamflow amplitude δq a coincide with the patterns of changes in q mean see fig 4b and d for both scenarios it is expected that large reductions in high flow and seasonal flow amplitude of more than 40 will occur in the western areas of the basin but important increases of these two magnitudes of around 50 are predicted for the north eastern areas and in some headwater subbasins in the rocky mountains low flows fig 4c are expected to decrease by more than 60 across the basin except in some areas toward the east and the west where reductions are around 20 overall climate change will trigger reductions in streamflow particularly toward the western areas of the basin but some increases of high flow toward the east and earlier onset of high flow in the north of the basin are also expected fig 4e 3 3 changes of water temperature large changes of the annual average water temperature regime are expected in the future particularly during the river s ice free months from march to october fig 5 the highest percentage tw increases of 25 predicted by crcm ccsm is expected during april also large increases of tw around 10 are also expected between may and july where increases can be greater than 2 c in contrast slight reductions of 5 1 c in annual average tw are expected during september and october whereas changes in winter temperatures are insignificant when the river is frozen changes of water temperature indices are expected to occur according to the climate change scenarios fig 6 mean water temperatures are expected to increase across the basin and higher increases are predicted for the western and eastern areas of the basin where tw mean rises between 0 2 c and 1 0 c can occur according primarily to crcm ccsm in contrast slight reductions of 0 23 c are noted in some headwater streams in the rocky mountains and in the northern region of the basin similar patterns were noted for high water temperatures and seasonal water temperature amplitudes tw high could increase between 0 5 c and 3 0 c in large areas along the western and the eastern portions of the basin and δtw a may increase substantially toward the north eastern areas by more than 2 c and decrease by 0 5 c in the southern areas the rise in low water temperatures is quite uniform and equal to 0 1 c in the basin except for some streams in the rocky mountains where small decreases of 0 1 c are predicted 3 4 frequency analysis and changes of fish tolerance to water temperatures the frequency distributions of seasonal average water temperature are predicted to change in the future fig 7 in general we observe that in spring the water temperature mean and the standard deviation will increase slightly from 1 38 to 1 41 c and from 0 48 to 0 51 c respectively in contrast a decrease of the mean and an increase of the standard deviation are noted for water temperature in the fall in summer large increases in the water temperature mean from 12 3 c to 14 7 c particularly for crcm ccsm scenario and higher standard deviation from 0 49 to 0 55 are expected in the future these changes in the frequency distributions will affect the probability of occurrence of art tolerant water temperature ranges table 4 using the probability density and cumulative distribution functions given in fig 7 we calculated the probability of occurrence of the water temperature ranges see table 5 and obtained values for tw prf tw spa tw frj which increase slightly in spring but decrease in summer and fall in contrast whereas frequency decreases of tw tha and tw the are expected in spring slight increases of these tw ranges are expected during summer and fall the average number of days per year in which daily water temperature is within the range of thermal tolerance of art are shown in fig 8 reductions of up to 40 days in the frequency of tw prf and tw frj particularly along the main reaches and across the centre region are expected in the basin however increases of over 20 days in the frequency of tw prf and tw frj are expected in headwater streams located at the rocky mountains the frequency of tw spa declines across the basin and greater reductions of 15 days occur toward the western areas whereas at the central and eastern areas of the basin the frequency declines by 5 days increases in the frequency of tw spa occur in some headwater streams located at the rocky mountains and across central and north eastern areas of the basin water temperatures in the range of tw tha do not occur very often in the basin so that they change very little across the basin with the exception of some north eastern reaches and main steam reaches where its frequency increase by 5 days slight decreases in frequency of tw tha are noted in tributaries located in the north and in the south of the basin similarly the frequency of tw the will increase by more than 15 days in reaches located in the rocky mountains the main stem river network and in reaches located in the south and central areas of the basin decreases in tw the frequency by 5 days are expected on the western and north eastern areas of the basin 3 5 frequency changes of fish tolerances to water temperatures changes in the frequency of water temperature within the range of art tolerances were analysed with respect to latitude longitude and altitude fig 9 changes of tw prf tw spa and tw frj frequency are very similar with respect to latitude and longitude in spring the frequency of tw prf tw spa and tw frj increased northward and eastward with a maximum between 5 and 10 days in the north eastern areas in contrast whereas a 5 days increase in tw the frequency is observed in the south western areas decreases of 10 days in tw the frequency is noted in the central and north eastern areas large changes in the frequency of tw tolerances occur in summer the frequency of tw prf and tw frj are expected to increase by 15 days in the south western areas however large decreases in frequency of up to 20 days are expected in central and north eastern areas similarly in summer decreases in tw spa frequency are going to be greater in the south western areas than in the north eastern areas in contrast whereas a 5 day decrease in tw the frequency is expected in the south western areas maximum increases of about 15 days will occur in central and north eastern areas in fall whereas uniform decreases between 2 and 8 days in tw prf tw spa and tw frj frequencies is expected 5 days uniform increases of tw the frequency are predicted with respect to latitude and longitude only slight increases of tw tha frequency in summer were predicted toward the north eastern areas changes in frequency of water temperatures within art tolerances with respect to basin altitude were analysed in spring changes in tw prf tw spa and tw frj frequency are small with a slight tendency to decrease when altitude increases however decreases in tw the frequency is expected in low lands but for mid and high lands an increase in frequency is expected in spring in summer decreases of 5 days in tw prf and tw frj frequency will occur in the low lands but increases of 10 days will occur in the high lands near the rocky mountains in contrast whereas a reduction of tw spa frequency is expected in low and even more in mid lands increases in frequency are expected in high lands located above 2500 m in summer increases in tw the frequency is expected in the low lands but slight decreases in the mid and high lands slight decreases in tw prf tw spa and tw frj frequency is expected in fall with higher changes in the mid and high lands in contrast tw the frequency increases linearly from low to high altitudes where it increases of five days no meaningful changes of tw tha frequency were detected at any altitude 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on streamflow and fish habitat and ecosystems global climate change is a major concern to freshwater fisheries in canada with altered flow and temperature regimes anticipated to impact fish physiology distribution and survival poesch et al 2016 cold water species with limited distribution such as the art may be particularly susceptible to climate change altered flows can have multiple impacts on fish resulting from changes to physical habitat habitat access prey availability behaviour community composition energy expenditure and population dynamics rytwinski et al 2017 peak discharge and q mean are predicted to decrease between 40 and 60 respectively in the western portion of the arb peak flows are critical to creating and maintaining channel features i e riffle pool run sequences that fish depend on for habitat foraging and carrying out their life cycle decreases of this magnitude may compromise the formation maintenance of habitat features necessary to support the art e g rasmussen and taylor 2009 aartrt 2014 the potential effects of flow alterations on fish productivity are not well understood because of uncertainties regarding flow fish productivity relationships rytwinski et al 2017 art spawn from late may to early june during the ascending limp of flow hydrographs at the crest sterling 1993 cosewic 2014 reductions in the frequency and magnitude of peak flows may delay preparedness for spawning due to the lack of cue provision e g richter et al 1996 poff and zimmerman 2010 our predictions of flow decreases in most of the basin means that flow velocities and water depths may render art habitat as suboptimal e g papadaki et al 2016 in order to cope with low flows during spawning period redds may have to be relocated toward the thalweg of the channel putting them at risk of becoming scoured during the summer flow surge peak flows are predicted to increase in the north eastern areas of the arb greater spring flows may reduce egg to fry survival through the scouring of redds crushing eggs through bed gravel mobilization or suffocating eggs through sediment deposition e g montgomery et al 1996 devries 1997 increases in high flows also reduce slow water habitats displacing fry and juveniles e g latterell et al 1998 mantua et al 2010 however the distribution of art is concentrated to the western headwaters of the arb where greater flows are not predicted to occur thus it is likely art will not be impacted minimum flows are predicted to decrease between 20 and 60 across the basin with the greatest reductions in the west other studies have predicted similar reductions in flow for the arb 21 4 and 41 reductions in mean maximum and minimum annual flow respectively kerkhoven and gan 2011 decreases in snow cover depth and duration lack of summer precipitation and increases air temperature are the main drivers of these changes e g eum et al 2017 art overwinter in deep pools that gradually lose 75 of their volume over the winter sterling and cox 2013 although minimum flow is predicted to decrease winter flows are predicted to increase and may enhance overwintering conditions for art 4 2 impact of climate change on water temperature and fish habitat and ecosystems our modeling predicts stream water temperature may increase during the ice free season by as much as 2 5 c by the second half of the 21st century our predictions align with those of a previous study where williams et al 2015 predicted increases of 2 4 c in stream water temperature by mid century in western canada the magnitude of these changes varies across the basin with the greatest increases in western areas of the arb near the foothills of the rocky mountains and in the eastern and central areas the greater increases in water temperature for these areas are likely driven by greater local increases in air temperature and earlier snowmelts e g schindler and donahue 2006 eum et al 2017 art habitat is constricted to the cold unproductive headwaters in the western portion of the arb cosewic 2014 the predicted increases in water temperature in the foothills region of the arb are likely to constrict art further upstream into the headwaters vacating the foothills may create opportunity for invasion by other competing species such as brook trout and non native rainbow trout that may be more tolerant to the changing conditions rasmussen and taylor 2009 cosewic 2014 for example wenger et al 2011 modeled the effects of increasing water temperature under the 2080s a1b emissions scenario and forecasted a mean 47 decline in total suitable habitat for all trout species on a finer scale habitat for cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarkii brook trout salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout salmo trutta was predicted to decline by 58 77 and 48 respectively rainbow trout experienced the least habitat loss at 33 as greater winter flows offset negative impacts of increases in temperature wenger et al 2011 our models similarly predict greater winter flows which likely will benefit the non native rainbow trout understanding interspecific responses to climate change and alterations to interspecific interactions i e shifts in competitive dominance should be a focus of future modeling to fully understand climate change impacts the contraction of habitat also concentrates the art population a reduction in their area of occupancy increases their susceptibility to a population collapse if a catastrophic event was to occur e g chemical spill landslide severe prolonged drought greater densities of fish also increase their susceptibility to disease and parasite transmission e g williams et al 2015 our model predicts spring habitat conditions will generally improve as the frequency of favourable temperatures for incubation and growth increase while the probability of experiencing lethal temperatures decreases table 5 the forecast for summer conditions is less clear as the probability of experiencing favorable optimal for growth and lethal for incubation temperatures varies depending on the model crcm ccsm versus crcm cgcm3 on a finer scale the probability of experiencing favorable versus sub optimal or lethal conditions varies spatially fig 8 and art may seek refuge in other reaches of the arb when conditions are unfavourable however the ability of art to migrate to areas with more favorable conditions would likely be limited by competition from non indigenous species rasmussen and taylor 2009 and size limited mobility i e fry would have limited ability to migrate but are most susceptible to deteriorating conditions radinger and wolter 2014 waterfalls and anthropogenic barriers cosewic 2014 5 conclusions this paper to the best of our knowledge presented the first research to estimate the effects of stream flow and water temperature changes in the context of climate change on fish habitat in the athabasca river catchment our modeling approach integrates a physically based semi distributed hydrological model and a 1d stream water temperature model forced by climate change scenarios model predictions can support decision making to mitigate the effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems the main conclusions of this research are predictions of flow decreases in most of the catchment will reduce flow velocities and water depths causing current art habitat to be suboptimal predicted increases of high flows in some north eastern areas may reduce egg to fry survival rates either by scouring redds and crushing eggs after bed gravel mobilization or suffocating eggs through sediment deposition increases in winter flow may enhance overwintering habitat for art predicted increases in water temperature will result in habitat contraction concentrating art in the upper headwater of the arb contraction of art habitat may open niches for non native trout species to colonize new areas and limit the ability of art to utilize that habitat when conditions are favorable art habitat can potentially be reduced as the frequency of occurrence of life threatening and lethal water temperatures tend to increase particularly in summer appendix a description of mesh and rbm models a 1 mesh model the modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology mesh model is the hydrology land surface scheme developed and maintained by environment and climate change canada pietroniro et al 2007 mesh has been successfully implemented in multiple large scale cold region catchments e g davison et al 2006 2016 mekonnen et al 2014 yassin et al 2017 mesh couples the canadian land surface scheme class model verseghy et al 1993 with the hydrological routing model watflood kouwen 1988 class is a physically based model that simulates the vertical exchanges and lateral fluxes of energy and water for vegetation soil and snow dornes et al 2008a the soil moisture content and its vertical movement in the soil layers is calculated by applying an explicit finite difference scheme to solve richards equation a 1 θ t z k θ ϕ θ z where z is the vertical coordinate positive downward t is the time θ f z t is the volumetric soil moisture content ϕ θ is the empirical

watflood is a semi distributed model that uses mass conservation a 2 ds dt i t q t where s is the storage of water i t is the water inputs and q t is the water outputs and manning s equation a 3 q 1 n

hydrological routing across grid cells dependent on inflow outflow and water stored in depressions soulis et al 2000 comprehensive physically based hydrological models such as mesh require a large number of parameters and most of them employ the grouped response unit gru approach which is capable of handling several land covers in a catchment efficiently and with less computational expense gru combines areas of similar land cover types so that a grid cell represents a small number of specific grus or land cover tiles kouwen et al 1993 this approach allows the calibration of a set of parameters for each land cover type in the study area but the simulation does not account for sub grid land cover spatial distribution pohl et al 2005 for example two grid cells in mesh with the same precipitation temperature and percentage of different land covers produce the same amount of runoff regardless of how the land covers are distributed within the cells pietroniro et al 2007 additionally the class model can be run on each tile independently to account for variability in land cover within a grid and an aggregation step is performed at the end to calculate the total change in fluxes through the tile connector dornes et al 2008b the hydrological processes represented in mesh consist of three components i vertical exchange of water between soil plants and atmosphere

25019,the biosphere is self organized into a hierarchy of energy transformations more dilute forms of energy e g solar energy are concentrated in biological structures and through socioeconomic transformation processes forming energy outputs that are able to perform higher quality work to assess the hierarchy level of different forms of energy in the biosphere over 30 years howard t odum introduced the concept of transformity i e the amount of available energy of the same kind usually solar energy needed to obtain a specific output of available energy of another kind transformities represent energy quality and have been calculated for a broad set of energy forms and products both natural and anthropic in this paper we report on this broad literature illustrating how the energy

hierarchy law 1 overview forty years after howard t odum s definition of the concept of energy quality odum 1976 a critical mass of empirical evidence has been reached allowing us to provide a first picture of the energy quality hierarchy of the biosphere the idea of self organization i e the spontaneous emergence of ordered structures from interactions among initially disordered parts permeates

concentrated ordered ones e g chemical energy embodied in biological structures major insights on how self organization works have been put forward by ecologists studying ecological food webs howard t odum 1924 2002 extended the idea of an ordered series of energy transformations in natural systems or the universal energy hierarchy to the whole biosphere including humans and information one of the main contributions of h t odum his students and colleagues was the development of the energy quality concept as the descriptor of the hierarchical level of each form of energy throughout the biosphere odum 1983 thirty years after the publication of h t odum s seminal paper on self organization transformity and information in science odum 1988 and the award of the crawford prize of the royal swedish academy of science for his research on nature s dynamics empirical evidence bearing on h t odum s ideas has been mounting making it possible to test his assumptions on how energy flows are structured according to a hierarchy of energy quality in order to describe energy quality h t odum proposed a measure transformity which determines the level or position of each form of matter energy or information in the universal hierarchy of energy quality the transformity is defined as the available energy of one type usually solar energy that is necessary to obtain one unit of energy of another type precisely transformities represent the amount of solar energy directly and indirectly used up expressed as solar emjoules or sej through the energy transformation chain to obtain a unit of a product of higher available energy and hierarchical level according to the principles of thermodynamics at each step along the energy transformation chain in the biosphere a significant amount of available energy is lost or degraded i e energy availability decreases over subsequent transformations at the same time the energy quality of the remaining available energy increases if the percent use of the available energy transferred at each step in the energy transformation chain remains constant then the chain of processes should form a line of the same slope when the whole data set is considered of course each specific transformation chain may have a different average efficiency h t odum s ideas to understand self organization were presented in his book environmental accounting emergy and environmental decision making odum 1996 and since then used in thousands of scientific papers including the calculation of hundreds of transformities referring to a broad set of energy types from natural and anthropic production systems transformities have been calculated to represent energy transformations at many scales of the biosphere from dna abel 2013 to products of industrial processes almeida et al 2018 to global information flows within the internet di salvo et al 2017 2 examining three decades of empirical evidence we reviewed this broad variety of empirical exercises table s1 in order to model a hierarchy of energy types based on the amount of direct and indirect solar energy required to obtain them according to h t odum this relationship should be logarithmically linear relating decreasing energy quantities and increasing energy qualities odum 1996 the energy values considered in this work are representative of the energy flow available in the biosphere for each transformation process in a year the overall flow throughout the biosphere of each energy type has been retrieved by and elaborated from a list of different sources as described in detail in the supplementary material due to data availability transformities have been grouped as follows global renewable resources such as earth cycle heat flow or evaporation from the oceans see table s2 in the supplementary materials natural resource flows see table s2 fossil fuels surface and ground water agriculture biofuels electricity drinking water chemical and materials industry livestock and fish agricultural and livestock industry people subsistence people education information geological information cultural and information genetic following odum 1983 1996 2007 odum and odum 2001 these groups have been related to each other fig 1 depicting how different transformation processes might be linked together through energy flows fig 1 is one representation of the biosphere organized into hierarchical levels with the environmental sources at the base going from the left to the right end of fig 1 each previous transformation process makes available a certain amount of energy for the subsequent transformation step at the same time reinforcing feedbacks amplify the energy available in previous transformations 3 procedure to group the transformities all transformities were updated to the 12 0e 24 sej yr baseline employing the harmonic average one value was determined for each product element the harmonic mean was used to represent the values of items that have been calculated more than once e g ethanol which to a certain extent intensified the presence of outliers thus due to the fact that the harmonic mean is not influenced as much by discrepant values and tends to minimize values it was more adequate to represent the repeated items the median value of the previous transformities was adopted to represent the group the median represents the value in the middle of the data set when n is odd or the arithmetic mean of the values in the n 2 and n 2 1 positions when the data set is even the median divides the data set into two halves of identical areas and in general extreme values both upper and lower do not affect the median value it is considered the most robust measure since the insertion of new values will hardly cause changes in results the distribution of the transformities calculated during the last 30 years table s1 has been investigated and outliers have been identified within each group with the use of boxplots the boxplot is a box diagram constructed using the references of minimum and maximum values first and third quartile median and outliers of the database it is used to study the statistical measures of the data set the center part of the chart contains the values that are between the first quartile and the third quartile the lower and upper stems extend respectively from the first quartile to the lower limit and from the third quartile to the upper limit all values lower than the first quartile value 1 5 interquartile range value and greater than the third quartile value 1 5 interquartile range value are considered outliers the outliers were not considered abnormal since transformities were calculated by several authors at different times and there was no criterion to single them out in fig 2 transformities are ordered from lower to higher values for each group according to their median values this analysis shows how different groups of natural and anthropic transformation processes are ordered in an energy quality hierarchy as successive transformations take place throughout the energy quality hierarchy the amount of available energy decreases and the quality transformity of the remaining available energy increases all the economic transformation processes identified in fig 1 ultimately depend on natural resources including water and fossil fuels human society also depends on economic processes that generate the most concentrated ordered forms of available energy such as information i e both cultural and genetic which is able to perform the highest quality work by considering the median values of the different groups of transformation processes fig 2 the inversely proportional values of available energies and transformities can be presented in a simple linear regression graph p 0 001 r2 65 r 0 81 at the geobiosphere scale fig 3 corroborating h t odum s intuition when the whole data set is considered each specific transformation chain may have different average efficiencies as shown by the two lines in fig 3 one for ecosystem type systems solid line and one for technological systems dashed line which practically coincides with the line that covers the whole dataset results shown in fig 3 could have several implications for the understanding of earth dynamics the linear logarithmic relationship hypothesized by odum and corroborated in this present work allows discussing at least two extreme cases on one hand when the logarithm of transformity tends towards zero the logarithm of energy tends to 23 8 s e m 0 81 p 0 05 where s e m the standard error of the mean and gives an idea of its accuracy this represents the sum of the overall independent energy inputs to the biosphere and confirms what has been already calculated in scientific literature brown et al 2016 on the other hand when the logarithm of energy tends to zero the logarithm of transformity tends to its maximum ideal value of 39 5 interception of x axis this ideal value sets the boundary for the highest achievable process of energy concentration or ordering for the biosphere including human driven transformation processes it also represents the maximum possible amount of solar energy embodied in 1 j of information the second relevant information provided by fig 3 is the definition of a constant mean value of the marginal relation between energy quality and energy quantity for the geobiosphere including human driven transformation processes operationally in order to increase one order of magnitude of energy quality around 75 of the energy quantity energy flow becomes unavailable to do work in the process eq 1 1 e j e i t r i t r j n where ei and ej represent the energy quantity of the systems i and j tri and trj the corresponding transformities and n the exponent 0 6036 for the universal diagram fig 3 the fraction of the available energy lost is lower than what is generally observed through subsequent steps over an ecosystem s trophic levels which is around 90 by lindeman s 10 law lindeman 1942 in fact the lindeman s law is only observed when the systems near the interface with nature are considered the exponent n 0 9914 from eq 1 for the series 1 solar energy 2 global renewable sources 3 natural resources 4 fossil fuels 5 surface and ground water 6 biofuels 7 agriculture this implies that highly efficient human processes are overrepresented in the overall relation investigated here which is influenced to some extent by the current technological levels of different production processes human processes are designed to reduce costs such as in lean production and are highly specialized this specialization might lead to a higher efficiency of energy transfer society is always searching for more efficient outcomes and this reduces diversity and redundancy which are sought in natural systems as a means for maximizing power under variable emergy signatures and increases efficiency through orienting and simplifying systems biggs et al 2012 however the exact reason is still unknown and requires further investigation starting from the relationship represented in fig 3 it is possible to obtain the amount of solar energy needed to produce one unit of a product a measure of its hierarchical energy quality level or alternatively the amount of energy flowing through the biosphere in a particular process can be determined in order to do so after adjusting for residuals and assessing the predictive power of the linear relationship found see supplementary material we propose two prediction graphs and working tables fig 4 s3 with reference values for energy flows and relative transformities and vice versa with 95 confidence intervals there are large error bars on most of these numbers and predictions are not possible just using this figure different physical processes trace out different lines of energy hierarchy and the universal diagram may represent a useful advance but it still requires more specific information fig 3 also provides an overall picture of transformities so far calculated in the literature and it identifies the gaps to be covered by future research a relatively small amount of data is available for specific natural resources and ecological processes as well as regarding the energy required to produce different kinds of information table s1 this study allowed a first graphical representation of the hierarchical organization of the biosphere in terms of energy quality that could be further refined by focusing research where data is lacking 4 potential implications the results of this study confirm the log log linear relationship between energy quantity annual energy flow and energy quality as described by h t odum in 1988 log log relationships are frequently known as the signature for the operation of a power law andriani and mckelvey 2009 which has been used to represent complex aspects of how individuals organizations economies and societies operate in nature trees rivers mountains clouds coastlines and earthquakes show the operation of power laws jiang 2015 formulated as a fundamental law in various disciplines from physics to linguistics complex systems evolved in non linear manners and many of them tend to be self similar across levels i e they display fractal behavior and similar dynamics drive order creation behavior at multiple levels similarly scaling laws representing system dynamics appear at many orders of magnitude andriani and mckelvey 2009 west et al 1997 casti 1994 power laws can also describe fractals suggesting a proportional relationship between two correlated measures odum s hierarchical scaling based on the structure of energy cascades is a clear analogy with fractal structure both regular fractals and the geobiosphere hierarchy have the same scaling process and self similar patterns chen 2017 giannetti et al 2012 the main implications of this study are 1 theoretically achievable and existing lower and higher boundaries of energy quality levels in the geobiosphere can be defined 2 a first order estimate of the amount of energy lost in each subsequent transformation step in the geobiosphere was made 3 two working tables that can be used by researchers interested in self organization to test the relationship between energy quality and quantity were constructed allowing prediction of one as a function of the other fig 4 s3 4 and finally gaps in the transformity values found in the scientific literature were identified which require further research efforts to be
