2525,leaf stomata play a central role in mediating the exchange of water vapor and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the terrestrial ecosystems stomatal response to the environment presumably optimizes the trade off between carbon uptake and water loss recently developed optimization models show their remarkable success in capturing empirical patterns of stomata however solutions of these models with different mathematical details should vary for the same environments indicating that stomatal strategies implied in these models may differ and require further investigation the present study proposed a novel stomatal optimization model assuming that stomatal regulation aims to achieve a water carbon balance shaped by a hydraulic based weight factor hbw model in particular we introduce the balancing point bp for analyzing the behavioral difference between models we tested the hbw model based on set scenarios and leaf level gas exchange data and compared it with two existing models results show that these models differ mainly in stomatal sensitivity to soil moisture bp characteristics reveal the behavioral difference between models and only the hbw model which is more sensitive to soil moisture captures the actual response patterns of bp to water stress well this work emphasizes the differences in stomatal strategies among different optimization models and provides an alternative modeling approach which offers a more conservative stomatal strategy that can stand as a useful comparison with existing models keywords optimization model stomatal conductance stomatal strategy drought data availability the data used to test the theory in this study are obtained from anderegg et al 2018 https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 6066449 1 introduction vegetation is a key part of the global water carbon cycle system plant transpiration contributes 64 of terrestrial evapotranspiration good et al 2015 and photosynthesis accounts for 53 of global co 2 uptake friedlingstein et al 2022 both transpiration and photosynthesis are directly regulated by stomatal conductance which dynamically responses to environmental changes such as solar radiation shimazaki et al 2007 atmospheric co 2 concentration ainsworth rogers 2007 temperature and humidity lawson blatt 2014 and soil moisture munemasa et al 2015 stomatal responses to these environmental variables affect the prediction of evapotranspiration and ecosystem productivity and remain a dominant source of uncertainty in feedbacks between vegetation and climate berry et al 2010 jasechko et al 2013 trugman et al 2018 this uncertainty emphasizes the importance of accurately modeling leaf stomatal conductance the beneficial co 2 uptake through stomata for photosynthesis a is accompanied by the loss of water to the atmosphere i e transpiration e this inevitable loss of transpiration must ultimately be balanced by the supply of liquid water to the leaves brodribb 2009 if plants regulate stomatal conductance g s for carbon gain alone regardless of water loss then greater g s is better but obviously doing so will lead to excessive water loss through transpiration leading to a series of consequences such as rapid depletion of soil water the decline of water potential in the hydraulic continuum xylem cavitation and even mortality drake et al 2017 martin stpaul et al 2017 dewar et al 2018 therefore plants face a fundamental water carbon trade off in regulating stomata basic optimization theory suggests that stomatal regulation aims to maximize the difference between the gain and risk of stomata opening i e maximizing g a i n r i s k wang et al 2020 once the gain and risk can be calculated as functions of stomatal conductance the optimal g s that maximizes the difference can be mathematically determined this allows the optimization approach to predict how plant gas exchange responds to environmental changes the optimization approach not only overcomes the shortcoming of the empirical method e g jarvis slatyer 1970 ball et al 1987 that is the lack of theoretical explanation but also avoids the shortcomings of more mechanistic models e g buckley et al 2003 buckley 2005 that is relying on many parameters and being difficult to be applied broadly across species and environments dewar et al 2009 buckley et al 2012 buckley 2017 a classic optimization theory proposed by cowan and farquhar 1977 more than 40 years ago takes soil water depletion as the risk of stomata opening and hypothesizes that plants regulate stomata to maximize the photosynthetic gain i e cumulative a for a given amount of water i e cumulative e during a given period d t mathematically this hypothesis can be expressed as maximizing the function a λ e over d t arneth et al 2002 katul et al 2009 katul et al 2010 where the lagrangian multiplier λ can be interpreted as the marginal carbon cost of water within the cowan farquhar framework the optimal g s depends on the value of λ a larger λ means the cost of water use increases so stomatal regulation is more inclined to reduce transpiration than increase carbon gain and therefore behaves more conservatively lin et al 2015 many efforts have been made to elaborate on the cowan farquhar model which has much empirical support medlyn et al 2011 manzoni et al 2011 manzoni et al 2013 however a perpetual challenge for the cowan farquhar model is how to predict the response of λ to a variety of fluctuating environmental variables and different plant traits as λ has been found to vary with species environment and time manzoni et al 2011 lin et al 2015 buckley et al 2017 another recently proposed and developed optimization theory wolf et al 2016 sperry et al 2017 hypothesizes that plants regulate stomata to maximize the instantaneous carbon gain a minus the risk θ of vascular damage by embolism formation i e maximizing a θ θ is assumed to be comparable to instantaneous photosynthesis and is usually quantified based on some hydraulic processes such as decline in leaf water potential and loss of hydraulic conductivity sperry et al 2017 anderegg et al 2018 eller et al 2018 these hydraulic based models avoid the extra parameter λ and directly couple the effects of hydraulic limitation to leaf water supply into the optimization criterion which improves the model s ability to reproduce stomatal response to drought anderegg et al 2018 zenes et al 2020 nevertheless uncertainty from the risk function i e θ remains when the risk of unit water potential p decline is high i e θ p is more negative the stomatal behavior would be more conservative zenes et al 2020 a recent study summarizes a set of characteristics that an effective θ function should meet wang et al 2020 which helps to screen out or develop models with better performance however the θ function that meets these criteria is not unique some models differ in mathematical details but perform equally well in the empirical data wang et al 2020 theoretically however for the same plant in the same environment the balancing state i e the optimal g s where a θ is maximized predicted by these models with different θ functions should be different therefore the balancing rules behind these effective models may be inconsistent and it is worth debating whether these models capture the real balancing rule for plant water carbon trade off a typical case of plant water carbon trade off is the stomatal closure caused by soil water deficit within the a θ framework when soil moisture stress intensifies the hydraulic risk function θ progressively weights more than the carbon gain function a so plants tend to close stomata to reduce water loss i e to reduce hydraulic risk therefore a shift in the relative weights of the carbon gain and hydraulic risk is embedded internally in these models acting as a balance rule for plant water carbon trade off this implied balance rule largely depends on the specific θ function as a more sensitive θ function i e with more negative θ p may mean a more rapid shift of the relative weight we speculate that the desired θ function in the a θ framework may be a mathematical fusion of two parts the change of the actual risk of stomata opening and the change of the relative weight if the influences of risk and weight can be clearly distinguished in the optimization model we may find a more predictive and realistic optimization objective for stomatal regulation hence more work on trying a different approach to construct optimization models remains needed in this study we use multi objective programming mop also known as multi criteria optimization and the weighted method to reformulate the stomatal optimization model we hypothesize that plants would regulate stomata to achieve a water carbon balance between maximizing carbon gain and minimizing water loss and that this balance is weighted by the canopy hydraulic conductivity this hypothesis yields a novel stomatal optimization model which we will refer to as the hydraulic based weighted hbw model given that the gain and risk of stomata opening and their weights are specified in the model the hbw model is expected to perform differently from existing models in predicting stomatal behavior and the underlying balancing rule therefore the overall objective of this study is twofold 1 to test whether the hbw model captures real stomatal responses to environments to assess the generality of our hypothesis 2 to reveal the major difference between the hbw model and other optimization models in balancing rules and then evaluate which model is closer to reality specifically we carried out the following work first we defined the balancing point bp to characterize the balancing rules implied by the model second given that differences in balancing rules between models may affect their predictions of stomatal behavior we theoretically tested the hbw model and compared it with two prevailing models sperry et al 2017 wang et al 2020 aiming to explore the differences in the predicted stomatal responses to drought changes in vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric co 2 concentration and the general differences in the predicted bps of different optimization models finally we tested the hbw model against the leaf gas exchange dataset of anderegg et al 2018 and evaluated the ability of different models to reproduce the actual characteristic of bps 2 methodology this section is organized into three subsections the first describes the equations required for the hbw model including the water loss function the carbon gain function and the optimization criteria the second introduces preparations for the theoretical testing of the model including the definition of the balancing point and settings of a series of simulation scenarios the third details the dataset used for empirical testing of the model and some related processing 2 1 model description 2 1 1 the water loss function stomata control the water loss through transpiration e mol m 2 s 1 which can be described by 1 e g s vpd p atm where g s is stomatal conductance to water vapor mol m 2 s 1 vpd is leaf to air vapor pressure deficit k p a p atm is atmospheric pressure k p a we assumed that cuticular conductance is negligible and boundary layer and mesophyll conductances are much larger than stomatal conductance this assumption was also used in the previous modeling because sufficient data were unavailable to estimate these conductances anderegg et al 2018 thus in equation 1 and later in the diffusion equation of co 2 only stomatal conductance is considered at steady state the water loss through leaf transpiration equals to the water supply by the hydraulic transport continuum and e induces a pressure drop across each element in the continuum soil root stem leaf thereby e can be calculated by integrating the conductance function k p from soil water potential p soil m p a to leaf water potential p leaf m p a sperry love 2015 2 e p leaf p soil k p d p where k p m o l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 is soil plant hydraulic conductance per leaf area at pressure p k p describes how hydraulic conductance declines from its maximum k m a x in response to negative water pressure p m p a this decline curve is known as the vulnerability curve and is treated here as a three parameter weibull function 3 k p k max e p c d where c and d are weibull parameters that control the shape of the curve combining equations 2 and 3 the relation between e and a given total pressure drop between soil and leaf i e p soil p leaf can be obtained transpiration starts at e 0 when plant leaf water pressure is equal to soil water potential i e p leaf p soil and rises to its maximum e e crit when p leaf p crit p crit is the threshold of leaf xylem pressure below which the plant desiccates since the k p function has no mathematical zero p crit represents a physiological zero of hydraulic conductivity set to 5 of k max when p leaf falls to p crit increases in e beyond e crit have become undetectable through equations 1 to 3 we can calculate the values of g s and e under any water pressure drop i e any possible p leaf when the environmental variables vpd p atm p soil are fixed 2 1 2 the carbon gain function the photosynthetic rate a μ m o l m 2 s 1 is usually calculated from stomatal conductance photosynthetic capacity and environmental conditions including light air temperature vpd and atmospheric co 2 concentration c a ppm here instantaneous a is calculated from an established farquhar type model as described in sperry et al 2017 necessary inputs include the maximum rates of carboxylation v m a x 25 and electron transport j m a x 25 at 25 leaf temperature t leaf photosynthetic active radiation par and c a 4 a f v max 25 j max 25 t leaf p a r c a c i eq 4 is a pseudo form of the photosynthetic model showing that a is a function of these physiological and environmental variables note that c i the intercellular co 2 concentration is a variable to be calculated not an environmental input leaf temperature was not modeled using an additional energy balance routine in this paper because the main purpose of the study was to test the predictive ability of our optimization criterion t leaf required here was an input and its value came from the testing data the temperature dependence of v m a x and j m a x relative to 25 v m a x 25 and j m a x 25 respectively was modelled using equation and parameters of leuning 2002 we assumed v m a x 25 and j m a x 25 co varied using j m a x 25 1 67 v m a x 25 medlyn et al 2002 the temperature dependence of some physiological parameters including michaelis menten constants for carboxylation and oxygenation k c and k o respectively and co 2 compensation point γ was modelled as in bernacchi et al 2001 and medlyn et al 2002 more details can be seen in the appendix description of the model of photosynthesis to calculate a the only unknown variable in equation 4 is c i the gradient between c a and c i affects the diffusion of co 2 available for photosynthesis and this process can be described by fick s law which gives a second equation for a 5 a g s 1 6 c a c i where 1 6 is relative diffusivity of water vapor with respect to co 2 when g s at any pressure drop is calculated according to eqs 1 3 the corresponding a can be obtained by setting eqs 4 and 5 equal to each other and solving for c i with the above functions of water loss and carbon gain a series of values of g s e and a from p leaf p soil to p leaf p crit can be determined at a fixed instant with given environmental variables including p soil par t leaf c a and vpd the family of these gas exchange characteristics represents all the possible steady states of a plant at that instant however the plant can only hold one stable point within these theoretical possibilities thus to predict the actual stomatal response we need an optimization criterion for stomatal behavior i e a goal that leaves would achieve by adjusting stomata 2 1 3 the hbw optimization criterion we introduced the framework of multi objective programming mop often used to solve problems with multiple contradictory and interactive objectives ye et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 to develop the stomatal optimization model under the mop framework the objectives of stomatal regulation and the weights of each objective need to be clearly stated so we proposed two main hypotheses first we hypothesized that plants have two contradictory objectives in regulating stomata 1 opening stomata maximally at every instant for more carbon gain i e maximize a and 2 minimizing water loss to avoid physiological damages caused by dehydration i e minimize e the stomatal behavior may be a compromise between these two objectives as plants cannot achieve these two objectives simultaneously by adjusting stomata therefore our second hypothesis is that the two objectives are balanced by a dynamic weight quantified by canopy hydraulic conductivity the first hypothesis includes two objectives of stomatal regulation maximizing carbon gain i e maxa and minimizing water loss i e mine these two opposing objectives are used as the two ends of the plant water carbon trade off to solve this multi objective optimization problem we used a weighted method to transform it into a single objective optimization first we normalized these two objectives and uniformly represent them as maximization goals that is maxa a max and m a x 1 e e crit a max is the instantaneous maximum a over the full p leaf range from p leaf p soil to p leaf p crit sperry et al 2017 then these two objectives were weighted by 1 α and α respectively thus the optimization objective of the hbw model is expressed as 6 max 1 α a g s a max objective 1 m a x a α 1 e g s e crit objective 2 m i n e where α is weight factor with a value between 0 and 1 with this optimization objective the stomata mediated water carbon balancing depends on the change of the weight factor a lower α close to 0 indicates that stomatal regulation is more inclined to open stomata to absorb more carbon for growing and a higher α close to 1 indicates that stomatal regulation is more inclined to close stomata to use water more slowly and efficiently another hypothesis is about the weight factor α we took the percentage loss of canopy hydraulic conductivity plc c as a proxy for α in this study mainly based on the following considerations first plc c can be directly and quantitatively linked to leaf water potential p leaf through the hydraulic vulnerability curve of the leaf the close relationship between p leaf and leaf gas exchange has been reported for example water stress can cause the reduction of p leaf which in turn causes the activation of turgor related signals sperry et al 2002 rodriguez dominguez et al 2016 and or hormonal signals dodd et al 2008 bauer et al 2013 mcadam et al 2016 these factors can regulate stomata to control both transpiration and co 2 supply for the optimization of gas exchange thus plc c serves as a bridge to couple the effect of p leaf on stomatal responses into the model second this hypothesis enables the model to distinguish differences in stomatal behavior across species since leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves are species specific for species with high resistance to embolism plc c does not increase substantially until p leaf drops to a certain level this means that these species tend to open stomata without limiting water loss during drought until their p leaf drops to a very negative level this is consistent with previous findings that species with high embolism resistance usually have a later stomatal closure under drought choat et al 2012 klein 2014 third the value of plc c can be easily calculated as a broad body of literature has quantified the vulnerability curves across species environments and life stages anderegg venturas 2020 this greatly facilitates the model parameterization and application therefore α in equation 6 is calculated as 7 α p l c c 1 k c p leaf k c max where k c p leaf is canopy hydraulic conductance at p leaf k cmax is maximum canopy hydraulic conductance m o l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 the k c p function can be calculated by the weibull function as equation 3 and the vulnerability curve parameters of the leaf equations 6 and 7 together constitute the optimization criterion of the hbw model to apply the hbw optimization model the necessary inputs include table 1 1 environmental factors p soil vpd p atm t leaf par and c a 2 hydraulic traits k max and two parameters c d in the weibull vulnerability curve and 3 photosynthetic parameter v m a x 25 the solving steps are as follows first for a series of given conditions an initial guess of p leaf is made which is slightly lower than p soil i e p leaf p soil 0 01 m p a at this water status e and g s were calculated by equations 1 3 with the calculated g s a was calculated by setting equation 4 and equation 5 equal to each other and solving for c i then the value of the objective function could be calculated by equations 6 and 7 where e crit and a max were pre calculated next the leaf water potential dropped a tiny fraction 0 01 m p a and e g s a and the objective function value were recalculated as above the calculation was stopped when p leaf dropped to the threshold p crit finally the optimization algorithm finds the p leaf at which the objective function value is maximized this predicted the optimal g s a e and p leaf at this instant all model programs are written and run through matlab r2019a 2 2 theoretical testing for behavioral differences between models the balancing rules implied in different models are different table 2 for the cowan farquhar model the implied weight ratio of a e is 1 λ that is the greater the λ the stomatal regulation is more inclined to control water loss for the a θ models if we take the θ function as a mathematical version of λ e then the weight ratio of a e implied in these models is 1 θ e in this way the weight ratio of a e behind the a θ models can be derived for the hbw model we converted it into the a θ form in the supporting information eq s6 in note s1 and then derived the weight ratio of a e as shown in table 2 compared with the cowan farquhar model both the a θ models and the hbw model provide more specific expressions of the weight ratio table 2 nevertheless these weight ratios are not the same in detail so their implicit balancing rules may be different 2 2 1 definition of balancing point to express the balancing rule more visually we defined the balancing point bp as the point with e e crit as the abscissa and a a max as the ordinate bp is essentially influenced by plant traits e g v max k max and hydraulic vulnerability curves environmental factors and stomatal behavior plant traits and environmental factors determine the instantaneous maximum photosynthesis and maximum transpiration i e a max and e crit the stomatal responses to changing environments determine the instantaneous leaf photosynthesis and transpiration i e a and e theoretically the bp may be distributed in the space shown in fig 1 we simply divide this space into 4 parts for understanding and the characteristics of each part are as follows 1 the behavior in the red area is relatively risk because leaf transpiration is close to its maximum in order to achieve a high level photosynthetic rate i e close to maximum 2 the behavior in the blue area is economical in water utilization because the photosynthetic rate is maintained at a high level close to its maximum while the transpiration is controlled at a relatively low level 3 the behavior in the green area is conservative because both photosynthesis and transpiration are far away from their maximum 4 the behavior in the white area is less economical in water utilization because the transpiration is close to the maximum while the photosynthesis is not 2 2 2 scenario simulation setting we set up three main simulation scenarios to theoretically compare the behavior of different models the first scenario s1 was set up to analyze the differences between models in predicting the stomatal responses to drought the second scenario s2 explored the differences between models in predicting the stomatal responses to changes in vpd and c a the third scenario s3 analyzed the general differences in the predicted bps of different optimization models s1 stomatal responses to drought we set up a test scenario where all environmental parameters and plant traits remain unchanged except for soil water potential changing from 0 mpa to 3 mpa see table 3 for specific parameter settings s2 stomatal responses to changes in vpd and c a we set up two simulations for testing 1 vpd varies from 0 1 kpa to 5 kpa while the other environmental variables remain constant 2 c a varies from 150 ppm to 1000 ppm while the other environmental variables remain constant in addition considering the possible influence of soil water we set three different soil water conditions for comparing see table 3 we first compared the models under the plant traits set by s1 i e p 50 1 73 m p a p 50 represents the water potential at 50 loss of canopy hydraulic conductivity then we set up two other plants with higher embolism resistance p 50 3 54 m p a a n d 6 66 m p a to test the generality of the results we did not set up more combinations of plant traits for this theoretical comparison because later tests against measurements can represent many different species see table 3 for specific parameter settings s3 general differences in the predicted bps s1 and s2 include only partial combinations of environmental variables but the actual environmental combinations are complex and changeable to compare the bps across models more generally we randomly generated 1000 different combinations of environmental variables including varying par c a vpd t leaf and p soil in addition we set three plants with different embolism resistance i e p 50 1 73 m p a 3 54 m p a a n d 6 66 m p a respectively but for simplicity only the results of p 50 3 54 m p a are shown in the text and the others are shown in fig s2 note s2 of the supporting information see table 3 for specific parameter settings 2 3 model testing against measurements the hbw model was evaluated by its ability to fit actual gas exchange data the models of sperry et al 2017 and wang et al 2020 with good performance in stomatal modeling wang et al 2020 were used for comparison we used the anderegg et al 2018 data compiled from 34 species that spanned broad taxonomic and geographical coverage of global forest biomes the anderegg et al 2018 data contains concurrent measurements of stomatal conductance leaf water potential and other driving environmental variables including p soil vpd p atm t leaf par and c a in the anderegg dataset there are stem vulnerability curve parameters for all species but the root and leaf vulnerability curves and the rhizosphere conductance k rhiz are lacking these xylem vulnerability curves came from the original studies or the xylem functional traits dataset gleason et al 2016 therefore as anderegg et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 did we used the stem vulnerability curve as the proxy for the vulnerability curves of root leaf and the whole plant and assumed infinite k rhiz for consistency we also followed these assumptions in the theoretical analysis these assumptions could be problematic for the accuracy of the optimization model given the variation in plant hydraulic vulnerability and resistances across tissues nevertheless we believe this is unlikely to greatly influence our results for several reasons first some studies support the expectation that relative hydraulic vulnerabilities of different organs are expected to be coordinated within species domec et al 2004 domec et al 2006 meinzer et al 2008 second these assumptions are shared by all optimization models so it may not significantly impact the relative differences between the models for example when the more vulnerable root and leaf are considered the whole plant hydraulic vulnerability would become less resistant than we assumed but as we will show in the later results different embolism resistances of the whole plant do not affect the main differences between the models we compared third we theoretically tested the models when considering segmentation of the vulnerability curve and the simulation results point to the same relative differences between models see figs s3 s5 in note s3 of the supporting information we evaluated the models by testing their ability to fit actual gas exchange data the anderegg dataset lacked v m a x 25 for five species and k max for all the species therefore first we fitted the missing v m a x 25 to minimize the sum of squared error between the observed a and calculated a i e calculated from equation 4 and the observed g s since the fitting of v m a x 25 only used an established farquhar type photosynthetic model and did not involve the optimization criterion the fitted v m a x 25 values were shared for all tested models including the hbw model the sperry model sperry et al 2017 and the wang model wang et al 2020 on this basis we had all the input parameters required to run the model except the value of k max see table 1 thus we then ran the model for each species and fitted the k max to minimize the sum of squared error between the predicted and observed stomatal conductance note that we fitted the k max values separately for each model and obtained the corresponding model outputs including a g s e p leaf a max and e crit finally we used the taylor diagram taylor 2001 to assess how well the model outputs a g s and p leaf fit the observations to evaluate the performance of different models the taylor diagram taylor 2001 visualizes how closely a model predicts the observed values based on its correlation coefficient r root mean square difference rmsd and standard deviation std using these metrics the location of the predicted dataset and their distance from the reference point designates their similarity to the observed dataset the following equations calculate these metrics 8 r i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 9 rmsd i 1 n m i m o i o 2 n 10a std of the observation i 1 n o i o 2 n 10b std of the prediction i 1 n m i m 2 n where n denotes the number of variables o i is the i th observed value o is the mean of observed values m i is the i th modelled value o denotes the mean of modelled values to compare the difference between the actual and predicted bps we need to clarify the main characteristic of the actual bp however the values of a max and e crit are not included in the anderegg data so we employed the calculated values from the model as approximations this makes the a max and e crit values of both actual bps and predicted bps come from the same method and thus the relative difference mainly depends on how close the predicted gas exchange traits are to the observations consequently the behavior differences in bp are closely related to the different predictions between models in addition considering that the values of a max and e crit calculated by different models are different because the fitted k max values are different the actual bps based on the hbw model sperry model and wang model are displayed in the supporting information figs s8 s10 in note s4 respectively these bps all show highly similar distribution characteristics and similar responses to soil moisture therefore for simplicity we only offer the actual bps that calculated using a max and e crit of the hbw model in the following result section in addition we tested the influence that v m a x 25 and k max had on all results in a sensitivity analysis note s5 3 result 3 1 theoretical testing 3 1 1 g s response to soil moisture different optimization models showed different sensitivities of g s to soil moisture fig 2 regarding bp compared with the models of sperry et al 2017 and wang et al 2020 the bp of the hbw model was more profligate when p soil 0 m p a while it was more conservative when p soil 1 5 o r 2 m p a fig 2a this indicates that the bp of the hbw model has an active response to the drop of soil water potential while those of the sperry model and wang model are relatively less sensitive to soil moisture consequently the hbw model predicted a more sensitive stomatal response to soil moisture fig 2b at relatively high p soil the predicted g s of the hbw model was slightly higher than that of the sperry model and they were both higher than the wang model however as soil moisture gradually decreased the hbw model predicted a steeper decrease in g s and an earlier stomatal closure than the other two models 3 1 2 g s responses to vpd and c a there is no difference between the three models in predicting the response patterns of stomata to vpd and c a they all predicted the typical stomatal closure to rising vpd and c a fig 3 for the same vpd or c a the predicted g s values varied with models which was essentially due to the different sensitivity of models to soil moisture for example when p soil 0 m p a the hbw model predicted greater g s than the sperry model and wang model despite the same response trend fig 3a d compared with the sperry and wang models the bps of the hbw model at p soil 0 m p a were distributed closer to the upper right area showing a higher a a max under the same e e crit see inserts in fig 3a d as p soil decreased the bps of the hbw model became more conservative than those of the sperry model and wang model so the predicted g s for the same vpd or c a was lower fig 3b e when p soil dropped to 2 5 m p a the stomata of the hbw model had been closed so it did not respond to changes in vpd or c a fig 3c f 3 1 3 general differences in balancing points between models fig 3 shows an interesting phenomenon when p soil decreases gradually the bps of different models will move along different paths to run out the possibility that this phenomenon occurs only in the set plant traits we set up two more embolism resistant plants to repeat the simulation as shown in fig 4 differences in hydraulic vulnerability did not affect the relative differences in model predictions on the one hand the hbw model always predicted a more sensitive stomatal response to drought compared to the sperry model and wang model fig 4a e on the other hand as p soil decreased the bp of the hbw model showed a significant shift to the lower left i e becoming more conservative whereas the sperry model and wang model did not fig 4b d fig 4f h we compared the distribution of bps in different models and their responses to soil moisture under a more general combination of environmental factors fig 5 for the hbw model the bps were mainly distributed in a triangular area on the left fig 5a characterized by good control of leaf transpiration that is keeping e at a certain distance from its maximum e crit when p soil decreased the bp of the hbw model shifted significantly from the upper to the lower left meaning that both relative photosynthesis a a max and relative transpiration e e crit were further adjusted to lower levels for the sperry model the bps were mainly distributed in a triangular area at the top which a consistently high a a max characterizes fig 5b when p soil decreased different from the hbw model the bp of the sperry model moved toward the upper right area with high a a max and e e crit for the wang model the bps were mainly distributed in the relatively concentrated area on the upper left i e with a high level of a a max and were not significantly affected by the change of p soil fig 5c in the supporting information we added the simulations when the plant became weaker or stronger in embolism resistance all results point to the same relative differences across models i e same as shown in fig 5 in addition we show the differences in predicted g s between models fig 6 compared with the hbw model both the sperry model and the wang model predicted lower g s under wet conditions but predicted greater g s under dry conditions this finding is consistent with our results in figs 2 5 which indicate that the hbw model is more sensitive to soil moisture than the sperry model and wang model and behaves more conservatively under dry conditions 3 2 empirical testing 3 2 1 predictions of g s a and p l e a f the performance of the three models in fitting the anderegg et al 2018 data is shown in fig 7 for predictions of g s and a the three models performed equally well compared with the sperry and wang models fig 7a c the hbw model had a slightly smaller rmsd a slightly higher correlation coefficient and a standard deviation closer to the observation fig 7d e for the prediction of p leaf the hbw model and sperry model performed equally well however the wang model performed relatively poorly with a larger rmsd a smaller correlation coefficient and a standard deviation farther from observation fig 7f additionally in the sensitivity analyses of the key plant traits i e v m a x 25 and k max the model performances were quite similar across the sensitivity analyses tables s2 s4 in note s5 these results show that the hbw model is well supported by empirical observations and can capture the real stomatal responses to environments 3 2 2 distribution of balancing points fig 8 shows the actual distribution of bps for the anderegg et al 2018 data the bps were distributed almost everywhere except in the lower right corner but they were mainly distributed in a triangular area on the left in terms of density fig 8a the distribution of bps seems to be related to p soil because the red points i e those with more negative p soil were more concentrated in the lower left area fig 8b to present this connection more clearly we divided the bps into two parts by taking 2 m p a as the segmental point of p soil when p soil 2 m p a the high density area of the bp was distributed in the upper left area fig 8c however when p soil 2 m p a the high density area was concentrated in the lower left area fig 8d these results convey a key message as the p soil decreases the actual bp tends to shift to the more conservative area we show that the differences in the predicted bps between models that driven by real plant traits and environmental combination from anderegg data fig 9 point to the same relative differences as the theoretical analysis fig 5 the distributions of bps predicted by these three models differed from the actual case and only covered a part of the actual range nevertheless compared with the sperry model and wang model the bps of the hbw model were closer to reality first the bps of the hbw model were distributed in a triangular area on the left fig 9a which overlaps with the high density area of the actual bps to some extent fig 8a in contrast the bps of the sperry model and wang model were concentrated in the upper area and the upper left area respectively fig 9b c secondly as p soil decreased the bp of the hbw model showed a tendency to shift to the lower left area fig 9a indicating that it behaved more conservatively this captures the main response characteristic of the actual bp to soil moisture shown in fig 8c 8d while the sperry model and wang model do not in the sensitivity analyses of plants traits fig s12 in nots s5 the behavioral differences of bps between models are consistent with those shown in fig 9 these results suggest that the balancing rule implied in the hbw model especially its adaption to water stress is closer to the real stomatal behavior 3 2 3 variation in δ g s with soil moisture in the theoretical analysis we found that the three models differed in their soil moisture sensitivities therefore we evaluated the variation of the error of predicted g s with soil moisture fig 10 results show that the prediction errors δ g s of models were distributed asymmetrically on both sides of the reference i e δ g s 0 in terms of the mean δ g s three models showed a consistent variation with soil moisture although the degree varied that is δ g s was negative when the soil was wet and positive when the soil was drier compared with the sperry model and wang model the predicted g s of the hbw model was closer to the observation i e the average δ g s was closer to 0 fig 10 when p soil became more negative both the sperry model and wang model tended to overestimate g s to a greater extent as shown in right in fig 10 these results indicate that the sensitive response to soil moisture implied in the hbw model is more consistent with the empirical data 4 discussion in this study we propose a stomatal optimization model i e hbw model using multi objective programming and a weighted method unlike the existing optimization methods we clearly distinguished the risk of stomata opening and the weight ratio between gain and risk during modeling in contrast in the basic g a i n r i s k framework the actual risk and the potential weight ratio may be mixed in the risk function which invisibly increases the difficulty of finding a proper risk function in the hbw model the benefit and risk of stomata opening are represented by the relative values of photosynthesis and transpiration respectively equation 6 the weight ratio is quantified by the loss of canopy hydraulic conductance equation 7 under any combination of environments the optimal g s is considered to be the solution that maximizes the objective function formed by weighting two sub objectives equation 6 this model at least provides an alternative modeling method which gives straightforward suggestions for each component that constitutes the optimization objective 4 1 the hbw model is supported both theoretically and empirically we demonstrate that the hbw model can capture the realistic responses of stomata to environments the good performance of the hbw model is to be expected as the hbw model bears some mathematical similarities to the sperry model and wang model when we converted the hbw model into the a θ form eq s6 in note s1 we found that the hbw model implies a different risk function from existing models i e θ plc c a a max e e crit 1 this implied θ expression like those of the sperry model and wang model meets the criteria proposed by wang et al 2020 for an effective risk function fig s1 this provides mathematical support for the good performance of the hbw model in capturing typical stomatal responses to vpd c a and p soil the hbw model also shows the expected ability of the model based on plant hydraulics that is predicting the coordination of stomatal behavior and hydraulic traits across species see fig s3 in note s2 in addition according to the universal evaluation criteria wang et al 2020 the advantages of the sperry and wang models in application and prediction should carry over in the hbw model the test against the anderegg et al 2018 data proves this point as the hbw model performed equally well compared with the sperry model and wang model fig 7 what s more the g s prediction error of the hbw model was smaller than that of the sperry model and wang model at lower p soil fig 10 4 2 the hbw model offers a more conservative stomatal strategy revealed from the bp the balancing point bp effectively distinguishes the water carbon balancing rules implied by different optimization models in theoretical testing we found no significant difference in predicting typical responses of stomata to the environment despite differences in mathematical details of the models even though the hbw model was more sensitive to soil moisture than the sperry model and wang model their differences in the predicted values of g s were relatively small fig 6 the information that this slight numerical difference can convey is limited for instance all three models predict that g s will decrease as soil moisture decreases this behavior is generally understood that stomatal regulation becomes more conservative in response to drought it seems to imply that the balancing rules of these models are consistent i e as the water deficit intensifies the stomatal regulation tends to control water loss rather than increase carbon gain however from the perspective of bp this is clearly not the case when p soil became more negative the bps of the sperry model and wang model were still distributed in the area where a was relatively high and close to its maximum figs 5 9 in particular the bps of the sperry model even appeared in the area where a and e were both close to their maximum therefore from these points of view the stomatal regulation predicted by the sperry model or wang model even if the predicted g s is reduced during drought is not essentially a conservative behavior in contrast when p soil decreased the bps of the hbw model would shift to the area where a and e were both far away from their maximum this behavior of the hbw model reflects the adjustment of the stomatal strategy under drought i e becoming more conservative therefore our work shows that the bp serves as an effective indicator revealing the differences in stomatal optimization strategies implied by different models the hbw model predicts a more sensitive stomatal response to soil moisture implying a more conservative stomatal strategy we show that the actual bps tend to be distributed in more conservative areas as p soil decreases fig 8 this response of bp to soil moisture is captured only by the hbw model but not by the sperry and wang models this feature of the hbw model may be because we weighted the photosynthetic benefit by 1 plc c see equations 6 and 7 on the one hand mathematically doing so results in a new θ function under the a θ framework which differs from those of the sperry and wang models in shape and sensitivity to soil moisture see fig s2 in note s1 on the other hand in theory this means that when p leaf drops the plant s willingness to obtain carbon gain decreases i e there would be a down regulation of photosynthesis this can be explained by the feedback on photosynthesis from phloem transport due to the close hydraulic connection between the xylem and phloem thorpe and minchin 1996 holtta et al 2009 the phloem flow is sensitive to changes in water potential in the xylem of the leaf the lower the xylem water potential the more difficult it is for the phloem to maintain sufficient turgor to transport sugars sevanto 2014 this would slow phloem transport down resulting in carbohydrate accumulation which then causes the down regulation of photosynthesis nebauer et al 2011 for instance a previous study used a function of leaf sugar concentration to weight a and thus to model the down regulation of photosynthetic production nikinmaa et al 2013 therefore similarly the 1 plc c a a max term in the hbw model may indirectly represent this down regulation through changes in leaf water potential 4 3 implication and limitation of this study the sensitivity difference between the models to soil moisture matters most during drought conditions a meta analysis found that plant resistance to drought depends on timely stomatal closure martin stpaul et al 2017 the longer stomatal opening is maintained during drought the faster the decreases in soil and plant water potential finally leading to rapid mortality through hydraulic failure anderegg et al 2016 adams et al 2017 we show that the stomatal closure predicted by the hbw model is earlier than the sperry model and wang model figs 2 3 therefore when these optimization models are coupled into whole plant or ecological scale models their predictions regarding the degree to which plants are likely to suffer carbon limitation and hydraulic failure during drought periods may differ in this sense the hbw model can stand as a helpful comparison to existing optimization models while more work is needed to test and validate the hbw model at ecosystem scales and in multiple ecosystems our theoretical and empirical exercise at leaf level suggests that the conservative stomatal strategy implied by the hbw hypothesis may have substantial effects on predicted vegetation responses to drought events what s more given the simplicity of the optimization approach it can predict the transpiration of plants in any environment with measurable parameters this can be further combined with the budyko hypothesis to predict the changes in the coupled response of vegetation and hydrological processes to environment changes xin et al 2019 yu et al 2019 and to evaluate the role of vegetation on long term water balance in watersheds tang and wang 2017 there are some limitations to our research first we simply assumed that the weight factor α is equal to plc c however the critical closing tendency of stomata during drought seems to be an active process controlled by the extrusion of anions from guard cells rather than a passive process mediated directly by water potential brodribb mcadam 2011 therefore α may be affected by other factors that affect membrane polarization such as abscisic acid aba increased levels of aba lead to a depolarization of guard cell membranes triggering osmotic ion efflux and a loss of guard cell turgor resulting in the closure of stomata pantin et al 2012 bauer et al 2013 mcadam brodribb 2014 therefore α may be expressed as a piecewise function of water potential and aba for example when the leaf aba accumulates to a certain concentration α may rise sharply in this sense equation 6 can be readily improved by including more accurate descriptions of the physiology of α second α may also be optimized on long term scales to most efficiently use water for carbon gains at high α stomata will adopt a more conservative regulation strategy to reduce current water consumption this is a sensible behavior to avoid current inefficient water use or excess hydraulic embolism thus ensuring that plants can use saved water to capture more carbon in a more favorable environment in the future therefore hedging rules zeng et al 2021 may be used to characterize the different forms of α considering precipitation uncertainty which is helpful to predict the long term adaptive stomatal behavior of plants third we only focused on the response of the bp to soil moisture which may be only one of the potential characteristics of the bp nevertheless by modeling the response of bp to soil moisture the differences between models are effectively demonstrated we expect more efforts to explore the response patterns of bp to the environment through specially designed experiments which may be helpful to find more standards for evaluating and developing optimization models 5 conclusion in summary we demonstrate that the hbw model captures the realistic stomatal responses to environmental variables and performs well in the existing dataset crucially the hbw model differs from the existing models in predicting the response of the bp to soil moisture when p soil decreased the bp of the hbw model moved to a conservative area with lower a a max and e e crit while the bps of the sperry and wang models were still distributed in areas with higher a a max the hbw model better reproduces the actual bps distribution characteristic and offers a more conservative stomatal strategy than others our results emphasize the importance of distinguishing the balancing rules of different optimization models because inaccurate stomatal strategy would lead to deviations in the predicted stomatal response to water stress ultimately as a complement to the stomatal optimization models our work provides an alternative method to understand stomatal behavior and construct optimization models credit

2525,leaf stomata play a central role in mediating the exchange of water vapor and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the terrestrial ecosystems stomatal response to the environment presumably optimizes the trade off between carbon uptake and water loss recently developed optimization models show their remarkable success in capturing empirical patterns of stomata however solutions of these models with different mathematical details should vary for the same environments indicating that stomatal strategies implied in these models may differ and require further investigation the present study proposed a novel stomatal optimization model assuming that stomatal regulation aims to achieve a water carbon balance shaped by a hydraulic based weight factor hbw model in particular we introduce the balancing point bp for analyzing the behavioral difference between models we tested the hbw model based on set scenarios and leaf level gas exchange data and compared it with two existing models results show that these models differ mainly in stomatal sensitivity to soil moisture bp characteristics reveal the behavioral difference between models and only the hbw model which is more sensitive to soil moisture captures the actual response patterns of bp to water stress well this work emphasizes the differences in stomatal strategies among different optimization models and provides an alternative modeling approach which offers a more conservative stomatal strategy that can stand as a useful comparison with existing models keywords optimization model stomatal conductance stomatal strategy drought data availability the data used to test the theory in this study are obtained from anderegg et al 2018 https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 6066449 1 introduction vegetation is a key part of the global water carbon cycle system plant transpiration contributes 64 of terrestrial evapotranspiration good et al 2015 and photosynthesis accounts for 53 of global co 2 uptake friedlingstein et al 2022 both transpiration and photosynthesis are directly regulated by stomatal conductance which dynamically responses to environmental changes such as solar radiation shimazaki et al 2007 atmospheric co 2 concentration ainsworth rogers 2007 temperature and humidity lawson blatt 2014 and soil moisture munemasa et al 2015 stomatal responses to these environmental variables affect the prediction of evapotranspiration and ecosystem productivity and remain a dominant source of uncertainty in feedbacks between vegetation and climate berry et al 2010 jasechko et al 2013 trugman et al 2018 this uncertainty emphasizes the importance of accurately modeling leaf stomatal conductance the beneficial co 2 uptake through stomata for photosynthesis a is accompanied by the loss of water to the atmosphere i e transpiration e this inevitable loss of transpiration must ultimately be balanced by the supply of liquid water to the leaves brodribb 2009 if plants regulate stomatal conductance g s for carbon gain alone regardless of water loss then greater g s is better but obviously doing so will lead to excessive water loss through transpiration leading to a series of consequences such as rapid depletion of soil water the decline of water potential in the hydraulic continuum xylem cavitation and even mortality drake et al 2017 martin stpaul et al 2017 dewar et al 2018 therefore plants face a fundamental water carbon trade off in regulating stomata basic optimization theory suggests that stomatal regulation aims to maximize the difference between the gain and risk of stomata opening i e maximizing g a i n r i s k wang et al 2020 once the gain and risk can be calculated as functions of stomatal conductance the optimal g s that maximizes the difference can be mathematically determined this allows the optimization approach to predict how plant gas exchange responds to environmental changes the optimization approach not only overcomes the shortcoming of the empirical method e g jarvis slatyer 1970 ball et al 1987 that is the lack of theoretical explanation but also avoids the shortcomings of more mechanistic models e g buckley et al 2003 buckley 2005 that is relying on many parameters and being difficult to be applied broadly across species and environments dewar et al 2009 buckley et al 2012 buckley 2017 a classic optimization theory proposed by cowan and farquhar 1977 more than 40 years ago takes soil water depletion as the risk of stomata opening and hypothesizes that plants regulate stomata to maximize the photosynthetic gain i e cumulative a for a given amount of water i e cumulative e during a given period d t mathematically this hypothesis can be expressed as maximizing the function a λ e over d t arneth et al 2002 katul et al 2009 katul et al 2010 where the lagrangian multiplier λ can be interpreted as the marginal carbon cost of water within the cowan farquhar framework the optimal g s depends on the value of λ a larger λ means the cost of water use increases so stomatal regulation is more inclined to reduce transpiration than increase carbon gain and therefore behaves more conservatively lin et al 2015 many efforts have been made to elaborate on the cowan farquhar model which has much empirical support medlyn et al 2011 manzoni et al 2011 manzoni et al 2013 however a perpetual challenge for the cowan farquhar model is how to predict the response of λ to a variety of fluctuating environmental variables and different plant traits as λ has been found to vary with species environment and time manzoni et al 2011 lin et al 2015 buckley et al 2017 another recently proposed and developed optimization theory wolf et al 2016 sperry et al 2017 hypothesizes that plants regulate stomata to maximize the instantaneous carbon gain a minus the risk θ of vascular damage by embolism formation i e maximizing a θ θ is assumed to be comparable to instantaneous photosynthesis and is usually quantified based on some hydraulic processes such as decline in leaf water potential and loss of hydraulic conductivity sperry et al 2017 anderegg et al 2018 eller et al 2018 these hydraulic based models avoid the extra parameter λ and directly couple the effects of hydraulic limitation to leaf water supply into the optimization criterion which improves the model s ability to reproduce stomatal response to drought anderegg et al 2018 zenes et al 2020 nevertheless uncertainty from the risk function i e θ remains when the risk of unit water potential p decline is high i e θ p is more negative the stomatal behavior would be more conservative zenes et al 2020 a recent study summarizes a set of characteristics that an effective θ function should meet wang et al 2020 which helps to screen out or develop models with better performance however the θ function that meets these criteria is not unique some models differ in mathematical details but perform equally well in the empirical data wang et al 2020 theoretically however for the same plant in the same environment the balancing state i e the optimal g s where a θ is maximized predicted by these models with different θ functions should be different therefore the balancing rules behind these effective models may be inconsistent and it is worth debating whether these models capture the real balancing rule for plant water carbon trade off a typical case of plant water carbon trade off is the stomatal closure caused by soil water deficit within the a θ framework when soil moisture stress intensifies the hydraulic risk function θ progressively weights more than the carbon gain function a so plants tend to close stomata to reduce water loss i e to reduce hydraulic risk therefore a shift in the relative weights of the carbon gain and hydraulic risk is embedded internally in these models acting as a balance rule for plant water carbon trade off this implied balance rule largely depends on the specific θ function as a more sensitive θ function i e with more negative θ p may mean a more rapid shift of the relative weight we speculate that the desired θ function in the a θ framework may be a mathematical fusion of two parts the change of the actual risk of stomata opening and the change of the relative weight if the influences of risk and weight can be clearly distinguished in the optimization model we may find a more predictive and realistic optimization objective for stomatal regulation hence more work on trying a different approach to construct optimization models remains needed in this study we use multi objective programming mop also known as multi criteria optimization and the weighted method to reformulate the stomatal optimization model we hypothesize that plants would regulate stomata to achieve a water carbon balance between maximizing carbon gain and minimizing water loss and that this balance is weighted by the canopy hydraulic conductivity this hypothesis yields a novel stomatal optimization model which we will refer to as the hydraulic based weighted hbw model given that the gain and risk of stomata opening and their weights are specified in the model the hbw model is expected to perform differently from existing models in predicting stomatal behavior and the underlying balancing rule therefore the overall objective of this study is twofold 1 to test whether the hbw model captures real stomatal responses to environments to assess the generality of our hypothesis 2 to reveal the major difference between the hbw model and other optimization models in balancing rules and then evaluate which model is closer to reality specifically we carried out the following work first we defined the balancing point bp to characterize the balancing rules implied by the model second given that differences in balancing rules between models may affect their predictions of stomatal behavior we theoretically tested the hbw model and compared it with two prevailing models sperry et al 2017 wang et al 2020 aiming to explore the differences in the predicted stomatal responses to drought changes in vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric co 2 concentration and the general differences in the predicted bps of different optimization models finally we tested the hbw model against the leaf gas exchange dataset of anderegg et al 2018 and evaluated the ability of different models to reproduce the actual characteristic of bps 2 methodology this section is organized into three subsections the first describes the equations required for the hbw model including the water loss function the carbon gain function and the optimization criteria the second introduces preparations for the theoretical testing of the model including the definition of the balancing point and settings of a series of simulation scenarios the third details the dataset used for empirical testing of the model and some related processing 2 1 model description 2 1 1 the water loss function stomata control the water loss through transpiration e mol m 2 s 1 which can be described by 1 e g s vpd p atm where g s is stomatal conductance to water vapor mol m 2 s 1 vpd is leaf to air vapor pressure deficit k p a p atm is atmospheric pressure k p a we assumed that cuticular conductance is negligible and boundary layer and mesophyll conductances are much larger than stomatal conductance this assumption was also used in the previous modeling because sufficient data were unavailable to estimate these conductances anderegg et al 2018 thus in equation 1 and later in the diffusion equation of co 2 only stomatal conductance is considered at steady state the water loss through leaf transpiration equals to the water supply by the hydraulic transport continuum and e induces a pressure drop across each element in the continuum soil root stem leaf thereby e can be calculated by integrating the conductance function k p from soil water potential p soil m p a to leaf water potential p leaf m p a sperry love 2015 2 e p leaf p soil k p d p where k p m o l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 is soil plant hydraulic conductance per leaf area at pressure p k p describes how hydraulic conductance declines from its maximum k m a x in response to negative water pressure p m p a this decline curve is known as the vulnerability curve and is treated here as a three parameter weibull function 3 k p k max e p c d where c and d are weibull parameters that control the shape of the curve combining equations 2 and 3 the relation between e and a given total pressure drop between soil and leaf i e p soil p leaf can be obtained transpiration starts at e 0 when plant leaf water pressure is equal to soil water potential i e p leaf p soil and rises to its maximum e e crit when p leaf p crit p crit is the threshold of leaf xylem pressure below which the plant desiccates since the k p function has no mathematical zero p crit represents a physiological zero of hydraulic conductivity set to 5 of k max when p leaf falls to p crit increases in e beyond e crit have become undetectable through equations 1 to 3 we can calculate the values of g s and e under any water pressure drop i e any possible p leaf when the environmental variables vpd p atm p soil are fixed 2 1 2 the carbon gain function the photosynthetic rate a μ m o l m 2 s 1 is usually calculated from stomatal conductance photosynthetic capacity and environmental conditions including light air temperature vpd and atmospheric co 2 concentration c a ppm here instantaneous a is calculated from an established farquhar type model as described in sperry et al 2017 necessary inputs include the maximum rates of carboxylation v m a x 25 and electron transport j m a x 25 at 25 leaf temperature t leaf photosynthetic active radiation par and c a 4 a f v max 25 j max 25 t leaf p a r c a c i eq 4 is a pseudo form of the photosynthetic model showing that a is a function of these physiological and environmental variables note that c i the intercellular co 2 concentration is a variable to be calculated not an environmental input leaf temperature was not modeled using an additional energy balance routine in this paper because the main purpose of the study was to test the predictive ability of our optimization criterion t leaf required here was an input and its value came from the testing data the temperature dependence of v m a x and j m a x relative to 25 v m a x 25 and j m a x 25 respectively was modelled using equation and parameters of leuning 2002 we assumed v m a x 25 and j m a x 25 co varied using j m a x 25 1 67 v m a x 25 medlyn et al 2002 the temperature dependence of some physiological parameters including michaelis menten constants for carboxylation and oxygenation k c and k o respectively and co 2 compensation point γ was modelled as in bernacchi et al 2001 and medlyn et al 2002 more details can be seen in the appendix description of the model of photosynthesis to calculate a the only unknown variable in equation 4 is c i the gradient between c a and c i affects the diffusion of co 2 available for photosynthesis and this process can be described by fick s law which gives a second equation for a 5 a g s 1 6 c a c i where 1 6 is relative diffusivity of water vapor with respect to co 2 when g s at any pressure drop is calculated according to eqs 1 3 the corresponding a can be obtained by setting eqs 4 and 5 equal to each other and solving for c i with the above functions of water loss and carbon gain a series of values of g s e and a from p leaf p soil to p leaf p crit can be determined at a fixed instant with given environmental variables including p soil par t leaf c a and vpd the family of these gas exchange characteristics represents all the possible steady states of a plant at that instant however the plant can only hold one stable point within these theoretical possibilities thus to predict the actual stomatal response we need an optimization criterion for stomatal behavior i e a goal that leaves would achieve by adjusting stomata 2 1 3 the hbw optimization criterion we introduced the framework of multi objective programming mop often used to solve problems with multiple contradictory and interactive objectives ye et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 to develop the stomatal optimization model under the mop framework the objectives of stomatal regulation and the weights of each objective need to be clearly stated so we proposed two main hypotheses first we hypothesized that plants have two contradictory objectives in regulating stomata 1 opening stomata maximally at every instant for more carbon gain i e maximize a and 2 minimizing water loss to avoid physiological damages caused by dehydration i e minimize e the stomatal behavior may be a compromise between these two objectives as plants cannot achieve these two objectives simultaneously by adjusting stomata therefore our second hypothesis is that the two objectives are balanced by a dynamic weight quantified by canopy hydraulic conductivity the first hypothesis includes two objectives of stomatal regulation maximizing carbon gain i e maxa and minimizing water loss i e mine these two opposing objectives are used as the two ends of the plant water carbon trade off to solve this multi objective optimization problem we used a weighted method to transform it into a single objective optimization first we normalized these two objectives and uniformly represent them as maximization goals that is maxa a max and m a x 1 e e crit a max is the instantaneous maximum a over the full p leaf range from p leaf p soil to p leaf p crit sperry et al 2017 then these two objectives were weighted by 1 α and α respectively thus the optimization objective of the hbw model is expressed as 6 max 1 α a g s a max objective 1 m a x a α 1 e g s e crit objective 2 m i n e where α is weight factor with a value between 0 and 1 with this optimization objective the stomata mediated water carbon balancing depends on the change of the weight factor a lower α close to 0 indicates that stomatal regulation is more inclined to open stomata to absorb more carbon for growing and a higher α close to 1 indicates that stomatal regulation is more inclined to close stomata to use water more slowly and efficiently another hypothesis is about the weight factor α we took the percentage loss of canopy hydraulic conductivity plc c as a proxy for α in this study mainly based on the following considerations first plc c can be directly and quantitatively linked to leaf water potential p leaf through the hydraulic vulnerability curve of the leaf the close relationship between p leaf and leaf gas exchange has been reported for example water stress can cause the reduction of p leaf which in turn causes the activation of turgor related signals sperry et al 2002 rodriguez dominguez et al 2016 and or hormonal signals dodd et al 2008 bauer et al 2013 mcadam et al 2016 these factors can regulate stomata to control both transpiration and co 2 supply for the optimization of gas exchange thus plc c serves as a bridge to couple the effect of p leaf on stomatal responses into the model second this hypothesis enables the model to distinguish differences in stomatal behavior across species since leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves are species specific for species with high resistance to embolism plc c does not increase substantially until p leaf drops to a certain level this means that these species tend to open stomata without limiting water loss during drought until their p leaf drops to a very negative level this is consistent with previous findings that species with high embolism resistance usually have a later stomatal closure under drought choat et al 2012 klein 2014 third the value of plc c can be easily calculated as a broad body of literature has quantified the vulnerability curves across species environments and life stages anderegg venturas 2020 this greatly facilitates the model parameterization and application therefore α in equation 6 is calculated as 7 α p l c c 1 k c p leaf k c max where k c p leaf is canopy hydraulic conductance at p leaf k cmax is maximum canopy hydraulic conductance m o l m 2 s 1 mpa 1 the k c p function can be calculated by the weibull function as equation 3 and the vulnerability curve parameters of the leaf equations 6 and 7 together constitute the optimization criterion of the hbw model to apply the hbw optimization model the necessary inputs include table 1 1 environmental factors p soil vpd p atm t leaf par and c a 2 hydraulic traits k max and two parameters c d in the weibull vulnerability curve and 3 photosynthetic parameter v m a x 25 the solving steps are as follows first for a series of given conditions an initial guess of p leaf is made which is slightly lower than p soil i e p leaf p soil 0 01 m p a at this water status e and g s were calculated by equations 1 3 with the calculated g s a was calculated by setting equation 4 and equation 5 equal to each other and solving for c i then the value of the objective function could be calculated by equations 6 and 7 where e crit and a max were pre calculated next the leaf water potential dropped a tiny fraction 0 01 m p a and e g s a and the objective function value were recalculated as above the calculation was stopped when p leaf dropped to the threshold p crit finally the optimization algorithm finds the p leaf at which the objective function value is maximized this predicted the optimal g s a e and p leaf at this instant all model programs are written and run through matlab r2019a 2 2 theoretical testing for behavioral differences between models the balancing rules implied in different models are different table 2 for the cowan farquhar model the implied weight ratio of a e is 1 λ that is the greater the λ the stomatal regulation is more inclined to control water loss for the a θ models if we take the θ function as a mathematical version of λ e then the weight ratio of a e implied in these models is 1 θ e in this way the weight ratio of a e behind the a θ models can be derived for the hbw model we converted it into the a θ form in the supporting information eq s6 in note s1 and then derived the weight ratio of a e as shown in table 2 compared with the cowan farquhar model both the a θ models and the hbw model provide more specific expressions of the weight ratio table 2 nevertheless these weight ratios are not the same in detail so their implicit balancing rules may be different 2 2 1 definition of balancing point to express the balancing rule more visually we defined the balancing point bp as the point with e e crit as the abscissa and a a max as the ordinate bp is essentially influenced by plant traits e g v max k max and hydraulic vulnerability curves environmental factors and stomatal behavior plant traits and environmental factors determine the instantaneous maximum photosynthesis and maximum transpiration i e a max and e crit the stomatal responses to changing environments determine the instantaneous leaf photosynthesis and transpiration i e a and e theoretically the bp may be distributed in the space shown in fig 1 we simply divide this space into 4 parts for understanding and the characteristics of each part are as follows 1 the behavior in the red area is relatively risk because leaf transpiration is close to its maximum in order to achieve a high level photosynthetic rate i e close to maximum 2 the behavior in the blue area is economical in water utilization because the photosynthetic rate is maintained at a high level close to its maximum while the transpiration is controlled at a relatively low level 3 the behavior in the green area is conservative because both photosynthesis and transpiration are far away from their maximum 4 the behavior in the white area is less economical in water utilization because the transpiration is close to the maximum while the photosynthesis is not 2 2 2 scenario simulation setting we set up three main simulation scenarios to theoretically compare the behavior of different models the first scenario s1 was set up to analyze the differences between models in predicting the stomatal responses to drought the second scenario s2 explored the differences between models in predicting the stomatal responses to changes in vpd and c a the third scenario s3 analyzed the general differences in the predicted bps of different optimization models s1 stomatal responses to drought we set up a test scenario where all environmental parameters and plant traits remain unchanged except for soil water potential changing from 0 mpa to 3 mpa see table 3 for specific parameter settings s2 stomatal responses to changes in vpd and c a we set up two simulations for testing 1 vpd varies from 0 1 kpa to 5 kpa while the other environmental variables remain constant 2 c a varies from 150 ppm to 1000 ppm while the other environmental variables remain constant in addition considering the possible influence of soil water we set three different soil water conditions for comparing see table 3 we first compared the models under the plant traits set by s1 i e p 50 1 73 m p a p 50 represents the water potential at 50 loss of canopy hydraulic conductivity then we set up two other plants with higher embolism resistance p 50 3 54 m p a a n d 6 66 m p a to test the generality of the results we did not set up more combinations of plant traits for this theoretical comparison because later tests against measurements can represent many different species see table 3 for specific parameter settings s3 general differences in the predicted bps s1 and s2 include only partial combinations of environmental variables but the actual environmental combinations are complex and changeable to compare the bps across models more generally we randomly generated 1000 different combinations of environmental variables including varying par c a vpd t leaf and p soil in addition we set three plants with different embolism resistance i e p 50 1 73 m p a 3 54 m p a a n d 6 66 m p a respectively but for simplicity only the results of p 50 3 54 m p a are shown in the text and the others are shown in fig s2 note s2 of the supporting information see table 3 for specific parameter settings 2 3 model testing against measurements the hbw model was evaluated by its ability to fit actual gas exchange data the models of sperry et al 2017 and wang et al 2020 with good performance in stomatal modeling wang et al 2020 were used for comparison we used the anderegg et al 2018 data compiled from 34 species that spanned broad taxonomic and geographical coverage of global forest biomes the anderegg et al 2018 data contains concurrent measurements of stomatal conductance leaf water potential and other driving environmental variables including p soil vpd p atm t leaf par and c a in the anderegg dataset there are stem vulnerability curve parameters for all species but the root and leaf vulnerability curves and the rhizosphere conductance k rhiz are lacking these xylem vulnerability curves came from the original studies or the xylem functional traits dataset gleason et al 2016 therefore as anderegg et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 did we used the stem vulnerability curve as the proxy for the vulnerability curves of root leaf and the whole plant and assumed infinite k rhiz for consistency we also followed these assumptions in the theoretical analysis these assumptions could be problematic for the accuracy of the optimization model given the variation in plant hydraulic vulnerability and resistances across tissues nevertheless we believe this is unlikely to greatly influence our results for several reasons first some studies support the expectation that relative hydraulic vulnerabilities of different organs are expected to be coordinated within species domec et al 2004 domec et al 2006 meinzer et al 2008 second these assumptions are shared by all optimization models so it may not significantly impact the relative differences between the models for example when the more vulnerable root and leaf are considered the whole plant hydraulic vulnerability would become less resistant than we assumed but as we will show in the later results different embolism resistances of the whole plant do not affect the main differences between the models we compared third we theoretically tested the models when considering segmentation of the vulnerability curve and the simulation results point to the same relative differences between models see figs s3 s5 in note s3 of the supporting information we evaluated the models by testing their ability to fit actual gas exchange data the anderegg dataset lacked v m a x 25 for five species and k max for all the species therefore first we fitted the missing v m a x 25 to minimize the sum of squared error between the observed a and calculated a i e calculated from equation 4 and the observed g s since the fitting of v m a x 25 only used an established farquhar type photosynthetic model and did not involve the optimization criterion the fitted v m a x 25 values were shared for all tested models including the hbw model the sperry model sperry et al 2017 and the wang model wang et al 2020 on this basis we had all the input parameters required to run the model except the value of k max see table 1 thus we then ran the model for each species and fitted the k max to minimize the sum of squared error between the predicted and observed stomatal conductance note that we fitted the k max values separately for each model and obtained the corresponding model outputs including a g s e p leaf a max and e crit finally we used the taylor diagram taylor 2001 to assess how well the model outputs a g s and p leaf fit the observations to evaluate the performance of different models the taylor diagram taylor 2001 visualizes how closely a model predicts the observed values based on its correlation coefficient r root mean square difference rmsd and standard deviation std using these metrics the location of the predicted dataset and their distance from the reference point designates their similarity to the observed dataset the following equations calculate these metrics 8 r i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 9 rmsd i 1 n m i m o i o 2 n 10a std of the observation i 1 n o i o 2 n 10b std of the prediction i 1 n m i m 2 n where n denotes the number of variables o i is the i th observed value o is the mean of observed values m i is the i th modelled value o denotes the mean of modelled values to compare the difference between the actual and predicted bps we need to clarify the main characteristic of the actual bp however the values of a max and e crit are not included in the anderegg data so we employed the calculated values from the model as approximations this makes the a max and e crit values of both actual bps and predicted bps come from the same method and thus the relative difference mainly depends on how close the predicted gas exchange traits are to the observations consequently the behavior differences in bp are closely related to the different predictions between models in addition considering that the values of a max and e crit calculated by different models are different because the fitted k max values are different the actual bps based on the hbw model sperry model and wang model are displayed in the supporting information figs s8 s10 in note s4 respectively these bps all show highly similar distribution characteristics and similar responses to soil moisture therefore for simplicity we only offer the actual bps that calculated using a max and e crit of the hbw model in the following result section in addition we tested the influence that v m a x 25 and k max had on all results in a sensitivity analysis note s5 3 result 3 1 theoretical testing 3 1 1 g s response to soil moisture different optimization models showed different sensitivities of g s to soil moisture fig 2 regarding bp compared with the models of sperry et al 2017 and wang et al 2020 the bp of the hbw model was more profligate when p soil 0 m p a while it was more conservative when p soil 1 5 o r 2 m p a fig 2a this indicates that the bp of the hbw model has an active response to the drop of soil water potential while those of the sperry model and wang model are relatively less sensitive to soil moisture consequently the hbw model predicted a more sensitive stomatal response to soil moisture fig 2b at relatively high p soil the predicted g s of the hbw model was slightly higher than that of the sperry model and they were both higher than the wang model however as soil moisture gradually decreased the hbw model predicted a steeper decrease in g s and an earlier stomatal closure than the other two models 3 1 2 g s responses to vpd and c a there is no difference between the three models in predicting the response patterns of stomata to vpd and c a they all predicted the typical stomatal closure to rising vpd and c a fig 3 for the same vpd or c a the predicted g s values varied with models which was essentially due to the different sensitivity of models to soil moisture for example when p soil 0 m p a the hbw model predicted greater g s than the sperry model and wang model despite the same response trend fig 3a d compared with the sperry and wang models the bps of the hbw model at p soil 0 m p a were distributed closer to the upper right area showing a higher a a max under the same e e crit see inserts in fig 3a d as p soil decreased the bps of the hbw model became more conservative than those of the sperry model and wang model so the predicted g s for the same vpd or c a was lower fig 3b e when p soil dropped to 2 5 m p a the stomata of the hbw model had been closed so it did not respond to changes in vpd or c a fig 3c f 3 1 3 general differences in balancing points between models fig 3 shows an interesting phenomenon when p soil decreases gradually the bps of different models will move along different paths to run out the possibility that this phenomenon occurs only in the set plant traits we set up two more embolism resistant plants to repeat the simulation as shown in fig 4 differences in hydraulic vulnerability did not affect the relative differences in model predictions on the one hand the hbw model always predicted a more sensitive stomatal response to drought compared to the sperry model and wang model fig 4a e on the other hand as p soil decreased the bp of the hbw model showed a significant shift to the lower left i e becoming more conservative whereas the sperry model and wang model did not fig 4b d fig 4f h we compared the distribution of bps in different models and their responses to soil moisture under a more general combination of environmental factors fig 5 for the hbw model the bps were mainly distributed in a triangular area on the left fig 5a characterized by good control of leaf transpiration that is keeping e at a certain distance from its maximum e crit when p soil decreased the bp of the hbw model shifted significantly from the upper to the lower left meaning that both relative photosynthesis a a max and relative transpiration e e crit were further adjusted to lower levels for the sperry model the bps were mainly distributed in a triangular area at the top which a consistently high a a max characterizes fig 5b when p soil decreased different from the hbw model the bp of the sperry model moved toward the upper right area with high a a max and e e crit for the wang model the bps were mainly distributed in the relatively concentrated area on the upper left i e with a high level of a a max and were not significantly affected by the change of p soil fig 5c in the supporting information we added the simulations when the plant became weaker or stronger in embolism resistance all results point to the same relative differences across models i e same as shown in fig 5 in addition we show the differences in predicted g s between models fig 6 compared with the hbw model both the sperry model and the wang model predicted lower g s under wet conditions but predicted greater g s under dry conditions this finding is consistent with our results in figs 2 5 which indicate that the hbw model is more sensitive to soil moisture than the sperry model and wang model and behaves more conservatively under dry conditions 3 2 empirical testing 3 2 1 predictions of g s a and p l e a f the performance of the three models in fitting the anderegg et al 2018 data is shown in fig 7 for predictions of g s and a the three models performed equally well compared with the sperry and wang models fig 7a c the hbw model had a slightly smaller rmsd a slightly higher correlation coefficient and a standard deviation closer to the observation fig 7d e for the prediction of p leaf the hbw model and sperry model performed equally well however the wang model performed relatively poorly with a larger rmsd a smaller correlation coefficient and a standard deviation farther from observation fig 7f additionally in the sensitivity analyses of the key plant traits i e v m a x 25 and k max the model performances were quite similar across the sensitivity analyses tables s2 s4 in note s5 these results show that the hbw model is well supported by empirical observations and can capture the real stomatal responses to environments 3 2 2 distribution of balancing points fig 8 shows the actual distribution of bps for the anderegg et al 2018 data the bps were distributed almost everywhere except in the lower right corner but they were mainly distributed in a triangular area on the left in terms of density fig 8a the distribution of bps seems to be related to p soil because the red points i e those with more negative p soil were more concentrated in the lower left area fig 8b to present this connection more clearly we divided the bps into two parts by taking 2 m p a as the segmental point of p soil when p soil 2 m p a the high density area of the bp was distributed in the upper left area fig 8c however when p soil 2 m p a the high density area was concentrated in the lower left area fig 8d these results convey a key message as the p soil decreases the actual bp tends to shift to the more conservative area we show that the differences in the predicted bps between models that driven by real plant traits and environmental combination from anderegg data fig 9 point to the same relative differences as the theoretical analysis fig 5 the distributions of bps predicted by these three models differed from the actual case and only covered a part of the actual range nevertheless compared with the sperry model and wang model the bps of the hbw model were closer to reality first the bps of the hbw model were distributed in a triangular area on the left fig 9a which overlaps with the high density area of the actual bps to some extent fig 8a in contrast the bps of the sperry model and wang model were concentrated in the upper area and the upper left area respectively fig 9b c secondly as p soil decreased the bp of the hbw model showed a tendency to shift to the lower left area fig 9a indicating that it behaved more conservatively this captures the main response characteristic of the actual bp to soil moisture shown in fig 8c 8d while the sperry model and wang model do not in the sensitivity analyses of plants traits fig s12 in nots s5 the behavioral differences of bps between models are consistent with those shown in fig 9 these results suggest that the balancing rule implied in the hbw model especially its adaption to water stress is closer to the real stomatal behavior 3 2 3 variation in δ g s with soil moisture in the theoretical analysis we found that the three models differed in their soil moisture sensitivities therefore we evaluated the variation of the error of predicted g s with soil moisture fig 10 results show that the prediction errors δ g s of models were distributed asymmetrically on both sides of the reference i e δ g s 0 in terms of the mean δ g s three models showed a consistent variation with soil moisture although the degree varied that is δ g s was negative when the soil was wet and positive when the soil was drier compared with the sperry model and wang model the predicted g s of the hbw model was closer to the observation i e the average δ g s was closer to 0 fig 10 when p soil became more negative both the sperry model and wang model tended to overestimate g s to a greater extent as shown in right in fig 10 these results indicate that the sensitive response to soil moisture implied in the hbw model is more consistent with the empirical data 4 discussion in this study we propose a stomatal optimization model i e hbw model using multi objective programming and a weighted method unlike the existing optimization methods we clearly distinguished the risk of stomata opening and the weight ratio between gain and risk during modeling in contrast in the basic g a i n r i s k framework the actual risk and the potential weight ratio may be mixed in the risk function which invisibly increases the difficulty of finding a proper risk function in the hbw model the benefit and risk of stomata opening are represented by the relative values of photosynthesis and transpiration respectively equation 6 the weight ratio is quantified by the loss of canopy hydraulic conductance equation 7 under any combination of environments the optimal g s is considered to be the solution that maximizes the objective function formed by weighting two sub objectives equation 6 this model at least provides an alternative modeling method which gives straightforward suggestions for each component that constitutes the optimization objective 4 1 the hbw model is supported both theoretically and empirically we demonstrate that the hbw model can capture the realistic responses of stomata to environments the good performance of the hbw model is to be expected as the hbw model bears some mathematical similarities to the sperry model and wang model when we converted the hbw model into the a θ form eq s6 in note s1 we found that the hbw model implies a different risk function from existing models i e θ plc c a a max e e crit 1 this implied θ expression like those of the sperry model and wang model meets the criteria proposed by wang et al 2020 for an effective risk function fig s1 this provides mathematical support for the good performance of the hbw model in capturing typical stomatal responses to vpd c a and p soil the hbw model also shows the expected ability of the model based on plant hydraulics that is predicting the coordination of stomatal behavior and hydraulic traits across species see fig s3 in note s2 in addition according to the universal evaluation criteria wang et al 2020 the advantages of the sperry and wang models in application and prediction should carry over in the hbw model the test against the anderegg et al 2018 data proves this point as the hbw model performed equally well compared with the sperry model and wang model fig 7 what s more the g s prediction error of the hbw model was smaller than that of the sperry model and wang model at lower p soil fig 10 4 2 the hbw model offers a more conservative stomatal strategy revealed from the bp the balancing point bp effectively distinguishes the water carbon balancing rules implied by different optimization models in theoretical testing we found no significant difference in predicting typical responses of stomata to the environment despite differences in mathematical details of the models even though the hbw model was more sensitive to soil moisture than the sperry model and wang model their differences in the predicted values of g s were relatively small fig 6 the information that this slight numerical difference can convey is limited for instance all three models predict that g s will decrease as soil moisture decreases this behavior is generally understood that stomatal regulation becomes more conservative in response to drought it seems to imply that the balancing rules of these models are consistent i e as the water deficit intensifies the stomatal regulation tends to control water loss rather than increase carbon gain however from the perspective of bp this is clearly not the case when p soil became more negative the bps of the sperry model and wang model were still distributed in the area where a was relatively high and close to its maximum figs 5 9 in particular the bps of the sperry model even appeared in the area where a and e were both close to their maximum therefore from these points of view the stomatal regulation predicted by the sperry model or wang model even if the predicted g s is reduced during drought is not essentially a conservative behavior in contrast when p soil decreased the bps of the hbw model would shift to the area where a and e were both far away from their maximum this behavior of the hbw model reflects the adjustment of the stomatal strategy under drought i e becoming more conservative therefore our work shows that the bp serves as an effective indicator revealing the differences in stomatal optimization strategies implied by different models the hbw model predicts a more sensitive stomatal response to soil moisture implying a more conservative stomatal strategy we show that the actual bps tend to be distributed in more conservative areas as p soil decreases fig 8 this response of bp to soil moisture is captured only by the hbw model but not by the sperry and wang models this feature of the hbw model may be because we weighted the photosynthetic benefit by 1 plc c see equations 6 and 7 on the one hand mathematically doing so results in a new θ function under the a θ framework which differs from those of the sperry and wang models in shape and sensitivity to soil moisture see fig s2 in note s1 on the other hand in theory this means that when p leaf drops the plant s willingness to obtain carbon gain decreases i e there would be a down regulation of photosynthesis this can be explained by the feedback on photosynthesis from phloem transport due to the close hydraulic connection between the xylem and phloem thorpe and minchin 1996 holtta et al 2009 the phloem flow is sensitive to changes in water potential in the xylem of the leaf the lower the xylem water potential the more difficult it is for the phloem to maintain sufficient turgor to transport sugars sevanto 2014 this would slow phloem transport down resulting in carbohydrate accumulation which then causes the down regulation of photosynthesis nebauer et al 2011 for instance a previous study used a function of leaf sugar concentration to weight a and thus to model the down regulation of photosynthetic production nikinmaa et al 2013 therefore similarly the 1 plc c a a max term in the hbw model may indirectly represent this down regulation through changes in leaf water potential 4 3 implication and limitation of this study the sensitivity difference between the models to soil moisture matters most during drought conditions a meta analysis found that plant resistance to drought depends on timely stomatal closure martin stpaul et al 2017 the longer stomatal opening is maintained during drought the faster the decreases in soil and plant water potential finally leading to rapid mortality through hydraulic failure anderegg et al 2016 adams et al 2017 we show that the stomatal closure predicted by the hbw model is earlier than the sperry model and wang model figs 2 3 therefore when these optimization models are coupled into whole plant or ecological scale models their predictions regarding the degree to which plants are likely to suffer carbon limitation and hydraulic failure during drought periods may differ in this sense the hbw model can stand as a helpful comparison to existing optimization models while more work is needed to test and validate the hbw model at ecosystem scales and in multiple ecosystems our theoretical and empirical exercise at leaf level suggests that the conservative stomatal strategy implied by the hbw hypothesis may have substantial effects on predicted vegetation responses to drought events what s more given the simplicity of the optimization approach it can predict the transpiration of plants in any environment with measurable parameters this can be further combined with the budyko hypothesis to predict the changes in the coupled response of vegetation and hydrological processes to environment changes xin et al 2019 yu et al 2019 and to evaluate the role of vegetation on long term water balance in watersheds tang and wang 2017 there are some limitations to our research first we simply assumed that the weight factor α is equal to plc c however the critical closing tendency of stomata during drought seems to be an active process controlled by the extrusion of anions from guard cells rather than a passive process mediated directly by water potential brodribb mcadam 2011 therefore α may be affected by other factors that affect membrane polarization such as abscisic acid aba increased levels of aba lead to a depolarization of guard cell membranes triggering osmotic ion efflux and a loss of guard cell turgor resulting in the closure of stomata pantin et al 2012 bauer et al 2013 mcadam brodribb 2014 therefore α may be expressed as a piecewise function of water potential and aba for example when the leaf aba accumulates to a certain concentration α may rise sharply in this sense equation 6 can be readily improved by including more accurate descriptions of the physiology of α second α may also be optimized on long term scales to most efficiently use water for carbon gains at high α stomata will adopt a more conservative regulation strategy to reduce current water consumption this is a sensible behavior to avoid current inefficient water use or excess hydraulic embolism thus ensuring that plants can use saved water to capture more carbon in a more favorable environment in the future therefore hedging rules zeng et al 2021 may be used to characterize the different forms of α considering precipitation uncertainty which is helpful to predict the long term adaptive stomatal behavior of plants third we only focused on the response of the bp to soil moisture which may be only one of the potential characteristics of the bp nevertheless by modeling the response of bp to soil moisture the differences between models are effectively demonstrated we expect more efforts to explore the response patterns of bp to the environment through specially designed experiments which may be helpful to find more standards for evaluating and developing optimization models 5 conclusion in summary we demonstrate that the hbw model captures the realistic stomatal responses to environmental variables and performs well in the existing dataset crucially the hbw model differs from the existing models in predicting the response of the bp to soil moisture when p soil decreased the bp of the hbw model moved to a conservative area with lower a a max and e e crit while the bps of the sperry and wang models were still distributed in areas with higher a a max the hbw model better reproduces the actual bps distribution characteristic and offers a more conservative stomatal strategy than others our results emphasize the importance of distinguishing the balancing rules of different optimization models because inaccurate stomatal strategy would lead to deviations in the predicted stomatal response to water stress ultimately as a complement to the stomatal optimization models our work provides an alternative method to understand stomatal behavior and construct optimization models credit

2526,groundwater is an important freshwater supply for residents on islands without surface reservoirs where groundwater floats on top of seawater forming freshwater lenses previous analytical solutions of groundwater lens are developed based on two dimensional models in this study we first derived an analytical solution for steady state groundwater lens profiles i e the freshwater seawater interface under pumping conditions for a three dimensional rectangular island using this solution critical or maximum pumping rates without extracting saltwater can be conveniently estimated for wells or drains at different locations in a three dimensional rectangular island numerical models are simulated to validate the analytical solution results show that the critical pumping rate of a single well initially increases with the aspect ratio i e the ratio between island length and width and reaches a constant which is limited by the short island side in addition the critical pumping rate of a single well is the largest in the center of the domain and decreases as the well approaches the domain boundary as expected when a rectangular island has an aspect ratio equal to one i e a square island the critical pumping rate is close to a circular island for islands with a high aspect ratio the critical pumping rate increases with the pumping drain length which may be simplified to a two dimensional strip island model the derived analytical solution can be easily extended to include multiple pumping wells and drains and can potentially be used to optimize groundwater pumping in oceanic islands keywords groundwater lens three dimensional island analytical solution optimal pumping data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the inhabitants of many islands face a huge threat to freshwater supply because they are isolated from the mainland and lack surface freshwater such as lakes or rivers yoshimoto et al 2020 groundwater is their primary source of freshwater which floats on top of seawater due to the difference in density between freshwater and seawater dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 babu et al 2020 a transition zone is formed between freshwater and seawater the thickness of the transition zone depends on the dispersion in the aquifer and when the transition zone is much thinner than the thickness of the aquifer it can be described by a sharp interface lu et al 2009 lu and luo 2010 2014 rathore et al 2018a 2018b rathore et al 2020 groundwater lenses have been extensively studied over the past few decades based on the sharp interface assumption and the dupuit assumption a series of analytical solutions were derived to estimate the freshwater seawater interface profile fetter 1972 first derived an analytical solution for steady groundwater lens interfaces in strip and circular islands in homogeneous aquifers under uniform recharge conditions fetter s solution was extended to islands with two spatial recharge rates vacher 1988 islands with two horizontally layered aquifers ketabchi et al 2014 and islands with two vertically sliced aquifers lu et al 2019 tang et al 2020 2021a presented analytical solutions for transient groundwater lens profiles in strip islands under respectively time dependent and space dependent recharge conditions analytical solutions are efficient and easy to draw general conclusions but can only be obtained under simplified conditions for more complex hydrogeological conditions numerical models combined with laboratory and field investigations have been widely used in groundwater lens studies bedekar et al 2019 chui and terry 2012 2015 dose et al 2014 houben and post 2017 ketabchi et al 2014 memari et al 2020 post et al 2018 schneider and kruse 2006 stoeckl and houben 2012 stoeckl et al 2015 stoeckl et al 2016 the main factors influencing the groundwater lens include recharge hydrogeological aquifer properties and human activities pumping is the primary human activity that interferes with the flow and shape of groundwater lenses the interface between seawater and freshwater moves toward the pumping well forming a cone shaped interface known as saltwater upconing saltwater upconing studies have mainly focused on coastal areas where aquifers are recharged by horizontal flow from inland to ocean dagan and bear 1968 schmork and mercado 1969 strack 1972 zhang and hocking 1996 dagan and zeitoun 1998 bower et al 1999 zhang et al 2009 werner et al 2009 gopinath et al 2016 houben and post 2017 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 for groundwater pumping from island aquifers groundwater lenses are affected by the surrounding sea level and replenished by vertical recharge mainly from rainfall infiltration research on pumping water from groundwater lenses is limited pumping tests were conducted in ilovik island in the adriatic sea to estimate aquifer properties terzić et al 2021 tang et al 2021b derived an analytical solution of critical pumping rate for an infinite drain or array of wells in the middle of a strip island parallel to the long side of the island previous groundwater lens analytical models were limited to two dimensional models in which only one horizontal flow direction was considered fetter 1972 vacher 1988 ketabchi et al 2014 lu et al 2019 tang et al 2021a tang et al 2021b two dimensional polar and cartesian coordinate systems can represent the slice of a circular island and the cross section of a strip island respectively strip islands are defined as islands whose length is much greater than their width so we only consider vertical cross sections with the boundary effect on the long side however if a single pumping well is considered such a two dimensional model is not valid because the effect of pumping is not uniform in space and the further away from the pumping well the weaker the effect therefore it is not possible to determine a representative cross section for pumping water in a strip island or we must assume it is a pumping trench across the island in addition if the long side of an island is not long enough compared to the width all boundary effects need to be considered in general for the above cases mentioned we need to consider two flow directions in the horizontal plane and simulate a three dimensional model to the best of our knowledge there are no analytical models for such three dimensional groundwater lenses the goal of this study is to derive an analytical solution for the freshwater seawater interface for pumping from groundwater lenses in three dimensional islands the critical pumping rate of a pumping well or a pumping drain i e the maximum pumping rate without seawater intrusion at any location of three dimensional islands can be conveniently calculated from the derived analytical solution numerical models are simulated to validate the analytical solution sensitivity analysis is performed in terms of pumping and island geometry conditions we also compare the critical pumping rates of circular strip and three dimensional islands 2 method 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 shows the conceptual model of a groundwater lens under pumping in a three dimensional island which is surrounded by a constant sea level the rectangular island has width a l and length b l a groundwater lens is formed due to rainfall infiltration at a recharge rate ω l t and pressure balance between freshwater and seawater the freshwater seawater transition zone is approximated by a sharp interface lu et al 2009 lu and luo 2010 2014 rathore et al 2018a 2018b rathore et al 2020 the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic and of sufficiently large thickness containing a fully developed groundwater lens fetter 1972 vacher 1988 the groundwater lens thickness is determined by the vertical distance between the freshwater seawater interface and the groundwater table where the distance between the interface and sea level is defined as h l and the distance between the groundwater table and sea level is defined as h l according to the ghyben herzberg approximation we have h δ h where δ ρ s ρ f ρ f and ρ s m l3 and ρ f m l3 are seawater and freshwater density respectively according to the dupuit assumption the groundwater flow is assumed to be horizontal i e the potential at points along a vertical line is equal to h the interface moves towards the pumping well under pumping as fig 1 b shows 2 2 analytical approach we first consider the conceptual model in the absence of groundwater pumping i e the groundwater lens

multiple pumping wells and drains eq 14 describes the lens interface profile under recharge ω and specific pumping rate q in addition to the interface delineation the key point of saltwater upconing is to prevent the apex of the interface upconing from entering the pumping well therefore we can estimate the critical or maximum pumping rate of a pumping well or drain by setting the depth of the apex equal to the well penetration depth tang et al 2021b for simplicity we can estimate the critical pumping rate by setting h 2 x w y w 0 which corresponds to zero lens thickness at the pumping

which corresponds to the maximum ratio of pumped water to total aquifer recharge 2 3 validation of analytical solution we validate the analytical solution using a numerical model solved by the variable density code seawat langevin et al 2003 which combines flow and solute transport models the domain size is 200 m 400 m 10 m each grid is 1 m 1 m 1 m and the total number of grids for the numerical model is 800 000 four sides of the first layer are fixed head to represent the constant sea level a 2 m 2 m single well is located at the center of the island for pumping water from the groundwater lens the hydrogeological parameters of the numerical model are shown in table 1 ketabchi et al 2014 fang et al 2021 tang et al 2021b the specific critical pumping rate q critical is estimated to be 1 187 m day by eq 15 which corresponds to the critical pumping rate q critical of 4 748 m3 day fig 2 shows the comparison between numerical and analytical results the 3d map clearly shows the freshwater seawater interface being pumped to the sea level at the well location x 100 m and y 200 m we choose cross sections along x 100 m 110 m 150 m and y 200 m 210 m 250 m to show the comparison the black lines given by the analytical solution are in good agreement with the numerical simulation the effect of pumping on interface changes deceases rapidly with the distance from the pumping well at cross sections along x 150 m and y 250 m the effect drops to a weak level indicated by smooth interfaces 3 results and discussion eqs 14 and 15 provide tools to evaluate how hydrogeological conditions affect the interface profile and critical pumping rate for example the critical pumping rate is linearly proportional to the constant recharge rate while the square of the lens thickness is inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity these relationships are consistent with findings revealed by the 2d solution tang et al 2021b in the following we will discuss the effect of unique parameters in 3d systems 3 1 effect of aspect ratio of rectangular island the dimensionless formula eq 18 clearly indicates that the aspect ratio of the rectangular island is a key parameter influencing the lens interface fig 3 shows that for a centrally located pumping well as the validation case above the critical pumping rate initially increases with the aspect ratio b a for a given island width because when a is fixed a higher b a represents a longer island containing a larger groundwater lens from which more groundwater can be withdrawn when b a is high enough i e a long strip island the critical pumping rate of the single well reaches a steady state constrained by the domain width in such a case the critical pumping rate does not increase even though the groundwater lens is enlarged for a given aspect ratio the critical pumping rate increases with island size because the groundwater lens increases with island size fig 3 b shows that for different a the normalized critical pumping rate versus b a curve is the same the critical pumping rate is normalized by the maximum value of the corresponding curve in fig 3 a confirming that the dimensionless system is valid and the aspect ratio plays a key role a special case is a rectangular island with an aspect ratio equal to one square island fig 3 a also compares the critical pumping rate of a 2 m 2 m well located at the center of a square island with a 1 m radius well at the center of a circular island with a diameter equal to the width of the square island fig 3 a shows that the critical pumping rates for these two islands are very close within 10 difference 3 2 effect of well location the critical pumping rate of pumping wells at different locations of the island can be easily calculated using the derived analytical solution fig 4 shows the critical pumping percentage of a fix size well of 2 m 2 m along the middle line and diagonal of the square island the critical pumping percentage described by eq 19 represents the maximum ratio of pumped water to total recharge received by the groundwater lens when the well is at the center of the island the pumping well has a maximum critical pumping percentage the critical pumping percentage decereases as the well approaches the boundary of the island when the well is of a fixed size it can pump a higher percentage of recharge amount from a smaller island 3 3 effect of pumping drain length the pumping drain can be simulated by adjusting l 1 l 2 l 3 and l 4 in eq 12 we examined the effect of the drain length along the length of the island i e y axis on the critical pumping rate for islands with different aspect ratio b a when b a is larger the island is more likely to be approximated as a strip island for a strip island defined as the island with length much longer than its width the critical pumping percentage is 0 5 tang et al 2021b fig 5 shows that the peak of the curve is closer to 0 5 when the value of b a is higher the critical pumping percentage increases as the drain length increases over most of drain lengths and decreases sharply when the edge of the drain is very close to the domain boundary the thickness of the freshwater lens is thin around the domain boundary where the extent of the mixing zone is comparable with the thickness of the freshwater lens therefore pumping from the areas near domain boundaries is not recommended in fig 6 we simulated an island of 200 m 400 m the same as table 1 with a pumping drain of 320 m which is 80 of the entire island length analytical solutions are in good agreement with the numerical simulation in fig 6 which verifies the applicability of the analytical solution to the freshwater lens under the condition of long drain pumping 4 conclusion in this study we derive an analytical solution for freshwater lens profiles under pumping in a three dimensional rectangular island based on this analytical solution critical or maximum pumping rates without extracting saltwater can be conveniently estimated for wells or drains at different locations in a three dimensional rectangular island numerical models are simulated to validate the analytical solution for the freshwater lens under a pumping well or drain the analytical solution shows that the critical pumping rate is linearly proportional to the constant recharge rate while the square of the lens thickness is inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity given the island width the critical pumping rate increases with the aspect ratio i e increasing island length and reaches a constant constrained by the island width the critical pumping rate is the largest when the well is located in the center of the island and decreases as the well approaches the boundary of the island we specifically investigate two special cases of rectangular islands square islands aspect ratio 1 and rectangular islands with high aspect ratios and pumping drains the critical pumping rate for a square island is close to that of a circular island of the same size for a rectangular island with a high aspect ratio the critical pumping percentage for a long pumping drain is close to 0 5 which is the critical pumping percentage for a 2d strip island due to the linearity of the equations approximating the interface profile our analytical solution can be easily extended to describe multiple pumping wells and drains thus we may use this solution to optimize groundwater pumping from island aquifers in addition the solution can also be extended to include spatially distributed recharge rates that can characterize the effects of land type and cover our solution is limited by dupuit assumption the sharp interface assumption and the homogeneity of the aquifer when the magnitude of recharge is comparable to hydraulic conductivity of aquifer dupuit assumption fails and models of three dimensional flow should be considered for thick freshwater seawater transition zones a correction factor may be used or a salinity threshold needs to be defined to determine the critical pumping rate for heterogeneous aquifers analytical solutions may be available for stratified aquifers but in general numerical models are necessary the recharge is also assumed constant but the realistic recharge is time dependent the corresponding pumping rate should also change with time

2526,groundwater is an important freshwater supply for residents on islands without surface reservoirs where groundwater floats on top of seawater forming freshwater lenses previous analytical solutions of groundwater lens are developed based on two dimensional models in this study we first derived an analytical solution for steady state groundwater lens profiles i e the freshwater seawater interface under pumping conditions for a three dimensional rectangular island using this solution critical or maximum pumping rates without extracting saltwater can be conveniently estimated for wells or drains at different locations in a three dimensional rectangular island numerical models are simulated to validate the analytical solution results show that the critical pumping rate of a single well initially increases with the aspect ratio i e the ratio between island length and width and reaches a constant which is limited by the short island side in addition the critical pumping rate of a single well is the largest in the center of the domain and decreases as the well approaches the domain boundary as expected when a rectangular island has an aspect ratio equal to one i e a square island the critical pumping rate is close to a circular island for islands with a high aspect ratio the critical pumping rate increases with the pumping drain length which may be simplified to a two dimensional strip island model the derived analytical solution can be easily extended to include multiple pumping wells and drains and can potentially be used to optimize groundwater pumping in oceanic islands keywords groundwater lens three dimensional island analytical solution optimal pumping data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the inhabitants of many islands face a huge threat to freshwater supply because they are isolated from the mainland and lack surface freshwater such as lakes or rivers yoshimoto et al 2020 groundwater is their primary source of freshwater which floats on top of seawater due to the difference in density between freshwater and seawater dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 babu et al 2020 a transition zone is formed between freshwater and seawater the thickness of the transition zone depends on the dispersion in the aquifer and when the transition zone is much thinner than the thickness of the aquifer it can be described by a sharp interface lu et al 2009 lu and luo 2010 2014 rathore et al 2018a 2018b rathore et al 2020 groundwater lenses have been extensively studied over the past few decades based on the sharp interface assumption and the dupuit assumption a series of analytical solutions were derived to estimate the freshwater seawater interface profile fetter 1972 first derived an analytical solution for steady groundwater lens interfaces in strip and circular islands in homogeneous aquifers under uniform recharge conditions fetter s solution was extended to islands with two spatial recharge rates vacher 1988 islands with two horizontally layered aquifers ketabchi et al 2014 and islands with two vertically sliced aquifers lu et al 2019 tang et al 2020 2021a presented analytical solutions for transient groundwater lens profiles in strip islands under respectively time dependent and space dependent recharge conditions analytical solutions are efficient and easy to draw general conclusions but can only be obtained under simplified conditions for more complex hydrogeological conditions numerical models combined with laboratory and field investigations have been widely used in groundwater lens studies bedekar et al 2019 chui and terry 2012 2015 dose et al 2014 houben and post 2017 ketabchi et al 2014 memari et al 2020 post et al 2018 schneider and kruse 2006 stoeckl and houben 2012 stoeckl et al 2015 stoeckl et al 2016 the main factors influencing the groundwater lens include recharge hydrogeological aquifer properties and human activities pumping is the primary human activity that interferes with the flow and shape of groundwater lenses the interface between seawater and freshwater moves toward the pumping well forming a cone shaped interface known as saltwater upconing saltwater upconing studies have mainly focused on coastal areas where aquifers are recharged by horizontal flow from inland to ocean dagan and bear 1968 schmork and mercado 1969 strack 1972 zhang and hocking 1996 dagan and zeitoun 1998 bower et al 1999 zhang et al 2009 werner et al 2009 gopinath et al 2016 houben and post 2017 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 for groundwater pumping from island aquifers groundwater lenses are affected by the surrounding sea level and replenished by vertical recharge mainly from rainfall infiltration research on pumping water from groundwater lenses is limited pumping tests were conducted in ilovik island in the adriatic sea to estimate aquifer properties terzić et al 2021 tang et al 2021b derived an analytical solution of critical pumping rate for an infinite drain or array of wells in the middle of a strip island parallel to the long side of the island previous groundwater lens analytical models were limited to two dimensional models in which only one horizontal flow direction was considered fetter 1972 vacher 1988 ketabchi et al 2014 lu et al 2019 tang et al 2021a tang et al 2021b two dimensional polar and cartesian coordinate systems can represent the slice of a circular island and the cross section of a strip island respectively strip islands are defined as islands whose length is much greater than their width so we only consider vertical cross sections with the boundary effect on the long side however if a single pumping well is considered such a two dimensional model is not valid because the effect of pumping is not uniform in space and the further away from the pumping well the weaker the effect therefore it is not possible to determine a representative cross section for pumping water in a strip island or we must assume it is a pumping trench across the island in addition if the long side of an island is not long enough compared to the width all boundary effects need to be considered in general for the above cases mentioned we need to consider two flow directions in the horizontal plane and simulate a three dimensional model to the best of our knowledge there are no analytical models for such three dimensional groundwater lenses the goal of this study is to derive an analytical solution for the freshwater seawater interface for pumping from groundwater lenses in three dimensional islands the critical pumping rate of a pumping well or a pumping drain i e the maximum pumping rate without seawater intrusion at any location of three dimensional islands can be conveniently calculated from the derived analytical solution numerical models are simulated to validate the analytical solution sensitivity analysis is performed in terms of pumping and island geometry conditions we also compare the critical pumping rates of circular strip and three dimensional islands 2 method 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 shows the conceptual model of a groundwater lens under pumping in a three dimensional island which is surrounded by a constant sea level the rectangular island has width a l and length b l a groundwater lens is formed due to rainfall infiltration at a recharge rate ω l t and pressure balance between freshwater and seawater the freshwater seawater transition zone is approximated by a sharp interface lu et al 2009 lu and luo 2010 2014 rathore et al 2018a 2018b rathore et al 2020 the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic and of sufficiently large thickness containing a fully developed groundwater lens fetter 1972 vacher 1988 the groundwater lens thickness is determined by the vertical distance between the freshwater seawater interface and the groundwater table where the distance between the interface and sea level is defined as h l and the distance between the groundwater table and sea level is defined as h l according to the ghyben herzberg approximation we have h δ h where δ ρ s ρ f ρ f and ρ s m l3 and ρ f m l3 are seawater and freshwater density respectively according to the dupuit assumption the groundwater flow is assumed to be horizontal i e the potential at points along a vertical line is equal to h the interface moves towards the pumping well under pumping as fig 1 b shows 2 2 analytical approach we first consider the conceptual model in the absence of groundwater pumping i e the groundwater lens

numerical model is 800 000 four sides of the first layer are fixed head to represent the constant sea level a 2 m 2 m single well is located at the center of the island for pumping water from the groundwater lens the hydrogeological parameters of the numerical model are shown in table 1 ketabchi et al 2014 fang et al 2021 tang et al 2021b the specific critical pumping rate q critical is estimated to be 1 187 m day by eq 15 which corresponds to the critical pumping rate q critical of 4 748 m3 day fig 2 shows the comparison between numerical and analytical results the 3d map clearly shows the freshwater seawater interface being pumped to the sea level at the well location x 100 m and y 200 m we choose cross sections along x 100 m 110 m 150 m and y 200 m 210 m 250 m to show the comparison the black lines given by the analytical solution are in good agreement with the numerical simulation the effect of pumping on interface changes deceases rapidly with the distance from the pumping well at cross sections along x 150 m and y 250 m the effect drops to a weak level indicated by smooth interfaces 3 results and discussion eqs 14 and 15 provide tools to evaluate how hydrogeological conditions affect the interface profile and critical pumping rate for example the critical pumping rate is linearly proportional to the constant recharge rate while the square of the lens thickness is inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity these relationships are consistent with findings revealed by the 2d solution tang et al 2021b in the following we will discuss the effect of unique parameters in 3d systems 3 1 effect of aspect ratio of rectangular island the dimensionless formula eq 18 clearly indicates that the aspect ratio of the rectangular island is a key parameter influencing the lens interface fig 3 shows that for a centrally located pumping well as the validation case above the critical pumping rate initially increases with the aspect ratio b a for a given island width because when a is fixed a higher b a represents a longer island containing a larger groundwater lens from which more groundwater can be withdrawn when b a is high enough i e a long strip island the critical pumping rate of the single well reaches a steady state constrained by the domain width in such a case the critical pumping rate does not increase even though the groundwater lens is enlarged for a given aspect ratio the critical pumping rate increases with island size because the groundwater lens increases with island size fig 3 b shows that for different a the normalized critical pumping rate versus b a curve is the same the critical pumping rate is normalized by the maximum value of the corresponding curve in fig 3 a confirming that the dimensionless system is valid and the aspect ratio plays a key role a special case is a rectangular island with an aspect ratio equal to one square island fig 3 a also compares the critical pumping rate of a 2 m 2 m well located at the center of a square island with a 1 m radius well at the center of a circular island with a diameter equal to the width of the square island fig 3 a shows that the critical pumping rates for these two islands are very close within 10 difference 3 2 effect of well location the critical pumping rate of pumping wells at different locations of the island can be easily calculated using the derived analytical solution fig 4 shows the critical pumping percentage of a fix size well of 2 m 2 m along the middle line and diagonal of the square island the critical pumping percentage described by eq 19 represents the maximum ratio of pumped water to total recharge received by the groundwater lens when the well is at the center of the island the pumping well has a maximum critical pumping percentage the critical pumping percentage decereases as the well approaches the boundary of the island when the well is of a fixed size it can pump a higher percentage of recharge amount from a smaller island 3 3 effect of pumping drain length the pumping drain can be simulated by adjusting l 1 l 2 l 3 and l 4 in eq 12 we examined the effect of the drain length along the length of the island i e y axis on the critical pumping rate for islands with different aspect ratio b a when b a is larger the island is more likely to be approximated as a strip island for a strip island defined as the island with length much longer than its width the critical pumping percentage is 0 5 tang et al 2021b fig 5 shows that the peak of the curve is closer to 0 5 when the value of b a is higher the critical pumping percentage increases as the drain length increases over most of drain lengths and decreases sharply when the edge of the drain is very close to the domain boundary the thickness of the freshwater lens is thin around the domain boundary where the extent of the mixing zone is comparable with the thickness of the freshwater lens therefore pumping from the areas near domain boundaries is not recommended in fig 6 we simulated an island of 200 m 400 m the same as table 1 with a pumping drain of 320 m which is 80 of the entire island length analytical solutions are in good agreement with the numerical simulation in fig 6 which verifies the applicability of the analytical solution to the freshwater lens under the condition of long drain pumping 4 conclusion in this study we derive an analytical solution for freshwater lens profiles under pumping in a three dimensional rectangular island based on this analytical solution critical or maximum pumping rates without extracting saltwater can be conveniently estimated for wells or drains at different locations in a three dimensional rectangular island numerical models are simulated to validate the analytical solution for the freshwater lens under a pumping well or drain the analytical solution shows that the critical pumping rate is linearly proportional to the constant recharge rate while the square of the lens thickness is inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity given the island width the critical pumping rate increases with the aspect ratio i e increasing island length and reaches a constant constrained by the island width the critical pumping rate is the largest when the well is located in the center of the island and decreases as the well approaches the boundary of the island we specifically investigate two special cases of rectangular islands square islands aspect ratio 1 and rectangular islands with high aspect ratios and pumping drains the critical pumping rate for a square island is close to that of a circular island of the same size for a rectangular island with a high aspect ratio the critical pumping percentage for a long pumping drain is close to 0 5 which is the critical pumping percentage for a 2d strip island due to the linearity of the equations approximating the interface profile our analytical solution can be easily extended to describe multiple pumping wells and drains thus we may use this solution to optimize groundwater pumping from island aquifers in addition the solution can also be extended to include spatially distributed

2527,a comprehensive understanding of nitrate dynamics in rivers is vital for nitrogen management especially for the karst zone with high leaching of nitrate producing potential risk to environmental quality however identification of the source transformation pathway of nitrate is limited in the karst rivers thus a suit of hydrogeochemical parameters including δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ13c dic δ18o h2o soil related parameters doc and geogenic ions mg2 dic were used to identify nitrate sources and dynamics in the wujiang river a typical karstic river as a tributary of changjiang river the combined use of a conceptual model of normalized no3 and doc and other hydrogeochemical parameters δ13c dic mg2 dic suggested that most nitrates were transported through the soil epikarst pathway in the wet season whereas 70 of nitrates were transported through groundwater pathway in the dry season for wujiang river nitrification and mixing were the dominant processes meanwhile 31 of nitrate was denitrified in the wet season in this study the reanalysis of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for reported karstic rivers in china and worldwide also revealed the predominant nitrification and denitrification in karst regions the bayesian model indicated that chemical fertilizer cf 42 and soil organic nitrogen son 32 contributed the most in the wet season while 60 of nitrate originated from son 31 and manure and sewage wastes m s 30 in the dry season in the wujiang river the sustained contribution of non point sources from nitrification through the soil epikarst pathway might be related to the widespread porosities in the karst rivers thus measures to reduce nitrogen leaching and improve fertilizer use efficiency should be considered like water and soil conservation slow release fertilizer and nitrification inhibitors additionally a suit of hydrogeochemical indicators proves to be helpful for identification of source transformation and transport pathway of nitrate in the karst basin keywords karst river hydrogeochemical compositions nitrate isotopes temporal source apportionment transport pathway data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction karst aquifers provide water sources for 25 of the world s population with increasing concerns about water quality deterioration due to its hydrological vulnerability to pollutants associated with fast infiltration and rapid transport of water ford and williams 2013 hartmann et al 2014 excessive inputs of reactive nitrogen to aquatic ecosystems have led to many eco environmental problems and human health impacts like eutrophication water acidification blue baby syndrome and cancer galloway et al 2008 kendall et al 2007 li et al 2022 matiatos et al 2021 yu et al 2019 nitrate as one of the major dissolved nitrogen species is reported to be a common contaminant in karst rivers chen et al 2021 liu et al 2006 2021 lorette et al 2020 yue et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 the major drivers of nitrate levels include nitrate sources such as fertilizer municipal sewage soil nitrogen atmosphere deposition transformations such as nitrification and denitrification and hydrogeologic characteristics such as hydrologic connectivity hydrologic pathways hu et al 2019 husic et al 2019 kendall et al 2007 thus deciphering the cross couplings of source transformation pathway under varied hydrologic conditions is vital for nitrogen pollution remediation and water quality management for the karst basins numerous studies focus on the nitrate source identification in karstic basins using coupled isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 δ18o no3 which prove useful in the apportionment of nitrate source and transformation since different nitrate sources are featured with distinctive isotopic signatures jiang et al 2021 rock and mayer 2004 yang et al 2020 yin et al 2020 for example nitrification derived nitrates have lower δ18o no3 values 10 to 10 than that of nitrate fertilizer 17 to 25 and atmospheric deposition 60 kendall et al 2007 however identification of nitrate source transformation pathway under various hydrological conditions is limited particularly for karstic rivers husic et al 2019 wang et al 2020c yue et al 2020 nitrate laden water experiences three pathways before flowing into rivers including dilute quick flow from overland flow and direct precipitation slow groundwater flow and concentrated quick flow from subsurface flow miller et al 2017 husic et al 2019 toran and white 2005 it is hypothesized that different water origins have distinguished hydrogeochemical characteristics thus the flow pathways can be distinguished using high frequency monitoring of hydrogeochemical parameters such as discharge δ13c dic soil related proxies e g doc and carbonate weathering related proxies dissolved inorganic carbon dic although these parameters have been applied to trace water origins hartmann et al 2014 lee and krothe 2001 lorette et al 2020 there is a lack of combined studies using the above parameters to disclose the transport pathway of nitrate considering data accessibility combined use of the easy to obtain hydrogeochemical parameters and nitrate related parameters might be helpful to identify the transport pathway of nitrate and might also be useful for reanalysis of historical data to disclose historical nitrate fate besides high frequency monitoring is needed to better understand the response of nitrogen dynamics to hydrological and biogeochemical processes as important signals might respond quickly to the discharge changes jones et al 2017 husic et al 2019 yi et al 2020 yue et al 2020 for example yue et al 2020 found that high rainfall events promote nitrate loss from the karst watershed as a result of enhanced hydraulic connectivity between the nitrate source areas and the nitrate stored in the karst matrix based on high frequency monitoring of nitrate isotopes changjiang river is the largest river in china providing abundant water resources for the socioeconomic development of china li et al 2010 wujiang river an important tributary of changjiang river flows through a typical karst basin of southwest china also wujiang river flows into the three gorges reservoir tgr and its higher nitrate concentrations compared to other input rivers of tgr have raised great concern chen et al 2021 li et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 given the above scientific challenges and water quality situation in the kart rivers the main objectives of this study are 1 to distinguish transport pathways of nitrate in wujiang river using a suit of hydrogeochemical indicators such as discharge δ13c dic soil related parameters doc and geogenic ions mg2 dic 2 to identify the sources and transformations of nitrate in wujiang river using multiple isotopes δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o and to estimate the proportion of nitrate sources using a bayesian model and 3 to gain an in depth understanding of nitrate fate in karst rivers by making a summary and reanalysis of different karst rivers from previously published documents 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wujiang river is in east of yunnan guizhou plateau a well known karst region of southwestern china fig 1 the studied river covers a total area of 87 900 km2 with 76 draining in karst areas liu 2007 the mainstream extends for approximately 1037 km the climate of the wujiang river basin belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual air temperature of upstream and downstream being 14 1 c and 17 4 c respectively the average annual precipitation in the upstream and downstream was 965 mm and 1125 mm respectively liang et al 2017 it has abundant water resources with an average annual discharge of 487 8 108 m3 during the period from 1956 to 2010 changjiang sediment bulletin 2014 the altitudes of wujiang river decrease from west to east with a drop of 2124 m its main land use includes forest land 50 cultivated land 31 and grassland 18 wang 2011 the main nitrogen fertilizer in guizhou province includes manure urea ammonium bicarbonate synthetic fertilizer and diammonium phosphate zeng et al 2020 the annual consumption of nitrogen fertilizer in guizhou province increased from 43 3 104 tons in 2004 to 52 0 104 tons in 2014 nbsc 1999 2015 2 2 sampling and analyses river samples were collected every month at the mouth of the wujiang river fig 1 from november 2013 to october 2014 five water samples were taken during the dry season of wujiang river considering the relatively stable variation of discharge in the dry season and more samples twenty nine were taken in the wet season considering the large variation of discharge the sampling time was selected before and after rain events based on the weather forecast thus the water samples were obtained with the rise and fall of discharge fig s1 the water samples were filtrated by 0 22 μm and stored below 20 c the concentrations of nitrogen species were measured immediately which would be measured again before isotope analysis to evaluate the change of nitrogen species concentration particularly nitrate and nitrite overall this storage way can well keep the samples coupled isotopes of nitrate were determined bimonthly in the dry season considering the relatively stable sources of nitrate during the low discharge period while more samples were measured for isotopes of nitrate in the wet season based on its large variations during the high discharge period nitrate isotopes were determined by the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 in short denitrifying bacteria converted nitrate to n2o and its nitrogen and oxygen isotope values were measured by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv uk the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate were calibrated using usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 iaea no3 and experimental reference materials with the standard errors of 0 3 and 0 5 respectively yue et al 2020 the nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios are expressed using delta δ notation in per mill relative to air nitrogen and vsmow respectively the supporting dataset can be found in our previous study zhong et al 2017 in relation to major ionic concentrations no3 mg2 dic doc δ13c dic and δ18o h2o values 2 3 statistics and calculations the seasonal difference was tested using one way anova in no3 concentrations whereas kruskal wallis non parametric test k w test was used in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values due to their non normal distribution a bayesian mixing model was used to estimate the proportional contributions of nitrate sources which has been applied in many studies parnell et al 2010 ryu et al 2021 torres martinez et al 2021 xia et al 2017 xuan et al 2022 the bayesian mixing model was run in a software package siar with set up parameters of residual error and process error term as well as uninformative priors the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of endmembers and isotopic fractionation were listed in table s1 the details of siar can be found in the supplemental information text s1 3 results 3 1 temporal variations in nitrate concentrations with hydrological conditions in the wujiang river the no3 n concentrations ranged from 0 16 to 3 41 mg l 1 zhong et al 2017 with a significantly higher average value 2 90 0 44 mg l 1 in the dry season than that of the wet season 1 97 0 84 mg l 1 anova p 0 05 in contrast the coefficient of variation cv of no3 n concentrations was lower in the dry season 15 than that of the wet season 43 reflecting a large variation in no3 n concentrations under the high flow conditions fig 2 a and b show the temporal variations in no3 n concentrations in response to varied hydrologic conditions in the wujiang river in terms of discharge it varied seasonally with an average of 566 m3 s and 2457 m3 s in the dry season and wet season respectively three discharge peaks were recorded in june and july fig s1 the discharge influenced the no3 n concentrations with large variations of no3 n concentrations in the wet season and little variations in the dry season during three peaks of discharge in june and july no3 n concentrations increased and decreased with the rise and fall of discharge fig s1 however the peaks of no3 concentration lagged discharge peaks to better elucidate the response of nitrate to hydrology in the wet season the correlation was analyzed between discharge and nitrate concentrations the discharge of 6000 m3 s twice as high as the average discharge was defined as extremely high discharge according to the study of zhong et al 2017 when discharge was lower than 6000 m3 s the no3 concentrations showed a positive correlation with discharge fig s2 when the discharge was higher than 6000 m3 s peak 3 fig s2 no3 concentration fluctuated during the period of rising discharge which was different from that of discharge peaks lower than 6000 m3 s 3 2 temporal variations in coupled isotopes of nitrate for wujiang river the δ15n no3 in the wujiang river varied from 5 4 to 11 1 with a mean value of 6 8 1 5 fig 2 seasonally the wujiang river had a significantly higher mean value k w test p 0 05 in the dry season 8 9 1 7 than that of the wet season 6 5 1 3 however the cv of δ15n no3 values in the dry season is roughly equal to the wet season the δ18o no3 values ranged from 0 3 to 5 9 with a mean value of 2 2 1 6 the dry season had a significantly higher mean value p 0 05 of δ18o no3 3 8 1 0 than that of the wet season 2 0 1 5 both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values showed a wider range in the wet season compared with the dry season considering the minus values of δ18o no3 values the variance was calculated to assess the amplitude of variation instead of cv the δ18o no3 values in the dry season showed a higher variance than that in the wet season 3 3 source proportions of nitrate in the wujiang river given the land use types in the wujiang river watershed the potential origins of nitrate include chemical fertilizer cf soil organic nitrogen son manure sewage wastes m s and atmospheric precipitation ap the proportional contributions of above four nitrate sources were calculated by a bayesian model parnell et al 2010 with the isotopic fractionation from denitrification considered fig 3 the model outputs reflected the seasonal variations in the proportional contribution of nitrate sources in the wet season nitrate was mainly derived from cf 42 and son 32 followed by m s 17 and ap 9 while in the dry season son 31 and m s 30 contributed the most cf was intermediate 26 and ap contributed the least 12 the soil organic nitrogen contribution in the wet season was close to the dry season which did not increase greatly in the wet season as expected 4 discussion 4 1 transport pathways of nitrate constrained by hydrochemical parameters in wujiang river in the wujiang river ca2 mg2 dic are reported to be mainly derived from carbonate weathering even though reservoirs along the mainstream affected the major ions to some extent wang et al 2020a zhong et al 2017 furthermore groundwater was characterized by relatively high concentrations of ca2 mg2 dic and no3 compared with soil water in the wujiang river basin and nearby chongqing municipality wang et al 2020b c thus the variations in rock weathering related ions may provide information on nitrate pathways in the wujiang river given their different pattern among varied hydrologic pathways to test this hypothesis the correlation was analyzed between nitrate concentration and geogenic ions in the wujiang river fig 4 the result shows a significant positive relationship between concentrations of no3 and mg2 dic in the dry season of wujiang river fig 4a and b which might indicate their similar hydrological flow pathways other karstic rivers like the xijiang river and lijiang river also exhibited a similar pattern between concentrations of no3 and mg2 dic in the dry season li et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 because baseflow in the dry season is mainly recharged by groundwater and the antecedent stored water in the karst matrix hartmann et al 2014 wang et al 2020c the transit pathway of nitrate in the dry season can be inferred that is nitrate contained groundwater and soil water transported into the wujiang river along with the geogenic ions in a relatively conservative way because of reduced biological activities under a relatively dry and cold condition interestingly the correlation of no3 concentrations and ca2 concentrations were relatively weak compared with that of no3 of and mg2 concentrations in the wujiang river which might be related to biogeochemical processes affecting ca2 variations for example carbonate precipitation in the wujiang basin wang et al 2020a δ13c dic values are reported as a tracer of the hydrologic pathway in karst basins given that biological process generates relatively light δ13c dic values in soil and epikarst zones while dissolution of carbonate results in relatively heavy δ13c dic values in groundwater pathway lee and krothe 2001 husic et al 2019 in the wujiang river there is a significant correlation between δ13c dic values and mg2 concentrations in the dry season fig 4c which was caused by the mixing of groundwater with higher δ13c dic values and mg2 concentrations and soil water with lower δ13c dic values and mg2 concentrations thus the nitrate pathways include groundwater and soil water pathway in the dry season of wujiang river fig 5 a which is consistent with the above hypothesis via chemical compositions a linear two endmembers mixing model was used to estimate the proportions of groundwater and soil water pathways this estimate indicated that groundwater pathway accounted for 75 when using δ13c dic values as endmember composition and 71 when using mg2 concentrations as endmember composition which confirmed the dominance of groundwater pathway in the dry season for wujiang river fig 5a in contrast no significant correlation was observed between no3 and rock weathering derived ions in the wet season of wujiang river which might be ascribed to a shift in transport pathway or complicated sources and or active nitrogen transformation process like nitrification under a humid and warm condition according to a study in an observatory in the wujiang basin groundwater flow remained at a low level 13 10 3 m3 s when no surface runoff occurred while it rose to 154 10 3 m3 s when surface runoff occurred after rainfall in the wet season wang et al 2022 this suggested a variable transport way of nitrate during the wet season dissolved organic carbon was reported to be an infiltration marker in karst basins hartmann et al 2014 lorette et al 2020 the relationship between normalized no3 and normalized doc is reported to distinguish water origins either from surface runoff or water from unsaturated zone in a karst system lorette et al 2020 specifically speaking water from surface runoff is expected to have greater variable doc than no3 a slope of docnorm no3 norm diagram 1 while unsaturated zone has greater variable no3 than doc a slope of docnorm no3 norm diagram 1 fig 6 a during the period of high discharge in karst system lorette et al 2020 thus we tried to use this conceptual model to decipher the transport pathways of nitrate fig 6b showed that most data have greater variable no3 than doc slope 1 during high discharge that is nitrate was mainly transported through soil and epikarst zone rather than groundwater pathway of note some points have a greater variable doc than no3 slope 1 during discharge peaks 1 and 3 which suggested that some nitrate was moved through surface flow thus nitrate was mainly transported through subsurface flow in the wet season with surface flow occurring during some periods fig 5b 4 2 nitrate transformation in wujiang river denitrification and nitrification drive the attenuation and production of nitrate respectively which can be identified by the variation pattern of dual isotopes of nitrate kendall et al 2007 denitrification results in an attenuation of nitrate and a simultaneous increase of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 with a slop of 1 0 2 1 for δδ15n δδ18o kendall et al 2007 and references therein in the wujiang river the simultaneous enrichment of dual isotopes of nitrate and depletion of no3 concentrations in the wet season confirmed the occurrence of denitrification process fig 7 a 7b and 7c based on the rayleigh equation text s2 the extent of denitrification averaged 31 which was slightly higher than a small karstic river from an agroecosystem in the wujiang river basin 27 yue et al 2015 even though the surface water of wujiang river was aerobic much low do concentration 0 mg l 1 was observed in the bottom water of reservoirs along the mainstream of wujiang river chen et al 2021 which was suitable for denitrification however there are some uncertainties in estimating the extent of denitrification which might be related to the selection of initial moment of denitrification process the high frequency monitoring is helpful to capture more complete denitrification process and thus improve the accuracy of denitrification estimation the nitrification process can be identified by δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o values since nitrifying bacteria use two oxygen atoms from ambient h2o and the remaining one oxygen atom from ambient o2 andersson and hooper 1983 kendall et al 2007 thus the theoretical δ18o no3 values from nitrification process can be estimated based on δ18o o2 values 23 5 amberger and schmidt 1987 and δ18o h2o values of river water in the studied basin as a result the theoretical δ18o no3 is estimated to range from 2 3 to 3 6 about 90 of samples fell outside this theoretical range which indicated that the in stream nitrification was deemed insignificant that is nitrate was mainly produced by nitrification in soil and or epikarst before it entered the rivers the significant nitrification in soil and or epikarst might be related to the widespread porosities in karst system which provided enough time and space for nitrifying bacteria before nitrate laden water flowed into the river 4 3 temporal source apportionment of nitrate in wujiang river generally the nitrate source from cf son and ap are characterized by relatively light 14n while m s is featured by heavy 15n kendall et al 2007 given the distinguished isotopic values of end members the proportion of nitrate sources was calculated in the wujiang river using a bayesian model seasonally son contributed continuously to nitrate even at high discharge which suggested the continuous production of nitrate from nitrification process our study was in agreement with lijiang river and inflowing rivers around caohai lake two karstic rivers with sustained leaching loss of nitrate from soil layer both in the wet and dry seasons cao et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 in contrast zhao et al 2019 reported a seasonal variation in son contribution in the tail area of three gorges reservoir with a slightly higher mean contribution ratio of son in the dry season 27 than that of the wet season 21 to nitrogen biotransformation from riparian zones due to more submerged soil after impoundment in the dry season during our study period the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir did not affect our sampling site which might be the reason for the different seasonal pattern for son contribution between our study and zhao et al 2019 in the three gorges reservoir basin the contribution of cf increased in the wet season which might result from enhanced nitrogen leaching due to fertilizer application from mid may to early june wang et al 2022 which was in agreement with the wide distribution of cropland in the lower reach of wujiang river shi et al 2017 the great impact of chemical fertilizer on nitrate can be also confirmed by the significant positive relationship between mean annual no3 concentrations and the annual amount of nitrogen fertilizer during the past 16 years in the wujiang river fig 8 a the mpe of cf and son showed a significant positive correlation fig 8b reflecting their common transport pathway that is nitrate from cf and son was simultaneously leached from the soil and epikarst zone the m s contributed twice as much in the dry season than in the wet season similar to the pattern of global rivers matiatos et al 2021 which was related to the decreased non point source due to reduced biological activities and fertilizer application in dry season moreover the mpe of m s was negatively correlated with son fig 8b suggesting their different transport pathway which was in line with their source properties i e the former belongs to point source and the other one is nonpoint source the low contribution of ap was similar to previous studies jiang et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 2020 which was related to the much lower no3 n concentration of rainwater in southwest china 0 3 mg l 1 zeng et al 2020 compared with river water the contribution of ap may be underestimated due to the signal alteration of nitrate isotopes by biotransformation before rainwater enters the river under warm and humid conditions which can be revised by δ17o no3 liu et al 2013 4 4 response of nitrate source transport and transformation to hydrological conditions in wujiang river in the dry season both no3 n concentrations and discharge showed a relatively flat pattern which could reflect a conservative mixing of nitrate sources mainly through the groundwater pathway featured by a relatively constant hydrochemistry in the wet season the rising and falling no3 n concentrations with discharge might be related to the varied transport pathways and a non conservative mixing of nitrate sources with involving nitrate transformation such as nitrification and denitrification specifically speaking when discharge was lower than 6000 m3 s during the wet season the significant positive correlation of no3 n concentrations and discharge fig s2 indicated a flushing effect which mainly originated from son and cf as shown by the siar results the nitrification process guaranteed the continuous production of nitrate as reflected by the variations of δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o this produced nitrate is transported mainly through the soil and epikarst zones as indicated by the conceptual model of normalized no3 and doc aforementioned when discharge was higher than 6000 m3 s the fluctuation of no3 n concentration during rising discharge suggested the diluting and flushing effect of note there is a time lag between peaks of no3 concentration and discharge one reason for the time lag might be the difference in transit time of transport pathways like the slow flow of groundwater and quick flow from overland flow and subsurface flow another cause might be related to topography like quick flow from high slopes and slow flow from valley bottom since the wide distribution of hillslope area in southwest china yue et al 2020 4 5 comparison with other rivers worldwide and implications to deeply understand the nitrate characteristics in karst basins a comparison was made between wujiang river and other reported karstic rivers as well as large rivers in china and worldwide fig 9 moreover the correlation of nitrogen related variables such as no3 concentrations δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o were analyzed from previous karstic studies fig s3 in the below section the related data of the chishui river xu et al 2020 and xijiang river li et al 2019 only refer to the mid upper mainstream in the karst basin unless otherwise noted as shown by fig 9 the concentrations and dual isotopes of nitrate in the wujiang river were within the range of previous studies in karstic rivers however the no3 concentrations and δ15n no3 values in the karstic rivers had a comparatively narrower range than that of china s great rivers and world rivers suggesting the influence of nitrate source with relatively light 15n signature in the karstic watershed indeed most of the karstic rivers in the wet season had higher no3 concentrations and lower δ15n no3 values 4 8 than in the dry season which could be related to more contribution of non point source son and cf to riverine nitrate due to more flushing of soil source to rivers in the wet season the multiple porosities of karst regions are conducive to increase residence time and thus beneficial to nitrification which can be confirmed by the significant correlation of δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o for the reported karstic rivers fig s3 apart from the above porous feature in kart areas temperature might be a factor of nitrification in association with microbial activities water temperature is reported to reflect microbial activities and productivity rivett et al 2008 matiatos et al 2021 found a significant increase of δ15n no3 with increasing water temperature in rivers worldwide including karstic and non karstic rivers however δ15n no3 values were not correlated with water temperature in the reported nine karstic rivers p 0 05 n 113 which suggested that water temperature was not a limiting factor of the nitrification process that is the dominant nitrification in karst rivers is more related to the porous feature instead of temperature similar to wujiang river the overall mean δ15n no3 value of reported karstic rivers presented in fig 9 was significantly higher in the dry season than that in the wet season with a 0 8 increase in the dry season 8 1 2 8 n 64 compared with the wet season 7 3 2 5 n 87 k w test p 0 05 this seasonal pattern was consistent with the global rivers with a 1 increase of δ15n no3 in winter 7 7 3 8 than other seasons matiatos et al 2021 thus the higher level of δ15n no3 in the dry season reflected more input of sewage wastes both in karstic rivers and the world rivers worldwide as shown in section of nitrate transformation wujiang river had a positive correlation between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the wet season fig 7a the reported karstic rivers also had a positive correlation of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 fig s3 denitrification and assimilation might lead to above simultaneous increase in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 however denitrification is more likely to be the main transformation process as reported in karst rivers such as qingmuguan houzhai cane run gabas river briand et al 2017 husic et al 2019 wang et al 2020c yue et al 2015 considering the porous feature in kart areas the anoxic condition in water logged epikarst or soil might be beneficial for denitrification in karst rivers however the expected negative correlation was not observed between dual isotopes and concentrations of nitrate for reported karstic rivers fig s3 this might be masked by the concurrent inputs of nitrate like mixing process of different sources and nitrification and or anammox granger and wankel 2016 li et al 2019 overall the karstic rivers had sustained nitrogen inputs from non point sources son and cf due to the significant nitrification process thus for water quality management policymakers should not only pay more attention to the non point source but also the role of nitrification in nitrate production in the karstic rivers 5 conclusions in the river mouth of wujiang river the nitrate source transformation pathway was disclosed using a suit of tracers including δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ13c dic and hydrochemical parameters under different hydrological conditions to shed light on nitrate fate in karstic rivers datasets of other reported karstic rivers were also compiled and reanalyzed the results showed that discharge of wujiang river varied seasonally with a higher level in the wet season 2457 m3 s than dry season 566 m3 s the discharge influenced the no3 n concentrations as reflected by the increased and decreased no3 n concentrations with rising and falling discharge the combined use of no3 concentrations δ13c dic doc concentrations and rock weathering related tracers mg2 dic are helpful to deeply understand the no3 transport pathways in the karst basin for the wujiang river nitrate was mainly transported through groundwater pathway in the dry season as reflected by the positive relation of nitrate concentration and concentrations of mg2 and dic as well as δ13c dic while in the wet season nitrate was mainly transported through the soil epikarst zone based on the conceptual model of normalized no3 and doc the dual isotopes of nitrate indicated that nitrification and mixing was the dominant process even though 31 of nitrate was denitrified in the wet season similar to the wujiang river other reported karstic rivers also show an apparent nitrification process the siar results showed that cf and son were the major nitrate source in the wet season while son and m s were the main nitrate sources in the dry season for wujiang river also the sustained non point source of nitrate was observed in other reported karstic rivers thus nitrogen management in the karstic rivers should not only reduce the non point source but also be concerned about the role of nitrification process in nitrate production for example the combined use of water and soil conservation nitrification inhibitors and slow release fertilizer can both reduce nitrogen leaching and improve fertilizer use efficiency from the perspective of nitrate sources and nitrification management it is undeniable that there are some uncertainties in apportionment result of nitrate sources due to the empirical data for end members instead of in situ data in this study further study is needed to quantify the transport pathway of nitrate under different hydrological conditions for the karstic rivers it could be helpful when combining the high frequency monitoring of river water and water from different transport pathways via stable isotopes hydrogeochemical and time series analysis credit authorship contribution statement cai li investigation data

2527,a comprehensive understanding of nitrate dynamics in rivers is vital for nitrogen management especially for the karst zone with high leaching of nitrate producing potential risk to environmental quality however identification of the source transformation pathway of nitrate is limited in the karst rivers thus a suit of hydrogeochemical parameters including δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ13c dic δ18o h2o soil related parameters doc and geogenic ions mg2 dic were used to identify nitrate sources and dynamics in the wujiang river a typical karstic river as a tributary of changjiang river the combined use of a conceptual model of normalized no3 and doc and other hydrogeochemical parameters δ13c dic mg2 dic suggested that most nitrates were transported through the soil epikarst pathway in the wet season whereas 70 of nitrates were transported through groundwater pathway in the dry season for wujiang river nitrification and mixing were the dominant processes meanwhile 31 of nitrate was denitrified in the wet season in this study the reanalysis of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for reported karstic rivers in china and worldwide also revealed the predominant nitrification and denitrification in karst regions the bayesian model indicated that chemical fertilizer cf 42 and soil organic nitrogen son 32 contributed the most in the wet season while 60 of nitrate originated from son 31 and manure and sewage wastes m s 30 in the dry season in the wujiang river the sustained contribution of non point sources from nitrification through the soil epikarst pathway might be related to the widespread porosities in the karst rivers thus measures to reduce nitrogen leaching and improve fertilizer use efficiency should be considered like water and soil conservation slow release fertilizer and nitrification inhibitors additionally a suit of hydrogeochemical indicators proves to be helpful for identification of source transformation and transport pathway of nitrate in the

fast infiltration and rapid transport of water ford and williams 2013 hartmann et al 2014 excessive inputs of reactive nitrogen to aquatic ecosystems have led to many eco environmental problems and human health impacts like eutrophication water acidification blue baby syndrome and cancer galloway et al 2008 kendall et al 2007 li et al 2022 matiatos et al 2021 yu et al 2019 nitrate as one of the major dissolved nitrogen species is reported to be a common contaminant in karst rivers chen et al 2021 liu et al 2006 2021 lorette et al 2020 yue et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 the major drivers of nitrate levels include nitrate sources such as fertilizer municipal sewage soil nitrogen atmosphere deposition transformations such as nitrification and denitrification and hydrogeologic characteristics such as hydrologic connectivity hydrologic pathways hu et al 2019 husic et al 2019 kendall et al 2007 thus deciphering the cross couplings of source transformation pathway under varied hydrologic conditions is vital for nitrogen pollution remediation and water quality management for the karst basins numerous studies focus on the nitrate source identification in karstic basins using coupled isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 δ18o no3 which prove useful in the apportionment of nitrate source and transformation since different nitrate sources are featured with distinctive isotopic signatures jiang et al 2021 rock and mayer 2004 yang et al 2020 yin et al 2020 for example nitrification derived nitrates have lower δ18o no3 values 10 to 10 than that of nitrate fertilizer 17 to 25 and atmospheric deposition 60 kendall et al 2007 however identification of nitrate source transformation pathway under various hydrological conditions is limited particularly for karstic rivers husic et al 2019 wang et al 2020c yue et al 2020 nitrate laden water experiences three pathways before flowing into rivers including dilute quick flow from overland flow and direct precipitation slow groundwater flow and concentrated quick flow from subsurface flow miller et al 2017 husic et al 2019 toran and white 2005 it is hypothesized that different water origins have distinguished hydrogeochemical characteristics thus the flow pathways can be distinguished using high frequency monitoring of hydrogeochemical parameters such as discharge δ13c dic soil related proxies e g doc and carbonate weathering related proxies dissolved inorganic carbon dic although these parameters have been applied to trace water origins hartmann et al 2014 lee and krothe 2001 lorette et al 2020 there is a lack of combined studies using the above parameters to disclose the transport pathway of nitrate considering data accessibility combined use of the easy to obtain hydrogeochemical parameters and nitrate related parameters might be helpful to identify the transport pathway of nitrate and might also be useful for reanalysis of historical data to disclose historical nitrate fate besides high frequency monitoring is needed to better understand the response of nitrogen dynamics to hydrological and biogeochemical processes as important signals might respond quickly to the discharge changes jones et al 2017 husic et al 2019 yi et al 2020 yue et al 2020 for example yue et al 2020 found that high rainfall events promote nitrate loss from the karst watershed as a result of enhanced hydraulic connectivity between the nitrate source areas and the nitrate stored in the karst matrix based on high frequency monitoring of nitrate isotopes changjiang river is the largest river in china providing abundant water resources for the socioeconomic development of china li et al 2010 wujiang river an important tributary of changjiang river flows through a typical karst basin of southwest china also wujiang river flows into the three gorges reservoir tgr and its higher nitrate concentrations compared to other input rivers of tgr have raised great concern chen et al 2021 li et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 given the above scientific challenges and water quality situation in the kart rivers the main objectives of this study are 1 to distinguish transport pathways of nitrate in wujiang river using a suit of hydrogeochemical indicators such as discharge δ13c dic soil related parameters doc and geogenic ions mg2 dic 2 to identify the sources and transformations of nitrate in wujiang river using multiple isotopes δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o and to estimate the proportion of nitrate sources using a bayesian model and 3 to gain an in depth understanding of nitrate fate in karst rivers by making a summary and reanalysis of different karst rivers from previously published documents 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wujiang river is in east of yunnan guizhou plateau a well known karst region of southwestern china fig 1 the studied river covers a total area of 87 900 km2 with 76 draining in karst areas liu 2007 the mainstream extends for approximately 1037 km the climate of the wujiang river basin belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual air temperature of upstream and downstream being 14 1 c and 17 4 c respectively the average annual precipitation in the upstream and downstream was 965 mm and 1125 mm respectively liang et al 2017 it has abundant water resources with an average annual discharge of 487 8 108 m3 during the period from 1956 to 2010 changjiang sediment bulletin 2014 the altitudes of wujiang river decrease from west to east with a drop of 2124 m its main land use includes forest land 50 cultivated land 31 and grassland 18 wang 2011 the main nitrogen fertilizer in guizhou province includes manure urea ammonium bicarbonate synthetic fertilizer and diammonium phosphate zeng et al 2020 the annual consumption of nitrogen fertilizer in guizhou province increased from 43 3 104 tons in 2004 to 52 0 104 tons in 2014 nbsc 1999 2015 2 2 sampling and analyses river samples were collected every month at the mouth of the wujiang river fig 1 from november 2013 to october 2014 five water samples were taken during the dry season of wujiang river considering the relatively stable variation of discharge in the dry season and more samples twenty nine were taken in the wet season considering the large variation of discharge the sampling time was selected before and after rain events based on the weather forecast thus the water samples were obtained with the rise and fall of discharge fig s1 the water samples were filtrated by 0 22 μm and stored below 20 c the concentrations of nitrogen species were measured immediately which would be measured again before isotope analysis to evaluate the change of nitrogen species concentration particularly nitrate and nitrite overall this storage way can well keep the samples coupled isotopes of nitrate were determined bimonthly in the dry season considering the relatively stable sources of nitrate during the low discharge period while more samples were measured for isotopes of nitrate in the wet season based on its large variations during the high discharge period nitrate isotopes were determined by the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 in short denitrifying bacteria converted nitrate to n2o and its nitrogen and oxygen isotope values were measured by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv uk the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate were calibrated using usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 iaea no3 and experimental reference materials with the standard errors of 0 3 and 0 5 respectively yue et al 2020 the nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios are expressed using delta δ notation in per mill relative to air nitrogen and vsmow respectively the supporting dataset can be found in our previous study zhong et al 2017 in relation to major ionic concentrations no3 mg2 dic doc δ13c dic and δ18o h2o values 2 3 statistics and calculations the seasonal difference was tested using one way anova in no3 concentrations whereas kruskal wallis non parametric test k w test was used in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values due to their non normal distribution a bayesian mixing model was used to estimate the proportional contributions of nitrate sources which has been applied in many studies parnell et al 2010 ryu et al 2021 torres martinez et al 2021 xia et al 2017 xuan et al 2022 the bayesian mixing model was run in a software package siar with set up parameters of residual error and process error term as well as uninformative priors the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of endmembers and isotopic fractionation were listed in table s1 the details of siar can be found in the supplemental information text s1 3 results 3 1 temporal variations in nitrate concentrations with hydrological conditions in the wujiang river the no3 n concentrations ranged from 0 16 to 3 41 mg l 1 zhong et al 2017 with a significantly higher average value 2 90 0 44 mg l 1 in the dry season than that of the wet season 1 97 0 84 mg l 1 anova p 0 05 in contrast the coefficient of variation cv of no3 n concentrations was lower in the dry season 15 than that of the wet season 43 reflecting a large variation in no3 n concentrations under the high flow conditions fig 2 a and b show the temporal variations in no3 n concentrations in response to varied hydrologic conditions in the wujiang river in terms of discharge it varied seasonally with an average of 566 m3 s and 2457 m3 s in the dry season and wet season respectively three discharge peaks were recorded in june and july fig s1 the discharge influenced the no3 n concentrations with large variations of no3 n concentrations in the wet season and little variations in the dry season during three peaks of discharge in june and july no3 n concentrations increased and decreased with the rise and fall of discharge fig s1 however the peaks of no3 concentration lagged discharge peaks to better elucidate the response of nitrate to hydrology in the wet season the correlation was analyzed between discharge and nitrate concentrations the discharge of 6000 m3 s twice as high as the average discharge was defined as extremely high discharge according to the study of zhong et al 2017 when discharge was lower than 6000 m3 s the no3 concentrations showed a positive correlation with discharge fig s2 when the discharge was higher than 6000 m3 s peak 3 fig s2 no3 concentration fluctuated during the period of rising discharge which was different from that of discharge peaks lower than 6000 m3 s 3 2 temporal variations in coupled isotopes of nitrate for wujiang river the δ15n no3 in the wujiang river varied from 5 4 to 11 1 with a mean value of 6 8 1 5 fig 2 seasonally the wujiang river had a significantly higher mean value k w test p 0 05 in the dry season 8 9 1 7 than that of the wet season 6 5 1 3 however the cv of δ15n no3 values in the dry season is roughly equal to the wet season the δ18o no3 values ranged from 0 3 to 5 9 with a mean value of 2 2 1 6 the dry season had a significantly higher mean value p 0 05 of δ18o no3 3 8 1 0 than that of the wet season 2 0 1 5 both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values showed a wider range in the wet season compared with the dry season considering the minus values of δ18o no3 values the variance was calculated to assess the amplitude of variation instead of cv the δ18o no3 values in the dry season showed a higher variance than that in the wet season 3 3 source proportions of nitrate in the wujiang river given the land use types in the wujiang river watershed the potential origins of nitrate include chemical fertilizer cf soil organic nitrogen son manure sewage wastes m s and atmospheric precipitation ap the proportional contributions of above four nitrate sources were calculated by a bayesian model parnell et al 2010 with the isotopic fractionation from denitrification considered fig 3 the model outputs reflected the seasonal variations in the proportional contribution of nitrate sources in the wet season nitrate was mainly derived from cf 42 and son 32 followed by m s 17 and ap 9 while in the dry season son 31 and m s 30 contributed the most cf was intermediate 26 and ap contributed the least 12 the soil organic nitrogen contribution in the wet season was close to the dry season which did not increase greatly in the wet season as expected 4 discussion 4 1 transport pathways of nitrate constrained by hydrochemical parameters in wujiang river in the wujiang river ca2 mg2 dic are reported to be mainly derived from carbonate weathering even though reservoirs along the mainstream affected the major ions to some extent wang et al 2020a zhong et al 2017 furthermore groundwater was characterized by relatively high concentrations of ca2 mg2 dic and no3 compared with soil water in the wujiang river basin and nearby chongqing municipality wang et al 2020b c thus the variations in rock weathering related ions may provide information on nitrate pathways in the wujiang river given their different pattern among varied hydrologic pathways to test this hypothesis the correlation was analyzed between nitrate concentration and geogenic ions in the wujiang river fig 4 the result shows a significant positive relationship between concentrations of no3 and mg2 dic in the dry season of wujiang river fig 4a and b which might indicate their similar hydrological flow pathways other karstic rivers like the xijiang river and lijiang river also exhibited a similar pattern between concentrations of no3 and mg2 dic in the dry season li et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 because baseflow in the dry season is mainly recharged by groundwater and the antecedent stored water in the karst matrix hartmann et al 2014 wang et al 2020c the transit pathway of nitrate in the dry season can be inferred that is nitrate contained groundwater and soil water transported into the wujiang river along with the geogenic ions in a relatively conservative way because of reduced biological activities under a relatively dry and cold condition interestingly the correlation of no3 concentrations and ca2 concentrations were relatively weak compared with that of no3 of and mg2 concentrations in the wujiang river which might be related to biogeochemical processes affecting ca2 variations for example carbonate precipitation in the wujiang basin wang et al 2020a δ13c dic values are reported as a tracer of the hydrologic pathway in karst basins given that biological process generates relatively light δ13c dic values in soil and epikarst zones while dissolution of carbonate results in relatively heavy δ13c dic values in groundwater pathway lee and krothe 2001 husic et al 2019 in the wujiang river there is a significant correlation between δ13c dic values and mg2 concentrations in the dry season fig 4c which was caused by the mixing of groundwater with higher δ13c dic values and mg2 concentrations and soil water with lower δ13c dic values and mg2 concentrations thus the nitrate pathways include groundwater and soil water pathway in the dry season of wujiang river fig 5 a which is consistent with the above hypothesis via chemical compositions a linear two endmembers mixing model was used to estimate the proportions of groundwater and soil water pathways this estimate indicated that groundwater pathway accounted for 75 when using δ13c dic values as endmember composition and 71 when using mg2 concentrations as endmember composition which confirmed the dominance of groundwater pathway in the dry season for wujiang river fig 5a in contrast no significant correlation was observed between no3 and rock weathering derived ions in the wet season of wujiang river which might be ascribed to a shift in transport pathway or complicated sources and or active nitrogen transformation process like nitrification under a humid and warm condition according to a study in an observatory in the wujiang basin groundwater flow remained at a low level 13 10 3 m3 s when no surface runoff occurred while it rose to 154 10 3 m3 s when surface runoff occurred after rainfall in the wet season wang et al 2022 this suggested a variable transport way of nitrate during the wet season dissolved organic carbon was reported to be an infiltration marker in karst basins hartmann et al 2014 lorette et al 2020 the relationship between normalized no3 and normalized doc is reported to distinguish water origins either from surface runoff or water from unsaturated zone in a karst system lorette et al 2020 specifically speaking water from surface runoff is expected to have greater variable doc than no3 a slope of docnorm no3 norm diagram 1 while unsaturated zone has greater variable no3 than doc a slope of docnorm no3 norm diagram 1 fig 6 a during the period of high discharge in karst system lorette et al 2020 thus we tried to use this conceptual model to decipher the transport pathways of nitrate fig 6b showed that most data have greater variable no3 than doc slope 1 during high discharge that is nitrate was mainly transported through soil and epikarst zone rather than groundwater pathway of note some points have a greater variable doc than no3 slope 1 during discharge peaks 1 and 3 which suggested that some nitrate was moved through surface flow thus nitrate was mainly transported through subsurface flow in the wet season with surface flow occurring during some periods fig 5b 4 2 nitrate transformation in wujiang river denitrification and nitrification drive the attenuation and production of nitrate respectively which can be identified by the variation pattern of dual isotopes of nitrate kendall et al 2007 denitrification results in an attenuation of nitrate and a simultaneous increase of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 with a slop of 1 0 2 1 for δδ15n δδ18o kendall et al 2007 and references therein in the wujiang river the simultaneous enrichment of dual isotopes of nitrate and depletion of no3 concentrations in the wet season confirmed the occurrence of denitrification process fig 7 a 7b and 7c based on the rayleigh equation text s2 the extent of denitrification averaged 31 which was slightly higher than a small karstic river from an agroecosystem in the wujiang river basin 27 yue et al 2015 even though the surface water of wujiang river was aerobic much low do concentration 0 mg l 1 was observed in the bottom water of reservoirs along the mainstream of wujiang river chen et al 2021 which was suitable for denitrification however there are some uncertainties in estimating the extent of denitrification which might be related to the selection of initial moment of denitrification process the high frequency monitoring is helpful to capture more complete denitrification process and thus improve the accuracy of denitrification estimation the nitrification process can be identified by δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o values since nitrifying bacteria use two oxygen atoms from ambient h2o and the remaining one oxygen atom from ambient o2 andersson and hooper 1983 kendall et al 2007 thus the theoretical δ18o no3 values from nitrification process can be estimated based on δ18o o2 values 23 5 amberger and schmidt 1987 and δ18o h2o values of river water in the studied basin as a result the theoretical δ18o no3 is estimated to range from 2 3 to 3 6 about 90 of samples fell outside this theoretical range which indicated that the in stream nitrification was deemed insignificant that is nitrate was mainly produced by nitrification in soil and or epikarst before it entered the rivers the significant nitrification in soil and or epikarst might be related to the widespread porosities in karst system which provided enough time and space for nitrifying bacteria before nitrate laden water flowed into the river 4 3 temporal source apportionment of nitrate in wujiang river generally the nitrate source from cf son and ap are characterized by relatively light 14n while m s is featured by heavy 15n kendall et al 2007 given the distinguished isotopic values of end members the proportion of nitrate sources was calculated in the wujiang river using a bayesian model seasonally son contributed continuously to nitrate even at high discharge which suggested the continuous production of nitrate from nitrification process our study was in agreement with lijiang river and inflowing rivers around caohai lake two karstic rivers with sustained leaching loss of nitrate from soil layer both in the wet and dry seasons cao et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 in contrast zhao et al 2019 reported a seasonal variation in son contribution in the tail area of three gorges reservoir with a slightly higher mean contribution ratio of son in the dry season 27 than that of the wet season 21 to nitrogen biotransformation from riparian zones due to more submerged soil after impoundment in the dry season during our study period the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir did not affect our sampling site which might be the reason for the different seasonal pattern for son contribution between our study and zhao et al 2019 in the three gorges reservoir basin the contribution of cf increased in the wet season which might result from enhanced nitrogen leaching due to fertilizer application from mid may to early june wang et al 2022 which was in agreement with the wide distribution of cropland in the lower reach of wujiang river shi et al 2017 the great impact of chemical fertilizer on nitrate can be also confirmed by the significant positive relationship between mean annual no3 concentrations and the annual amount of nitrogen fertilizer during the past 16 years in the wujiang river fig 8 a the mpe of cf and son showed a significant positive correlation fig 8b reflecting their common transport pathway that is nitrate from cf and son was simultaneously leached from the soil and epikarst zone the m s contributed twice as much in the dry season than in the wet season similar to the pattern of global rivers matiatos et al 2021 which was related to the decreased non point source due to reduced biological activities and fertilizer application in dry season moreover the mpe of m s was negatively correlated with son fig 8b suggesting their different transport pathway which was in line with their source properties i e the former belongs to point source and the other one is nonpoint source the low contribution of ap was similar to previous studies jiang et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 2020 which was related to the much lower no3 n concentration of rainwater in southwest china 0 3 mg l 1 zeng et al 2020 compared with river water the contribution of ap may be underestimated due to the signal alteration of nitrate isotopes by biotransformation before rainwater enters the river under warm and humid conditions which can be revised by δ17o no3 liu et al 2013 4 4 response of nitrate source transport and transformation to hydrological conditions in wujiang river in the dry season both no3 n concentrations and discharge showed a relatively flat pattern which could reflect a conservative mixing of nitrate sources mainly through the groundwater pathway featured by a relatively constant hydrochemistry in the wet season the rising and falling no3 n concentrations with discharge might be related to the varied transport pathways and a non conservative mixing of nitrate sources with involving nitrate transformation such as nitrification and denitrification specifically speaking when discharge was lower than 6000 m3 s during the wet season the significant positive correlation of no3 n concentrations and discharge fig s2 indicated a flushing effect which mainly originated from son and cf as shown by the siar results the nitrification process guaranteed the continuous production of nitrate as reflected by the variations of δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o this produced nitrate is transported mainly through the soil and epikarst zones as indicated by the conceptual model of normalized no3 and doc aforementioned when discharge was higher than 6000 m3 s the fluctuation of no3 n concentration during rising discharge suggested the diluting and flushing effect of note there is a time lag between peaks of no3 concentration and discharge one reason for the time lag might be the difference in transit time of transport pathways like the slow flow of groundwater and quick flow from overland flow and subsurface flow another cause might be related to topography like quick flow from high slopes and slow flow from valley bottom since the wide distribution of hillslope area in southwest china yue et al 2020 4 5 comparison with other rivers worldwide and implications to deeply understand the nitrate characteristics in karst basins a comparison was made between wujiang river and other reported karstic rivers as well as large rivers in china and worldwide fig 9 moreover the correlation of nitrogen related variables such as no3 concentrations δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o were analyzed from previous karstic studies fig s3 in the below section the related data of the chishui river xu et al 2020 and xijiang river li et al 2019 only refer to the mid upper mainstream in the karst basin unless otherwise noted as shown by fig 9 the concentrations and dual isotopes of nitrate in the wujiang river were within the range of previous studies in karstic rivers however the no3 concentrations and δ15n no3 values in the karstic rivers had a comparatively narrower range than that of china s great rivers and world rivers suggesting the influence of nitrate source with relatively light 15n signature in the karstic watershed indeed most of the karstic rivers in the wet season had higher no3 concentrations and lower δ15n no3 values 4 8 than in the dry season which could be related to more contribution of non point source son and cf to riverine nitrate due to more flushing of soil source to rivers in the wet season the multiple porosities of karst regions are conducive to increase residence time and thus beneficial to nitrification which can be confirmed by the significant correlation of δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o for the reported karstic rivers fig s3 apart from the above porous feature in kart areas temperature might be a factor of nitrification in association with microbial activities water temperature is reported to reflect microbial activities and productivity rivett et al 2008 matiatos et al 2021 found a significant increase of δ15n no3 with increasing water temperature in rivers worldwide including karstic and non karstic rivers however δ15n no3 values were not correlated with water temperature in the reported nine karstic rivers p 0 05 n 113 which suggested that water temperature was not a limiting factor of the nitrification process that is the dominant nitrification in karst rivers is more related to the porous feature instead of temperature similar to wujiang river the overall mean δ15n no3 value of reported karstic rivers presented in fig 9 was significantly higher in the dry season than that in the wet season with a 0 8 increase in the dry season 8 1 2 8 n 64 compared with the wet season 7 3 2 5 n 87 k w test p 0 05 this seasonal pattern was consistent with the global rivers with a 1 increase of δ15n no3 in winter 7 7 3 8 than other seasons matiatos et al 2021 thus the higher level of δ15n no3 in the dry season reflected more input of sewage wastes both in karstic rivers and the world rivers worldwide as shown in section of nitrate transformation wujiang river had a positive correlation between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the wet season fig 7a the reported karstic rivers also had a positive correlation of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 fig s3 denitrification and assimilation might lead to above simultaneous increase in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 however denitrification is more likely to be the main transformation process as reported in karst rivers such as qingmuguan houzhai cane run gabas river briand et al 2017 husic et al 2019 wang et al 2020c yue et al 2015 considering the porous feature in kart areas the anoxic condition in water logged epikarst or soil might be beneficial for denitrification in karst rivers however the expected negative correlation was not observed between dual isotopes and concentrations of nitrate for reported karstic rivers fig s3 this might be masked by the concurrent inputs of nitrate like mixing process of different sources and nitrification and or anammox granger and wankel 2016 li et al 2019 overall the karstic rivers had sustained nitrogen inputs from non point sources son and cf due to the significant nitrification process thus for water quality management policymakers should not only pay more attention to the non point source but also the role of nitrification in nitrate production in the karstic rivers 5 conclusions in the river mouth of wujiang river the nitrate source transformation pathway was disclosed using a suit of tracers including δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ13c dic and hydrochemical parameters under different hydrological conditions to shed light on nitrate fate in karstic rivers datasets of other reported karstic rivers were also compiled and reanalyzed the results showed that discharge of wujiang river varied seasonally with a higher level in the wet season 2457 m3 s than dry season 566 m3 s the discharge influenced the no3 n concentrations as reflected by the increased and decreased no3 n concentrations with rising and falling discharge the combined use of no3 concentrations δ13c dic doc concentrations and rock weathering related tracers mg2 dic are helpful to deeply understand the no3 transport pathways in the karst basin for the wujiang river nitrate was mainly transported through groundwater pathway in the dry season as reflected by the positive relation of nitrate concentration and concentrations of mg2 and dic as well as δ13c dic while in the wet season nitrate was mainly transported through the soil epikarst zone based on the conceptual model of normalized no3 and doc the dual isotopes of nitrate indicated that nitrification and mixing was the dominant process even though 31 of nitrate was denitrified in the wet season similar to the wujiang river other reported karstic rivers also show an apparent nitrification process the siar results showed that cf and son were the major nitrate source in the wet season while son and m s were the main nitrate sources in the dry season for wujiang river also the sustained non point source of nitrate was observed in other reported karstic rivers thus nitrogen management in the karstic rivers should not only reduce the non point source but also be concerned about the role of nitrification process in nitrate production for example the combined use of water and soil conservation nitrification inhibitors and slow release fertilizer can both reduce nitrogen leaching and improve fertilizer use efficiency from the perspective of nitrate sources and nitrification management it is undeniable that there are some uncertainties in apportionment result of nitrate sources due to the empirical data for end members instead of in situ data in this study further study is needed to quantify the transport pathway of nitrate under different hydrological conditions for the karstic rivers it could be helpful when combining the high frequency monitoring of river water and water from different transport pathways via stable isotopes hydrogeochemical and time series analysis credit authorship contribution statement cai li investigation data

2528,the physically based distributed wrf hydro modelling system including the noah land surface model with multiple parameterization options noah mp and the hydrological extension of the wrf atmospheric model weather research and forecasting model has recently been widely used for water balance investigations streamflow and coupled land atmosphere simulations despite the multiple available physical parameterizations in the model equations for simulating particular losses from the water balance are missing and a grid based calibration of distributed parameters across multiple watersheds has not been studied to fill these gaps this study aims i to analyze the impact of soil runoff groundwater and vegetation parameters on water balance components ii to improve baseflow and transpiration equations and iii to test a grid based calibration approach for distributed model parameters using streamflow observations the wrf hydro groundwater model was improved through the introduction of a groundwater loss factor and the jarvis stomatal conductance model was modified to account for nocturnal transpiration the grid based calibration was performed for three parameters infiltration hydraulic conductivity and percolation for 19 spatially distributed classes with the parameter estimation pest software the study area includes 31 small mountainous watersheds 5 115 km2 in cyprus in the eastern mediterranean a two year period 2011 2013 was used for calibration and a five year period 2013 2018 for the evaluation the baseline model set up overestimated streamflow on average by 50 in 2011 2012 and more than 100 in 2012 2013 overall streamflow and evapotranspiration et could vary by about 30 from the baseline simulation using different model parameters and model options the simulation of groundwater losses as a function of groundwater level reduced total streamflow on average by 30 the use of the proposed jarvis equation for nocturnal transpiration increased the total et on average by 25 the grid based approach facilitated the calibration of the distributed parameters over the area of the 31 watersheds the median nash sutcliff efficiency nse was 0 49 during calibration but 0 02 in the drier evaluation period the calibrated wrf hydro model reproduced the annual variability of et and the improved groundwater and transpiration equations reduced the substantial streamflow overestimation of wrf hydro the model performance during dry years demonstrated the need for representation of more processes that occur in semi arid environments with ephemeral streams and are not included in wrf hydro and noah mp the grid based wrf hydro parameterization can be applied to the full study area for fully coupled atmospheric hydrologic simulations keywords wrf hydro noah mp grid based calibration nocturnal transpiration semi arid conceptual groundwater model 1 introduction physically based and spatially distributed hydrological models have evolved over the last decades to become complex modelling systems that can represent the spatial variability of the hydrometeorological processes in the environment these models expand the capabilities of the simple lumped or conceptual hydrological models by simulating hydrological variables in the three dimensional land surface and subsurface space based on physical model formulation maxwell et al 2007 distributed models fit in a broad spectrum of applications they are used to simulate streamflow to reproduce flood events induced by extreme weather using spatially variable precipitation datasets yucel et al 2015 sofokleous et al 2021 and to improve our understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between the land surface and subsurface with the atmosphere through fully coupled atmospheric hydrologic model systems maxwell et al 2011 arnault et al 2018 rummler et al 2019 the community wrf hydro hydrological model gochis et al 2018 is a physically based spatially distributed model which is the core of the us national water model noaa 2016 and which has gained remarkable attention in research in the last few years developed as the hydrological extension of the widely used weather and research forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2019 wrf hydro is comprised of the noah land surface model lsm ek et al 2003 or the noah mp lsm noah lsm with multiple parameterization options niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 enhanced with lateral terrestrial water flow and a baseflow component it can operate in a fully coupled mode with the atmospheric wrf model wrf hydro simulates overland flow lateral subsurface flow flow in the channel network as well as inflow storage and outflow from surface and groundwater reservoirs gochis et al 2018 previous studies identified a number of model parameters to which wrf hydro simulated streamflow exhibits high sensitivity and which should be calibrated arnault et al 2015 and yucel et al 2015 identified the infiltration parameter refkdt in the surface runoff parameterization as the most impactful for streamflow simulations yucel et al 2015 found a significant reduction of simulated peak flow with an increase of refkdt from 1 to 2 with the suggested range of refkdt being from 0 5 to 5 according to the authors arnault et al 2015 added that apart from streamflow modeled monthly total precipitation and other water balance components simulated with the fully coupled wrf hydro are also sensitive to refkdt at the spatial scale of 100 100 km2 other authors confirmed the sensitivity of refkdt highlighting its importance in flood forecasting givati et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 due to its impact on the percolation of the soil and subsequently on baseflow particularly over mountain watersheds the parameter that controls percolation to groundwater at the bottom of the soil profile slope is also among the parameters that have been examined by numerous authors silver et al 2017 camera et al 2020 other commonly calibrated parameters in wrf hydro and related lsms are the vertical and lateral hydraulic conductivities senatore et al 2015 and the surface and channel roughness coefficients yucel et al 2015 arnault et al 2018 for the roughness parameters yucel et al 2015 found a significant impact on peak discharge magnitude and timing for flood events studies focusing only on the lsm component of wrf hydro in particular on the noah mp lsm showed that the calibration of parameters that describe land surface processes can impact the total runoff amounts cuntz et al 2016 suggested that lsm calibration should be made against both latent heat and runoff fluxes as plant and soil properties affect both fluxes ingwersen et al 2015 found that daily latent heat was underestimated by the ball berry model ball et al 1987 which is the default stomatal conductance model in noah mp zheng et al 2019 found that the jarvis stomatal conductance model jarvis 1976 produces more realistic transpiration in arid environments compared to ball berry through simulation of annual and seasonal evapotranspiration et with different configurations of noah mp for the different climate regions of the conterminous united states these authors also reported that the jarvis model produced significantly higher transpiration an additional 11 of total precipitation compared to the ball berry scheme whitley et al 2009 and wang et al 2020 reported the observation of nocturnal transpiration through sap flow measurements for different species these authors proposed modifications of the jarvis formula and calibration of the parameters of the four stress functions of the formula to better capture the daily nocturnal and seasonal variability of transpiration the partitioning of the surface energy and water balance to sensible and latent heat fluxes in noah mp was also found to be sensitive to the particular leaf area index lai and green vegetation fraction gvf dataset used fang et al 2018 this impact of plant parameters and parameterizations has not been addressed in the simulation of the water balance in previous wrf hydro studies wrf hydro is often calibrated and used for streamflow simulations in semi arid mediterranean environments for flood events e g silver et al 2017 camera et al 2020 and for multi month simulations e g senatore et al 2015 a process that is not included in wrf hydro and may impact simulated streamflow through baseflow particularly in dry areas is groundwater flow across surface watersheds schaller and fan 2009 used 30 years of streamflow data across 1555 basins in the united states and the variable infiltration capacity model to estimate the partitioning of water balance in these basins these authors found that the contribution of groundwater losses or gains in the water balance was significant they suggested that geology plays the most important role for groundwater flows across basins which are larger in term of losses in more arid regions the occurrence of groundwater flow across watersheds was shown through isotope and hydrogeochemical sampling and modelling analyses for the troodos area in the eastern mediterranean island of cyprus by christofi et al 2020 despite the spatially distributed nature of wrf hydro little to no attention has been given to a parameter calibration that is consistent with the spatial heterogeneity of the environment the reason for this is that previous wrf hydro model versions did not easily allow the modeler to assign spatially variable values to a number of important model parameters givati et al 2016 calibrated the infiltration parameter and hydraulic conductivity uniformly for a single watershed and then adjusted the calibrated values for subwatersheds silver et al 2017 proposed a calibration of refkdt by solving the model equation for infiltration for different soil texture types and observed values of hydraulic conductivity soil moisture runoff and precipitation rummler et al 2019 assigned different values to the infiltration parameter hydraulic conductivity and percolation parameter using information from land management maps yet most of the wrf hydro studies assign parameter values uniformly over entire watersheds a systematic and efficient approach to link the most important model parameters to landscape characteristics in a spatially distributed manner as hundecha and bárdossy 2004 suggested is currently missing this study aims to answer the following research question can the physically based wrf hydro model simulate streamflow of small semi arid mountain watersheds with an automated grid based calibration based on the topography land use and geology data of the study area considering losses from groundwater and nocturnal transpiration in light of this question the objectives of this study are i to examine the impact of soil runoff groundwater and vegetation parameters on annual streamflow peak flows and total et ii to improve baseflow and transpiration equations and iii to test a grid based calibration approach for spatially heterogeneous parameters these objectives are implemented in 31 small watersheds in the troodos mountains on the island of cyprus in the eastern mediterranean the changes in streamflow and water balance components due to alternative parameter values and parameterization options relative to a reference baseline model configuration are compared first for the two year period from september 2011 to september 2013 objective i and ii the model with the modified groundwater and transpiration equations is then calibrated with an automated grid based calibration of distributed parameters for the same two year period the calibrated model is evaluated for the period from october 2013 to september 2018 objective iii 2 methodology 2 1 study area and observational data the study geographically focuses on 31 watersheds of cyprus cyprus is an island with an area of 9251 km2 located in the eastern part of the mediterranean sea and it has a mediterranean climate the 31 studied watersheds st1 st31 form a radial percolation system around troodos the main mountain range of the island fig 1 daily streamflow recorded by the water development department of cyprus at the outlets of the 31 watersheds is used in this study for the evaluation of daily totals of wrf hydro streamflow the areas of the 31 watersheds range from 5 to 115 km2 long term average precipitation reference evapotranspiration eto runoff coefficients rc baseflow indices bfi and percent coverage of different geological formations of the 31 watersheds are shown in table 1 the precipitation over the watershed areas was derived from gridded daily precipitation camera et al 2014 sofokleous et al 2021 the eto was computed with the hargreaves s equation hargreaves and samani 1985 using gridded daily temperature data for the period 1980 2010 camera et al 2014 the rc was computed as the fraction of total annual streamflow to total precipitation daily baseflow was extracted from the daily streamflow with the part hydrograph separation method rutledge 1998 and the bfi was computed as the fraction of total annual baseflow to total annual streamflow geologically troodos is constituted by an ophiolite complex with plutonic intrusive and volcanic rocks and chemical sediments most of the rocks of the ophiolite especially the gabbro within the central plutonic sequence on the upper hillslope are faulted highly fractured and brecciated thus forming fractured aquifers or aquifer systems favoring infiltration udluft et al 2006 troodos has mostly lithic leptosols with a stony gravelly texture and a high variability in soil depth from very shallow 0 10 cm up to about 100 cm camera et al 2017 the study area is to a large extent covered by natural vegetation 70 comprised mostly by sclerophyllous vegetation and coniferous forests and to a lesser extent by crops cultivated on dry stone bench terraces zoumides et al 2017 the annual average et to precipitation ratio is 76 according to long term observations 2014 2020 of et components on a pine forest monitoring site near the outlets of two of the studied watersheds st16 and st17 eliades et al 2018a eliades personal communication about 15 of the transpiration is nocturnal transpiration eliades et al 2018b these long term annual average et observational data are used to evaluate and adjust modeled et in noah mp with wrf hydro in this study 2 2 model description and new model equations the wrf hydro modelling system gochis et al 2018 is a distributed physically based hydrologic model developed at the national centre for atmospheric research it simulates terrestrial hydrologic processes i e surface subsurface and channel flow and enables hydrologic atmospheric coupled modelling the wrf hydro modelling system contains the following six components i the land surface parameterizations of noah mp lsm which control the vertical water and energy fluxes in the soil and on the land surface ii an overland flow module iii a subsurface flow module iv a channel flow module v a reservoir storage and flow module and vi a conceptual baseflow module which controls groundwater storage and fluxes the wrf hydro v5 1 model version is used in this study the meteorological forcing data required by wrf hydro are incoming shortwave and longwave radiation specific humidity air temperature surface pressure near surface wind components and precipitation rate in addition to the vegetation mptable tbl soil soilparm tbl and global parameters genparm tbl for the stand alone noah mp lsm noah mp with wrf hydro require parameters for the lateral routing these include overland roughness hydraulic conductivity in the lateral direction as well as parameters for the channel and reservoir routing modules and for the groundwater bucket of wrf hydro in addition a number of noah mp land use soil texture dependent and global parameters can be assigned spatially distributed values all parameters are described in detail in gochis et al 2018 2 2 1 groundwater bucket loss factor the equation for the groundwater bucket baseflow in wrf hydro v5 1 is 1 q b u c k e t o u t c o e f f e e x p o n z z m a x 1 i f z z m a x q b u c k e t o u t q b u c k e t i n c o e f f e e x p o n z z m a x 1 i f z z m a x where qbucket out m3s 1 and qbucket in m3s 1 are the conceptual bucket model outflow and inflow at a given model time step z m is the depth of water stored in the bucket and zmax m is the maximum water depth in the bucket parameters coeff m3s 1 and expon control the response of the conceptual bucket the initial value of z is set at the beginning of the simulation period the depth of the water in the bucket z for a defined gridded domain is adjusted by the total percolation qbucket in of all grid cells of the gridded domain the extent of the contributing gridded domain to a bucket is defined by the user in this study the contributing gridded area is defined to be the same as the surface watershed for each of the 31 watersheds one novelty of this study is the incorporation of a loss factor in the baseflow routine of wrf hydro the loss factor can represent groundwater losses from surface watersheds as observed in the study area and reduce the overestimation of baseflow as seen in the baseline simulation experiments for the studied watersheds section 3 1 1 the modified equation of the groundwater bucket is 2 q b u c k e t o u t c o e f f 1 l f a c e e x p o n z z m a x 1 if z z m a x q b u c k e t o u t q b u c k e t i n c o e f f 1 l f a c e e x p o n z z m a x 1 i f z z m a x where lfac is a dimensionless loss factor ranging between 0 and 1 which quantifies a baseflow reduction from the bucket model as a function of the water level in the bucket parameter lfac represents the amount of groundwater losses from the specified surface watershed which can occur in fractured formations or groundwater systems where only part of the total percolation contributes to the watershed s baseflow 2 2 2 nocturnal transpiration the equations of the jarvis based stomatal conductance model in wrf hydro are based on the empirical stomatal conductance model proposed by jarvis 1976 which is still widely used the canopy stomatal resistance rs sm 1 can be computed at any environmental condition according to chen et al 1996 and is given by the following equation 3 r s r s m i n f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 1 where rsmin sm 1 is the vegetation type dependent minimum stomatal resistance corresponding to the value of canopy resistance at optimal environmental conditions for transpiration the value of rsmin is defined for different vegetation types in the noahmp tbl model input table f1 f2 f3 and f4 are four stress functions representing the effects of solar radiation vapor pressure deficit canopy air temperature and soil moisture respectively each ranging from 0 to 1 the model equation of the stress function f1 is 4 f 1 r s m i n r s m a x f 1 f w h e r e f 0 55 r s r g l 2 l a i where rsmax is the maximum canopy resistance which corresponds to the cuticular resistance of the leaves and a value of 5000 sm 1 is a representative value for many trees dickinson 1984 rs wm 2 is the intensity of direct solar radiation and rgl is a fitting parameter for the radiation response f1 ranging between 30 and 100 wm 2 and can be vegetation type specific noilhan and planton 1989 appendix a contains the full equations for the jarvis model the incorporation of a nocturnal transpiration component based on whitley et al 2009 and wang et al 2020 in the jarvis model in the noah mp code of wrf hydro is the second novelty of the study the et underestimation as seen in initial simulation experiments section 3 1 1 could be reduced by adding the nocturnal transpiration component the equation that replaces eq 4 is 5 f 1 r s k 1 k r r m r m k 1 r s k 1 where rm is the maximum solar radiation intensity at the latitude of the study area 1000 wm 2 and k1 wm 2 and kr are two fitting parameters that describe the curvature of the radiation response trial and error runs were performed to adjust k1 and kr such that the annual magnitude of transpiration increased by 15 close to the locally observed nocturnal transpiration fraction to total transpiration eliades et al 2018b the increase in transpiration with adjusted parameters was examined relative to the transpiration obtained with kr 0 in eq 5 which corresponds to zero nocturnal transpiration the selected parameter values were 1 wm 2 for k1 and 0 5 for kr however further calibration should be done on the jarvis equation and the nocturnal component to match the diurnal transpiration patterns 2 2 3 lai and dynamic vegetation the average leaf area index over a grid cell laicell in wrf hydro is given by 6 l a i c e l l g v f l a i where lai is the prescribed vegetation type dependent leaf area index or the dynamically predicted leaf area index of the vegetation in the grid cell and gvf is the green vegetation fraction of the grid cell the values of lai and gvf are controlled by the option for dynamic vegetation dveg of noah mp in wrf hydro six dveg options are available three dveg options 2 5 and 6 predict lai dynamically with the ball berry stomatal conductance model ball et al 1987 and the other three options 1 3 and 4 use tabulated vegetation specific monthly lai values and can be used with any stomatal conductance model the current study compares the performance of the ball berry and jarvis stomatal conductance models and for this reason the focus here is on dveg options that can be used with both conductance models i e 1 3 and 4 for the three options the monthly lai values are read from the noahmp tbl model input table for the different land use classes for dveg option 1 the gvf has prescribed monthly values which are derived from the modis dataset for dveg option 4 the gvf is the maximum of the 12 months of the modis derived data year round the equation for gvf for dveg option 3 is based on norman et al 1995 7 g v f 1 e b l a i where b is the extinction coefficient and has a value of 0 52 in model code eq 7 is part of the gap fraction theory by larcher 1995 which implies that there is a light attenuation following an exponential decay with increasing canopy depth gigante et al 2009 according to larcher 1995 different land uses can have different extinction coefficients in addition to the above options satellite derived monthly lai values of the copernicus global land service were tested for this study the new lai values were obtained by extracting the monthly copernicus lai for the year 2018 at 1 km for each land use type based on the gridded land use map section 2 3 2 these computed monthly values replaced the default monthly lai in mptable tbl following the update of lai the gvf was set to a globally constant value equal to 1 the selection of 1 for gvf was based on the fact that satellite derived lai corresponds to pixel average values of the vegetation density making gvf redundant gutman and ignatov 1998 with the updating of the prescribed lai values the monthly prescribed stem area index values were replaced by 10 of the lai values as assumed by the model appendix b contains the default and updated lai values 2 3 model set up and parameterization 2 3 1 watershed delineation and atmospheric forcing the 31 studied watersheds were delineated on a 100 m routing grid using the wrf hydro gis preprocessor arcmap wrf hydro gis pre processor v5 1 1 and the 25 m digital elevation model for cyprus from the geological survey department of cyprus the noah mp lsm grid was generated using the wrf model preprocessing system wps skamarock et al 2019 with spatial resolution at 1 km the domain for lateral routing of wrf hydro and the domain for the simulation of land surface vertical fluxes of noah mp cover the troodos mountain range fig 1 nine dams located upstream of eight streamflow stations in the study area were incorporated in the routing grid appendix d the default modis land cover with usgs land use categories at approximately 1 km resolution was replaced by the corine land cover clc dataset at 100 m resolution the clc dataset was reclassified to usgs land categories as required by the model according to pineda et al 2004 and is presented in appendix b the meteorological forcing of the noah mp lsm in this study consists of the output of the wrf atmospheric model except precipitation which was obtained from the spatial interpolation and temporal disaggregation of precipitation gauge observations based on the methods described in camera et al 2014 and sofokleous et al 2021 the wrf hydro time step for routing was set to 10 s and the time step for noah mp was set to 30 min the same as the temporal resolution of the atmospheric forcing and the model output time step from the model output 30 min streamflow and the annual totals for the water balance components of soil evaporation canopy interception and transpiration and soil moisture storage change were extracted for the model evaluation 2 3 2 land surface classes the values of spatially distributed model parameters were directly related to the physical characteristics land use topographic slope and geology of each grid cell the infiltration parameter refkdt in the surface runoff parameterization of wrf hydro was assigned spatially variable values based on nine land surface classes which are a combination of three land uses and three topographic slope classes the resulting nine land surface classes are shown in fig 2 the three land use classes were specified from the corresponding three dominant land uses in the study area the three classes are the coniferous forest the shrubland areas and the agricultural land the remaining classes each covering 3 of the total area were integrated in the three classes see table b1 appendix b the three topographic slope classes that were considered are flat to nearly flat terrain 5 moderate slopes 5 10 and steep slopes greater than10 the three slope classes cover areas of 32 46 and 22 respectively the assumptions used for assigning values to refkdt for different land surface classes were that infiltration capacity increases and thus refkdt increases with decreasing topographic slope and with increasing ground cover such as with natural vegetation as opposed to managed agricultural land 2 3 3 geological and soil type classes model parameters relevant to the soil and bedrock properties were linked to the geological formations of the study area for the present geological formations over the 31 watersheds five geological classes are defined fig 2 the percolation controlling distributed parameter slope was assigned values from 0 to 1 based on the permeability of these five classes according to udluft et al 2006 basal group diabase gabbro and plagiogranite have the highest permeability values of all ophiolite rocks whereas the vulcanic complex found at the foothills of troodos has low permeabilites the spatial distribution of the soil texture classes was the same as for the geological classes because the soil texture map for the mountainous part of cyprus is characterized by high uncertainty camera et al 2017 2 4 impact of model parameters and parameterization options on model outputs the impact of model parameters and model parameterization options on annual total streamflow annual total et and peak flow three day total discharge around the date with annual peak flow for two hydrological years 2011 2013 was examined this impact was quantified with the relative change of each model output δsimpar i which was computed as follows 8 δ s i m p a r i s i m p a r i s i m b a s e l i n e where simpar i is the model output variable computed with a certain parameter value or model parameterization option par i and simbaseline is the same variable obtained with the baseline parameter set these relative changes were computed for all 31 watersheds the parameter values were tested assigning the same parameter value across the domain test value 1 or test value 2 in table 2 the parameter values for the impact analysis were selected to be the minimum and maximum of the range of values specified in the model parameter tables section 2 2 the parameterization options dveg lai canres rs noc were tested for one or two different settings the selected parameters used in the analysis are parameters often reported in previous wrf hydro studies and vegetation parameters and parameterizations the impact however of a larger number of parameters than those listed in table 2 was examined with initial simulation experiments results not shown for soil texture dependent parameters these experiments showed that some parameters had similar impact and for this reason their number was reduced for this study the ball berry parameters were found to lead to minor changes in the model outputs and they were also omitted the baseline parameterization is the same as the default wrf hydro configuration but with the modifications of the parameter values described in this section which were made to represent local environmental conditions the baseline refkdt was assigned spatially variable values based on the nine land surface classes section 2 3 2 refkdt ranged for the three topographic slope classes from 2 to 4 for the agricultural land use from 2 5 to 4 5 for shrubland and from 3 to 5 for the coniferous forest the baseline percolation parameter slope values ranged from 0 1 to 1 the soil physical properties were related to the five geological classes section 2 3 3 for soil properties the baseline values were set as the default values from soilparm tbl model input file the groundwater bucket baseline parameters are specified in section 2 5 except for the refkdt and slope parameters the impact of the soil texture properties was examined for the parameters of porosity smcmax and hydraulic conductivity ksat the values tested for the soil parameters were set equal to the minimum and maximum of the range of values of the 13 soil textures specified in the noah mp soilparm tbl file the parameter for overland roughness ov rough2d ranged between the minimum and maximum default values of the 22 land use dependent values specified in the hydro tbl model file the default 2 m soil depth in wrf hydro was set to the smaller value of 1 m which is more representative of the generally shallow soils on the slopes of troodos mountains camera et al 2017 the effects of re initialization of the water depth in the gw bucket at the start of the second hydrological year zini was examined the zini option allows to remove excess water from the gw bucket at the end of a hydrologic year the groundwater loss factor in the baseflow bucket model equation lfac section 2 2 1 was tested as an alternative to the zini option the second half of table 2 presents the vegetation related model parameters and parameterization options the baseline stomatal conductance model used for the study is the ball berry model which is the default in wrf hydro the usgs land use based monthly lai values and the yearly maximum modis derived gvf comprise the baseline values for the vegetation density the impact of the various options dveg for the description of vegetation density lai and gvf as introduced in section 2 2 3 was examined the impact of the jarvis based model for stomatal conductance was also examined along with changes of the values of the jarvis model parameters and the change of the jarvis radiation component to account for nocturnal transpiration section 2 2 2 2 5 groundwater bucket parameters one major characteristic of baseflow for the majority of the troodos streams as ephemeral is the zero baseflow in the summer scatterplots of the long term baseflow indices i e the long term average and maximum bfi with the relative coverage of different geological classes in each watershed table 1 did not show a relation between the two for this reason the groundwater parameters could not be related to the geological characteristics across the model domain and parameters zmax and lfac were manually calibrated per watershed parameter coeff of the gw bucket model section 2 2 1 was set to two times the average non zero watershed baseflow for 28 watersheds for the baseline parameter set three watersheds st12 st13 and st14 which have a bfi equal or larger than 0 89 were assigned a value equal to 10 times the average non zero daily baseflow of the watershed parameter expon was set equal to 0 693 for the baseline parameterization which corresponds to bucket outflow equal to the coeff when the bucket is full 2 6 grid based calibration with pest the spatially distributed model parameters which were selected based on the results of the impact analysis section 3 1 2 and section 3 1 3 were calibrated for the land surface soil and geology classes using the parameter estimation pest calibration software doherty 2020 the calibrated parameter ranges were selected based on the ranges of the prescribed values for these parameters in the wrf hydro and noah mp input files for each land surface class and geology class the calibration range was further confined to a smaller range of values representative for the specific class as described in section 2 3 2 and section 2 3 3 the model parameter optimization simultaneously for the 31 watersheds was based on the minimization of the following objective function 9 φ i n o b s w i r i 2 where nobs is the total number of observations i e daily streamflow of 31 watersheds w is the weight of each observation i and r is the residual difference between model value and observation value the observation weights are set equal to zero or one with the value of zero used for missing observations the pest optimization algorithm is based on the least squares function and the gauss marquardt levenberg method doherty 2015 the pest estimation mode was used with singular value decomposition the latter guarantying numerical stability in the calibration process doherty 2020 the streamflow observations of the 31 watersheds were grouped into 31 groups the 31 watershed components in the objective function were assigned weights using the pwtadj1 utility of pest such that based on the residuals obtained for the initial parameter values the contribution to the objective function by each observation group will be equal this avoids a dominance of the objective function value by the watersheds with the largest errors doherty 2020 the automatic calibration with pest is based on the iterative behavior of the pest algorithm this means that the calibration is made up of multiple pest iterations with each iteration comprised of multiple wrf hydro model runs with different sets of initial parameter values this attribute of pest limits the possibilities for selecting a locally optimum solution of calibrated parameter set as a globally optimum the automatic calibration was terminated when pest failed to lower the objective function for three consecutive iterations as suggested in doherty 2020 2 7 simulation period and evaluation metrics the calibration and evaluation period referred to as 2011 2013 and 2013 2018 cover the sequence of hydrologic years from october 2011 to september 2013 and from october 2013 to september 2018 respectively the simulation period for the examination of the parameter impact on model outputs is the same as the calibration period following the adjustment of model parameters and options based on the impact analysis section 3 1 2 and section 3 1 3 and the pest calibration of the distributed parameters section 3 2 1 the model was evaluated for both the two year calibration period and the five year evaluation period with four evaluation metrics section 3 2 2 these metrics are the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse appendix e the kling gupta efficiency kge appendix e the mean absolute error mae and the percent total bias the individual annual water balance components of streamflow et soil evaporation transpiration interception groundwater storage change groundwater loss and soil moisture change were then assessed as fractions of precipitation for each hydrological year in the calibration and evaluation period section 3 2 3 total precipitation averaged over the area of the 31 watersheds is 900 mm for 2011 2012 and 680 mm for 2012 2013 total annual precipitation in the evaluation period 2013 2018 ranges from 397 mm to 700 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of model parameters and parameterization options on model outputs the baseline simulation results are presented first in section 3 1 1 the change in the output of wrf hydro with noah mp total streamflow peak flow and total et for simulations based on one parameter change at a time in the baseline parameterization table 2 relative to the output of the baseline parameterization are described in the following sections 3 1 1 baseline simulation results the baseline parameterization of the impact analysis table 2 simulated the fraction of average total et to average total precipitation over two watersheds st16 and st17 equal to 45 4 interception 12 soil evaporation 29 transpiration for the two years of calibration this fraction is much lower than the observed long term average et to precipitation fraction of 76 17 interception 16 soil evaporation 43 transpiration for the pine forest monitoring site near the outlets of the two watersheds the underestimation of et fluxes keeps the soil wetter and thereby affects surface runoff and percolation losses from the soil column to the groundwater the streamflow of the 31 watersheds for the two years was largely overestimated with a median percent bias of 54 in 2011 2012 and 139 in 2012 2013 this streamflow overestimation was linked to overestimated baseflow 30 in 2011 2012 and 80 in 2012 2013 resulting from soil column percolation losses the large positive bias in baseflow for the second hydrological year was found to be related to the contribution of water stored in the groundwater bucket and not released during the first year 3 1 2 soil runoff and groundwater parameters among the tested parameters slope and ksat followed by smcmax are the most effective in altering the streamflow amount as seen in fig 3 relative to the baseline parameter set no percolation slope 0 very low hydraulic conductivity ksat 4 mm h 1 and high porosity smcmax 0 48 lead to reduction of median watershed streamflow up to 25 with slope having the largest effect maximum percolation rate slope 1 very high ksat 168 mm h 1 and low porosity smcmax 0 34 lead to an increase in median streamflow of similar magnitude these parameters have a direct impact on soil moisture which in turn affects the available soil water for transpiration for this reason the change in median et has an opposite sign and an almost similar magnitude with the relative change of streamflow within the range of possible values of ksat the median relative change in total et is from about 20 up to 10 which is higher than the change resulting from any of the other soil and runoff parameters the same parameters with the addition of refkdt affect the peak flows most strongly for refkdt the relative change in streamflow 1 1 25 is smaller than the relative change in peak flow 0 6 2 4 the reason for this difference is because refkdt impacts mainly peak flows due to its regulation of the infiltration rate the effectiveness of refkdt in infiltration increases with drier soil moisture conditions as seen in the comparison of the relative change in peak flow for the two years in fig 3 and with increasing precipitation rate for these reasons previous studies e g yucel et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 which focused on short term extreme events found a strong regulation of refkdt in simulated streamflow regarding other parameters the low values of slope 0 and ksat 4 mm h 1 result in opposite signs of the relative change of peak flow in the two hydrological years these specific parameter values lead also to the highest et increase in both years the decrease of peak flow with no percolation slope 0 for instance in the second hydrologic year may be linked to the enhanced transpiration that reduces the soil moisture impeding the increase in peak flow due to saturation excess in 2011 2012 peak flows are instead enhanced with no percolation slope 0 probably because of saturation excess in the very wet conditions the effect of the gw loss factor lfac 0 1 is a reduction of total streamflow up to 30 in the wet year and in the second drier hydrological year by 15 to 75 for the different watersheds a comparable reduction is achieved with zini in the second hydrological year because the water depth in the bucket was set to 0 for the 28 ephemeral watersheds and to 0 1 times the water depth in the bucket for the continuous flow watersheds st12 st13 st14 at the beginning of the second year october 2012 both parameters are useful for the reduction of the substantial positive streamflow bias of the baseline parameterization however lfac induces groundwater losses and thus reduced baseflow throughout the simulation period zini creates instead a reduction in baseflow with a discontinuity in the baseflow component of the hydrograph at the time of initialization setting the parameter zmax equal to the maximum long term annual baseflow per watershed has a heterogeneous effect on the total streamflow of the 31 watersheds in contrast to the homogeneous response resulting from changes in the soil parameters total streamflow is reduced in some watersheds and increased in some others up to 25 in the wetter 2011 2012 and less in 2012 2013 this variable impact of zmax on total streamflow among watersheds justifies the manual calibration of zmax per watershed as described in section 2 5 considering the high variability of the model outputs to the percolation parameter slope it was selected to be a calibration parameter among the two soil properties ksat and smcmax the ksat was selected to be calibrated because of its larger impact and variability among watersheds compared to smcmax the soil depth for the calibration runs was set to 125 cm because it reduced the streamflow amounts that were overestimated by the 100 cm soil depth of the baseline parameterization further parameter refkdt which impacts the magnitude of peak flows was selected for calibration 3 1 3 vegetation parameters the magnitude of the relative change of total streamflow and et resulting from the representation of vegetation density gvf and lai is almost the same as the magnitude of the relative change due to the selection of the stomatal conductance model i e the jarvis model fig 4 the option for monthly gvf dveg 1 results in a median reduction in et by 15 up to 25 relative to the yearly maximum gvf dveg 4 baseline run the computation of gvf as a function of the prescribed monthly lai dveg 3 eq 7 results in higher gvf values and 20 higher et than both the monthly prescribed gvf dveg 1 and yearly prescribed gvf dveg 4 baseline the replacement of prescribed lai values with satellite derived values for different land use categories and gvf equal to 1 lai copernicus has a small impact on streamflow and et which are reduced and increased up to 5 respectively the jarvis stomatal conductance model increases the total annual et by 15 20 compared to the et obtained by the default option of ball berry model the refinement to the jarvis model with the inclusion of the description of nocturnal transpiration increases et on average with an additional 10 15 the adjustment of the parameter controlling the interception of precipitation by canopy ch2op to a value equal to 0 5 mm per unit lai instead of the prescribed 0 1 mm leads to a small increase in et due to increased intercepted precipitation the three parameters topt b and hs in the jarvis model stress functions have almost no impact giving the same results as the baseline parameter set the total et increase by 15 up to 20 with the jarvis model relative to the ball berry was found to be closer to the values of local et observations eliades et al 2018b this underestimation of et by ball berry in this semi arid mediterranean environment agrees with the results reported by zheng et al 2019 for the suitability of jarvis in semi arid regions of the conterminous united states for these reasons the jarvis model with the formula for nocturnal transpiration replaced the ball berry model in the model code of this study the jarvis model parameter topt was set to 20 c despite its negligible impact because the specific value is suggested for mediterranean vegetation by larcher 1995 and for crops by wang et al 2017 for a more realistic representation of gvf and lai the remote sensed copernicus based lai was used for the calibration model runs of this study the jarvis stomatal conductance enhanced with the nocturnal component leads to increased et relative to the baseline ball berry 30 which corresponds to a similar reduction in soil moisture the groundwater loss function continuously reduces the groundwater storage in the bucket as a function of the groundwater level and this induces reductions in baseflow overall but also reduction of large baseflow releases during peak flow events thus a new baseline parameterization based on modified jarvis and groundwater bucket equations could possibly lead to an altered impact of the tested parameters the difference in the parameter impact under drier conditions in soil and groundwater can be understood by comparing the relative changes of streamflow peak flow and et in the two hydrological years used in this study these relative changes are mostly similar in both the very wet 2011 2012 and in the less wet 2012 2013 particularly for the total streamflow and total et the significance of these findings is also indicated by comparing the relative impact of the same parameters and parameterizations for the 31 watersheds parameters slope ksat and lfac as well as most of the vegetation parameters result in similar relative changes in streamflow and et in both years as seen in fig 3 and fig 4 as well as when each watershed is examined individually for instance for st1 and slope equal to zero the relative changes in streamflow 0 92 in 2011 2012 and 0 87 in 2012 2013 and in et 1 09 in 2011 2012 and 1 14 in 2012 2013 have similar magnitude the same patterns can also be observed for ksat and lfac and most vegetation parameters and for other watersheds the results of this study show that the baseline parameterization of wrf hydro and particularly of noah mp from the parameterizations of which the soil runoff and vegetation parameters originate exhibit strong biases in et fluxes in the semi arid environment of the study area these findings are indicative of potentially strongly biased fluxes to the atmosphere which may affect the modeling of atmospheric variables such as in the wrf atmospheric model which can be coupled to noah mp and to wrf hydro as pointed out by lin and cheng 2016 in addition through the impact analysis it was seen that soil and vegetation parameters and the gw bucket maximum depth zmax as well as both the new gw loss factor and the adjustment in jarvis model equation are necessary to reduce the streamflow overestimation the largest reductions on average for all watersheds were up to 25 for slope ksat and the adjusted jarvis equation cuntz et al 2016 reached similar conclusions about the sensitivities of soil and vegetation parameters in a global sensitivity analysis for water balance components simulated with noah mp for locations in the eastern united states the influence of soil and runoff parameters on simulated surface fluxes with noah mp was also highlighted by li et al 2020 3 2 model calibration and evaluation 3 2 1 calibration of distributed and groundwater parameters the distributed model parameter calibrated values for refkdt slope and ksat for the different land surface and geology classes are presented in table 3 and fig 2 the calibration of the 19 parameters values was completed after nine pest iterations with 198 wrf hydro model runs the computational cost was 260 cpu hours per wrf hydro run for two years of simulations the manually calibrated value of zmax ranged between the long term annual average and maximum total baseflow for 17 watersheds for 12 watersheds zmax was set below the long term average baseflow and for two watersheds zmax was set above the long term maximum baseflow overall the grid based calibration of distributed model parameters resulted in calibrated parameter values generally within the calibration range and consistent with the expected hydrological function of watershed characteristics for instance the refkdt values were the highest and lowest for the topographic slope lower than 5 and larger than 10 respectively for the three land use classes from table 3 it is also seen that some calibrated refkdt values are equal to the maximum or minimum value of the range set for the calibration the calibrated values are most often close to the maximum values for the land surface classes with slope 5 low topographic slope is expected to increase infiltration which is simulated with high refkdt values these calibration results indicate the high infiltration rates which were correctly assigned by pest through the refkdt values for flat or nearly flat areas increasing the value of refkdt above these maxima reached during calibration will only induce however minor difference in the simulated streamflow according to camera et al 2020 these authors tested refkdt values ranging from 0 3 up to 1000 and showed that the refkdt impact on streamflow is well captured with values up to about five and only small variations in total discharge could be observed with refkdt up to about 100 for parameter slope the gridded areas with sedimentary gabbro or diabase geologies were assigned values higher than 0 85 this result is consistent with the high bedrock permeability of these formations udluft et al 2006 parameter slope values close to one lead to maximum percolation rate the calibrated values of ksat ranging from 2 8 10 6 and 1 6 10 5 m s 1 are also representative of the soils of troodos the highest hydraulic conductivities were assigned to soil classes of sandy loam and loamy sand which correspond to the geological classes of the uppermost part of troodos gabbro plagiogranite and ultramafic complex the spatial calibration has also resulted in higher value of ksat for the soil class of clay loam than that of loam despite that clay containing soils are expected to have a lower ksat than loam for instance these results are indicative of the high uncertainty of soil texture over troodos as reported by camera et al 2017 the grid based calibration for streamflow can be considered a useful method to estimate spatial values of soil properties that have not been measured the advantage in addition of the grid based calibration at multiple watersheds based on watershed characteristics is that the calibrated distributed parameters can be used for ungauged streams one limitation is that gw bucket parameters could not be linked to watershed characteristics in this study for ungauged basins gw parameters could instead be estimated from extrapolation of gw parameters of neighboring watersheds nevertheless the limitation of gw parameters is only relevant for streamflow and not for any land surface processes which control et 3 2 2 calibration and evaluation results the evaluation results of the model configuration based on the grid based calibration of distributed parameters are shown in fig 5 positive nse and kge values were obtained for 28 out of 31 watersheds with median nse equal to 0 49 in the calibration period the model efficiency in the evaluation period 2013 2018 is lower with a median nse of 0 02 and positive nse and kge in 16 and 21 watersheds respectively the number of watersheds with full streamflow observation time series in the evaluation period was however also lower 31 watersheds in 2013 2014 and in 2014 2015 26 in 2015 2016 20 in 2016 2017 and 15 in 2017 2018 despite this uneven number of watersheds in each hydrological year a positive correlation of nse and kge with total precipitation per hydrological year total precipitation shown in fig 8 with increasing efficiency metrics for increasing precipitation was observed considering all watersheds but also only considering the 15 watersheds with full records during the evaluation period the median nse and kge for the entire period were 0 24 and 0 55 with positive metrics for 28 and 29 watersheds respectively the mean absolute error mae in the volume of streamflow is on average 0 5 mm per day in both the calibration and evaluation period and the mae in the evaluation period is larger than the mae in the calibration period only in one 2014 2015 out of the five evaluation years the relative bias of total streamflow per hydrological year is less than 25 for 26 watersheds for the calibration period which is a substantial improvement relative to the bias of 50 100 in the same period with the baseline parameterization an exception is the group of five watersheds on the eastern flank of troodos mountains fig 6 which receives less rainfall than the west and central part of the mountains a large overestimation of total streamflow is evident from fig 5 and fig 6 for the evaluation period particularly for the three driest hydrological years 2013 2014 2015 2017 the examination of the simulated and observed hydrographs in fig 7 for three watersheds of different prevailing hydrological conditions i e non ephemeral st13 and ephemeral st17 and st21 confirms the results of fig 5 the hydrographs of all 31 watersheds are presented in appendix c the modeled streamflow follows very well the observed streamflow in the calibration period for most watersheds the most profound errors in the evaluation period are linked to baseflow and the mismatch between observed and simulated flow during the rising and descending limb of the hydrographs in the wetter years the timing of simulated peak flows agrees with the observed peak flows despite some errors in the magnitude of peak flows especially in days with high accumulated precipitation about 50 mm and above for the wettest hydrological year of the evaluation period 2014 2015 the first simulated peak flow is delayed for many watersheds relative to observations this delayed peak flow could be attributed to differences in the growth of the forest understory and the stream network vegetation which are represented by time invariant roughness coefficients in the model the errors in peak flows in days with high accumulated precipitation could be linked to errors in the precipitation because the rain gauge network that was used for the generation of the gridded forcing data may not sufficiently capture the spatial variability of the rainfall over the mountains sofokleous et al 2021 this explanation is even more important in small watersheds the small size of watersheds implies potentially large streamflow volume errors in case of errors of the spatially interpolated precipitation short concentration times in combination with the uncertainty of precipitation may also lead to errors in the timing of peak flows the reduction of performance in the evaluation period is common for wrf hydro as seen in other studies as well for a 3 year simulation period and a 1281 km2 sized basin in s italy senatore et al 2015 reported a reduction in nse from about 0 9 to about 0 3 moving from the calibration to the evaluation period these authors attributed the nse reduction to the peak flows underestimation which was related to the limitations in simulating the intensity and duration of precipitation for simulation of two extreme precipitation events for 22 watersheds in the troodos mountains camera et al 2020 reported nse and kge values above 0 5 for most watersheds for the calibration event and a reduction of the values of the two efficiency metrics remaining mostly positive for the evaluation event similar to this study they attributed the performance reduction to overestimation of peak flows which could have been lower with increased roughness coefficients biases in the baseflow component of the hydrographs as described above could be partly explained by the findings of previous studies for the groundwater processes in troodos boronina et al 2003 used the 2d groundwater modflow code to model groundwater processes of three troodos watersheds st29 st30 st31 and found substantial groundwater exploitation christofi et al 2020 showed with integrated observations and modeling that groundwater flows across subwatersheds the main reason for the latter is that in the complex fractured troodos aquifer system hydrogeological subsurface basins have a different extent than hydrologic surface watersheds the findings of boronina et al 2003 and christofi et al 2020 are indicative of groundwater losses simulated by wrf hydro here with the new gw loss factor rummler et al 2022 found that the implementation of a different groundwater parameterization i e a 2d groundwater table scheme with soil moisture and groundwater interaction improved wrf hydro streamflow simulations in the upper danube river basin however considering that modeling groundwater in fractured aquifers such as those in troodos is subject to large uncertainties the calibrated gw bucket model of wrf hydro with the groundwater loss factor introduced in this study is a useful conceptualization of complex groundwater processes such processes are groundwater losses beyond the watershed boundaries and water use abstractions that cannot be observed or modelled individually the low final nse calculated for the evaluation of wrf hydro can be due to the relatively large number of watersheds 31 calibrated simultaneously for a relatively small number of parameters 19 the consideration of alternative or additional soil parameters to be calibrated e g porosity and the exponent in the shape parameter for soil resistance as suggested to be very sensitive parameters by cuntz et al 2016 could have provided further performance improvements with the grid based calibration yet the assignment of distributed values to further soil properties would require additional computational resources and data for the spatial distribution of these properties which is currently lacking furthermore the equifinality of the results i e similar relative change of total streamflow et and peak flow in two different hydrological years with changes in the values of different parameters as discussed in section 3 1 2 and section 3 1 3 is another limiting factor for adding more parameters in the calibration parameter set an improved wrf hydro performance could possibly also be achieved with a variable soil depth across the simulation domain as fersch et al 2020 proposed which is however unsupported in the latest wrf hydro version v5 2 the degradation of the model performance in this study could have been lower in the evaluation period if a longer calibration period with an additional year of different precipitation conditions would have been included there are however certain considerations which imply that the poor model performance in dry years is not just subject to the selected period of calibration wrf hydro is a physically based model and the calibration of parameters used in the physically based model equations for two years with interchanging very wet wet and dry periods exposed the calibrated parameters to all of these conditions the aforementioned exploitation of groundwater resources over troodos not included in the wrf hydro code could be enhanced in drier years and this will have a direct impact on baseflow this study tested in addition to the loss factor the initialization of the groundwater bucket at the beginning of each hydrological year as a method to resolve the overestimation of baseflow in simulations of consecutive hydrological years this example highlights how water resources exploitation is not part of the physically based processes of wrf hydro and that the groundwater bucket level has to be manually adjusted to account for local water use the low performance of semi arid watersheds with ephemeral streams can also be explained by the changing vegetation properties in the stream network wet conditions in one year promote the development of riparian vegetation within the streams during the low flow season these changed stream roughness conditions remain in following dry years and hinder flow reaching the watershed outlet part of this flow becomes ponded water which eventually becomes et the stream roughness will decrease when the vegetation flattens during high precipitation and high flow events adding dynamic functions for some parameters to account for temporal variation of land surface and channel properties e g refkdt overland and channel roughness could alter the response of watersheds particularly for dry years and ephemeral streams the spatial calibration of these time variant parameters could in this case be performed for land surface classes based on high resolution satellite derived lai this study showed that the performance of small semi arid watersheds exhibits high relative change to model soil and vegetation parameters as well as to the total precipitation in the year of simulation the water limited environment of semi arid areas requires improved parameterizations reproducing et in noah mp which is the dominant water balance component for the largest part of a hydrological year at the same time the wet winter period of the year coincides with the period when the radiation is relatively low and thus the soil moisture and runoff parameterizations are important for simulating surface and subsurface runoff and percolation to the groundwater for streamflow simulations for entire hydrological years such as for seasonal streamflow forecasting the baseflow parameterization becomes important because baseflow is the dominant component in the hydrograph for the latter the soil physics parameterization and parameters slope and ksat which control the inflow into the groundwater bucket are important for the bucket outflow the size of groundwater bucket zmax and groundwater bucket outflow coefficients are other model components that should be considered in the calibration of the model 3 2 3 water balance evaluation the simulated watershed area average water balance components of the 31 watersheds are shown in fig 8 the partitioning of precipitation into the water balance components of soil evaporation canopy intercepted and evaporated water canopy transpiration runoff soil moisture change groundwater storage change groundwater loss and dam storage change the last not shown in each hydrological year is dominated by the losses to the atmosphere transpiration accounts for about 40 of the total water balance on average for all watersheds in addition soil evaporation and intercepted water have an average contribution to the total water balance of about 30 and 15 respectively therefore et returns about 85 of the input precipitation to the atmosphere the next most dominant component of the water balance is the total runoff with an average contribution of 15 a smaller contribution in the water balance less than 10 is due to the change in the soil and groundwater storage and to a much lesser extent to losses from the groundwater and dam storage soil and groundwater storage changes show positive changes in the wettest years such as 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 with these results the positive impact of the groundwater bucket in wrf hydro and the gw loss factor introduced here for streamflow simulations in semi arid environments can be seen once more the largely overestimated streamflow by the baseline wrf hydro as shown in this study can be reduced in order to better match the ephemeral behavior of semi arid streams with the adjustment of storage capacity of the gw bucket and the use of the gw loss factor the average water balance closure error was calculated to range within 5 possible sources for this figure could be the error in the numerical solution of the soil water flow in wrf hydro code maximum water balance error allowed per time step 0 1 mm and the mismatch between the watershed area of noah mp and wrf hydro from both of which the water balance components were extracted the watershed border in noah mp is based on its 1 km grid resolution whereas the watershed border in wrf hydro was delineated on the 100 m grid the temporal variability of these water balance components seems to be correlated with the total precipitation for instance the highest and lowest watershed average runoff coefficients are observed in the wettest 2011 2012 and driest 2013 2014 years respectively the water storage changes in soil and groundwater bucket relative to the total precipitation follow the change in total precipitation from year to year and the magnitude of the change is more evident in the transition between years when one of them is either very wet or very dry for instance the dry hydrologic year 2013 2014 after the wet 2012 2013 with total precipitation 400 mm and 680 mm respectively has a soil and groundwater storage change equal to 2 and 6 on average for all watersheds the ratio of evaporation interception and transpiration to the total precipitation seems to be inversely correlated with the total precipitation during the driest years the dominance of the three components is higher than in the wetter years taking into account however the amount of precipitation per hydrologic year the total amount of evaporated and transpired water is higher during the wet years the temporal pattern of the water balance components modeled by wrf hydro seems to generally follow observations at the pine forest monitoring site of eliades et al 2018a fig 8 which is located close to the boundary of peristerona watershed st17 and just downstream of the lagoudera watershed st16 the precipitation at the site is in the driest 25 percentile of the long term average precipitation of the 31 watersheds fig 8 the four year average 2014 2018 observed ratio of evaporation to precipitation e p was 0 18 whereas the simulated e p was 0 23 for peristerona and 0 26 for lagoudera the total observed interception to precipitation ratio i p according to long term interception observations by eliades et al 2022 was 0 19 and the modeled i p was 0 09 for peristerona and 0 10 for lagoudera the lower vegetation density for coniferous forest in the model copernicus lai 1 3 table b1 appendix b compared to that observed at the monitoring site lai 2 38 can explain the lower simulated interception rates and higher simulated soil evaporation fig 9 the four year average ratio of transpiration to precipitation t p at the site about 0 45 is very close to the average ratio simulated for the peristerona watershed 0 42 and for the lagoudera watershed 0 37 for the same years the partitioning of observed and modeled transpiration to day time and nocturnal amounts table 4 for the years 2015 to 2017 shows that the improved jarvis model reduces the total period transpiration bias for the location of the monitoring site for both day and night time to 25 and 28 mm respectively despite the improvement in the simulated amounts the jarvis model and the the parameters of the nocturnal jarvis radiation equation should be further tuned to match the diurnal transpiration patterns too overall the partitioning of the three water balance components to precipitation is simulated with a maximum difference of 10 of total precipitation relative to observations zheng et al 2019 found that for the improvement of annual and seasonal modeling of et through model simulations with noah mp the impact of terrestrial water and of vegetation changes during the vegetation growing season needs to be considered to account for the vegetation changes arsenault et al 2018 suggested the ball berry stomatal conductance model which is able to simulate dynamic vegetation changes which however underestimates observed et relative to the jarvis model as seen for the semi arid environment of this study as well as in ingwersen et al 2015 and zheng et al 2019 for these reasons including the seasonal variation of lai at high spatial resolution as well as the improvement of jarvis model for accounting for the local ecohydrological processes as suggested in this study particularly during the growing season need to be considered for the simulation of the magnitude and temporal variability of the et components the impact of lateral routing which is enabled in wrf hydro unlike the stand alone noah mp lsm can be seen in fig 10 the wrf hydro runoff coefficients are closer to the 1 1 line with the observed runoff coefficients compared to the noah mp runoff coefficients the correlation coefficient of wrf hydro runoff coefficient against observed values was 0 85 compared to 0 60 for the noah mp runoff coefficients in addition the average wrf hydro runoff coefficient was 0 13 very close to the observed average of 0 14 whereas the average value obtained with noah mp was 0 22 the reduced wrf hydro runoff amounts are related to the process of lateral routing and re infiltration of routed surface water zhang et al 2020 found that the re infiltration ratio and runoff coefficient in wrf hydro are two correlated indices furthermore wrf hydro here is enhanced with the loss factor introduced in the gw bucket model section 2 2 1 that contributes to groundwater losses and thus reduced baseflow wrf hydro has in some cases however higher runoff coefficients than noah mp this is because there might be a baseflow contribution to the total wrf hydro streamflow from groundwater stored in the bucket in the previous year overall these results clearly indicate the added value of using wrf hydro for water balance investigations 4 conclusions in this study a grid based approach was tested to calibrate the spatially distributed parameters of the wrf hydro model using the pest software the model equations of the groundwater bucket module and of the jarvis stomatal conductance model were improved to describe groundwater losses and nocturnal transpiration an impact analysis of different parameters parameterization options and the improved equations on total streamflow total evapotranspiration et and peak flows of 31 mediterranean mountain watersheds in a two year period was performed the parameter impact was examined relative to a baseline wrf hydro configuration for the baseline parameter set the parameters for runoff soil texture and soil depth were adjusted relative to the default wrf hydro and noah mp parameterization to represent local conditions the median bias of streamflow in the baseline parameterization was 54 and 139 respectively in two years of calibration the final model configuration was based on the results of the impact analysis and of the grid based calibration in the two year period and was evaluated in a five year period the main findings of this study are within the range of change of the soil parameter values or vegetation parameterization options the median streamflow and et of the 31 watersheds could be increased or decreased up to about 30 relative to the baseline model parameterization the largest impact in total streamflow peak flows and total et was due to three soil parameters hydraulic conductivity ksat the percolation controlling parameter slope and the porosity smcmax the vegetation parameterizations with the largest impact were the representation of vegetation density dveg option 1 monthly gvf and the jarvis stomatal conductance model the infiltration controlling parameter refkdt on which many previous studies focused impacts peak flows more than total streamflow but its effect on peak flow is similar or less than the effects of slope ksat and smcmax in the entire simulation period the impact analysis revealed that the effect of the most important parameters slope ksat vegetation parameters on streamflow and et was similar for all 31 watersheds and in two different hydrological years indicating the significance of the parameter impact analysis results the ball berry stomatal conductance model which is the default in noah mp lsm was found to simulate up to 25 less median transpiration than the jarvis model the jarvis model with the addition of a new equation for nocturnal transpiration simulated total day time and nocturnal transpiration close to locally observed amounts this modification of the jarvis model was also necessary to obtain acceptable results for streamflow the proposed groundwater loss factor lfac in the groundwater bucket component of wrf hydro was found to be another useful addition in the model code to reduce the streamflow overestimation by the reduction of baseflow on average the median reduction of total streamflow of the 31 watersheds was 30 in the two calibration years with lfac the groundwater loss factor can be especially useful for streamflow simulations of ephemeral streams the inclusion of groundwater losses can be considered to account for the cumulative losses from the water balance of semi arid mediterranean watersheds which are not modeled with wrf hydro such as extractions from groundwater the groundwater bucket model with the addition of the loss component is useful in simulating an average hydrological behavior of groundwater processes in complex fractured geology where groundwater basins are not aligned with surface watersheds the grid based calibration of the distributed model parameters ksat slope and refkdt for 19 spatial classes with pest proved useful for the estimation of parameter values the parameters were assigned spatially variable calibrated values in line with their expected hydrologic function on streamflow and spatial variability of land use topographic slope and geological classes the advantage of the grid based calibration is that the calibrated distributed parameters can be used for ungauged streams the final parameterization of wrf hydro based on the results of the grid based calibration and selection of parameters values and model options from the parameter impact analysis yielded positive model efficiency median nse 0 49 median kge 0 66 the model efficiency was lower however in the five year evaluation period median nse 0 02 median kge 0 10 the total streamflow median bias was 5 in calibration period and around 50 in the evaluation period the reduction of bias by about 50 is a substantial improvement relative to the baseline parameterization the wrf hydro model efficiency metrics and the bias metrics were highest and lowest respectively during wet years the median nse was about 0 5 for the wettest years above zero for the medium wet years and about 1 in the driest years the driest watersheds were also simulated with the highest negative relative biases the mae was however nearly the same and 0 5 mm d in both the calibration and in four out of five years in the evaluation period the overall results imply that the model performance is degraded in years with low total precipitation and dry conditions improving the model code by making the surface and stream roughness coefficients time variant could potentially improve the model performance for these conditions the calibrated model captures the patterns of the water balance annual partitioning among the components of evaporation transpiration and interception the simulated average et of 31 watersheds for seven years agreed with observations and accounted for 85 of the input precipitation which characterizes semi arid and mediterranean ecosystems the runoff coefficients obtained with the calibrated wrf hydro model averaged 0 13 whereas those obtained with noah mp which does not simulate lateral flow and re infiltration averaged 0 22 compared with the average observed value of 0 14 overall the pest based wrf hydro calibration for streamflow at multiple watersheds proved a functional and effective approach for the adjustment of model parameters and equations for both runoff and land surface processes additional to the groundwater loss factor and nocturnal transpiration equation improvements could be made to describe other observed hydrological and ecosystems processes for semi arid environments and ephemeral streams the impact of using the grid based calibrated wrf hydro with improved parameterizations on atmospheric modeling could be examined with fully coupled hydrological atmospheric simulations 5

2528,the physically based distributed wrf hydro modelling system including the noah land surface model with multiple parameterization options noah mp and the hydrological extension of the wrf atmospheric model weather research and forecasting model has recently been widely used for water balance investigations streamflow and coupled land atmosphere simulations despite the multiple available physical parameterizations in the model equations for simulating particular losses from the water balance are missing and a grid based calibration of distributed parameters across multiple watersheds has not been studied to fill these gaps this study aims i to analyze the impact of soil runoff groundwater and vegetation parameters on water balance components ii to improve baseflow and transpiration equations and iii to test a grid based calibration approach for distributed model parameters using streamflow observations the wrf hydro groundwater model was improved through the introduction of a groundwater loss factor and the jarvis stomatal conductance model was modified to account for nocturnal transpiration the grid based calibration was performed for three parameters infiltration hydraulic conductivity and percolation for 19 spatially distributed classes with the parameter estimation pest software the study area includes 31 small mountainous watersheds 5 115 km2 in cyprus in the eastern mediterranean a two year period 2011 2013 was used for calibration and a five year period 2013 2018 for the evaluation the baseline model set up overestimated streamflow on average by 50 in 2011 2012 and more than 100 in 2012 2013 overall streamflow and evapotranspiration et could vary by about 30 from the baseline simulation using different model parameters and model options the simulation of groundwater losses as a function of groundwater level reduced total streamflow on average by 30 the use of the proposed jarvis equation for nocturnal transpiration increased the total et on average by 25 the grid based approach facilitated the calibration of the distributed parameters over the area of the 31 watersheds the median nash sutcliff efficiency nse was 0 49 during calibration but 0 02 in the drier evaluation period the calibrated wrf hydro model reproduced the annual variability of et and the improved groundwater and transpiration equations reduced the substantial streamflow overestimation of wrf hydro the model performance during dry years demonstrated the need for representation of more processes that occur in semi arid environments with ephemeral streams and are not included in wrf hydro and noah mp the grid based wrf hydro parameterization can be applied to the full study area for fully coupled atmospheric hydrologic simulations keywords wrf hydro noah mp grid based calibration nocturnal transpiration semi arid conceptual groundwater model 1 introduction physically based and spatially distributed hydrological models have evolved over the last decades to become complex modelling systems that can represent the spatial variability of the hydrometeorological processes in the environment these models expand the capabilities of the simple lumped or conceptual hydrological models by simulating hydrological variables in the three dimensional land surface and subsurface space based on physical model formulation maxwell et al 2007 distributed models fit in a broad spectrum of applications they are used to simulate streamflow to reproduce flood events induced by extreme weather using spatially variable precipitation datasets yucel et al 2015 sofokleous et al 2021 and to improve our understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between the land surface and subsurface with the atmosphere through fully coupled atmospheric hydrologic model systems maxwell et al 2011 arnault et al 2018 rummler et al 2019 the community wrf hydro hydrological model gochis et al 2018 is a physically based spatially distributed model which is the core of the us national water model noaa 2016 and which has gained remarkable attention in research in the last few years developed as the hydrological extension of the widely used weather and research forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2019 wrf hydro is comprised of the noah land surface model lsm ek et al 2003 or the noah mp lsm noah lsm with multiple parameterization options niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 enhanced with lateral terrestrial water flow and a baseflow component it can operate in a fully coupled mode with the atmospheric wrf model wrf hydro simulates overland flow lateral subsurface flow flow in the channel network as well as inflow storage and outflow from surface and groundwater reservoirs gochis et al 2018 previous studies identified a number of model parameters to which wrf hydro simulated streamflow exhibits high sensitivity and which should be calibrated arnault et al 2015 and yucel et al 2015 identified the infiltration parameter refkdt in the surface runoff parameterization as the most impactful for streamflow simulations yucel et al 2015 found a significant reduction of simulated peak flow with an increase of refkdt from 1 to 2 with the suggested range of refkdt being from 0 5 to 5 according to the authors arnault et al 2015 added that apart from streamflow modeled monthly total precipitation and other water balance components simulated with the fully coupled wrf hydro are also sensitive to refkdt at the spatial scale of 100 100 km2 other authors confirmed the sensitivity of refkdt highlighting its importance in flood forecasting givati et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 due to its impact on the percolation of the soil and subsequently on baseflow particularly over mountain watersheds the parameter that controls percolation to groundwater at the bottom of the soil profile slope is also among the parameters that have been examined by numerous authors silver et al 2017 camera et al 2020 other commonly calibrated parameters in wrf hydro and related lsms are the vertical and lateral hydraulic conductivities senatore et al 2015 and the surface and channel roughness coefficients yucel et al 2015 arnault et al 2018 for the roughness parameters yucel et al 2015 found a significant impact on peak discharge magnitude and timing for flood events studies focusing only on the lsm component of wrf hydro in particular on the noah mp lsm showed that the calibration of parameters that describe land surface processes can impact the total runoff amounts cuntz et al 2016 suggested that lsm calibration should be made against both latent heat and runoff fluxes as plant and soil properties affect both fluxes ingwersen et al 2015 found that daily latent heat was underestimated by the ball berry model ball et al 1987 which is the default stomatal conductance model in noah mp zheng et al 2019 found that the jarvis stomatal conductance model jarvis 1976 produces more realistic transpiration in arid environments compared to ball berry through simulation of annual and seasonal evapotranspiration et with different configurations of noah mp for the different climate regions of the conterminous united states these authors also reported that the jarvis model produced significantly higher transpiration an additional 11 of total precipitation compared to the ball berry scheme whitley et al 2009 and wang et al 2020 reported the observation of nocturnal transpiration through sap flow measurements for different species these authors proposed modifications of the jarvis formula and calibration of the parameters of the four stress functions of the formula to better capture the daily nocturnal and seasonal variability of transpiration the partitioning of the surface energy and water balance to sensible and latent heat fluxes in noah mp was also found to be sensitive to the particular leaf area index lai and green vegetation fraction gvf dataset used fang et al 2018 this impact of plant parameters and parameterizations has not been addressed in the simulation of the water balance in previous wrf hydro studies wrf hydro is often calibrated and used for streamflow simulations in semi arid mediterranean environments for flood events e g silver et al 2017 camera et al 2020 and for multi month simulations e g senatore et al 2015 a process that is not included in wrf hydro and may impact simulated streamflow through baseflow particularly in dry areas is groundwater flow across surface watersheds schaller and fan 2009 used 30 years of streamflow data across 1555 basins in the united states and the variable infiltration capacity model to estimate the partitioning of water balance in these basins these authors found that the contribution of groundwater losses or gains in the water balance was significant they suggested that geology plays the most important role for groundwater flows across basins which are larger in term of losses in more arid regions the occurrence of groundwater flow across watersheds was shown through isotope and hydrogeochemical sampling and modelling analyses for the troodos area in the eastern mediterranean island of cyprus by christofi et al 2020 despite the spatially distributed nature of wrf hydro little to no attention has been given to a parameter calibration that is consistent with the spatial heterogeneity of the environment the reason for this is that previous wrf hydro model versions did not easily allow the modeler to assign spatially variable values to a number of important model parameters givati et al 2016 calibrated the infiltration parameter and hydraulic conductivity uniformly for a single watershed and then adjusted the calibrated values for subwatersheds silver et al 2017 proposed a calibration of refkdt by solving the model equation for infiltration for different soil texture types and observed values of hydraulic conductivity soil moisture runoff and precipitation rummler et al 2019 assigned different values to the infiltration parameter hydraulic conductivity and percolation parameter using information from land management maps yet most of the wrf hydro studies assign parameter values uniformly over entire watersheds a systematic and efficient approach to link the most important model parameters to landscape characteristics in a spatially distributed manner as hundecha and bárdossy 2004 suggested is currently missing this study aims to answer the following research question can the physically based wrf hydro model simulate streamflow of small semi arid mountain watersheds with an automated grid based calibration based on the topography land use and geology data of the study area considering losses from groundwater and nocturnal transpiration in light of this question the objectives of this study are i to examine the impact of soil runoff groundwater and vegetation parameters on annual streamflow peak flows and total et ii to improve baseflow and transpiration equations and iii to test a grid based calibration approach for spatially heterogeneous parameters these objectives are implemented in 31 small watersheds in the troodos mountains on the island of cyprus in the eastern mediterranean the changes in streamflow and water balance components due to alternative parameter values and parameterization options relative to a reference baseline model configuration are compared first for the two year period from september 2011 to september 2013 objective i and ii the model with the modified groundwater and transpiration equations is then calibrated with an automated grid based calibration of distributed parameters for the same two year period the calibrated model is evaluated for the period from october 2013 to september 2018 objective iii 2 methodology 2 1 study area and observational data the study geographically focuses on 31 watersheds of cyprus cyprus is an island with an area of 9251 km2 located in the eastern part of the mediterranean sea and it has a mediterranean climate the 31 studied watersheds st1 st31 form a radial percolation system around troodos the main mountain range of the island fig 1 daily streamflow recorded by the water development department of cyprus at the outlets of the 31 watersheds is used in this study for the evaluation of daily totals of wrf hydro streamflow the areas of the 31 watersheds range from 5 to 115 km2 long term average precipitation reference evapotranspiration eto runoff coefficients rc baseflow indices bfi and percent coverage of different geological formations of the 31 watersheds are shown in table 1 the precipitation over the watershed areas was derived from gridded daily precipitation camera et al 2014 sofokleous et al 2021 the eto was computed with the hargreaves s equation hargreaves and samani 1985 using gridded daily temperature data for the period 1980 2010 camera et al 2014 the rc was computed as the fraction of total annual streamflow to total precipitation daily baseflow was extracted from the daily streamflow with the part hydrograph separation method rutledge 1998 and the bfi was computed as the fraction of total annual baseflow to total annual streamflow geologically troodos is constituted by an ophiolite complex with plutonic intrusive and volcanic rocks and chemical sediments most of the rocks of the ophiolite especially the gabbro within the central plutonic sequence on the upper hillslope are faulted highly fractured and brecciated thus forming fractured aquifers or aquifer systems favoring infiltration udluft et al 2006 troodos has mostly lithic leptosols with a stony gravelly texture and a high variability in soil depth from very shallow 0 10 cm up to about 100 cm camera et al 2017 the study area is to a large extent covered by natural vegetation 70 comprised mostly by sclerophyllous vegetation and coniferous forests and to a lesser extent by crops cultivated on dry stone bench terraces zoumides et al 2017 the annual average et to precipitation ratio is 76 according to long term observations 2014 2020 of et components on a pine forest monitoring site near the outlets of two of the studied watersheds st16 and st17 eliades et al 2018a eliades personal communication about 15 of the transpiration is nocturnal transpiration eliades et al 2018b these long term annual average et observational data are used to evaluate and adjust modeled et in noah mp with wrf hydro in this study 2 2 model description and new model equations the wrf hydro modelling system gochis et al 2018 is a distributed physically based hydrologic model developed at the national centre for atmospheric research it simulates terrestrial hydrologic processes i e surface subsurface and channel flow and enables hydrologic atmospheric coupled modelling the wrf hydro modelling system contains the following six components i the land surface parameterizations of noah mp lsm which control the vertical water and energy fluxes in the soil and on the land surface ii an overland flow module iii a subsurface flow module iv a channel flow module v a reservoir storage and flow module and vi a conceptual baseflow module which controls groundwater storage and fluxes the wrf hydro v5 1 model version is used in this study the meteorological forcing data required by wrf hydro are incoming shortwave and longwave radiation specific humidity air temperature surface pressure near surface wind components and precipitation rate in addition to the vegetation mptable tbl soil soilparm tbl and global parameters genparm tbl for the stand alone noah mp lsm noah mp with wrf hydro require parameters for the lateral routing these include overland roughness hydraulic conductivity in the lateral direction as well as parameters for the channel and reservoir routing modules and for the groundwater bucket of wrf hydro in addition a number of noah mp land use soil texture dependent and global parameters can be assigned spatially distributed values all parameters are described in detail in gochis et al 2018 2 2 1 groundwater bucket loss factor the equation for the groundwater bucket baseflow in wrf hydro v5 1 is 1 q b u c k e t o u t c o e f f e e x p o n z z m a x 1 i f z z m a x q b u c k e t o u t q b u c k e t i n c o e f f e e x p o n z z m a x 1 i f z z m a x where qbucket out m3s 1 and qbucket in m3s 1 are the conceptual bucket model outflow and inflow at a given model time step z m is the depth of water stored in the bucket and zmax m is the maximum water depth in the bucket parameters coeff m3s 1 and expon control the response of the conceptual bucket the initial value of z is set at the beginning of the simulation period the depth of the water in the bucket z for a defined gridded domain is adjusted by the total percolation qbucket in of all grid cells of the gridded domain the extent of the contributing gridded domain to a bucket is defined by the user in this study the contributing gridded area is defined to be the same as the surface watershed for each of the 31 watersheds one novelty of this study is the incorporation of a loss factor in the baseflow routine of wrf hydro the loss factor can represent groundwater losses from surface watersheds as observed in the study area and reduce the overestimation of baseflow as seen in the baseline simulation experiments for the studied watersheds section 3 1 1 the modified equation of the groundwater bucket is 2 q b u c k e t o u t c o e f f 1 l f a c e e x p o n z z m a x 1 if z z m a x q b u c k e t o u t q b u c k e t i n c o e f f 1 l f a c e e x p o n z z m a x 1 i f z z m a x where lfac is a dimensionless loss factor ranging between 0 and 1 which quantifies a baseflow reduction from the bucket model as a function of the water level in the bucket parameter lfac represents the amount of groundwater losses from the specified surface watershed which can occur in fractured formations or groundwater systems where only part of the total percolation contributes to the watershed s baseflow 2 2 2 nocturnal transpiration the equations of the jarvis based stomatal conductance model in wrf hydro are based on the empirical stomatal conductance model proposed by jarvis 1976 which is still widely used the canopy stomatal resistance rs sm 1 can be computed at any environmental condition according to chen et al 1996 and is given by the following equation 3 r s r s m i n f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 1 where rsmin sm 1 is the vegetation type dependent minimum stomatal resistance corresponding to the value of canopy resistance at optimal environmental conditions for transpiration the value of rsmin is defined for different vegetation types in the noahmp tbl model input table f1 f2 f3 and f4 are four stress functions representing the effects of solar radiation vapor pressure deficit canopy air temperature and soil moisture respectively each ranging from 0 to 1 the model equation of the stress function f1 is 4 f 1 r s m i n r s m a x f 1 f w h e r e f 0 55 r s r g l 2 l a i where rsmax is the maximum canopy resistance which corresponds to the cuticular resistance of the leaves and a value of 5000 sm 1 is a representative value for many trees dickinson 1984 rs wm 2 is the intensity of direct solar radiation and rgl is a fitting parameter for the radiation response f1 ranging between 30 and 100 wm 2 and can be vegetation type specific noilhan and planton 1989 appendix a contains the full equations for the jarvis model the incorporation of a nocturnal transpiration component based on whitley et al 2009 and wang et al 2020 in the jarvis model in the noah mp code of wrf hydro is the second novelty of the study the et underestimation as seen in initial simulation experiments section 3 1 1 could be reduced by adding the nocturnal transpiration component the equation that replaces eq 4 is 5 f 1 r s k 1 k r r m r m k 1 r s k 1 where rm is the maximum solar radiation intensity at the latitude of the study area 1000 wm 2 and k1 wm 2 and kr are two fitting parameters that describe the curvature of the radiation response trial and error runs were performed to adjust k1 and kr such that the annual magnitude of transpiration increased by 15 close to the locally observed nocturnal transpiration fraction to total transpiration eliades et al 2018b the increase in transpiration with adjusted parameters was examined relative to the transpiration obtained with kr 0 in eq 5 which corresponds to zero nocturnal transpiration the selected parameter values were 1 wm 2 for k1 and 0 5 for kr however further calibration should be done on the jarvis equation and the nocturnal component to match the diurnal transpiration patterns 2 2 3 lai and dynamic vegetation the average leaf area index over a grid cell laicell in wrf hydro is given by 6 l a i c e l l g v f l a i where lai is the prescribed vegetation type dependent leaf area index or the dynamically predicted leaf area index of the vegetation in the grid cell and gvf is the green vegetation fraction of the grid cell the values of lai and gvf are controlled by the option for dynamic vegetation dveg of noah mp in wrf hydro six dveg options are available three dveg options 2 5 and 6 predict lai dynamically with the ball berry stomatal conductance model ball et al 1987 and the other three options 1 3 and 4 use tabulated vegetation specific monthly lai values and can be used with any stomatal conductance model the current study compares the performance of the ball berry and jarvis stomatal conductance models and for this reason the focus here is on dveg options that can be used with both conductance models i e 1 3 and 4 for the three options the monthly lai values are read from the noahmp tbl model input table for the different land use classes for dveg option 1 the gvf has prescribed monthly values which are derived from the modis dataset for dveg option 4 the gvf is the maximum of the 12 months of the modis derived data year round the equation for gvf for dveg option 3 is based on norman et al 1995 7 g v f 1 e b l a i where b is the extinction coefficient and has a value of 0 52 in model code eq 7 is part of the gap fraction theory by larcher 1995 which implies that there is a light attenuation following an exponential decay with increasing canopy depth gigante et al 2009 according to larcher 1995 different land uses can have different extinction coefficients in addition to the above options satellite derived monthly lai values of the copernicus global land service were tested for this study the new lai values were obtained by extracting the monthly copernicus lai for the year 2018 at 1 km for each land use type based on the gridded land use map section 2 3 2 these computed monthly values replaced the default monthly lai in mptable tbl following the update of lai the gvf was set to a globally constant value equal to 1 the selection of 1 for gvf was based on the fact that satellite derived lai corresponds to pixel average values of the vegetation density making gvf redundant gutman and ignatov 1998 with the updating of the prescribed lai values the monthly prescribed stem area index values were replaced by 10 of the lai values as assumed by the model appendix b contains the default and updated lai values 2 3 model set up and parameterization 2 3 1 watershed delineation and atmospheric forcing the 31 studied watersheds were delineated on a 100 m routing grid using the wrf hydro gis preprocessor arcmap wrf hydro gis pre processor v5 1 1 and the 25 m digital elevation model for cyprus from the geological survey department of cyprus the noah mp lsm grid was generated using the wrf model preprocessing system wps skamarock et al 2019 with spatial resolution at 1 km the domain for lateral routing of wrf hydro and the domain for the simulation of land surface vertical fluxes of noah mp cover the troodos mountain range fig 1 nine dams located upstream of eight streamflow stations in the study area were incorporated in the routing grid appendix d the default modis land cover with usgs land use categories at approximately 1 km resolution was replaced by the corine land cover clc dataset at 100 m resolution the clc dataset was reclassified to usgs land categories as required by the model according to pineda et al 2004 and is presented in appendix b the meteorological forcing of the noah mp lsm in this study consists of the output of the wrf atmospheric model except precipitation which was obtained from the spatial interpolation and temporal disaggregation of precipitation gauge observations based on the methods described in camera et al 2014 and sofokleous et al 2021 the wrf hydro time step for routing was set to 10 s and the time step for noah mp was set to 30 min the same as the temporal resolution of the atmospheric forcing and the model output time step from the model output 30 min streamflow and the annual totals for the water balance components of soil evaporation canopy interception and transpiration and soil moisture storage change were extracted for the model evaluation 2 3 2 land surface classes the values of spatially distributed model parameters were directly related to the physical characteristics land use topographic slope and geology of each grid cell the infiltration parameter refkdt in the surface runoff parameterization of wrf hydro was assigned spatially variable values based on nine land surface classes which are a combination of three land uses and three topographic slope classes the resulting nine land surface classes are shown in fig 2 the three land use classes were specified from the corresponding three dominant land uses in the study area the three classes are the coniferous forest the shrubland areas and the agricultural land the remaining classes each covering 3 of the total area were integrated in the three classes see table b1 appendix b the three topographic slope classes that were considered are flat to nearly flat terrain 5 moderate slopes 5 10 and steep slopes greater than10 the three slope classes cover areas of 32 46 and 22 respectively the assumptions used for assigning values to refkdt for different land surface classes were that infiltration capacity increases and thus refkdt increases with decreasing topographic slope and with increasing ground cover such as with natural vegetation as opposed to managed agricultural land 2 3 3 geological and soil type classes model parameters relevant to the soil and bedrock properties were linked to the geological formations of the study area for the present geological formations over the 31 watersheds five geological classes are defined fig 2 the percolation controlling distributed parameter slope was assigned values from 0 to 1 based on the permeability of these five classes according to udluft et al 2006 basal group diabase gabbro and plagiogranite have the highest permeability values of all ophiolite rocks whereas the vulcanic complex found at the foothills of troodos has low permeabilites the spatial distribution of the soil texture classes was the same as for the geological classes because the soil texture map for the mountainous part of cyprus is characterized by high uncertainty camera et al 2017 2 4 impact of model parameters and parameterization options on model outputs the impact of model parameters and model parameterization options on annual total streamflow annual total et and peak flow three day total discharge around the date with annual peak flow for two hydrological years 2011 2013 was examined this impact was quantified with the relative change of each model output δsimpar i which was computed as follows 8 δ s i m p a r i s i m p a r i s i m b a s e l i n e where simpar i is the model output variable computed with a certain parameter value or model parameterization option par i and simbaseline is the same variable obtained with the baseline parameter set these relative changes were computed for all 31 watersheds the parameter values were tested assigning the same parameter value across the domain test value 1 or test value 2 in table 2 the parameter values for the impact analysis were selected to be the minimum and maximum of the range of values specified in the model parameter tables section 2 2 the parameterization options dveg lai canres rs noc were tested for one or two different settings the selected parameters used in the analysis are parameters often reported in previous wrf hydro studies and vegetation parameters and parameterizations the impact however of a larger number of parameters than those listed in table 2 was examined with initial simulation experiments results not shown for soil texture dependent parameters these experiments showed that some parameters had similar impact and for this reason their number was reduced for this study the ball berry parameters were found to lead to minor changes in the model outputs and they were also omitted the baseline parameterization is the same as the default wrf hydro configuration but with the modifications of the parameter values described in this section which were made to represent local environmental conditions the baseline refkdt was assigned spatially variable values based on the nine land surface classes section 2 3 2 refkdt ranged for the three topographic slope classes from 2 to 4 for the agricultural land use from 2 5 to 4 5 for shrubland and from 3 to 5 for the coniferous forest the baseline percolation parameter slope values ranged from 0 1 to 1 the soil physical properties were related to the five geological classes section 2 3 3 for soil properties the baseline values were set as the default values from soilparm tbl model input file the groundwater bucket baseline parameters are specified in section 2 5 except for the refkdt and slope parameters the impact of the soil texture properties was examined for the parameters of porosity smcmax and hydraulic conductivity ksat the values tested for the soil parameters were set equal to the minimum and maximum of the range of values of the 13 soil textures specified in the noah mp soilparm tbl file the parameter for overland roughness ov rough2d ranged between the minimum and maximum default values of the 22 land use dependent values specified in the hydro tbl model file the default 2 m soil depth in wrf hydro was set to the smaller value of 1 m which is more representative of the generally shallow soils on the slopes of troodos mountains camera et al 2017 the effects of re initialization of the water depth in the gw bucket at the start of the second hydrological year zini was examined the zini option allows to remove excess water from the gw bucket at the end of a hydrologic year the groundwater loss factor in the baseflow bucket model equation lfac section 2 2 1 was tested as an alternative to the zini option the second half of table 2 presents the vegetation related model parameters and parameterization options the baseline stomatal conductance model used for the study is the ball berry model which is the default in wrf hydro the usgs land use based monthly lai values and the yearly maximum modis derived gvf comprise the baseline values for the vegetation density the impact of the various options dveg for the description of vegetation density lai and gvf as introduced in section 2 2 3 was examined the impact of the jarvis based model for stomatal conductance was also examined along with changes of the values of the jarvis model parameters and the change of the jarvis radiation component to account for nocturnal transpiration section 2 2 2 2 5 groundwater bucket parameters one major characteristic of baseflow for the majority of the troodos streams as ephemeral is the zero baseflow in the summer scatterplots of the long term baseflow indices i e the long term average and maximum bfi with the relative coverage of different geological classes in each watershed table 1 did not show a relation between the two for this reason the groundwater parameters could not be related to the geological characteristics across the model domain and parameters zmax and lfac were manually calibrated per watershed parameter coeff of the gw bucket model section 2 2 1 was set to two times the average non zero watershed baseflow for 28 watersheds for the baseline parameter set three watersheds st12 st13 and st14 which have a bfi equal or larger than 0 89 were assigned a value equal to 10 times the average non zero daily baseflow of the watershed parameter expon was set equal to 0 693 for the baseline parameterization which corresponds to bucket outflow equal to the coeff when the bucket is full 2 6 grid based calibration with pest the spatially distributed model parameters which were selected based on the results of the impact analysis section 3 1 2 and section 3 1 3 were calibrated for the land surface soil and geology classes using the parameter estimation pest calibration software doherty 2020 the calibrated parameter ranges were selected based on the ranges of the prescribed values for these parameters in the wrf hydro and noah mp input files for each land surface class and geology class the calibration range was further confined to a smaller range of values representative for the specific class as described in section 2 3 2 and section 2 3 3 the model parameter optimization simultaneously for the 31 watersheds was based on the minimization of the following objective function 9 φ i n o b s w i r i 2 where nobs is the total number of observations i e daily streamflow of 31 watersheds w is the weight of each observation i and r is the residual difference between model value and observation value the observation weights are set equal to zero or one with the value of zero used for missing observations the pest optimization algorithm is based on the least squares function and the gauss marquardt levenberg method doherty 2015 the pest estimation mode was used with singular value decomposition the latter guarantying numerical stability in the calibration process doherty 2020 the streamflow observations of the 31 watersheds were grouped into 31 groups the 31 watershed components in the objective function were assigned weights using the pwtadj1 utility of pest such that based on the residuals obtained for the initial parameter values the contribution to the objective function by each observation group will be equal this avoids a dominance of the objective function value by the watersheds with the largest errors doherty 2020 the automatic calibration with pest is based on the iterative behavior of the pest algorithm this means that the calibration is made up of multiple pest iterations with each iteration comprised of multiple wrf hydro model runs with different sets of initial parameter values this attribute of pest limits the possibilities for selecting a locally optimum solution of calibrated parameter set as a globally optimum the automatic calibration was terminated when pest failed to lower the objective function for three consecutive iterations as suggested in doherty 2020 2 7 simulation period and evaluation metrics the calibration and evaluation period referred to as 2011 2013 and 2013 2018 cover the sequence of hydrologic years from october 2011 to september 2013 and from october 2013 to september 2018 respectively the simulation period for the examination of the parameter impact on model outputs is the same as the calibration period following the adjustment of model parameters and options based on the impact analysis section 3 1 2 and section 3 1 3 and the pest calibration of the distributed parameters section 3 2 1 the model was evaluated for both the two year calibration period and the five year evaluation period with four evaluation metrics section 3 2 2 these metrics are the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse appendix e the kling gupta efficiency kge appendix e the mean absolute error mae and the percent total bias the individual annual water balance components of streamflow et soil evaporation transpiration interception groundwater storage change groundwater loss and soil moisture change were then assessed as fractions of precipitation for each hydrological year in the calibration and evaluation period section 3 2 3 total precipitation averaged over the area of the 31 watersheds is 900 mm for 2011 2012 and 680 mm for 2012 2013 total annual precipitation in the evaluation period 2013 2018 ranges from 397 mm to 700 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of model parameters and parameterization options on model outputs the baseline simulation results are presented first in section 3 1 1 the change in the output of wrf hydro with noah mp total streamflow peak flow and total et for simulations based on one parameter change at a time in the baseline parameterization table 2 relative to the output of the baseline parameterization are described in the following sections 3 1 1 baseline simulation results the baseline parameterization of the impact analysis table 2 simulated the fraction of average total et to average total precipitation over two watersheds st16 and st17 equal to 45 4 interception 12 soil evaporation 29 transpiration for the two years of calibration this fraction is much lower than the observed long term average et to precipitation fraction of 76 17 interception 16 soil evaporation 43 transpiration for the pine forest monitoring site near the outlets of the two watersheds the underestimation of et fluxes keeps the soil wetter and thereby affects surface runoff and percolation losses from the soil column to the groundwater the streamflow of the 31 watersheds for the two years was largely overestimated with a median percent bias of 54 in 2011 2012 and 139 in 2012 2013 this streamflow overestimation was linked to overestimated baseflow 30 in 2011 2012 and 80 in 2012 2013 resulting from soil column percolation losses the large positive bias in baseflow for the second hydrological year was found to be related to the contribution of water stored in the groundwater bucket and not released during the first year 3 1 2 soil runoff and groundwater parameters among the tested parameters slope and ksat followed by smcmax are the most effective in altering the streamflow amount as seen in fig 3 relative to the baseline parameter set no percolation slope 0 very low hydraulic conductivity ksat 4 mm h 1 and high porosity smcmax 0 48 lead to reduction of median watershed streamflow up to 25 with slope having the largest effect maximum percolation rate slope 1 very high ksat 168 mm h 1 and low porosity smcmax 0 34 lead to an increase in median streamflow of similar magnitude these parameters have a direct impact on soil moisture which in turn affects the available soil water for transpiration for this reason the change in median et has an opposite sign and an almost similar magnitude with the relative change of streamflow within the range of possible values of ksat the median relative change in total et is from about 20 up to 10 which is higher than the change resulting from any of the other soil and runoff parameters the same parameters with the addition of refkdt affect the peak flows most strongly for refkdt the relative change in streamflow 1 1 25 is smaller than the relative change in peak flow 0 6 2 4 the reason for this difference is because refkdt impacts mainly peak flows due to its regulation of the infiltration rate the effectiveness of refkdt in infiltration increases with drier soil moisture conditions as seen in the comparison of the relative change in peak flow for the two years in fig 3 and with increasing precipitation rate for these reasons previous studies e g yucel et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 which focused on short term extreme events found a strong regulation of refkdt in simulated streamflow regarding other parameters the low values of slope 0 and ksat 4 mm h 1 result in opposite signs of the relative change of peak flow in the two hydrological years these specific parameter values lead also to the highest et increase in both years the decrease of peak flow with no percolation slope 0 for instance in the second hydrologic year may be linked to the enhanced transpiration that reduces the soil moisture impeding the increase in peak flow due to saturation excess in 2011 2012 peak flows are instead enhanced with no percolation slope 0 probably because of saturation excess in the very wet conditions the effect of the gw loss factor lfac 0 1 is a reduction of total streamflow up to 30 in the wet year and in the second drier hydrological year by 15 to 75 for the different watersheds a comparable reduction is achieved with zini in the second hydrological year because the water depth in the bucket was set to 0 for the 28 ephemeral watersheds and to 0 1 times the water depth in the bucket for the continuous flow watersheds st12 st13 st14 at the beginning of the second year october 2012 both parameters are useful for the reduction of the substantial positive streamflow bias of the baseline parameterization however lfac induces groundwater losses and thus reduced baseflow throughout the simulation period zini creates instead a reduction in baseflow with a discontinuity in the baseflow component of the hydrograph at the time of initialization setting the parameter zmax equal to the maximum long term annual baseflow per watershed has a heterogeneous effect on the total streamflow of the 31 watersheds in contrast to the homogeneous response resulting from changes in the soil parameters total streamflow is reduced in some watersheds and increased in some others up to 25 in the wetter 2011 2012 and less in 2012 2013 this variable impact of zmax on total streamflow among watersheds justifies the manual calibration of zmax per watershed as described in section 2 5 considering the high variability of the model outputs to the percolation parameter slope it was selected to be a calibration parameter among the two soil properties ksat and smcmax the ksat was selected to be calibrated because of its larger impact and variability among watersheds compared to smcmax the soil depth for the calibration runs was set to 125 cm because it reduced the streamflow amounts that were overestimated by the 100 cm soil depth of the baseline parameterization further parameter refkdt which impacts the magnitude of peak flows was selected for calibration 3 1 3 vegetation parameters the magnitude of the relative change of total streamflow and et resulting from the representation of vegetation density gvf and lai is almost the same as the magnitude of the relative change due to the selection of the stomatal conductance model i e the jarvis model fig 4 the option for monthly gvf dveg 1 results in a median reduction in et by 15 up to 25 relative to the yearly maximum gvf dveg 4 baseline run the computation of gvf as a function of the prescribed monthly lai dveg 3 eq 7 results in higher gvf values and 20 higher et than both the monthly prescribed gvf dveg 1 and yearly prescribed gvf dveg 4 baseline the replacement of prescribed lai values with satellite derived values for different land use categories and gvf equal to 1 lai copernicus has a small impact on streamflow and et which are reduced and increased up to 5 respectively the jarvis stomatal conductance model increases the total annual et by 15 20 compared to the et obtained by the default option of ball berry model the refinement to the jarvis model with the inclusion of the description of nocturnal transpiration increases et on average with an additional 10 15 the adjustment of the parameter controlling the interception of precipitation by canopy ch2op to a value equal to 0 5 mm per unit lai instead of the prescribed 0 1 mm leads to a small increase in et due to increased intercepted precipitation the three parameters topt b and hs in the jarvis model stress functions have almost no impact giving the same results as the baseline parameter set the total et increase by 15 up to 20 with the jarvis model relative to the ball berry was found to be closer to the values of local et observations eliades et al 2018b this underestimation of et by ball berry in this semi arid mediterranean environment agrees with the results reported by zheng et al 2019 for the suitability of jarvis in semi arid regions of the conterminous united states for these reasons the jarvis model with the formula for nocturnal transpiration replaced the ball berry model in the model code of this study the jarvis model parameter topt was set to 20 c despite its negligible impact because the specific value is suggested for mediterranean vegetation by larcher 1995 and for crops by wang et al 2017 for a more realistic representation of gvf and lai the remote sensed copernicus based lai was used for the calibration model runs of this study the jarvis stomatal conductance enhanced with the nocturnal component leads to increased et relative to the baseline ball berry 30 which corresponds to a similar reduction in soil moisture the groundwater loss function continuously reduces the groundwater storage in the bucket as a function of the groundwater level and this induces reductions in baseflow overall but also reduction of large baseflow releases during peak flow events thus a new baseline parameterization based on modified jarvis and groundwater bucket equations could possibly lead to an altered impact of the tested parameters the difference in the parameter impact under drier conditions in soil and groundwater can be understood by comparing the relative changes of streamflow peak flow and et in the two hydrological years used in this study these relative changes are mostly similar in both the very wet 2011 2012 and in the less wet 2012 2013 particularly for the total streamflow and total et the significance of these findings is also indicated by comparing the relative impact of the same parameters and parameterizations for the 31 watersheds parameters slope ksat and lfac as well as most of the vegetation parameters result in similar relative changes in streamflow and et in both years as seen in fig 3 and fig 4 as well as when each watershed is examined individually for instance for st1 and slope equal to zero the relative changes in streamflow 0 92 in 2011 2012 and 0 87 in 2012 2013 and in et 1 09 in 2011 2012 and 1 14 in 2012 2013 have similar magnitude the same patterns can also be observed for ksat and lfac and most vegetation parameters and for other watersheds the results of this study show that the baseline parameterization of wrf hydro and particularly of noah mp from the parameterizations of which the soil runoff and vegetation parameters originate exhibit strong biases in et fluxes in the semi arid environment of the study area these findings are indicative of potentially strongly biased fluxes to the atmosphere which may affect the modeling of atmospheric variables such as in the wrf atmospheric model which can be coupled to noah mp and to wrf hydro as pointed out by lin and cheng 2016 in addition through the impact analysis it was seen that soil and vegetation parameters and the gw bucket maximum depth zmax as well as both the new gw loss factor and the adjustment in jarvis model equation are necessary to reduce the streamflow overestimation the largest reductions on average for all watersheds were up to 25 for slope ksat and the adjusted jarvis equation cuntz et al 2016 reached similar conclusions about the sensitivities of soil and vegetation parameters in a global sensitivity analysis for water balance components simulated with noah mp for locations in the eastern united states the influence of soil and runoff parameters on simulated surface fluxes with noah mp was also highlighted by li et al 2020 3 2 model calibration and evaluation 3 2 1 calibration of distributed and groundwater parameters the distributed model parameter calibrated values for refkdt slope and ksat for the different land surface and geology classes are presented in table 3 and fig 2 the calibration of the 19 parameters values was completed after nine pest iterations with 198 wrf hydro model runs the computational cost was 260 cpu hours per wrf hydro run for two years of simulations the manually calibrated value of zmax ranged between the long term annual average and maximum total baseflow for 17 watersheds for 12 watersheds zmax was set below the long term average baseflow and for two watersheds zmax was set above the long term maximum baseflow overall the grid based calibration of distributed model parameters resulted in calibrated parameter values generally within the calibration range and consistent with the expected hydrological function of watershed characteristics for instance the refkdt values were the highest and lowest for the topographic slope lower than 5 and larger than 10 respectively for the three land use classes from table 3 it is also seen that some calibrated refkdt values are equal to the maximum or minimum value of the range set for the calibration the calibrated values are most often close to the maximum values for the land surface classes with slope 5 low topographic slope is expected to increase infiltration which is simulated with high refkdt values these calibration results indicate the high infiltration rates which were correctly assigned by pest through the refkdt values for flat or nearly flat areas increasing the value of refkdt above these maxima reached during calibration will only induce however minor difference in the simulated streamflow according to camera et al 2020 these authors tested refkdt values ranging from 0 3 up to 1000 and showed that the refkdt impact on streamflow is well captured with values up to about five and only small variations in total discharge could be observed with refkdt up to about 100 for parameter slope the gridded areas with sedimentary gabbro or diabase geologies were assigned values higher than 0 85 this result is consistent with the high bedrock permeability of these formations udluft et al 2006 parameter slope values close to one lead to maximum percolation rate the calibrated values of ksat ranging from 2 8 10 6 and 1 6 10 5 m s 1 are also representative of the soils of troodos the highest hydraulic conductivities were assigned to soil classes of sandy loam and loamy sand which correspond to the geological classes of the uppermost part of troodos gabbro plagiogranite and ultramafic complex the spatial calibration has also resulted in higher value of ksat for the soil class of clay loam than that of loam despite that clay containing soils are expected to have a lower ksat than loam for instance these results are indicative of the high uncertainty of soil texture over troodos as reported by camera et al 2017 the grid based calibration for streamflow can be considered a useful method to estimate spatial values of soil properties that have not been measured the advantage in addition of the grid based calibration at multiple watersheds based on watershed characteristics is that the calibrated distributed parameters can be used for ungauged streams one limitation is that gw bucket parameters could not be linked to watershed characteristics in this study for ungauged basins gw parameters could instead be estimated from extrapolation of gw parameters of neighboring watersheds nevertheless the limitation of gw parameters is only relevant for streamflow and not for any land surface processes which control et 3 2 2 calibration and evaluation results the evaluation results of the model configuration based on the grid based calibration of distributed parameters are shown in fig 5 positive nse and kge values were obtained for 28 out of 31 watersheds with median nse equal to 0 49 in the calibration period the model efficiency in the evaluation period 2013 2018 is lower with a median nse of 0 02 and positive nse and kge in 16 and 21 watersheds respectively the number of watersheds with full streamflow observation time series in the evaluation period was however also lower 31 watersheds in 2013 2014 and in 2014 2015 26 in 2015 2016 20 in 2016 2017 and 15 in 2017 2018 despite this uneven number of watersheds in each hydrological year a positive correlation of nse and kge with total precipitation per hydrological year total precipitation shown in fig 8 with increasing efficiency metrics for increasing precipitation was observed considering all watersheds but also only considering the 15 watersheds with full records during the evaluation period the median nse and kge for the entire period were 0 24 and 0 55 with positive metrics for 28 and 29 watersheds respectively the mean absolute error mae in the volume of streamflow is on average 0 5 mm per day in both the calibration and evaluation period and the mae in the evaluation period is larger than the mae in the calibration period only in one 2014 2015 out of the five evaluation years the relative bias of total streamflow per hydrological year is less than 25 for 26 watersheds for the calibration period which is a substantial improvement relative to the bias of 50 100 in the same period with the baseline parameterization an exception is the group of five watersheds on the eastern flank of troodos mountains fig 6 which receives less rainfall than the west and central part of the mountains a large overestimation of total streamflow is evident from fig 5 and fig 6 for the evaluation period particularly for the three driest hydrological years 2013 2014 2015 2017 the examination of the simulated and observed hydrographs in fig 7 for three watersheds of different prevailing hydrological conditions i e non ephemeral st13 and ephemeral st17 and st21 confirms the results of fig 5 the hydrographs of all 31 watersheds are presented in appendix c the modeled streamflow follows very well the observed streamflow in the calibration period for most watersheds the most profound errors in the evaluation period are linked to baseflow and the mismatch between observed and simulated flow during the rising and descending limb of the hydrographs in the wetter years the timing of simulated peak flows agrees with the observed peak flows despite some errors in the magnitude of peak flows especially in days with high accumulated precipitation about 50 mm and above for the wettest hydrological year of the evaluation period 2014 2015 the first simulated peak flow is delayed for many watersheds relative to observations this delayed peak flow could be attributed to differences in the growth of the forest understory and the stream network vegetation which are represented by time invariant roughness coefficients in the model the errors in peak flows in days with high accumulated precipitation could be linked to errors in the precipitation because the rain gauge network that was used for the generation of the gridded forcing data may not sufficiently capture the spatial variability of the rainfall over the mountains sofokleous et al 2021 this explanation is even more important in small watersheds the small size of watersheds implies potentially large streamflow volume errors in case of errors of the spatially interpolated precipitation short concentration times in combination with the uncertainty of precipitation may also lead to errors in the timing of peak flows the reduction of performance in the evaluation period is common for wrf hydro as seen in other studies as well for a 3 year simulation period and a 1281 km2 sized basin in s italy senatore et al 2015 reported a reduction in nse from about 0 9 to about 0 3 moving from the calibration to the evaluation period these authors attributed the nse reduction to the peak flows underestimation which was related to the limitations in simulating the intensity and duration of precipitation for simulation of two extreme precipitation events for 22 watersheds in the troodos mountains camera et al 2020 reported nse and kge values above 0 5 for most watersheds for the calibration event and a reduction of the values of the two efficiency metrics remaining mostly positive for the evaluation event similar to this study they attributed the performance reduction to overestimation of peak flows which could have been lower with increased roughness coefficients biases in the baseflow component of the hydrographs as described above could be partly explained by the findings of previous studies for the groundwater processes in troodos boronina et al 2003 used the 2d groundwater modflow code to model groundwater processes of three troodos watersheds st29 st30 st31 and found substantial groundwater exploitation christofi et al 2020 showed with integrated observations and modeling that groundwater flows across subwatersheds the main reason for the latter is that in the complex fractured troodos aquifer system hydrogeological subsurface basins have a different extent than hydrologic surface watersheds the findings of boronina et al 2003 and christofi et al 2020 are indicative of groundwater losses simulated by wrf hydro here with the new gw loss factor rummler et al 2022 found that the implementation of a different groundwater parameterization i e a 2d groundwater table scheme with soil moisture and groundwater interaction improved wrf hydro streamflow simulations in the upper danube river basin however considering that modeling groundwater in fractured aquifers such as those in troodos is subject to large uncertainties the calibrated gw bucket model of wrf hydro with the groundwater loss factor introduced in this study is a useful conceptualization of complex groundwater processes such processes are groundwater losses beyond the watershed boundaries and water use abstractions that cannot be observed or modelled individually the low final nse calculated for the evaluation of wrf hydro can be due to the relatively large number of watersheds 31 calibrated simultaneously for a relatively small number of parameters 19 the consideration of alternative or additional soil parameters to be calibrated e g porosity and the exponent in the shape parameter for soil resistance as suggested to be very sensitive parameters by cuntz et al 2016 could have provided further performance improvements with the grid based calibration yet the assignment of distributed values to further soil properties would require additional computational resources and data for the spatial distribution of these properties which is currently lacking furthermore the equifinality of the results i e similar relative change of total streamflow et and peak flow in two different hydrological years with changes in the values of different parameters as discussed in section 3 1 2 and section 3 1 3 is another limiting factor for adding more parameters in the calibration parameter set an improved wrf hydro performance could possibly also be achieved with a variable soil depth across the simulation domain as fersch et al 2020 proposed which is however unsupported in the latest wrf hydro version v5 2 the degradation of the model performance in this study could have been lower in the evaluation period if a longer calibration period with an additional year of different precipitation conditions would have been included there are however certain considerations which imply that the poor model performance in dry years is not just subject to the selected period of calibration wrf hydro is a physically based model and the calibration of parameters used in the physically based model equations for two years with interchanging very wet wet and dry periods exposed the calibrated parameters to all of these conditions the aforementioned exploitation of groundwater resources over troodos not included in the wrf hydro code could be enhanced in drier years and this will have a direct impact on baseflow this study tested in addition to the loss factor the initialization of the groundwater bucket at the beginning of each hydrological year as a method to resolve the overestimation of baseflow in simulations of consecutive hydrological years this example highlights how water resources exploitation is not part of the physically based processes of wrf hydro and that the groundwater bucket level has to be manually adjusted to account for local water use the low performance of semi arid watersheds with ephemeral streams can also be explained by the changing vegetation properties in the stream network wet conditions in one year promote the development of riparian vegetation within the streams during the low flow season these changed stream roughness conditions remain in following dry years and hinder flow reaching the watershed outlet part of this flow becomes ponded water which eventually becomes et the stream roughness will decrease when the vegetation flattens during high precipitation and high flow events adding dynamic functions for some parameters to account for temporal variation of land surface and channel properties e g refkdt overland and channel roughness could alter the response of watersheds particularly for dry years and ephemeral streams the spatial calibration of these time variant parameters could in this case be performed for land surface classes based on high resolution satellite derived lai this study showed that the performance of small semi arid watersheds exhibits high relative change to model soil and vegetation parameters as well as to the total precipitation in the year of simulation the water limited environment of semi arid areas requires improved parameterizations reproducing et in noah mp which is the dominant water balance component for the largest part of a hydrological year at the same time the wet winter period of the year coincides with the period when the radiation is relatively low and thus the soil moisture and runoff parameterizations are important for simulating surface and subsurface runoff and percolation to the groundwater for streamflow simulations for entire hydrological years such as for seasonal streamflow forecasting the baseflow parameterization becomes important because baseflow is the dominant component in the hydrograph for the latter the soil physics parameterization and parameters slope and ksat which control the inflow into the groundwater bucket are important for the bucket outflow the size of groundwater bucket zmax and groundwater bucket outflow coefficients are other model components that should be considered in the calibration of the model 3 2 3 water balance evaluation the simulated watershed area average water balance components of the 31 watersheds are shown in fig 8 the partitioning of precipitation into the water balance components of soil evaporation canopy intercepted and evaporated water canopy transpiration runoff soil moisture change groundwater storage change groundwater loss and dam storage change the last not shown in each hydrological year is dominated by the losses to the atmosphere transpiration accounts for about 40 of the total water balance on average for all watersheds in addition soil evaporation and intercepted water have an average contribution to the total water balance of about 30 and 15 respectively therefore et returns about 85 of the input precipitation to the atmosphere the next most dominant component of the water balance is the total runoff with an average contribution of 15 a smaller contribution in the water balance less than 10 is due to the change in the soil and groundwater storage and to a much lesser extent to losses from the groundwater and dam storage soil and groundwater storage changes show positive changes in the wettest years such as 2011 2012 and 2014 2015 with these results the positive impact of the groundwater bucket in wrf hydro and the gw loss factor introduced here for streamflow simulations in semi arid environments can be seen once more the largely overestimated streamflow by the baseline wrf hydro as shown in this study can be reduced in order to better match the ephemeral behavior of semi arid streams with the adjustment of storage capacity of the gw bucket and the use of the gw loss factor the average water balance closure error was calculated to range within 5 possible sources for this figure could be the error in the numerical solution of the soil water flow in wrf hydro code maximum water balance error allowed per time step 0 1 mm and the mismatch between the watershed area of noah mp and wrf hydro from both of which the water balance components were extracted the watershed border in noah mp is based on its 1 km grid resolution whereas the watershed border in wrf hydro was delineated on the 100 m grid the temporal variability of these water balance components seems to be correlated with the total precipitation for instance the highest and lowest watershed average runoff coefficients are observed in the wettest 2011 2012 and driest 2013 2014 years respectively the water storage changes in soil and groundwater bucket relative to the total precipitation follow the change in total precipitation from year to year and the magnitude of the change is more evident in the transition between years when one of them is either very wet or very dry for instance the dry hydrologic year 2013 2014 after the wet 2012 2013 with total precipitation 400 mm and 680 mm respectively has a soil and groundwater storage change equal to 2 and 6 on average for all watersheds the ratio of evaporation interception and transpiration to the total precipitation seems to be inversely correlated with the total precipitation during the driest years the dominance of the three components is higher than in the wetter years taking into account however the amount of precipitation per hydrologic year the total amount of evaporated and transpired water is higher during the wet years the temporal pattern of the water balance components modeled by wrf hydro seems to generally follow observations at the pine forest monitoring site of eliades et al 2018a fig 8 which is located close to the boundary of peristerona watershed st17 and just downstream of the lagoudera watershed st16 the precipitation at the site is in the driest 25 percentile of the long term average precipitation of the 31 watersheds fig 8 the four year average 2014 2018 observed ratio of evaporation to precipitation e p was 0 18 whereas the simulated e p was 0 23 for peristerona and 0 26 for lagoudera the total observed interception to precipitation ratio i p according to long term interception observations by eliades et al 2022 was 0 19 and the modeled i p was 0 09 for peristerona and 0 10 for lagoudera the lower vegetation density for coniferous forest in the model copernicus lai 1 3 table b1 appendix b compared to that observed at the monitoring site lai 2 38 can explain the lower simulated interception rates and higher simulated soil evaporation fig 9 the four year average ratio of transpiration to precipitation t p at the site about 0 45 is very close to the average ratio simulated for the peristerona watershed 0 42 and for the lagoudera watershed 0 37 for the same years the partitioning of observed and modeled transpiration to day time and nocturnal amounts table 4 for the years 2015 to 2017 shows that the improved jarvis model reduces the total period transpiration bias for the location of the monitoring site for both day and night time to 25 and 28 mm respectively despite the improvement in the simulated amounts the jarvis model and the the parameters of the nocturnal jarvis radiation equation should be further tuned to match the diurnal transpiration patterns too overall the partitioning of the three water balance components to precipitation is simulated with a maximum difference of 10 of total precipitation relative to observations zheng et al 2019 found that for the improvement of annual and seasonal modeling of et through model simulations with noah mp the impact of terrestrial water and of vegetation changes during the vegetation growing season needs to be considered to account for the vegetation changes arsenault et al 2018 suggested the ball berry stomatal conductance model which is able to simulate dynamic vegetation changes which however underestimates observed et relative to the jarvis model as seen for the semi arid environment of this study as well as in ingwersen et al 2015 and zheng et al 2019 for these reasons including the seasonal variation of lai at high spatial resolution as well as the improvement of jarvis model for accounting for the local ecohydrological processes as suggested in this study particularly during the growing season need to be considered for the simulation of the magnitude and temporal variability of the et components the impact of lateral routing which is enabled in wrf hydro unlike the stand alone noah mp lsm can be seen in fig 10 the wrf hydro runoff coefficients are closer to the 1 1 line with the observed runoff coefficients compared to the noah mp runoff coefficients the correlation coefficient of wrf hydro runoff coefficient against observed values was 0 85 compared to 0 60 for the noah mp runoff coefficients in addition the average wrf hydro runoff coefficient was 0 13 very close to the observed average of 0 14 whereas the average value obtained with noah mp was 0 22 the reduced wrf hydro runoff amounts are related to the process of lateral routing and re infiltration of routed surface water zhang et al 2020 found that the re infiltration ratio and runoff coefficient in wrf hydro are two correlated indices furthermore wrf hydro here is enhanced with the loss factor introduced in the gw bucket model section 2 2 1 that contributes to groundwater losses and thus reduced baseflow wrf hydro has in some cases however higher runoff coefficients than noah mp this is because there might be a baseflow contribution to the total wrf hydro streamflow from groundwater stored in the bucket in the previous year overall these results clearly indicate the added value of using wrf hydro for water balance investigations 4 conclusions in this study a grid based approach was tested to calibrate the spatially distributed parameters of the wrf hydro model using the pest software the model equations of the groundwater bucket module and of the jarvis stomatal conductance model were improved to describe groundwater losses and nocturnal transpiration an impact analysis of different parameters parameterization options and the improved equations on total streamflow total evapotranspiration et and peak flows of 31 mediterranean mountain watersheds in a two year period was performed the parameter impact was examined relative to a baseline wrf hydro configuration for the baseline parameter set the parameters for runoff soil texture and soil depth were adjusted relative to the default wrf hydro and noah mp parameterization to represent local conditions the median bias of streamflow in the baseline parameterization was 54 and 139 respectively in two years of calibration the final model configuration was based on the results of the impact analysis and of the grid based calibration in the two year period and was evaluated in a five year period the main findings of this study are within the range of change of the soil parameter values or vegetation parameterization options the median streamflow and et of the 31 watersheds could be increased or decreased up to about 30 relative to the baseline model parameterization the largest impact in total streamflow peak flows and total et was due to three soil parameters hydraulic conductivity ksat the percolation controlling parameter slope and the porosity smcmax the vegetation parameterizations with the largest impact were the representation of vegetation density dveg option 1 monthly gvf and the jarvis stomatal conductance model the infiltration controlling parameter refkdt on which many previous studies focused impacts peak flows more than total streamflow but its effect on peak flow is similar or less than the effects of slope ksat and smcmax in the entire simulation period the impact analysis revealed that the effect of the most important parameters slope ksat vegetation parameters on streamflow and et was similar for all 31 watersheds and in two different hydrological years indicating the significance of the parameter impact analysis results the ball berry stomatal conductance model which is the default in noah mp lsm was found to simulate up to 25 less median transpiration than the jarvis model the jarvis model with the addition of a new equation for nocturnal transpiration simulated total day time and nocturnal transpiration close to locally observed amounts this modification of the jarvis model was also necessary to obtain acceptable results for streamflow the proposed groundwater loss factor lfac in the groundwater bucket component of wrf hydro was found to be another useful addition in the model code to reduce the streamflow overestimation by the reduction of baseflow on average the median reduction of total streamflow of the 31 watersheds was 30 in the two calibration years with lfac the groundwater loss factor can be especially useful for streamflow simulations of ephemeral streams the inclusion of groundwater losses can be considered to account for the cumulative losses from the water balance of semi arid mediterranean watersheds which are not modeled with wrf hydro such as extractions from groundwater the groundwater bucket model with the addition of the loss component is useful in simulating an average hydrological behavior of groundwater processes in complex fractured geology where groundwater basins are not aligned with surface watersheds the grid based calibration of the distributed model parameters ksat slope and refkdt for 19 spatial classes with pest proved useful for the estimation of parameter values the parameters were assigned spatially variable calibrated values in line with their expected hydrologic function on streamflow and spatial variability of land use topographic slope and geological classes the advantage of the grid based calibration is that the calibrated distributed parameters can be used for ungauged streams the final parameterization of wrf hydro based on the results of the grid based calibration and selection of parameters values and model options from the parameter impact analysis yielded positive model efficiency median nse 0 49 median kge 0 66 the model efficiency was lower however in the five year evaluation period median nse 0 02 median kge 0 10 the total streamflow median bias was 5 in calibration period and around 50 in the evaluation period the reduction of bias by about 50 is a substantial improvement relative to the baseline parameterization the wrf hydro model efficiency metrics and the bias metrics were highest and lowest respectively during wet years the median nse was about 0 5 for the wettest years above zero for the medium wet years and about 1 in the driest years the driest watersheds were also simulated with the highest negative relative biases the mae was however nearly the same and 0 5 mm d in both the calibration and in four out of five years in the evaluation period the overall results imply that the model performance is degraded in years with low total precipitation and dry conditions improving the model code by making the surface and stream roughness coefficients time variant could potentially improve the model performance for these conditions the calibrated model captures the patterns of the water balance annual partitioning among the components of evaporation transpiration and interception the simulated average et of 31 watersheds for seven years agreed with observations and accounted for 85 of the input precipitation which characterizes semi arid and mediterranean ecosystems the runoff coefficients obtained with the calibrated wrf hydro model averaged 0 13 whereas those obtained with noah mp which does not simulate lateral flow and re infiltration averaged 0 22 compared with the average observed value of 0 14 overall the pest based wrf hydro calibration for streamflow at multiple watersheds proved a functional and effective approach for the adjustment of model parameters and equations for both runoff and land surface processes additional to the groundwater loss factor and nocturnal transpiration equation improvements could be made to describe other observed hydrological and ecosystems processes for semi arid environments and ephemeral streams the impact of using the grid based calibrated wrf hydro with improved parameterizations on atmospheric modeling could be examined with fully coupled hydrological atmospheric simulations 5

system was 150 g it consisted of a weighing system and a drainage weighing system with a measurement accuracy of 0 139 kg and 0 001 kg respectively the data acquisition system automatically recorded the growing process of summer maize in about 0 47 hm2 planting area and the soil type was clay five maize plants were randomly selected to measure plant height hc leaf length and width at 1 or 2 weeks intervals during the maize growing season specific time length depended on maize growth stages and leaf growth rates the amount of each irrigation depends on the soil moisture content and collected experimental data within specific periods from june 18 to october 1 2011 from june 19 to october 2 2012 and from june 23 to september 30 2013 the growth period of summer maize was divided into three major stages the seedling emergence to jointing stage the booting to silking stage and the grouting and harvest stage table 1 shows the schedule of each growing stage in 2011 2012 and 2013 the pearson

artificial neural network ann model mainly include training processes of variable selection data segmentation and normalization and testing each process is composed of independent neurons in which the upper and lower ones are connected by transfer functions the transmission of ann starts from receiving data learning and fitness adjustment but if the difference between the output and the target results exceeds the expected value the forward propagation is replaced by back propagation in this case the weight and threshold of neurons in each layer can be changed to reduce the error in signal transmission abdullah et al 2015 through back propagation the network can gradually adjust the parameters in the model to reduce the error between prediction and ground truth and obtain the best prediction consequently ann has been applied to et0 estimation chen and ou 2010 traore et al 2010 traore et al 2016 but the simulation of crop evapotranspiration etc based on ann remains to be studied 2 3 2 support vector machine the support vector machine svm model proposed by vapnik 1995 is mainly composed of three parts input layer hidden layer and output layer the model is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on kernel function which is mainly used in regression and classification it has a strong ability to solve complex nonlinear problems and has been widely used in etc simulation yao et al 2017 fan et al 2018b tang et al 2018 dou and yang 2018 ferreira et al 2019 different svm algorithms use different types of kernel functions including linear nonlinear polynomial sigmoid kernel and radial basis function rbf svm transforms a low dimensional space into a high dimensional space the research indicates that the estimated results in feature space transformed by rbf function have high accuracy fan et al 2018b tang et al 2018 therefore in this study the svm model based on the rbf function is used to predict daily corn etc for more details about the model please refer to yao et al 2017 2 3 3 random forest random forest rf proposed by breiman 2001 is an algorithm based on supervised ensemble learning samples for training are randomly selected to create independent decision trees these trees through regression can produce their own predictions the average value of which is used as the final output the model can deal with high dimensional regression complex nonlinear problems and classification and the over fitting problem can be reduced through regression feng et al 2017c therefore researchers feng et al 2017c shiri 2018 fan et al 2019 applied the rf model to estimate et0 but there are few applications to the simulation of crop water consumption for more detailed information about the rf model please refer to karimi et al 2020 2 3 4 extreme learning model the extreme learning machine elm model first proposed by huang et al 2006 contains three main layers input layer input variable parameters hidden layer neuron and output layer etc it is a feedforward neural network ffnn model that can randomly set the input weights and has higher learning efficiency and higher generalization performance than the traditional model ffnn specifically different input parameters need to be tuned and the mapping between different layers should be maintained in the ffnn model while the parameters of hidden layers are randomly assigned without any further adjustment in the elm model which makes the training of the model extremely fast for more details about elm please refer to huang 2014 2 4 evaluating indicators determination coefficient r2

results 3 1 meteorological and growth factors at different growth stages of maize table 4 shows the average daily meteorological parameters crop coefficient and evapotranspiration of summer maize in different growing seasons the meteorological data were collected from a meteorological station 150 m away from the experiment station including wind speed u 2 at the height of 2 m above the ground daily maximum and minimum temperatures t max and t min maximum and minimum relative humidity rhmax and rhmin solar radiation r s and evapotranspiration etc table 4 indicated that there was a small change in the meteorological parameters of summer maize at each growth stage specifically wind speed u 2 air temperature tmax tmin and solar radiation rs were the lowest while the relative air humidity rhmax rhmin was the highest at the grouting to harvest stage and the evapotranspiration was the lowest at the seedling emergence to jointing stage it can be seen from table 4 that the grouting to harvest stage of summer maize from mid september to early october temperature solar radiation and wind speed gradually decreased and air humidity gradually increased at the seedling emergence to jointing stage the evapotranspiration of maize was seedlings low as it mainly came from soil evaporation 3 2 simulation of summer maize etc at the seedling emergence to jointing stage the simulation results of the daily evapotranspiration etc of summer maize at the seedling emergence to jointing stage using rf svm ann and elm models under six different input combinations were shown in table 5 it shows that the mean r2 from rf svm ann and elm models under six input combinations was 0 764 0 772 0 733 and 0 762 the mean mse was 0 403 0 479 0 513 and 0 518 mm d and the mean gpi was 0 147 0 153 0 399 and 0 324 respectively the performance of the four machine learning models ranked in the order of svm rf elm and ann the results indicated that the svm had higher accuracy than other models at the seedling emergence to jointing stage of summer maize among rf models rfⅰ 6 had the highest simulation accuracy followed by rfⅰ 5 and rfⅰ 4 with r2 of 0 859 0 827 and 0 791 mse of 0 232 0 291 and 0 350 mm d and gpi of 1 197 0 732 and 0 397 respectively the rfⅰ 4 model was thus recommended as the optimal one considering both the accessibility of input parameters and simulation accuracy among svm models the svmⅰ 6 had the highest simulation accuracy followed by svmⅰ 2 and svmⅰ 5 with r2 of 0 895 0 796 and 0 781 mse of 0 227 0 327 and 0 442 mm d and gpi of 2 112 0 729 and 0 014 respectively the svmⅰ 2 model was the best one because it had relatively higher simulation accuracy and the inputs of the crop were only coefficient temperature and radiation among ann models the annⅰ 5 had the highest accuracy followed by annⅰ 4 and annⅰ 6 models with r2 of 0 782 0 764 and 0 749 mse of 0 367 0 395 and 0 396 mm d and gpi of 0 360 0 089 and 0 068 respectively the annⅰ 4 was the optimal model because it required fewer parameters and had higher accessibility than annⅰ 5 and annⅰ 6 among elm models the elmⅰ 6 had the highest accuracy followed by elmⅰ 5 and elmⅰ 2 models with r2 of 0 852 0 782 and 0 771 mse of 0 284 0 324 and 0 347 mm d and gpi of 1 001 0 514 and 0 270 respectively the elmⅰ 2 model with relatively fewer input parameters and higher simulation accuracy was thus

relatively higher simulation accuracy followed by rfiv 5 and rfiv 2 with r2 of 0 873 0 869 and 0 865 mse of 0 224 0 289 and 0 324 mm d and gpi of 0 055 0 310 and 0 545 respectively the rfiv 2 required fewer parameters and had higher accuracy and accessibility than rfiv 6 and rfiv 2 so it was considered as the optimal model among svm models the svmiv 6 had the highest simulation accuracy followed by svmiv 5 and svmiv 2 with r2 of 0 889 0 885 and 0 885 mse of 0 203 0 216 and 0 225 mm d and gpi of 0 436 0 158 and 0 144 respectively overall the svmiv 2 model was the recommended one with simulation

one due to its relatively higher accuracy of stimulation and accessibility of the required parameters the rfiv 2 svmiv 2 anniv 2 and elmiv 2 were the optimal models among the four machine learning models respectively with r 2 of 0 865 0 885 0 879 and 0 896 mse of 0 324 0 225 0 226 and 0 190 mm d and gpi of 0 545 0 144 0 004 and 0 342 respectively the results demonstrated that the accuracy of elmiv 2 was the highest followed by svmiv 2 and anniv 2 and the accuracy of rfiv 2 was the lowest therefore the elmiv 2 model was recommended for summer maize etc simulation during the whole growing period based on rf svm ann and elm models maize evapotranspiration at the whole growth stage was simulated under six input combinations as shown in fig 9 as can be seen from the figure the simulated and measured values of the four machine learning models under six different inputs are close to the 1 1 line indicating that the simulation accuracy of the model was high in the whole growth period among them the elmiv 2 model had high simulation accuracy under kc tmax tmin and rs inputs which can accurately reflect the water demand information of maize in the whole growth period fig 10 illustrates the simulation accuracy of rf svm ann and elm models under six different input combinations during the whole growing period of summer maize the red reference points in the figure referred to the observed value etc obs and the closer the four models output to the points was the higher their accuracy was it can be seen that among the four models under six input combinations the elmiv 6 had the highest accuracy followed by svmiv 6 and elmiv 5 under a limited amount of input data the accuracy of the elmiv 2 model was the highest and the following were elmiv 4 and elmiv 3 in conclusion the elmiv 2 model was more suitable for summer maize etc simulation during the whole growing period the evapotranspiration of maize in the whole growth period was simulated based on rf dt svm and elm models with different inputs as shown in fig 11 it can be seen from the figure that the errors between the simulated and the measured values of the four models under different inputs are small indicating that the simulation accuracy of the four machine learning models was high therefore machine learning models were recommended to simulate maize evapotranspiration 3 6 time cost of the four machine learning models fig 12 shows the time cost of four models under six different input combinations it can be seen that under six input combinations the time consumed by rf ann svm and elm models ranged 3 19 4 13 25 13 29 29 4 07 4 31 and 2 08 3 59 s which indicated that the running time of rf ann and elm was much less than that of svm and elm model took the shortest time based on six input combinations through the four machine learning models the running time of set c3 kc tmax tmin and u 2 was the least 7 0 shorter than that of set c2 the one with the longest time consumption with the gradual increase of input parameters the time consumption of elm models had an overall increasing trend of but smaller than that of rf and ann 4 discussion 4 1 simulation of etc in different growth stages of summer maize by rf ann svm and elm models evapotranspiration simulation is a complex and dynamic nonlinear process this study based on svm elm ann and rf models simulated the evapotranspiration of summer maize at different growth stages and found that models in oder of precision performance are svm rf elm and ann at the seedling emergence to jointing stage elm ann rf and svm at the booting to silking stage svm elm ann and rf at the grouting to harvest stage and elm svm ann and rf during the whole growing period the rf model for lack of hyper parameter tuning randomly selected training data to build classifier leading to instability in simulation accuracy so the accuracy of the model was the lowest at the grouting to harvest stage and during the whole growing period and was relatively higher at the seedling emergence to jointing stage breiman 2001 yamaç 2021 the svm model can build the optimal hyperplane in feature space based on the structural risk minimization principle obtain the optimal value of global convergence and seek the optimal value in the case of small dataset size so its simulation accuracy can achieve the highest at the seedling emergence to jointing stage and at grouting and harvest stage mehdizadeh et al 2017 yin et al 2017 wen et al 2015 the ann is a mathematical model inspired by networks of biological neurons to process complex information and its output values are affected by many factors resulting in uncertainty in the simulation accuracy in different growing stages abyaneh et al 2011 abdullah et al 2015 the elm model had relatively higher simulation accuracy at the booting to silking stage and during the whole growing period of summer maize but the model may run into underfitting with great randomness and low simulation accuracy due to short data series in training at the seedling emergence to jointing stage and at the grouting to harvest stage huang et al 2006 wu et al 2021a compared with rf ann and svm models elm has the advantage of good usability with no need for manual adjustment of any parameters fast learning speed i e computing data in milliseconds and seconds high generalization performance better than ann similar to or better than svm and excellent suitability for all nonlinear functions including discontinuous differential and non differential functions fan et al 2018b feng et al 2018 these models in order of running time and stability are svm elm ann and rf when new data were used as input the simulation accuracy of rf with poor stability was relatively lower hassan et al 2017 while elm and svm had optimal accuracy and stability however considering the structural complexity estimation accuracy calculation cost and availability of input parameters the elm model was effective in simulating daily maize etc in semi humid areas in northern china in addition the machine learning model can be coupled with grid data to simulate crop evapotranspiration at the regional scale 4 2 the significant effect of different meteorological factors on maize etc at each growth stage it was found that different meteorological factors significantly affected the daily etc of summer maize at each growth stage at the seedling emergence to jointing stage maize transpiration mainly depended on soil evaporation and the leaf transpiration rate gradually rose the maize canopy leaf stomata closure affected the vertical distribution of solar radiation and temperature change but had few impacts on wind speed and relative humidity solar radiation rs and temperature t were the key factors in etc at this stage shan et al 2020 li et al 2016 at the booting to silking stage when summer maize grew rapidly with the gradual increase of canopy stomata closure there was a large difference in humidity and temperature between the top and bottom of the canopy and a decrease in saturated vapor pressure deficit liu et al 2015 more solar radiation was captured by the canopy for transpiration accounting for a larger proportion than soil evaporation therefore the etc of summer maize at this stage was mainly affected by radiation temperature and humidity li et al 2013 yu et al 2016 kang et al 2003 at the grouting and harvest stage the leaves gradually turned yellow and the canopy closure gradually decreased the solar radiation was able to irradiate the ground through the canopy gap in this stage the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the canopy became small the soil evaporation gradually increased and the canopy transpiration decreased piotrowski and napiorkowski 2013 zhang et al 2016 shan et al 2020 therefore the changes in temperature and solar radiation received by the maize canopy were consistent with the changes in canopy closure and the impacts on humidity and wind speed were relatively small solar radiation and temperature were the major driving factors for summer maize etc at this stage in addition some researchers also hold that the contribution of meteorological parameters to etc was different under different terrain or climate conditions torres et al 2011 tabari et al 2012 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 5 conclusions this study divided the growth season of summer maize into three growth stages the seedling emergence to jointing stage the booting to silking stage and the grouting to harvest stage and simulated the evapotranspiration of summer maize through four machine learning models under six different input combinations the results show that at the seedling emergence to jointing stage at the booting and silking stage at the grouting to harvest stage and during the whole growing period of summer maize the accuracy of svmⅰ 6 elmⅱ 5 svmiii 6 and elmiv 6 model was the highest with r2 of 0 895 0 879 0 841

and ann models using meteorological data and crop coefficients were not as efficient as elm and svm models their accuracy for maize etc estimation was acceptable and could be considered as a tool to estimate maize etc the findings of this research can be utilized to optimize irrigation planning and water consumption in the areas analyzed it is suggested that the proposed models be tested under various climatic conditions in addition machine learning models can be combined with meta heuristic algorithms and remote sensing data to scientifically guide water resource scheduling and planning at

jiang et al 2021 however the main limitation of these methods developed on a physical basis is that their required input data cannot be easily measured such as aerodynamic and surface resistance ding et al 2013 huang et al 2019 mattar 2018 to overcome this deficiency the indirect fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach was proposed by allen et al 1998 which was the product of reference

the growing process of summer maize in about 0 47 hm2 planting area and the soil type was clay five maize plants were randomly selected to measure plant height hc leaf length and width at 1 or 2 weeks intervals during the maize growing season specific time length depended on maize growth stages and leaf growth rates the amount of each irrigation depends on the soil moisture content and collected experimental data within specific periods from june 18 to october 1 2011 from june 19 to october 2 2012 and from june 23 to september 30 2013 the growth period of summer maize was divided into three

artificial neural network ann model mainly include training processes of variable selection data segmentation and normalization and testing each process is composed of independent neurons in which the upper and lower ones are connected by transfer functions the transmission of ann starts from receiving data learning and fitness adjustment but if the difference between the output and the target results exceeds the expected value the forward propagation is replaced by back propagation in this case the weight and threshold of neurons in each layer can be changed to reduce the error in signal transmission abdullah et al 2015 through back propagation the network can gradually adjust the parameters in the model to reduce the error between prediction and ground truth and obtain the best prediction consequently ann has been applied to et0 estimation chen and ou 2010 traore et al 2010 traore et al 2016 but the simulation of crop evapotranspiration etc based on ann remains to be studied

different input parameters need to be tuned and the mapping between different layers should be maintained in the ffnn model while the parameters of hidden layers are randomly assigned without any further adjustment in the elm model which makes the training of the model extremely fast for more details about elm please refer to huang 2014 2 4 evaluating indicators determination coefficient r2

ranged 3 19 4 13 25 13 29 29 4 07 4 31 and 2 08 3 59 s which indicated that the running time of rf ann and elm was much less than that of svm and elm model took the shortest time based on six input combinations through the four machine learning models the running time of set c3 kc tmax tmin and u 2 was the least 7 0 shorter than that of set c2 the one with the longest time consumption with the gradual increase of input parameters the time consumption of elm models had an overall increasing trend of but smaller than that of rf and ann 4 discussion 4 1 simulation of etc in different growth stages of summer maize by rf ann svm and elm models evapotranspiration simulation is a complex and dynamic nonlinear process this study based on svm elm ann and rf models simulated the evapotranspiration of summer maize at different growth stages and found that models in oder of precision performance are svm rf elm and ann at the seedling emergence to jointing stage elm ann rf and svm at the booting to silking stage svm elm ann and rf at the grouting to harvest stage and elm svm ann and rf during the whole growing period the rf model for lack of hyper parameter tuning randomly selected training data to build classifier leading to instability in simulation accuracy so the accuracy of the model was the lowest at the grouting to harvest stage and during the whole growing period and was relatively higher at the seedling emergence to jointing stage breiman 2001 yamaç 2021 the svm model can build the optimal hyperplane in feature space based on the structural risk minimization principle obtain the optimal value of global convergence and seek the optimal value in the case of small dataset size so its simulation accuracy can achieve the highest at the seedling emergence to jointing stage and at grouting and harvest stage mehdizadeh et al 2017 yin et al 2017 wen et al 2015 the ann is a mathematical model inspired by networks of biological neurons to process complex information and its output values are affected by many factors resulting in uncertainty in the simulation accuracy in different growing stages abyaneh et al 2011 abdullah et al 2015 the elm model had relatively higher simulation accuracy at the booting to silking stage and during the whole growing period of summer maize but the model may run into underfitting with great randomness and low simulation accuracy due to short data series in training at the seedling emergence to jointing stage and at the grouting to harvest stage huang et al 2006 wu et al 2021a compared with rf ann and svm models elm has the advantage of good usability with no need for manual adjustment of any parameters fast learning speed i e computing data in milliseconds and seconds high generalization performance better than ann similar to or better than svm and excellent suitability for all nonlinear functions including discontinuous differential and non differential functions fan et al 2018b feng et al 2018 these models in order of running time and stability are svm elm ann and rf when new data were used as input the simulation accuracy of rf with poor stability was relatively lower hassan et al 2017 while elm and svm had optimal accuracy and stability however considering the structural complexity estimation accuracy calculation cost and availability of input parameters the elm model was effective in simulating daily maize etc in semi humid areas in northern china in addition the machine learning model can be coupled with grid data to simulate crop evapotranspiration at the regional scale 4 2 the significant effect of different meteorological factors on maize etc at each growth stage it was found that different meteorological factors significantly affected the daily etc of summer maize at each growth stage at the seedling emergence to jointing stage maize transpiration mainly depended on soil evaporation and the leaf transpiration rate gradually rose the maize canopy leaf stomata closure affected the vertical distribution of solar radiation and temperature change but had few impacts on wind speed and relative humidity solar radiation rs and temperature t were the key factors in etc at this stage shan et al 2020 li et al 2016 at the booting to silking stage when summer maize grew rapidly with the gradual increase of canopy stomata closure there was a large difference in humidity and temperature between the top and bottom of the canopy and a decrease in saturated vapor pressure deficit liu et al 2015 more solar radiation was captured by the canopy for transpiration accounting for a larger proportion than soil evaporation therefore the etc of summer maize at this stage was mainly affected by radiation temperature and humidity li et al 2013 yu et al 2016 kang et al 2003 at the grouting and harvest stage the leaves gradually turned yellow and the canopy closure gradually decreased the solar radiation was able to irradiate the ground through the canopy gap in this stage the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the canopy became small the soil evaporation gradually increased and the canopy transpiration decreased piotrowski and napiorkowski 2013 zhang et al 2016 shan et al 2020 therefore the changes in temperature and solar radiation received by the maize canopy were consistent with the changes in canopy closure and the impacts on humidity and wind speed were relatively small solar radiation and temperature were the major driving factors for summer maize etc at this stage in addition some researchers also hold that the contribution of meteorological parameters to etc was different under different terrain or climate conditions torres et al 2011 tabari et al 2012 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 5 conclusions this study divided the growth season of summer maize into three growth stages the seedling emergence to jointing stage the booting to silking stage and the grouting to harvest stage and simulated the evapotranspiration of summer maize through four machine learning models under six different input combinations the results show that at the seedling emergence to jointing stage at the booting and silking stage at the grouting to harvest stage and during the whole growing period of summer maize the accuracy of svmⅰ 6 elmⅱ 5 svmiii 6 and elmiv 6 model was the highest with r2 of 0 895 0 879 0 841 and 0 954 mae of 0 310 0 418 0 468 and 0 285 mm d mse of 0 227 0 887 0 513 and 0 182 mm d respectively which confirmed the capabilities of elm and svm models for maize etc estimation although the rf and ann models using meteorological data and crop coefficients were not as efficient as elm and svm models their accuracy for maize etc estimation was acceptable and could be considered as a tool to estimate maize etc the findings of this research can be utilized to optimize irrigation planning and water consumption in the areas analyzed it is suggested that the proposed models be tested under various climatic conditions in addition machine learning models can be combined with meta heuristic algorithms and remote sensing data to scientifically guide water resource scheduling and planning at
