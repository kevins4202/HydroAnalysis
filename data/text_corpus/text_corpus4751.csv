23755,idealized and comprehensive ocean models at low resolutions cannot reproduce nominally resolved flow structures similar to those presented in the high resolution solution although there are various underlying physical reasons for this from the dynamical system point of view all these reasons manifest themselves as a low resolution trajectory avoiding the phase space occupied by the reference solution the high resolution solution projected onto the coarse grid in order to solve this problem a set of hyper parameterization methods has recently been proposed and successfully tested on idealized ocean models in this work for the first time we apply one of hyper parameterization methods advection of the image point to a comprehensive rather than idealized general circulation model of the north atlantic the results show that the hyper parameterization method significantly outperforms the coarse grid ocean model by reproducing both the large and small scale features of the gulf stream flow the proposed method is much faster than even a single run of the coarse grid ocean model requires no modification of the model and is easy to implement moreover the method can take not only the reference solution as input data but also real measurements from different sources drifters weather stations etc or combination of both all this offers a great flexibility to ocean modellers

parameterization problem nudging gulf stream flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the eddy parameterization problem how to account for the effect of unresolved small scales onto the resolved large scales is one of the most challenging problems in the ocean modelling counting decades of active research despite a number of parameterizations computationally affordable and physically justified mathematical models of unresolved processes have been proposed to solve the problem e g gent and mcwilliams 1990 duan and nadiga 2007 frederiksen et al 2012 mana and zanna 2014 cooper and zanna 2015 grooms et al 2015 berloff 2015 2016 2018 ryzhov et al 2019 cotter et al 2019 ryzhov et al 2020 cotter et al 2020a b c it remains largely unresolved the main general point is that most of the parameterization approaches are physics based rather than data driven and the former has obvious advantage of being valid in situation when the underlying physics changes however in the situation when physics based parameterizations remain in their infancy there is a great practicality in considering data driven parameterizations which can reproduce nominally resolved flow structures within their obvious limitations for example for many research questions a computationally cheap data driven solution can replace a computationally expensive dynamical ocean simulation in climate type models and predictions our approach is both novel and orthogonal to all existing parameterization approaches we refer to it as hyper parameterization and develop it in the context of oceanic eddies although its broader impact will be across most of the turbulence research areas hyper parameterization is a new strategy which capitalizes on the use of quasi time invariant structures in phase space and within this approach the main focus is shifted from representing essential local physics of cross scale interactions towards simulating nominally resolved most important flow patterns directly including anti diffusive jet sharpening and upscale feedbacks advancing the hyper parameterization approach within broader context of data driven parameterizations provides the main motivation for our study in which we continue the series of precursor works shevchenko and berloff 2021a 2022b a the main novelty is to adapt the methodology for fully comprehensive and realistic ocean models and demonstrate its success with full confidence in turn this paves the way for broad use of hyper parameterizations across the ocean modelling community 2 the method in this work we consider the method called advection of the image point the image point also called the representative point corresponds to the tip of the state vector of the dynamical system in the phase space advection means that the image point is transported by the vector flow mapped in the phase space here in terms of discrete observations of tendencies the method falls into the category of data driven methods and has been successfully tested on a multi layer quasi geostrophic model and showed promising results shevchenko and berloff 2021a the method is based on the fact that the first order ordinary differential equation 1 x t f x x r n can be interpreted as a vector field f x in the phase space of eq 1 and the prime denotes a derivative in time if f x is known it can be used to advect the image point x in the phase space evolution of an image point can be described by the equation 2 y t 1 n i u y t f x t i η 1 m i u y t x t i y t y t 0 x t 0 where u y t is a neighbourhood of solution y t and i is the timestep of the reference solution x t i the integration step for 2 equals to the step with which the reference solution is sampled 6 h in our case in a nutshell in eq 2 we nudge toward the observed reference states x t i in the phase space neighbourhood in order to prevent runaway from the attractor the actual dynamics is given by reconstruction of the observed references tendencies this is the key right hand side term the neighbourhood is computed as the average over n and m for the nudging term nearest in l 2 norm to the solution y t points and η is the nudging strength having units of 1 s we will return to the choice of n m and η in the next section we refer to these parameters as hyper parameters note that in order to calculate the l 2 norm in the phase space of variables having different units say relative vorticity ζ and temperature t as in this study it is necessary that all the variables are represented in the same units or nondimensional as in our case for doing so we calculate the z score for these variables as follows z i x i x i σ x i i ζ t where z i is the new variable x i is the old variable x i is the time mean of x i and σ x i is the standard deviation of x i x i is a vector of all the values of the i th variable the hyper parameters can be set based on the chosen metric and available data getting a bit ahead we report that in our case the neighbourhood consists of n 15 and m 5 points and the nudging strength is η 0 001 the term f x is computed with the central finite difference in time originally the method was supposed to have the same size of the neighbourhood for both the vector field f x and the nudging term i e n m however our experiments showed that using neighbourhoods of different sizes can prevent the so called build up effect which we discuss later we refer the reader to shevchenko and berloff 2021a for a more detailed discussion of the method it is worth noting that the length of the sampling interval that is enough to properly represent the dynamics cannot be defined a priori as it strongly depends on the reference data we recommend to use all available reference data to better approximate the structure of the reference phase space it might seem that a state x t cannot be expressed as a solution of a certain differential equation with the right hand side depending only on x t because x t can depend on many other prognostic and or diagnostic variables as in our case because all primitive equations in mitgcm are coupled however it is not necessarily true as one can reconstruct a dynamical system and we did it in shevchenko and berloff 2022b the solution of which is x t while the right hand side depends only on x t moreover the idea of representing the evolution of a process as a solution of a certain differential equation with the right hand side depending only on this process is at the core of dynamical system reconstruction theory 3 model configuration and numerical results for the purpose of this study we consider the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 in the north atlantic configuration shevchenko and berloff 2021b jamet et al 2019 it is a 46 layer oceanic model coupled with an atmospheric boundary model marshall et al 1997 deremble et al 2013 the coupled model is initially spun up for 5 years and then integrated for another 2 years although for this work it is not essential that the initial state of the ocean circulation is in the statistically equilibrated regime the model is integrated at two different horizontal resolutions 1 12 and 1 3 the oceanic and atmospheric models are implemented with the same horizontal resolution we refer to the solution and or a set of diagnostic variables computed on the 1 12 grid and projected onto the 1 3 grid fig 1a as the reference solution x t in eqs 1 2 and to the solution and or a set of diagnostic variables computed on the 1 3 grid as the modelled solution y t in eq 2 see fig 1c the hyper parameterized solution computed with eq 2 is presented in fig 1b note that the reference solution consists only of the coarse grained variables that are modelled with the hyper parameterization method it is surface relative vorticity and temperature in our case it provides a great flexibility for modelling and significant acceleration of computations it is also worth reiterating again that we only solve eq 2 to model the north atlantic and the underlying primitive equations are not used as it would defeat the purpose of our approach the whole complexity of the flow dynamics enters eq 2 via the right hand side as it follows from the results in fig 1 the hyper parameterized solution computed on the coarse grid fig 1b reproduces both the large scales the gulf stream flow and small scales vortices of the reference solution fig 1a in instantaneous and time averaged fields while the solution computed on the coarse grid without the hyper parameterization fig 1c leads to no gulf stream or small scale flow features we remark that the hyper parameterized solution is a part of a 2 year simulation from which we use only the first year of the reference solution over the second year model 2 runs on its own the hyper parameterized solution with a bad choice of hyper parameters n m η fig 2 still reproduces both large and small scales flow features but only over the period in which the reference solution is available it is one year in our case after that the solution almost stops evolving and eventually settles to a constant in time field like the one in the middle plot of fig 2 it can be seen from the time mean over the second year the right subplot in fig 2 which is very similar to the snapshot taken at year 2 middle subplot in fig 2 thus showing that the solution evolution is stalled over the second year the build up effect and solution degradation the lack of reference data for the hyper parameterized model and or bad choice of hyper parameters can steer the trajectory to leave the reference phase space the phase space occupied by the reference solution note that the phase space of the primitive equations consists of all prognostic variables and its dimension is equal to the number of degrees of freedom while the reference phase space consists of only the variables that are hyper parameterized which are surface relative vorticity and temperature in our case this escape may result in a significant degradation of the hyper parameterized solution and even lead to a numerical blow up we refer to this as the build up effect meaning that after a period of time say t the neighbourhood of the nearest points stalls fig 2 i e the points in the neighbourhood become the closest ones to the image point y t for t t in the present case t 1 year therefore the same points are used again and again during the integration of eq 2 thus driving the image point away from the reference phase space in principle building up numerical errors may terminate this runaway and the solution can return back to the reference phase space region but this is case dependent and should be kept in mind however if the return time is relatively long longer than the characteristic time of the reference solution then the flow dynamics can be seriously distorted over the period of the trajectory injection in order to prevent the build up effect one should properly set up the hyper parameters n m and η by using weak nudging towards a slightly lager set of neighbours after some experiments we have found that n 15 m 5 and η 0 001 lead to no build up effect it is not necessarily the only choice and other sets of hyper parameters providing no build up may exist the optimal hyper parameters for a reference solution x t can be computed by solving the following problem 3 min n m η f x t y t t 0 t where f is a problem specific function and t is the length of the reference solution x t for example f can be defined as a norm of the difference between the reference and hyper parameterized solutions our choice of n m and η is driven by our measure of goodness it is also important to note that the way the neighbourhood u y t in eq 2 is computed affects the hyper parameterized solution one can change the algorithm on how to pickup points from the neighbourhood to tailor the method for a given problem it is also worth noting that these experiments are very fast and computationally cheap even relative to a single run of the coarse grid model the optimal choice of hyper parameters and the neighbourhood size and how they affect the solution is a topic beyond the scope of the present study the measure of goodness and evolution in phase space the measure of goodness i e the proximity of the modelled or parameterized solution to the reference one in a given metric depends on the specific purpose our measure of goodness is how close the hyper parameterized solution is to the reference phase space we use this measure to allow the hyper parameterized solution to evolve in the neighbourhood of the reference phase space since the failure of the coarse grid model blue dots in fig 3 to reproduce large and small scale features of the flow dynamics is because it steers away from where it should be black dots in fig 3 i e the reference phase space measuring the proximity of individual trajectories in phase space is of no value because small initial perturbations will grow exponentially due to the inherently chaotic dynamics the build up effect is demonstrated in fig 3b the short green line near the time mean over the second year red circle is the 1 year evolution of the hyper parameterized solution affected by the bad choice of hyper parameters namely n m 5 and η 0 001 evolution of the euclidean distance from the reference time mean the time mean of the reference solution to the hyper parameterized solution fig 4 shows that the hyper parameterized solution affected by the build up effect green line stops to evolve after one year the period over which the reference solution is available in this case we observe no numerical blow up as the solution quickly settles to a constant in time field when the build up effect is prevented the hyper parameterized solution red line continues to evolve with the reference phase space coupled fields comprehensive ocean models have several prognostic fields velocity temperature etc and a good choice of hyper parameters n m and η for one field is not necessarily applicable to another for example n 15 m 5 and η 0 001 choice works well only for the relative vorticity however it leads to a build up for the coupled fields relative vorticity and temperature not shown thus a set of hyper parameters for a coupled case has to be found separately namely for the coupled fields relative vorticity and temperature we have found that n 18 and m 4 remove the build up effect hence the hyper parameterized solution is of high quality fig 5 the nudging strength in this case remains unchanged from the single relative vorticity case fig 1 η 0 001 this example of the coupled fields demonstrates that one should exercise caution when it comes to setting up the hyper parameters on the other hand it also shows that the hyper parameterization method works for coupled fields even with huge differences between the fields which is 7 orders of magnitude for the relative vorticity and temperature see colorbars in fig 5 the main difficulty here is that the significant difference in the magnitude of these fields can lead to a fast accumulation of the computational error when computing the l 2 norm that eventually contaminates the fields and further results in incorrect computations if the problem comes out it can be fixed by normalizing relative vorticity and temperature but we chose not to do this because the method performed well for our choice of data 4 conclusions and discussion in this work we have applied the hyper parameterization method advection of the image point to the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model in the north atlantic configuration and thus tested the method in a significantly more complicated setting as compared to the earlier idealized model tests our results show that the hyper parameterization method significantly outperforms the non eddy resolving 1 3 grid ocean model for both single and coupled fields even with large difference between the fields it is 7 orders of magnitude in our case by reproducing both the large scale the gulf stream eastward jet extension and small scale vortices flow features of the reference eddy resolving solution on a 1 12 grid and then projected onto the 1 3 grid it is important to note that the hyper parameterization method reproduces both large and small scale flow features not only over the period for which the reference solution is available 1 year in our case but also over the second year for which there is no reference data the ability of the hyper parameterization method to work well beyond the reference data set is explained by the fact that the reference data set is sufficient to capture the structure of the reference phase space in other words the reference data is a representative sample of the flow dynamics if it were not the case the method would not work we deliberately chose to demonstrate that the method works decently even with a short reference solution as a matter of fact the whole method is intrinsically stable and can provide a hyper parameterized solution over any time interval the quality of the hyper parameterized solution still depends on the amount of data fed into the data training that is into increasingly more detailed reconstruction of the phase space the more data is fed in especially in terms of longer time spans the better will be quality of the hyper parameterized solution we have also explained the build up effect and showed that a bad choice of hyper parameters leads to the build up effect and eventually to a significant degradation of the hyper parameterized solution in the worst case scenario the build up can lead to a numerical blow up which we did not observe in our experiments though the build up can be avoided by a proper setup of hyper parameters which we have found through a series of numerical experiments in addition the hyper parameters have to be found separately for hyper parameterizing single and coupled fields as well as for different single fields for instance the hyper parameters that work well for relative vorticity may not be optimal for temperature and vice versa it is important to keep in mind that the proposed method is data driven and therefore can suffer from lack of data as any data driven method the hyper parameterization approach has other methods shevchenko and berloff 2022b a that can be used to reproduce effects of mesoscale oceanic eddies on the large scale ocean circulation but demonstration of their skills on the level of comprehensive models is left for the future in other words staying complimentary to the mainstream physics based parameterization approach we propose to work in phase space of the corresponding dynamical system and to interpret the lack of eddy effects as persistent tendency of phase space trajectories representing the modelled solution to escape the correct reference phase space region the proposed hyper parameterization method is purely data driven hence it cannot accommodate for changing physics this only implies that the method should be used for specific problems for example as representation of the ocean circulation in atmosphere only model runs or in ocean transport process studies it will not be superfluous to also note that the data driven nature of the method arrests its ability to operate in phases space regions that are not presented or sparsely presented in reference data for instance studying decadal variability can require tens of years of reference data to ensure that the reference data set is a representative sample of the studied phenomenon however this weakness is inherent in the data driven paradigm on the other note within the hyper parameterization approach there are other methods shevchenko and berloff 2022a b which are hybrids between pure data driven and physics driven dynamics they can handle physical feedbacks the proposed hyper parameterization method offers many advantages 1 it is computationally very cheap it is much faster than even a single run of the coarse grid ocean model and is easy to implement 2 it enables research situations involving only part component of the ocean circulation subject to hyper parameterization some geographical part e g ocean surface or sub basin some specific field e g temperature or velocity or even some specific observational data satellite images drifters etc if needed the reference data can be always filtered to get rid of its fluctuations and only then be used as the reference phase space 3 it can be straightforwardly used with comprehensive ocean models e g mitgcm nemo etc without modifying the model dynamic core 4 it is well suited for generating ensembles of solutions that can be used to sample the multitude of possible nonlinear chaotic ocean climate states and to separate the response to external forcing from the internal unforced nonlinear variability an ensemble can be generated by changing initial positions in the phase space 5 it can take as input data not only the reference solution but also real measurements from different sources drifters weather stations etc or combination of both in order to use real measurements together with a numerical solution one needs to compute the variables of interest and corresponding directional vectors from the observational data in the modelled region say relative vorticity and temperature in the north atlantic as in this study at the same resolution as the numerical solution and then use both the numerical solution and the variables and the directional vectors computed from observations as new reference data for example if the numerical solution and the observational data consists of n n u m and n o b s records of relative vorticity and temperature respectively then the phase space consists of x i points and corresponding directional vectors f x i i 1 n n u m n o b s we recommend using data assimilation first and then using reanalysis for data driven reconstruction of the attractor as observational data might be inconsistent in time and or in space thus requiring extra interpolation or other procedures to ensure its proper representation at a given resolution however other approaches are likely to

numerical results for the purpose of this study we consider the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 in the north atlantic configuration

for 5 years and then integrated for another 2 years although for this work it is not essential that the initial state of the ocean circulation is in the statistically equilibrated regime the model is integrated at two different horizontal resolutions 1 12 and 1 3 the oceanic and atmospheric models are implemented with the same horizontal resolution we refer to the solution and or a set of diagnostic variables computed on the 1 12 grid and projected onto the 1 3 grid fig 1a as the reference solution x t in eqs 1 2 and to the solution and or a set of diagnostic variables computed on the 1 3 grid as the modelled solution y t in eq 2 see fig 1c the hyper parameterized solution computed with eq 2 is presented in fig 1b note that the reference solution consists only of the coarse grained variables that are modelled with the hyper parameterization method it is surface relative vorticity and temperature in our case it provides a great flexibility for modelling and significant acceleration of computations it is also worth reiterating again that we only solve eq 2 to model the north atlantic and the underlying primitive equations are not used as it would defeat the purpose

closest ones to the image point y t for t t in the present case t 1 year therefore the same points are used again and again during the integration of eq 2 thus driving the image point away from the reference phase space in principle building up numerical errors may terminate this runaway and the solution can return back to the reference phase space region but this is case dependent and should be kept in mind however if the return time is relatively long longer than the characteristic time of the reference solution then the flow dynamics can be seriously distorted over the period of the trajectory injection in order to prevent the build up effect one should properly set up the hyper parameters n m and η by using weak nudging towards a slightly lager set of neighbours after some experiments we have found that n 15 m 5 and η 0 001 lead to no build up effect it is not necessarily the only choice and other sets of hyper parameters providing no build up may exist the optimal hyper parameters for a reference solution x t can be computed by solving the following problem 3 min n m η f x t y t t 0 t where f is a problem specific function and t is the length of the reference solution x t for example f can be defined as a norm of the difference between the reference and hyper parameterized solutions our choice of n m and η is driven by our measure of goodness it is also important to note that the way the neighbourhood u y t in eq 2 is computed affects the hyper parameterized solution one can change the algorithm on how to pickup points from the neighbourhood to tailor the method for a given problem it is also worth noting that these experiments are very fast and computationally cheap even relative to a single run of the coarse grid model the optimal choice of hyper parameters and the neighbourhood size and how they affect the solution is a topic beyond the scope of the present study the measure of goodness and evolution in phase space the measure of goodness i e the proximity of the modelled or parameterized solution to the reference one in a given metric depends on the specific purpose our measure of goodness is how close the hyper parameterized solution is to the reference phase space we use this measure to allow the hyper parameterized solution to evolve in the neighbourhood of the reference phase space since the failure of the coarse grid model blue dots in fig 3 to reproduce large and small scale features of the flow dynamics is because it steers away from where it should be black dots in fig 3 i e the reference phase space measuring the proximity of individual trajectories in phase space is of no value because small initial perturbations will grow exponentially due to the inherently chaotic dynamics the build up effect is demonstrated in fig 3b the short green line near the time mean over the second year red circle is the 1 year evolution of the hyper parameterized solution affected by the bad choice of hyper parameters namely n m 5 and η 0 001 evolution of the euclidean distance from the reference time mean the time mean of the reference solution to the hyper parameterized solution fig 4 shows that the hyper parameterized solution affected by the build up effect green line stops to evolve after one year the period over which the reference solution is available in this case we observe no numerical blow up as the solution quickly settles to a constant in time field when the build up effect is prevented the hyper parameterized solution red line continues to evolve with the reference phase space coupled fields comprehensive ocean models have several prognostic fields velocity temperature etc and a good choice of hyper parameters n m and η for one field is not necessarily applicable to another for example n 15 m 5 and η 0 001 choice works well only for the relative vorticity however it leads to a build up for the coupled fields relative vorticity and temperature not shown thus a set of hyper parameters for a coupled case has to be found separately namely for the coupled fields relative vorticity and temperature we have found that n 18 and m 4 remove the build up effect hence the hyper parameterized solution is of high quality fig 5 the nudging strength in this case remains unchanged from the single relative vorticity case fig 1 η 0 001 this example of the coupled fields demonstrates that one should exercise caution when it comes to setting up the hyper parameters on the other hand it also shows that the hyper parameterization method works for coupled fields even with huge differences between the fields which is 7 orders of magnitude for the relative vorticity and temperature see colorbars in fig 5 the main difficulty here is that the significant difference in the magnitude of these fields can lead to a fast accumulation of the computational error when computing the l 2 norm that eventually contaminates the fields and further results in incorrect computations if the problem comes out it can be fixed by normalizing relative vorticity and temperature but we chose not to do this because the method performed well for our choice of data 4 conclusions and discussion in this work we have applied the hyper parameterization method advection of the image point to the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model in the north atlantic configuration and thus tested the method in a significantly more complicated setting as compared to the earlier idealized model tests our results show that the hyper parameterization method significantly outperforms the non eddy resolving 1 3 grid ocean model for both single and coupled fields even with large difference between the fields it is 7 orders of magnitude in our case by reproducing both the large scale the gulf stream eastward jet extension and small scale vortices flow features of the reference eddy resolving solution on a 1 12 grid and then projected onto the 1 3 grid it is important to note that the hyper parameterization method reproduces both large and small scale flow features not only over the period for which the reference solution is available 1 year in our case but also over the second year for which there is no reference data the ability of the hyper parameterization method to work well beyond the reference data set is explained by the fact that the reference data set is sufficient to capture the structure of the reference phase space in other words the reference data is a representative sample of the flow dynamics if it were not the case the method would not work we deliberately chose to demonstrate that the method works decently even with a short reference solution as a matter of fact the whole method is intrinsically stable and can provide a hyper parameterized solution over any time interval the quality of the hyper parameterized solution still depends on the amount of data fed into the data training that is into increasingly more detailed reconstruction of the phase space the more data is fed in especially in terms of longer time spans the better will be quality of the hyper parameterized solution we have also explained the build up effect and showed that a bad choice of hyper parameters leads to the build up effect and eventually to a significant degradation of the hyper parameterized solution in the worst case scenario the build up can lead to a numerical blow up which we did not observe in our experiments though the build up can be avoided by a proper setup of hyper parameters which we have found through a series of numerical experiments in addition the hyper parameters have to be found separately for hyper parameterizing single and coupled fields as well as for different single fields for instance the hyper parameters that work well for relative vorticity may not be optimal for temperature and vice versa it is important to keep in mind that the proposed method is data driven and therefore can suffer from lack of data as any data driven method the hyper parameterization approach has other methods shevchenko and berloff 2022b a that can be used to reproduce effects of mesoscale oceanic eddies on the large scale ocean circulation but demonstration of their skills on the level of comprehensive models is left for the future in other words staying complimentary to the mainstream physics based parameterization approach we propose to work in phase space of the corresponding dynamical system and to interpret the lack of eddy effects as persistent tendency of phase space trajectories representing the modelled solution to escape the correct reference phase space region the proposed hyper parameterization method is purely data driven hence it cannot accommodate for changing physics this only implies that the method should be used for specific problems for example as representation of the ocean circulation in atmosphere only model runs or in ocean transport process studies it will not be superfluous to also note that the data driven nature of the method arrests its ability to operate in phases space regions that are not presented or sparsely presented in reference data for instance studying decadal variability can require tens of years of reference data to ensure that the reference data set is a representative sample of the studied phenomenon however this weakness is inherent in the data driven paradigm on the other note within the hyper parameterization approach there are other methods shevchenko and berloff 2022a b which are hybrids between pure data driven and physics driven dynamics they can handle physical feedbacks the proposed hyper parameterization method offers many advantages 1 it is computationally very cheap it is much faster than even a single run of the coarse grid ocean model and is easy to implement 2 it enables research situations involving only part component of the ocean circulation subject to hyper parameterization some geographical part e g ocean surface or sub basin some specific field e g temperature or velocity or even some specific observational data satellite images drifters etc if needed the reference data can be always filtered to get rid of its fluctuations and only then be used as the reference phase space 3 it can be straightforwardly used with comprehensive ocean models e g mitgcm nemo etc without modifying the model dynamic core 4 it is well suited for generating ensembles of solutions that can be used to sample the multitude of possible nonlinear chaotic ocean climate states and to separate the response to external forcing from the internal unforced nonlinear variability an ensemble can be generated by changing initial positions in the phase space 5 it can take as input data not only the reference solution but also real measurements from different sources drifters weather stations etc or combination of both in order to use real measurements together with a numerical solution one needs to compute the variables of interest and corresponding directional vectors from the observational data in the modelled region say relative vorticity and temperature in the north atlantic as in this study at the same resolution as the numerical solution and then use both the numerical solution and the variables and the directional vectors computed from observations as new reference data for example if the numerical solution and the observational data consists of n n u m and n o b s records of relative vorticity and temperature respectively then the phase space consists of x i points and corresponding directional vectors f x i i 1 n n u m n o b s we recommend using data assimilation first and then using reanalysis for data driven reconstruction of the attractor as observational data might be inconsistent in time and or in space thus requiring extra interpolation or other procedures to ensure its proper representation at a given resolution however other approaches are likely to exist all this offers a great flexibility not only to ocean modellers working with mathematical models but also to those working with measurements credit authorship contribution statement igor

23756,the regional ocean modeling system roms 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation platform has been extended to include nested grid configurations using both one way and two way nesting strategies the efficacy of this new roms utility is demonstrated in a model comprising three nested grids with horizontal refinement and configured for the mid atlantic bight the three nested grids have a horizontal resolution ranging from 7 km to 0 8 km thereby capturing circulation regimes that span the gulf stream western boundary current through the mesoscale eddy field and down to the rapidly evolving and energetic submesoscale these circulation regimes represent a challenge for any data assimilation system and the nested 4d var system was found to perform well across the range of resolved space and time scales the observational data used to constrain the ocean state estimates come from a wide range of remote sensing in situ and mobile platforms along with the u s national science foundation s ocean observatories initiative pioneer array several aspects of the system performance are explored and described here including the fit of the model to the observations the influence of data assimilation on the wave number spectra at the submesoscale and the downscaling and upscaling of information captured by the observations keywords data assimilation 4d var nested grids mid atlantic bight pioneer array data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal ocean observing systems have evolved rapidly in recent years and in many cases now resolve the upper limits of the submesoscale via routine observations made by ocean gliders and networks of coastal high frequency radars in addition the introduction of satellite wide swath altimetry such as the recently launched surface water and ocean topography swot mission promises to deliver routine unprecedented observations of sea surface height ssh at scales approaching the submesoscale thus ocean data assimilation strategies that can capitalize fully on the information content of these data at all resolved scales are a priority given the computational demands of running ocean models that resolve the submesoscale nested grid approaches are perhaps the most promising approach since they can target areas where observing systems have the highest resolution data assimilation in nested models is not new and has been a mainstay of numerical weather prediction nwp for several decades for example one of the earliest attempts is that of stauffer and seaman 1994 who used a nested model of the colorado plateau and grand canyon to assimilate atmospheric observations capable of resolving the meso β scale i e 20 200 km scales the approach they used was a simple multi scale nudging technique since then progress has been rapid in support of the needs of nwp particularly with high impact weather events such as thunderstorms and tornadoes the so called meso γ scales 2 20 km a variety of data assimilation approaches are also now used in nested nwp models including ensemble kalman filters e g oigawa et al 2018 and variational approaches both 3 dimensional 3d var e g xiao et al 2005 and 4 dimensional 4d var e g huva et al 2020 various approaches to data assimilation in nested models have also been employed in the ocean for example vandenbulcke et al 2006 and barth et al 2007 have used different flavors of kalman filters in triply nested configurations of a primitive equation model of the mediterranean sea targeting the gulf of lion and the ligurian sea respectively in addition logutov 2008 used a variational data assimilation approach to optimize the tidal constituents in a model of the philippines archipelago while simon et al 2011 explored 4d var approaches in an idealized configuration of a shallow water model simulating a wind driven double gyre circulation this paper describes and documents an extension of the regional ocean modeling system roms 4d var data assimilation system to nested grid configurations since roms is a popular and widely used community ocean model this paper also serves as a helpful reference for future users of the nested 4d var interface and documents the first application of nested 4d var in roms the specific focus of this study is the mid atlantic bight mab in the northwest atlantic and both one way and two way nested configurations are considered here a triply nested design of grids is considered in which the highest resolution grid targets the national science foundation nsf ocean observatories initiative ooi pioneer array located at the mab shelf break some 140 km south of martha s vineyard the pioneer array and the highest resolution model grid both resolve the ocean submesoscale circulations at this site so this study represents an opportunity to explore the extent to which observations from the broader scale observing network can be downscaled to inform the submesoscale in the vicinity of the array as well as the degree to which information at the submesoscale captured by the array can be upscaled to constrain the mesoscale and quasi geostrophic circulation of the neighboring western boundary current region and shelf circulation a description of the roms configuration employed in this study is given in section 2 followed by a detailed account of the 4d var data assimilation approach used in section 3 specifically we describe in section 3 1 the 4d var formulation in relation to the augmented state vector comprising the state variables from all of the nested grids this is followed in section 3 2 and section 3 3 by a description of the observations and error covariances respectively next the performance of the nested 4d var system is quantitatively explored in section 4 using a variety of system output indicators finally a summary and some conclusions follow in section 5 2 roms configuration the roms configuration used here comprises three telescoping nested grids with refinement in horizontal resolution as illustrated in fig 1 the outer most grid referred to as g1 has a horizontal resolution of 7 km and spans the mab the grid g2 has a horizontal resolution of 2 3 km while the inner most grid g3 has a horizontal resolution of 0 8 km all three grids have 40 σ levels in the vertical the circulation in the mab spans a range of horizontal scales encompassing the broad gulf stream western boundary current an energetic field of mesoscale eddies and a wide range of submesoscale circulation features an example of the sea surface temperature sst across these different scales is shown in fig 2 from the nested roms configuration the placement of the three nested grids was motivated by the location of the nsf ooi pioneer array which is well resolved by g3 as illustrated in figs 2c and 2f the model can be run with either one way or two way communications between the nested model grids roms nesting algorithms are flexible allowing various configuration topologies with refinement or composite warner et al 2010 grids each grid exchanges information in the computational contact region that extends the mesh that overlays or is adjacent to a nested grid as illustrated in fig 1 inset between the telescoping g2 and g3 grids the c staggered contact points in halo region ca3 facilitate the evaluation of roms kernel horizontal operators advection diffusion viscosity pressure gradient and fluxes at the finer g3 physical boundary instead of applying lateral boundary conditions the state variable values in ca3 are interpolated from the coarser donor g2 thus the evaluation of the horizontal operators is seamless by manipulating the i and j ranges in the kernel do loops it is similar to the parallel distributed memory halo exchanges or periodicity boundary treatment in the case of one way nesting information in the nonlinear model passes only from a low resolution grid to a high resolution grid across grid open boundaries so in this case from g1 to g2 and from g2 to g3 as indicated in fig 1 therefore each grid produces a different circulation within the regions where the grids overlap although often the circulations in the overlapping areas may be qualitatively similar conversely in the case of two way nesting information passes both ways across the grid open boundaries as illustrated in fig 1 in addition the solutions within the overlapping grid regions are updated by averaging the fields on the high resolution grid to the next lower resolution grid thus in the case considered here the fields from g3 are averaged and replace the solution in g2 within the overlapping region similarly the averaged fields from g2 replace those of g1 within the region overlapped by these two grids the g1 open boundaries were constrained using data from the mercator oc é an global analyses lellouche et al 2018 after application of a seasonal bias correction using the regional climatology of fleming 2016 additional corrections for bias were made to the g1 open boundary mean dynamic topography and seasonal cycle of sea surface height ssh and velocity using a regional data assimilative climatological analysis as described by wilkin et al 2022 surface forcing for all three grids was derived from surface fluxes of momentum heat and freshwater using 3 hourly national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american mesoscale nam rogers et al 2009 fields and the coare3 0 bulk formulae of fairall et al 2003 application of the nam atmospheric pressure drives an oceanic dynamic inverted barometer response daily freshwater discharge from rivers was imposed in each grid as appropriate based on gauge observations from the u s geological survey and water survey of canada lopez et al 2020 wilkin et al 2018 the sub tidal mesoscale variability captured by mercator océan is retained harmonic tidal forcing from the tpxo global harmonic tidal analysis egbert and erofeeva 2002 was added to the boundary ssh and depth averaged velocity data in a domain this small the astronomical tide generating forces are negligible as discussed in section 3 2 the period considered here is 26 april 3 august 2015 the roms configuration used in g1 forms the basis of the analysis forecast system of wilkin et al 2018 and the reanalysis of wilkin et al 2022 however the present study extends these previous efforts by considering a suite of refined nested grids g2 and g3 that resolve important processes of the shelf break dynamics targeted by the nsf ooi pioneer array furthermore the work presented here represents the first application of the roms nested 4d var data assimilation system and demonstrates how the circulation at all resolved scales can be informed by observations assimilated on each of the refined grids 3 the 4d var approach 3 1 one way versus two way nesting before describing the roms nested 4d var system it is necessary first to establish some notation given that several one way or two way nested grids are involved following the notation of ide et al 1997 we will define the roms state vector as x t which comprises all ocean grid point values of temperature salinity free surface height and the two components of horizontal velocity at time t the state vectors corresponding to the grids g1 g2 and g3 will then be denoted by x 1 t x 2 t and x 3 t respectively finally the augmented state vector formed by concatenating x 1 t x 2 t and x 3 t will be designated as x t x 1 t t x 2 t t x 3 t t t the roms nested 4d var approach is based on the dual formulation described by gürol et al 2014 in which observations spanning the interval t t 1 t 2 referred to as the assimilation window are assimilated into the model therefore in the usual way we can express the desired 4d var analysis x a t 1 at the beginning of the assimilation window as 1 x a t 1 x b t 1 b h t hb h t r 1 d where x b t 1 is the background state vector d y h x b is the innovation vector based on the difference between the vector of all observations of any type that span t 1 t 2 denoted y and the background sampled at the observation locations and times according to the observation operator h x b t b and r are the background error covariance and observation error covariance matrices respectively h is the tangent linearization of h and h t denotes the adjoint of h in 4d var h represents the nonlinear roms integrated over the interval t 1 t 2 and sampled at the observations while h and h t represent the corresponding integrations of the tangent linear model and adjoint for roms respectively consecutive assimilation windows through time are referred to as assimilation cycles since the dimension of the state vector x is very large o 1 0 7 in the application considered here it is not possible to represent the background error covariance b matrix in 1 explicitly instead b is factorized as k b σ c σ t k b t where c is a univariate covariance matrix that is modeled in roms following the diffusion operator approach of weaver and courtier 2001 see moore et al 2011 for technical details σ represents a diagonal matrix of background standard deviations that is estimated from a long integration of the nonlinear roms and k b is a multivariate balance operator that accounts for cross covariances between the background errors in different fields see for example weaver et al 2005 the observation vector y comprises observations of all types for technical reasons in the current roms 4d var system the observation errors are treated as uncorrelated in which case the observation error covariance r is represented as a diagonal matrix with the dimension of y the total number of observations within the assimilation window spanning t 1 t 2 see fig 4 in 4d var x a t 1 is identified by minimizing a non linear cost function of the form 2 j n l x t 1 x b t 1 t b 1 x t 1 x b t 1 y h x t t r 1 y h x t direct minimization of the non linear cost function given by 2 is generally very challenging and a truncated gauss newton iterative approach is typically used in practice lawless et al 2005 by employing the incremental approach to 4d var introduced by courtier et al 1994 specifically the problem is linearized about the background x b t and a linear cost function j of the form 3 j δ x t b 1 δ x h δ x d t r 1 h δ x d is minimized where δ x x t 1 x b t 1 is the increment at the beginning of the assimilation window the linear cost function j in 3 is minimized iteratively where each iteration is referred to as an inner loop and each sequence of inner loop iterations is referred to as an outer loop during the first outer loop the tangent linear and adjoint observation operators h and h t are linearized about x b t after the δ x that minimizes 3 has been identified the state vector is updated according to x 1 t 1 x b t 1 δ x if a second outer loop is performed as in the experiments described below a second sequence of inner loop iterations is performed during which h and h t are linearized about the updated state vector x 1 t subsequent outer loops n would be updated similarly according to x n t 1 x n 1 t 1 δ x the combination of inner and outer loop iterations yields the minimum of the non linear cost function 2 the dimension of the state vector x employed in the cost functions 1 and 2 depends upon whether one way or two way nesting is used in the case of one way nesting x comprises all elements of x 1 x 2 and x 3 regardless of their geographical location as described above information flows in only one direction across the grid open boundaries in the nl model therefore there will be multiple estimates of the circulation in the overlapping regions for the grids in other words with reference to fig 1 there will be a single state estimate in the rectangular annulus region labeled ra1 according to the elements of x 1 while in the rectangular annulus ra2 there will be state estimates based on x 1 and x 2 likewise in the region spanned by g3 there will be state estimates for x 1 x 2 and x 3 in the same way in the case of one way nesting observations are assimilated on all three grids in all regions regardless of their geographical location therefore an observation within the area ra2 will be assimilated into g1 and g2 while an observation within the regions spanned by g3 will be assimilated into g1 g2 and g3 thus information from some observations will be utilized in the data assimilation more than once obviously observations within the region ra1 are assimilated into g1 only in the case of two way nesting the state vector fields within the overlapping regions depend on the averaged values from the higher resolution grid therefore in two way nesting x comprises the subset of elements of x 1 that fall within ra1 the subset of elements of x 2 that fall within ra2 and all the elements of x 3 with this strategy each observation is utilized only once within the 4d var system reducing the amount of redundant information from the observations the two different approaches to 4d var in one way and two way nested configurations can perhaps be better appreciated by considering the flow of information between the three grids during the inner loop iterations each inner loop involves sequential integrations of the tangent linear and adjoint models to evaluate the matrix operator hb h t in 1 in the tangent linear model information is exchanged between the grid open boundaries in much the same way as in the nonlinear model in the case of both one way and two way nesting as illustrated in fig 1 however the adjoint model involves an integration backwards in time thus information flows across the grid open boundaries in a different direction in the case of two way nesting information flows in both directions at the grid open boundaries during the evaluation of the adjoint operator h t just as in the tangent linear and nonlinear models however in the case of one way nesting information is exchanged in only one direction by h t at the grid open boundaries from the high resolution grid to the low resolution grid as illustrated in fig 1 the influence of the flow of information in the adjoint model in the one way and two way nesting cases is demonstrated in fig 3 which shows the results of an adjoint sensitivity calculation for both cases in these experiments a forcing was applied in the adjoint model to the g3 velocity field normal to the section of the 200 m isobath identified in figs 3c and 3f the forcing takes the form of an impulse applied every hour and the nested adjoint model is integrated backwards in time for 3 days the adjoint forcing was appropriately scaled to yield the sensitivity of the 3 day average transport crossing the target 200 m isobath section this particular example was chosen because it directly relates to the experiments presented in section 4 2 fig 3 shows the adjoint sst field at the end of the 3 day adjoint integration 22 july 2015 and represents the sensitivity of the cross isobath transport to changes in sst in sv k 1 results from a one way and a two way nested adjoint integration are shown recalling that it is only the adjoint of g3 that is being forced then in the one way case figs 3a c the influence of information propagating out of g3 into g2 and then into g1 is very evident for example data from g3 is passed to g2 at the g3 open boundary at which time it can propagate in all directions unconstrained within g2 including the overlapping grid regions similarly information passes from g2 to g1 through the g2 open boundary and can then propagate in all directions unconstrained in g1 including the overlapping grid regions during one way nested 4d var the propagation of information in the adjoint model from a high resolution grid to a low resolution grid informs the data assimilation algorithm how the initial conditions for the entire lower resolution grid need to be adjusted in order to yield a better fit of the higher resolution grid solution to the observations in the case of two way nesting information flows from g3 to g2 at the g3 open boundary but can only influence the g2 solution in the rectangular annulus ra2 likewise information passing from g2 through the open boundary to g1 can only affect the solution in the rectangular annulus ra1 the transfer of information in the opposite direction i e from g1 to g2 and g2 to g1 is constrained by the adjoint of the averaging procedure employed in two way nesting therefore during two way nested 4d var the adjoint model informs the data assimilation algorithm how the initial conditions for the lower resolution grids in the rectangular annulus regions need to be adjusted in order to yield a better fit of the higher resolution grid solution to the observations 3 2 observations the observations assimilated span the interval 26 april 3 august 2015 a period that represents relatively good data coverage from the pioneer array see levin et al 2021b the observation data streams and preprocessing are identical to those used in previous configurations of g1 g2 and g3 by levin et al 2020 2021a 2021b hereafter l20 l21a and l21b respectively and are summarized in table 1 from l20 for all observation types super observations were formed when appropriate to avoid the assimilation of multiple observations of the same state variable into a single grid cell at the same time step this procedure improves the conditioning of the matrix inverse in 1 see daley 1991 the super observation procedure is grid resolution dependent generally less super obing is required at higher resolution as discussed in section 3 1 redundant information from the observations is present due to the repeat assimilation of data within the regions overlapped by g1 g2 and g3 in the case of one way nesting however because the super observation procedure depends on the grid resolution information from platforms in the overlapping grid regions will be processed and assimilated somewhat differently in the case of two way nesting each observation and super observation is assimilated only once based on which grid it falls in the period 26 april 3 august 2015 was subdivided into 3 day intervals and all observations falling within each window 33 windows in total were assimilated using 4d var fig 4a shows the time series of the total number of observations after super obing or thinning assimilated into the model during each 3 day 4d var cycle in the one way and two way nested experiments the number of observations assimilated in the one way cases is greater than in the two way cases which reflects the assimilation of some observational information up to three times in the former case the number of observations assimilated into each of the three grids in both cases is indicated in fig 4b in the case of g3 the number of data assimilated during the one way and two way experiments is identical for each cycle 3 3 error covariances as noted earlier l20 l21a and l21b have performed 4d var on the same three grids using a quasi one way nested approach where data were first assimilated independently into g1 for multiple years data were then assimilated independently into g2 constrained at the open boundaries by the g1 4d var estimates finally data were assimilated independently into g3 using the g2 4d var estimates to constrain the open boundaries to compare the performance of the new one way and two way nested 4d var approaches that are advocated here we have therefore used the same background and observation error covariance matrix formulations as those adopted by l20 l21a and l21b this will allow us to more directly compare the results presented here with those of the previous studies for the same overlapping period as noted in section 3 1 the background error covariance b matrix in roms is modeled following the diffusion operator approach of weaver and courtier 2001 see moore et al 2011 for technical details the decorrelation length scales assumed in b for errors in each control variable on the three model grids are summarized in table 2 these parameter choices are discussed in l20 and l21a the b matrix comprises blocks corresponding to each grid but no attempt was made to account for the covariance in the background errors between grids the observation error covariance matrix r in 1 was assumed to be a diagonal matrix table 1 summarizes the errors and uncertainties assigned to measurements from each of the different observing platforms these errors reflect the combined influence of measurement errors and representativeness errors and are also discussed in l20 l21a and l21b observation quality control was performed during each 4d var cycle following the approach developed in nwp by anderson and järvinen 1999 specifically the innovation d i associated with each observation is compared to the standard error computed from the background error σ b 2 and observation error σ o 2 variances for a chosen threshold α an observation is rejected from the analysis if d i 2 α 2 σ b 2 σ o 2 the thresholds α depend on the type of observation and are given in table 2 for the analyses on each grid 4 nested circulation estimates before examining the 4d var circulation estimates it is helpful to first compare the free run example solutions from the one way and two way nested cases shown in fig 2 for 25 july 2015 with corresponding 4d var estimates the free run solutions were started from the same initial conditions on 26 april 2015 which are taken from a longer two way nested simulation spanning the period 1 april 2014 to 26 april 2015 not too surprisingly the free run g1 solutions from the one way and two way nesting cases cf figs 2a and 2d are very similar on the other hand the details of the free run sst in g2 are quite different between the two nesting approaches cf figs 2b and 2e even though the mesoscale is conditioned on a similar larger scale circulation in the form of a gulf stream meander entering the southwest corner of g2 likewise the submesoscale features in free run g3 which are conditioned on the mesoscale circulations of g2 are also quite different cf figs 2c and 2f although they are equally energetic as illustrated in section 4 1 2 following l20 l21a and l21b two outer loops and seven inner loops were employed during each 3 day 4d var cycle the 4d var control vector comprises only the model initial conditions in the experiments presented here and the analysis x a t 2 at the end of each 4d var cycle becomes the background x b t 1 at the beginning of the next cycle cf eq 1 fig 5 compares the sst on 25 july 2015 at the end of the second outer loop for the one way and two way nested approaches for the 4d var cycle spanning the period 22 25 july the 4d var sst estimates of fig 5 differ significantly from the free run case since satellite sst observations are one of the dominant data streams see section 3 2 however the one way and two way nested 4d var estimates are generally more similar to each other than the corresponding free run solutions for example the root mean square rms difference between the sst of the one way and two way free run solutions is 0 8 c for g1 1 1 c for g2 and 1 4 c for g3 while for the 4d var sst estimates the rms differences are 0 9 c on all three grids in the following subsections the performance of the 4d var system in one way and two way nested configurations of the model is quantified section 4 1 will focus on the performance in terms of cost function reduction in addition we also examine how data assimilation across the multiple resolved scales influences the wave number spectra of the circulation the issue of discontinuous field estimates across the grid boundaries is also addressed finally section 4 2 explores the exchange of information from the observations between each grid 4 1 4d var performance 4 1 1 cost function as an initial 4d var performance indicator we consider first the behavior of the cost function specifically we evaluate the contribution of the observations to the non linear cost function 2 namely j o y h x t r 1 y h x this is straightforward to evaluate during each 4d var cycle for both the background x b and the analysis x a at the end of each outer loop since the magnitude of j o depends on the number of observations it is helpful to normalize j o by its value in the absence of data assimilation thus if x f denotes the state vector of the free run without data assimilation then we let j f y h x f t r 1 y h x f fig 6 shows time series of the cost function ratio j o j f for each 4d var cycle for the one way fig 6a and two way fig 6e cases each time series shows the cost function ratio for the background and the analysis at the end of each outer loop at the beginning of the first 4d var cycle the background is the same as the free running model so in both the one way and two way cases j o j f 1 however figs 6a and 6e show that generally j o j f 1 for the background indicating the background is closer to the observations than the free running model there are a few exceptions such as in the 1 way nesting case fig 6a during the middle of june when j o j f 1 for three consecutive cycles and a few cycles on various dates in the two way nesting case fig 6e when j o j f 1 in general however figs 6a and 6e indicate that the model background retains information from the observations from one cycle to the next as anticipated figs 6a and 6e reveal that data assimilation significantly reduces the cost function ratio j o j f with the largest reduction generally occurring during the 1st outer loop a 2nd outer loop is clearly beneficial although the subsequent decrease in j o j f is much less this is true in the case of both one way and two way nesting time series of the contribution to j o of observations from each grid are shown in figs 6b c d for the one way nesting case and fig 6f g h for the two way nesting case for reference the contribution of each grid to the free run cost function j f is also shown in general the background solution for g1 is generally always closer to the observations than the free run in the case of one way nesting fig 6c as noted above j o j f 1 during mid june in fig 6a and figs 6c and 6d indicate that this is associated with the state vector on g2 and g3 as there are times when j o j f for the background on both grids thus the ability of the model to retain information from one assimilation to the next is resolution dependent in the case of two way nesting figs 6f g h suggest a similar behavior although j o j f for all three grids during most cycles the exception is on g3 fig 6h where j o is slightly larger than j f during much of june 4 1 2 wave number spectra one appealing aspect of data assimilation in nested grids is that it offers a way of potentially constraining the mesoscale to submesoscale circulation features in a dynamically consistent way using observations in particular the circulation at the submesoscale has attracted considerable attention and a growing body of literature demonstrates the rich nature of the circulation at these scales for example mcwilliams 2016 provides an excellent review of the submesoscale environment and associated dynamical regimes the submesoscale is thought to provide a direct route for the turbulent dissipation of energy from the mesoscale to smaller scales therefore one aspect of the submesoscale circulation that has received considerable attention is the shape of the energy and variance spectra since under certain assumptions they provide clues about the direction of the energy and variance cascades in wave number space it is of interest here then to examine the characteristics of spectra in the free running model particularly in the submesoscale resolving grid g3 and the extent to which they are modified by data assimilation a central tenet for theoretical interpretations of wave number spectra is the existence of an inertial range over which the inertial accelerations or nonlinear advection terms in the governing equations control the cascade of the variance between scales see vallis 2006 chapter 8 by invoking assumptions of isotropy homogeneity and conservation the expected slope of the wave number spectra of different properties can be predicted a priori some well known canonical regimes thought to be relevant to the ocean are 2 dimensional quasi geostrophic 2dqg turbulence and surface quasi geostrophic sqg turbulence in the case of 2dqg turbulence the kinetic energy ke spectrum is expected to follow a k 3 spectrum in the inertial range where k k 2 l 2 1 2 is the total horizontal wave number in this case energy and relative enstrophy conservation lead to an inverse cascade of ke i e toward larger scales accompanied by a forward cascade in relative enstrophy batchelor 1953 conversely in the case of sqg turbulence the ke spectrum is actually controlled by the buoyancy variance both are predicted to follow a k 5 3 spectrum and the ke and buoyancy variance ratio remains constant at all wave numbers within the inertial range characterized by an inverse energy cascade and a forward cascade of buoyancy variance capet et al 2008a within the submesoscale range however the notion of an inertial range is generally less well defined as discussed by mcwilliams 2016 and a spectrum following k 2 for kinetic energy and buoyancy variance may be more relevant in the surface boundary layer accompanied by forward cascades in both in settings more reminiscent of the real ocean the spectral slope of the variance of different properties can deviate from that expected from the canonical cases and is influenced by the presence of surface forcing dissipation and the β effect via rotation and the presence of bathymetry therefore the relevance of the aforementioned canonical cases to the circulation considered here is by no means clear e g see lapeyre 2017 for a thorough review in the context of sqg nevertheless the canonical cases provide useful reference points and we consider the extent to which they may apply in the nested roms configurations used here however before examining the details of the variance spectra it is useful to first appreciate the nature of the surface fields themselves to gain an intuitive sense of the horizontal length scales that are present to this end fig 7 shows examples of the g3 surface stream flow surface relative vorticity normalized by the coriolis parameter i e the local rossby number and the surface density anomaly δ ρ ρ ρ 0 where ρ 0 1025 kg m 3 each field is shown at the end of the two way 4d var cycle spanning the interval 22 25 july as figs 5d e f show at this time there is a gulf stream meander entering the southwest portion of the g3 domain and this is the most coherent feature of the circulation in fig 7 elsewhere in g3 the surface velocity relative vorticity and density anomaly are characterized by a mixture of mesoscale and submesoscale features in the form of eddies fronts and filaments for many of these features fig 7b demonstrates that ζ f 1 indicating that nonlinearity will be locally important these regions delineate the inertial range which controls the cascades of variance in the form of ke relative enstrophy and buoyancy fig 8 shows the wave number spectra for velocity variance i e ke relative vorticity variance i e relative enstrophy q and variance of the density anomaly δ ρ i e buoyancy variance or available potential energy at the surface for g3 for the one way and two way nesting cases in all cases the wave number spectra were computed from an ensemble of 2400 realizations i e hourly snap shot fields spanning the april august period the spectra are based on a 2 dimensional discrete cosine transform dct of the full 2 dimensional field e g ahmed et al 1974 denis et al 2002 fig 8 shows wave number spectra for each property for the free running model and for the 4d var estimates in all cases the variance of the 4d var estimates is higher than in the free run at all wave numbers the same was found for g1 and g2 also not shown thus data assimilation increases the variance of the circulation which corresponds to an increase in surface ke relative enstrophy and buoyancy variance in fig 8 closer inspection of figs 8a and 8b reveals that for horizontal scales greater than the g3 resolution i e k 2 π 0 6 km 1 the slope of the ke spectrum is approximately piecewise linear with a change in slope near k 2 π 0 1 km 1 corresponding to a horizontal scale of 10 km since the relative enstrophy and buoyancy spectra exhibit less of a linear relationship between the spectral slope and k we will confine the discussion here to the ke spectra the slope of the spectrum above and below k 2 π 0 1 km 1 was estimated using a least squares method in the case of one way nesting for k 2 π 0 1 km 1 the ke spectrum varies approximately as k 2 7 in the case of the free run while in the case of 4d var it varies as k 2 1 at shorter scales 0 1 k 2 π 0 5 km 1 the free run ke spectrum varies as k 3 5 while in the case of 4d var it varies as k 3 on the other hand in the case of two way nesting the ke varies as k 2 8 in the free run and as k 2 4 for the 4d var estimates for k 2 π 0 1 km 1 while for 0 1 k 2 π 0 5 km 1 the ke spectra vary according to k 4 3 for the free run and k 3 6 for the 4d var estimates thus in all cases the slope of the ke spectrum is smaller in the case of the 4d var estimates for both the one way and two ways nesting cases this indicates that a greater fraction of the ke resides at scales less than 10 km in the 4d var estimates compared to the free run two of these cases have spectral slopes consistent with the 2dqg canonical case one way nesting 4d var and the two way nesting free run however in both of these cases the ke spectrum is generally characterized by a forward cascade rather than the inverse cascade expected for 2dqg turbulence as demonstrated next specifically if the ke is defined as 1 2 u 2 v 2 then the horizontal spectral transfer function for ke due to the inertial accelerations in the horizontal momentum equations is given by the discrete analog of 4 π k e k k k m a x u ˆ u u x v u y v ˆ u v x v v y d k where u ˆ and v ˆ represent the dct of the surface horizontal velocity components and u u x v u y etc represent the dct of the corresponding inertial accelerations at the surface see capet et al 2008b 1 1 the contribution of vertical advection of momentum was not included since w was not archived during the 4d var analyses however a calculation of π k e for the free run that includes the influence of the vertical inertial accelerations indicates that their contribution is very small compared to the horizontal inertial terms and the same is likely to be the case for the 4d var estimates also the range of the horizontal wave number considered is k k m i n k m a x where k m i n and k m a x represent the wave numbers associated with the largest and smallest resolved horizontal scales respectively the spectral transfer function π k e k given by 4 represents the time rate of change of the domain integrated surface ke due to the horizontal inertial accelerations for all wavenumbers in the range k to k m a x the time rate of change of the total domain integrated ke within the surface layer is given by π k e k m i n in the case of closed lateral boundaries the horizontal energy fluxes will vanish at the boundaries and π k e k m i n will be associated with the vertical energy flux divergence since vertical energy fluxes will generally be very small compared to the horizontal fluxes then to a good approximation we expect π k e k m i n π k e k m a x 0 in a closed domain therefore in a closed domain the sign of π k e k indicates whether there is a forward i e π k e k 0 or inverse i e π k e k 0 energy cascade in the presence of open boundaries however there will in general be fluxes of ke across the boundaries therefore while the condition π k e k m a x 0 still applies in this situation π k e k m i n 0 which complicates the interpretation of the spectral transfer functions i e there are no conservation properties for g3 specifically if π k e k is single signed the direction of the energy cascade cannot be determined unambiguously since ke may be fluxing into or out of the domain across a range of scales when π k e k m i n 0 on the other hand if π k e k changes sign somewhere within the range k k m i n k m a x the condition π k e k m a x 0 provides an indication of the range of wavenumbers over which the cascade of ke is able to overcome the direction in which ke is fluxing through the boundaries with this in mind estimates of π k e versus k for g3 in the case of one way and two way nesting are shown in fig 8g and fig 8h respectively for both the free run and 4d var solutions 2 2 the net surface flux of ke at the open boundaries due to the inertial accelerations is given by π k e k m i n while there is considerable variation in π k e k m i n through time there is most often a net flux of ke out of the g3 domain at the boundaries not shown however during the free run there are some short periods characterized by large fluxes of ke into g3 and these tend to dominate the ensemble estimate of π k e k m i n therefore for ease of presentation the boundary fluxes π k e k m i n are not shown in figs 8g and 8h figs 8g and 8h both indicate that π k e k changes sign at k 2 π 3 5 1 0 2 km 1 i e a horizontal scale 29 km and π k e k 0 for k 2 π 3 5 1 0 2 km 1 with a peak value close to the break point in the spectral slope discussed above i e near k 2 π 0 1 km 1 since we expect π k e k m a x 0 ke must be accumulating in the near surface circulation at scales shorter than 29 km due to nonlinearity in other words there is a forward cascade of ke in part of wavenumber range in both the free run and the 4d var estimates which is the opposite of what is expected for 2dqg turbulence conversely for k 2 π 3 5 1 0 2 km 1 the spectral transfer function π k e k is generally negative however since in general π k e k m i n 0 due to non zero fluxes of ke at the g3 open boundaries we cannot unambiguously attribute the condition π k e k 0 to an inverse cascade since π k e k here may simply be a consequence of ke fluxing out of the domain over a range of wavenumbers the larger amplitude of π k e k for the 4d var estimates compared to the free run note the rescaling used in figs 8g and 8h for the latter is consistent with the difference in amplitude of the wave number spectra in figs 8a and 8d as noted above the ratio of ke and buoyancy variance can also provide clues about the possible dynamical regime fig 8i shows the ke to buoyancy variance ratio versus k in the case of two way nesting the one way nesting is similar in both cases the ratio is relatively constant over much of the spectrum until k 2 π 0 1 km 1 which corresponds to the peak of the spectral transfer function in fig 8h the region of constant ratio is reminiscent of sqg where an inverse ke energy cascade would be expected at odds with figs 8g and 8h furthermore the expected ke spectral slope for sqg is proportional to k 5 3 which is inconsistent with fig 8h while the spectral analyses of fig 8 indicate that the surface circulation in g3 is not described by one of the canonical cases discussed earlier we should probably not place too much importance on this given that the g3 circulations are strongly forced subject to non conservative open boundary fluxes of variance and are far from being isotropic and homogeneous cf fig 7 as the assumptions underlying the aforementioned canonical spectral slopes demand here we note only that the variance in the nested circulation is enhanced at all scales by data assimilation and that the direction of the ke cascade within the inertial range at the submesoscale in g3 is not affected by the data assimilation procedure our findings are somewhat at odds with the arguments set forth by sandery and sakov 2017 hereafter s17 who reasoned that data assimilation at submesoscales could lead to a deterioration of the circulation estimates at the larger mesoscales in their study s17 explored data assimilation in models of the east australia current a subtropical western boundary current with horizontal resolutions of 10 km and 2 5 km where they argued that an inverse energy cascade from the smallest resolved scales would lead to a deterioration of the circulation at larger scales in s17 however the inverse energy cascade is argued based on a presupposed assumption about the possible canonical turbulent regime present however as shown above the circulation may not necessarily behave in a canonical way in addition the highest horizontal resolution of 2 5 km considered by s17 would be expected to only marginally resolve the largest submesoscale features if at all given that the effective resolution of such a model would more likely be 10 km i e approximately four times the grid resolution see haltiner and williams 1980 in the experiments presented in our study the horizontal resolution of g3 is 0 8 km significantly higher than that considered by s17 as noted above we find that the submesoscale circulation of g3 is generally characterized by a forward cascade of ke at the surface for scales shorter than 29 km indicating that errors in the near surface circulation estimates below this scale would move to smaller scales not larger scales indeed as argued by mcwilliams 2016 one would ultimately expect a forward cascade of energy via secondary instabilities and fronts to ever smaller scales where dissipation must eventually occur nonetheless figs 8g and 8h do perhaps hint at a possible inverse cascade of ke for scales larger than 29 km which is consistent with the arguments set forth by s17 although as discussed above the non conservative property of the g3 open boundary domain does not allow us to unambiguously identify π k e k 0 with an inverse cascade the elevated levels of variance evident in fig 8 only persist while data assimilation is in place if data assimilation is terminated the variance returns to the same level as the free run this is demonstrated in fig 9 which shows log10 of the ratio of the g3 surface ke spectra of the two way nested 4d var analyses and free run versus wave number for each analysis cycle for the case where data assimilation is performed every cycle fig 9a and where data assimilation is terminated on 13 june fig 9b within the scale range characterized by the forward energy cascade of fig 8h the kinetic energy returns to the level of the free run i e log 10 of the ke ratio 0 after 15 days 4 1 3 open boundary discontinuities in two way nested 4d var the one potentially significant detrimental issue that can develop during two way nested 4d var is discontinuities at the grid open boundaries in the analysis increments the most egregious example identified during the total period considered here is illustrated in fig 10 for the two way nested 4d var cycle spanning the interval 16 19 june 2015 discontinuities if present develop in the increment fields at the beginning of the 4d var analysis window this is illustrated in fig 10a which shows a close up view of the g1 sst analysis near the g2 boundary for 16 june although discontinuities in other state vector fields are also present at the same time not shown a significant discontinuity in sst is evident near a where the circulation from g1 enters g2 however the discontinuities quickly dissipate and by the end of the assimilation cycle on 19 june the sst and other state vector fields are smooth as shown in fig 10b and there is no evidence of discontinuities at the g2 boundaries this aspect of 4d var in two way nested models has been discussed by simon et al 2011 they propose a solution to the problem by adding a smoothness constraint to the cost function 3 similar to the conventional approach commonly used in optimal control problems e g bertsekas 1982 while such techniques warrant further investigation in the roms 4d var system we do not view the discontinuous nature of the state vector fields at the beginning of the analysis cycle as a significant impediment recall that 4d var acts in much the same way as a smoother by assimilating observations over some past time window up to the current time therefore it is the state vector at the end of the 4d var window that is the most relevant in many applications since this represents the best estimate of the ocean state at the current time for example the state estimate at this time would be used as the initial condition for an ocean forecast thus the smoothness of the state vector fields that is naturally re established by the end of the assimilation window by dynamic adjustment during the 4d var cycle can be considered an inherent form of dynamical smoothing constraint while the example of fig 10 focuses on discontinuities that develop at the g1 g2 boundary similar issues can develop at the g2 g3 boundary although we found these discontinuities to be typically less obvious and less frequent wavenumber spectra computed at the end of each 4d var cycle following the action of the inherent dynamical smoothing in g3 are indistinguishable from those in fig 8 not shown indicating that the presence of initial time discontinuities does not introduce significant high wave number variance 4 2 downscaling and upscaling as discussed in section 1 data assimilation in nested grid configurations is one possible approach for downscaling regional ocean analyses and for making more effective use of high resolution observations such as those from the pioneer array however the potential also exists for information to be transferred upscale within the nested system in this section we explore the flow of information between grids by quantifying the impact that each observation has on circulation indices in the examples considered here we evaluate the impact of the observations on the increments of cross shelf transport at two different locations the first location considered coincides with the pioneer array and takes the form of cross shelf transport across a section of the 200 m isobath shown in figs 5c and 5f which passes through the middle of the array this section was chosen because it has also been studied extensively by l20 l21a and l21b specifically we consider the mab transport across this section in the g3 grid as in fig 3 if we denote by i m a b the cross shelf transport across the g3 section averaged over a 3 day 4d var cycle then i m a b x h t n 1 n x n where x n denotes the state vector at time step n and n is the number of time steps spanning the assimilation window here h represents a vector with all zero elements except those that correspond to u and v that define the normal component of velocity along the section throughout the water column in g3 the non zero elements take the form h i β i a i n where β i are the projection coefficients that locally define the normal component of velocity and a i are the appropriate grid cell areas along the 200 m isobath section following the approach of langland and baker 2004 the change in i m a b due to assimilating the data is given by 5 δ i m a b i m a b x a i m a b x b d t k t i m a b x where k b h t hb h t r 1 is the gain matrix cf eq 1 the last approximate equality in 5 results from a 1st order taylor expansion of i m a b x and the operation g k t i m a b x can be achieved by one integration of the adjoint model to evaluate i m a b x and one integration of the tangent linear model to evaluate k t see l20 for practical details multiplication by the matrix inverse hb h t r 1 is performed using the archived conjugate gradient vectors employed to minimize 3 during each 4d var cycle the resulting dot product δ i m a b d t g j 1 m d j g j can then be parsed according to the contribution of each observation j to the increment δ i m a b in the case of multiple outer loops as here 5 is formally applicable to only the 1st outer loop however in the case where the 1st outer loop accounts for most of the increment trémolet 2008 demonstrates that only the 1st outer loop needs to be considered the derivative i m a b x represents the sensitivity of i m a b to variations in all elements of x in space and time fig 3 shows i m a b x with respect to the sst components of x on 22 july 2015 for the 4d var cycle spanning the interval 22 25 july 2015 for both the one way and two way nested cases as discussed in section 3 1 fig 3 clearly illustrates how information can propagate between grids for these two different nesting strategies the operation k t hb h t r 1 hb in 5 propagates i m a b x cf fig 3 forward through time samples the resulting tangent linear fields at the observation locations and times and weights them by the inverse expected total error variance hb h t r time series of the i m a b cross shelf transport index are shown in figs 11a and 11c for the background and the two outer loop state estimates for each 4d var cycle for the one way and two way nested cases the corresponding transport from the free run without data assimilation is also shown for reference in both cases data assimilation modifies the cross shelf transport index significantly compared to the free run however during each data assimilation cycle fig 11 shows that 4d var makes relatively modest changes to i m a b which indicates that after the data assimilation system has settled down large potentially disruptive adjustments are not being made furthermore the cost functions of fig 6 suggest that the majority of the fit of the model to the observations occurs during the 1st outer loop thus we can use 5 to quantify the extent to which the observations on each nested grid contribute to the transport increments on g3 however since 5 is predicated on a tangent linear approximation it is essential first to establish the veracity of the approach in the present system to this end figs 11b and 11d also show time series of δ i m a b computed from the linear approximation in 5 and computed directly from the nonlinear model solutions x a and x b clearly the degree of correspondence between these two estimates of δ i m a b is excellent during most cycles which gives us confidence in the reliability of the observation impacts derived from 5 the root mean square rms contributions of each type of observation to δ i m a b aka observation impact are shown in fig 12 for the one way and two way nested cases the rms impacts are shown for all three grids combined labeled all and for each grid separately for all three grids combined velocity observations contribute the most to δ i m a b for both the one way and two way nested cases recall that in the case of one way nesting data from some platforms are assimilated multiple times if they lie within the rectangular annulus ra2 or in g3 cf fig 1 although the data values assimilated in the different grids may not be identical because the formation of super observations depends on the grid resolution thus in the case of one way nesting fig 12a shows that velocity observations in g2 have almost as much impact on δ i m a b as velocity observations in g3 these data come primarily from the pioneer array moorings in the case of g1 the grid resolution is too coarse to resolve the pioneer mooring array in any meaningful way so these data do not appear as significant in fig 12a instead the g1 in situ temperature and salinity observations mainly from gliders and satellite sst are more substantial players the impact of satellite altimetry on δ i m a b is very small in the case of two way nesting all observations that fall within g3 are assimilated while only observations that fall within the annulus regions ra1 and ra2 see fig 1 are assimilated in g1 and g2 respectively thus in this case fig 12b indicates that most of the impact on δ i m a b is associated with observations within the g3 grid however there are some significant contributions to δ i m a b from in situ salinity observations from the ra1 region of g1 as in the one way nesting case the impact of satellite altimetry on δ i m a b is very small fig 12 indicates that information from the observations can be downscaled in both one way and two way 4d var nesting strategies although in the case of one way nesting there is redundant information from the observations in the overlapping grid regions to explore the extent to which information from observations assimilated in the higher resolution grids can be upscaled to inform the circulation at lower resolution and or larger scales we also considered the transport across a section of the 200 m isobath in the southern mid atlantic bight smab hereafter denoted by i s m a b in this case i s m a b is defined only on grid g1 and the location of the section is shown in figs 5a and 5d this approximately corresponds to where the pioneer array will be relocated beginning in 2024 time series of i s m a b for the one way and two way nested cases are shown in fig 13 for the free run background and 4d var analyses again data assimilation causes significant modifications to the transport in both cases compared to the free run although the transport increments are generally smaller than for i m a b the rms impact of the different types of observations is shown in fig 14 in aggregate and for the individual grids and comparison with fig 12 confirms that the rms transport increments are generally smaller than those in i m a b fig 14a shows that on g1 in situ salinity observations have the largest impact on δ i s m a b while on g2 and g3 it is velocity observations that have the largest impact fig 14b indicates that in the case of two way nesting observations from g1 and g3 typically have the largest impact on δ i s m a b specifically the in situ velocity and temperature observations the sst observations typically have largest impact during the first few cycles in april when the 4d var system has not yet reached an equilibrium not shown as in the case of the mab transport increment the impact of satellite altimetry on δ i s m a b is very small the impact of observations in g3 on δ i s m a b for both the one way and two way cases indicates there is a transfer of information upscale from the observations during 4d var for both nesting strategies as discussed on l20 l21a and l21b the observation impacts depend on several factors that include a the background circulation x b which of course is highly resolution dependent across the three grids b the background error covariance b and c the observation error covariance r as described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the parameters used to compute b and r were not the same across all three grids since different error statistics are appropriate for each grid as such some of the changes in the relative impact of the various observing system components on the three grids will depend on variations in the error covariances the observation error covariance matrix r is generally dominated by errors of representativeness which are challenging to estimate a priori as noted earlier we have used the same choices as those of l20 l21a and l21b for their quasi one way nested assimilation experiments specifically for the in situ temperature observations the standard deviations assumed for r are similar across all three grids and range from 0 6 c on g1 to 0 4 c on g2 and g3 however as discussed in l21a and l21b an a posteriori analysis of the innovation statistics following desroziers et al 2005 suggests that these standard deviations should be closer to 1 c for in situ salinity observations the a priori observation errors were assumed to be 0 2 on g1 although the a posteriori innovation statistics indicate that a more appropriate choice is 0 4 which is the value used for both g2 and g3 similarly for velocity measurements the standard deviation of the observation error on g1 was assumed to be 0 6 m s 1 for hf radar surface current estimates and 0 3 m s 1 for moorings these values were adjusted downwards to 0 1 m s 1 for hf radar observations and 0 04 m s 1 for moorings for g2 and g3 and are more in line with the a posteriori innovation statistics rather than attempt to refine the choice of r for the present study we intentionally used the same r as l20 l21a and l21b to provide a direct comparison with the performance of their related quasi one way nested system that being the case the observation impact calculations for δ i m a b presented in fig 12 are consistent with the findings of l21a and l21b as noted above the larger impact of salinity observations on δ i m a b in g1 is consistent with the lower observation errors on this grid similarly the larger impact of velocity observations on δ i m a b in g3 is partly associated with the reduction in observation error assigned to these data compared to g1 and g2 however the detailed analysis of l21b also suggests that the larger impact of the velocity observations collected at the pioneer array mooring sites can be attributed to a reduction in the horizontal length scale resolved by the g3 grid despite the inhomogeneous and non geostrophic nature of the submesoscale circulation the expectations of quasi geostrophic adjustment theory i e temperton 1973 gill 1982 appear to explain the increasing importance of velocity observations in constraining the circulation at smaller scales due the rapid decrease in the rossby radius of deformation from 20 km to 5 km moving inshore across the shelf 5 summary and conclusions a new nested 4d var capability has been developed for roms a popular community ocean model and is described here for the first time the strategy adopted for 4d var is demonstrated for one way and two way nesting in roms configured for the mid atlantic bight where the highest resolution grid targets the nsf ooi pioneer array it was found that 4d var generally performs well under both one way and two way nesting strategies furthermore the fit of the 4d var background to the observations is usually superior on all grids to that of a free running model demonstrating that the model is able to retain information from the observations from one cycle to the next the ability of the model to retain information is generally scale dependent performing best for the quasi geostrophic and mesoscale circulations of grids g1 and g2 whereas the highly nonlinear submesoscale environment of grid g3 presents more of a challenge the most appropriate choice of nesting strategy employed by future users will most likely depend on the region considered and the problem to be addressed while roms supports both one and two way nesting the two way nesting is generally more computationally demanding than one way nesting as currently implemented because the additional interpolation step from a high resolution grid to the next lower resolution grid that must be performed at each time step represents a bottleneck for parallel computations in light of this one way nesting may be preferable if computing resources are limited or constrained by operational constraints however while two way nesting may be the more intellectually appealing strategy for nested grid applications the authors are not aware of any study that has demonstrated that two way nesting yields a more accurate analysis forecast system than a one way nested approach in ocean applications this is a topic that requires more investigation data assimilation was also found to energize the circulation compared to the free running model as evidenced by an increased surface kinetic energy relative enstrophy and buoyancy variance i e available potential energy the increase is particularly marked within the inertial range of the horizontal wavenumber spectra in the case of kinetic energy and relative enstrophy in addition data assimilation does not modify the fundamental character of the kinetic energy cascade at the submesoscale on the highest resolution grid however if data assimilation is terminated then in the inertial range the energy returns to the level of the free running model within 2 weeks the reason for the elevated variance in the 4d var analyses presented here requires further investigation dynamical imbalances at the beginning of each data assimilation window so called initialization shock can excite inertia gravity waves igws which could account for some of increase in variance however the variance remains elevated throughout the 3 day assimilation window even though igws typically dissipate significantly within a day or two e g raghukumar et al 2015 while methods exist for suppressing igws resulting from initialization shock such as digital filters gauthier and thépaut 2001 igws can be coupled to the submesoscale circulation and it can be difficult to separate igws from submesoscale features mcwilliams 2016 therefore distinguishing between igws resulting from initialization shocks and igw like submesoscale flows during any initialization procedure will likely be very challenging and deserves further attention elevated variance in the 4d var analyses will also result from information provided the observations similar increases in eddy kinetic energy following data assimilation have also been documented in other applications of roms 4d var for example neveu et al 2016 hereafter n16 found that the kinetic energy of the offshore mesoscale eddy field associated with the california current system is similarly elevated following 4d var data assimilation n16 found that the development of eddies via baroclinic instability and the subsequent westward propagation and subduction farther offshore was considerably enhanced by 4d var the conclusion from n16 then is that the elevation of eddy kinetic energy due to data assimilation is associated with a data informed enhancement of the dynamical processes responsible for eddy generation and ocean variance it seems likely therefore that just as in the study of n16 the increase of circulation variance across all three nested grids in the mab configuration considered here will be similarly data informed by the observations in other words the circulation of the roms free run may not be as energetic as the observations indicate there are a several possible factors that may contribute to the general deficiency in the free run circulation variance which include the choice of horizontal and vertical resolution short comings in ocean mixing parameterizations and forcing strategies for stand alone ocean models that neglect important coupled air sea interaction processes while the extent to which each of these factors limit the variance of the model circulation clearly requires further investigation our main aim here is to demonstrate the feasibility of performing 4d var data assimilation across multiple nested grids and across a range of scales and dynamical regimes and to demonstrate the utility of the new roms system the transfer of information across grids and scales during data assimilation was demonstrated by computing the contribution of each observation aka observation impact to the 4d var analysis increments in cross shelf transport at the shelf break at two different locations the observation impact calculations indicate that the information from the observing network can move both downscale and upscale demonstrating that data assimilation within nested grids can take full advantage of high resolution observing networks such as the nsf ooi pioneer array considered here two outstanding issues with the current roms nested 4d var system deserve further investigation first discontinuities in the 4d var state estimates can develop at the grid open boundaries at the beginning of each assimilation window this problem could be potentially alleviated by adding a term to the 4d var cost functions 2 and 3 that acts as a smoothness constraint by penalizing the state vector field gradients simon et al 2011 have discussed some practical approaches based on these ideas in a nested shallow water model nonetheless the initial time state vector discontinuities that develop near the grid boundaries are quickly ameliorated by dynamic adjustment of the model fields so that by the end of the 4d var data assimilation window appropriate dynamical balances of the state vector fields have been restored since the state estimate at the end of the 4d var window represents the circulation estimate at the current time we view the discontinuities in the increments at the initial time as a secondary concern however further investigation is warranted secondly in the present 4d var formulation no attempt has been made to account for correlations between errors in the background fields on the three overlapping nested grids such correlations will clearly be present given the relationship between the state vectors of each grid experience gained from multigrid approaches to data assimilation offer potential ways forward to address this issue e g robert et al 2005 attempts to ameliorate the

23756,the regional ocean modeling system roms 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation platform has been extended to include nested grid configurations using both one way and two way nesting strategies the efficacy of this new roms utility is demonstrated in a model comprising three nested grids with horizontal refinement and configured for the mid atlantic bight the three nested grids have a horizontal resolution ranging from 7 km to 0 8 km thereby capturing circulation regimes that span the gulf stream western boundary current through the mesoscale eddy field and down to the rapidly evolving and energetic submesoscale these circulation regimes represent a challenge for any data assimilation system and the nested 4d var system was found to perform well across the range of resolved space and time scales the observational data used to constrain the ocean state estimates come from a wide range of remote sensing in situ and mobile platforms along with the u s national science foundation s ocean observatories initiative pioneer array several aspects of the system performance are explored and described here including the fit of the model to the observations the influence of data assimilation on the wave number spectra at the submesoscale and the downscaling and upscaling of information captured by the observations keywords data assimilation 4d var nested grids mid atlantic bight pioneer array data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal ocean observing systems have evolved rapidly in recent years and in many cases now resolve the upper limits of the submesoscale via routine observations made by ocean gliders and networks of coastal high frequency radars in addition the introduction of satellite wide swath altimetry such as the recently launched surface water and ocean topography swot mission promises to deliver routine unprecedented observations of sea surface height ssh at scales approaching the submesoscale thus ocean data assimilation strategies that can capitalize fully on the information content of these data at all resolved scales are a priority given the computational demands of running ocean models that resolve the submesoscale nested grid approaches are perhaps the most promising approach since they can target areas where observing systems have the highest resolution data assimilation in nested models is not new and has been a mainstay of numerical weather prediction nwp for several decades for example one of the earliest attempts is that of stauffer and seaman 1994 who used a nested model of the colorado plateau and grand canyon to assimilate atmospheric observations capable of resolving the meso β scale i e 20 200 km scales the approach they used was a simple multi scale nudging technique since then progress has been rapid in support of the needs of nwp particularly with high impact weather events such as thunderstorms and tornadoes the so called meso γ scales 2 20 km a variety of data assimilation approaches are also now used in nested nwp models including ensemble kalman filters e g oigawa et al 2018 and variational approaches both 3 dimensional 3d var e g xiao et al 2005 and 4 dimensional 4d var e g huva et al 2020 various approaches to data assimilation in nested models have also been employed in the ocean for example vandenbulcke et al 2006 and barth et al 2007 have used different flavors of kalman filters in triply nested configurations of a primitive equation model of the mediterranean sea targeting the gulf of lion and the ligurian sea respectively in addition logutov 2008 used a variational data assimilation approach to optimize the tidal constituents in a model of the philippines archipelago while simon et al 2011 explored 4d var approaches in an idealized configuration of a shallow water model simulating a wind driven double gyre circulation this paper describes and documents an extension of the regional ocean modeling system roms 4d var data assimilation system to nested grid configurations since roms is a popular and widely used community ocean model this paper also serves as a helpful reference for future users of the nested 4d var interface and documents the first application of nested 4d var in roms the specific focus of this study is the mid atlantic bight mab in the northwest atlantic and both one way and two way nested configurations are considered here a triply nested design of grids is considered in which the highest resolution grid targets the national science foundation nsf ocean observatories initiative ooi pioneer array located at the mab shelf break some 140 km south of martha s vineyard the pioneer array and the highest resolution model grid both resolve the ocean submesoscale circulations at this site so this study represents an opportunity to explore the extent to which observations from the broader scale observing network can be downscaled to inform the submesoscale in the vicinity of the array as well as the degree to which information at the submesoscale captured by the array can be upscaled to constrain the mesoscale and quasi geostrophic circulation of the neighboring western boundary current region and shelf circulation a description of the roms configuration employed in this study is given in section 2 followed by a detailed account of the 4d var data assimilation approach used in section 3 specifically we describe in section 3 1 the 4d var formulation in relation to the augmented state vector comprising the state variables from all of the nested grids this is followed in section 3 2 and section 3 3 by a description of the observations and error covariances respectively next the performance of the nested 4d var system is quantitatively explored in section 4 using a variety of system output indicators finally a summary and some conclusions follow in section 5 2 roms configuration the roms configuration used here comprises three telescoping nested grids with refinement in horizontal resolution as illustrated in fig 1 the outer most grid referred to as g1 has a horizontal resolution of 7 km and spans the mab the grid g2 has a horizontal resolution of 2 3 km while the inner most grid g3 has a horizontal resolution of 0 8 km all three grids have 40 σ levels in the vertical the circulation in the mab spans a range of horizontal scales encompassing the broad gulf stream western boundary current an energetic field of mesoscale eddies and a wide range of submesoscale circulation features an example of the sea surface temperature sst across these different scales is shown in fig 2 from the nested roms configuration the placement of the three nested grids was motivated by the location of the nsf ooi pioneer array which is well resolved by g3 as illustrated in figs 2c and 2f the model can be run with either one way or two way communications between the nested model grids roms nesting algorithms are flexible allowing various configuration topologies with refinement or composite warner et al 2010 grids each grid exchanges information in the computational contact region that extends the mesh that overlays or is adjacent to a nested grid as illustrated in fig 1 inset between the telescoping g2 and g3 grids the c staggered contact points in halo region ca3 facilitate the evaluation of roms kernel horizontal operators advection diffusion viscosity pressure gradient and fluxes at the finer g3 physical boundary instead of applying lateral boundary conditions the state variable values in ca3 are interpolated from the coarser donor g2 thus the evaluation of the horizontal operators is seamless by manipulating the i and j ranges in the kernel do loops it is similar to the parallel distributed memory halo exchanges or periodicity boundary treatment in the case of one way nesting information in the nonlinear model passes only from a low resolution grid to a high resolution grid across grid open boundaries so in this case from g1 to g2 and from g2 to g3 as indicated in fig 1 therefore each grid produces a different circulation within the regions where the grids overlap although often the circulations in the overlapping areas may be qualitatively similar conversely in the case of two way nesting information passes both ways across the grid open boundaries as illustrated in fig 1 in addition the solutions within the overlapping grid regions are updated by averaging the fields on the high resolution grid to the next lower resolution grid thus in the case considered here the fields from g3 are averaged and replace the solution in g2 within the overlapping region similarly the averaged fields from g2 replace those of g1 within the region overlapped by these two grids the g1 open boundaries were constrained using data from the mercator oc é an global analyses lellouche et al 2018 after application of a seasonal bias correction using the regional climatology of fleming 2016 additional corrections for bias were made to the g1 open boundary mean dynamic topography and seasonal cycle of sea surface height ssh and velocity using a regional data assimilative climatological analysis as described by wilkin et al 2022 surface forcing for all three grids was derived from surface fluxes of momentum heat and freshwater using 3 hourly national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american mesoscale nam rogers et al 2009 fields and the coare3 0 bulk formulae of fairall et al 2003 application of the nam atmospheric pressure drives an oceanic dynamic inverted barometer response daily freshwater discharge from rivers was imposed in each grid as appropriate based on gauge observations from the u s geological survey and water survey of canada lopez et al 2020 wilkin et al 2018 the sub tidal mesoscale variability captured by mercator océan is retained harmonic tidal forcing from the tpxo global harmonic tidal analysis egbert and erofeeva 2002 was added to the boundary ssh and depth averaged velocity data in a domain this small the astronomical tide generating forces are negligible as discussed in section 3 2 the period considered here is 26 april 3 august 2015 the roms configuration used in g1 forms the basis of the analysis forecast system of wilkin et al 2018 and the reanalysis of wilkin et al 2022 however the present study extends these previous efforts by considering a suite of refined nested grids g2 and g3 that resolve important processes of the shelf break dynamics targeted by the nsf ooi pioneer array furthermore the work presented here represents the first application of the roms nested 4d var data assimilation system and demonstrates how the circulation at all resolved scales can be informed by observations assimilated on each of the refined grids 3 the 4d var approach 3 1 one way versus two way nesting before describing the roms nested 4d var system it is necessary first to establish some notation given that several one way or two way nested grids are involved following the notation of ide et al 1997 we will define the roms state vector as x t which comprises all ocean grid point values of temperature salinity free surface height and the two components of horizontal velocity at time t the state vectors corresponding to the grids g1 g2 and g3 will then be denoted by x 1 t x 2 t and x 3 t respectively finally the augmented state vector formed by concatenating x 1 t x 2 t and x 3 t will be designated as x t x 1 t t x 2 t t x 3 t t t the roms nested 4d var approach is based on the dual formulation described by gürol et al 2014 in which observations spanning the interval t t 1 t 2 referred to as the assimilation window are assimilated into the model therefore in the usual way we can express the desired 4d var analysis x a t 1 at the beginning of the assimilation window as 1 x a t 1 x b t 1 b h t hb h t r 1 d where x b t 1 is the background state vector d y h x b is the innovation vector based on the difference between the vector of all observations of any type that span t 1 t 2 denoted y and the background sampled at the observation locations and times according to the observation operator h x b t b and r are the background error covariance and observation error covariance matrices respectively h is the tangent linearization of h and h t denotes the adjoint of h in 4d var h represents the nonlinear roms integrated over the interval t 1 t 2 and sampled at the observations while h and h t represent the corresponding integrations of the tangent linear model and adjoint for roms respectively consecutive assimilation windows through time are referred to as assimilation cycles since the dimension of the state vector x is very large o 1 0 7 in the application considered here it is not possible to represent the background error covariance b matrix in 1 explicitly instead b is factorized as k b σ c σ t k b t where c is a univariate covariance matrix that is modeled in roms following the diffusion operator approach of weaver and courtier 2001 see moore et al 2011 for technical details σ represents a diagonal matrix of background standard deviations that is estimated from a long integration of the nonlinear roms and k b is a multivariate balance operator that accounts for cross covariances between the background errors in different fields see for example weaver et al 2005 the observation vector y comprises observations of all types for technical reasons in the current roms 4d var system the observation errors are treated as uncorrelated in which case the observation error covariance r is represented as a diagonal matrix with the dimension of y the total number of observations within the assimilation window spanning t 1 t 2 see fig 4 in 4d var x a t 1 is identified by minimizing a non linear cost function of the form 2 j n l x t 1 x b t 1 t b 1 x t 1 x b t 1 y h x t t r 1 y h x t direct minimization of the non linear cost function given by 2 is generally very challenging and a truncated gauss newton iterative approach is typically used in practice lawless et al 2005 by employing the incremental approach to 4d var introduced by courtier et al 1994 specifically the problem is linearized about the background x b t and a linear cost function j of the form 3 j δ x t b 1 δ x h δ x d t r 1 h δ x d is minimized where δ x x t 1 x b t 1 is the increment at the beginning of the assimilation window the linear cost function j in 3 is minimized iteratively where each iteration is referred to as an inner loop and each sequence of inner loop iterations is referred to as an outer loop during the first outer loop the tangent linear and adjoint observation operators h and h t are linearized about x b t after the δ x that minimizes 3 has been identified the state vector is updated according to x 1 t 1 x b t 1 δ x if a second outer loop is performed as in the experiments described below a second sequence of inner loop iterations is performed during which h and h t are linearized about the updated state vector x 1 t subsequent outer loops n would be updated similarly according to x n t 1 x n 1 t 1 δ x the combination of inner and outer loop iterations yields the minimum of the non linear cost function 2 the dimension of the state vector x employed in the cost functions 1 and 2 depends upon whether one way or two way nesting is used in the case of one way nesting x comprises all elements of x 1 x 2 and x 3 regardless of their geographical location as described above information flows in only one direction across the grid open boundaries in the nl model therefore there will be multiple estimates of the circulation in the overlapping regions for the grids in other words with reference to fig 1 there will be a single state estimate in the rectangular annulus region labeled ra1 according to the elements of x 1 while in the rectangular annulus ra2 there will be state estimates based on x 1 and x 2 likewise in the region spanned by g3 there will be state estimates for x 1 x 2 and x 3 in the same way in the case of one way nesting observations are assimilated on all three grids in all regions regardless of their geographical location therefore an observation within the area ra2 will be assimilated into g1 and g2 while an observation within the regions spanned by g3 will be assimilated into g1 g2 and g3 thus information from some observations will be utilized in the data assimilation more than once obviously observations within the region ra1 are assimilated into g1 only in the case of two way nesting the state vector fields within the overlapping regions depend on the averaged values from the higher resolution grid therefore in two way nesting x comprises the subset of elements of x 1 that fall within ra1 the subset of elements of x 2 that fall within ra2 and all the elements of x 3 with this strategy each observation is utilized only once within the 4d var system reducing the amount of redundant information from the observations the two different approaches to 4d var in one way and two way nested configurations can perhaps be better appreciated by considering the flow of information between the three grids during the inner loop iterations each inner loop involves sequential integrations of the tangent linear and adjoint models to evaluate the matrix operator hb h t in 1 in the tangent linear model information is exchanged between the grid open boundaries in much the same way as in the nonlinear model in the case of both one way and two way nesting as illustrated in fig 1 however the adjoint model involves an integration backwards in time thus information flows across the grid open boundaries in a different direction in the case of two way nesting information flows in both directions at the grid open boundaries during the evaluation of the adjoint operator h t just as in the tangent linear and nonlinear models however in the case of one way nesting information is exchanged in only one direction by h t at the grid open boundaries from the high resolution grid to the low resolution grid as illustrated in fig 1 the influence of the flow of information in the adjoint model in the one way and two way nesting cases is demonstrated in fig 3 which shows the results of an adjoint sensitivity calculation for both cases in these experiments a forcing was applied in the adjoint model to the g3 velocity field normal to the section of the 200 m isobath identified in figs 3c and 3f the forcing takes the form of an impulse applied every hour and the nested adjoint model is integrated backwards in time for 3 days the adjoint forcing was appropriately scaled to yield the sensitivity of the 3 day average transport crossing the target 200 m isobath section this particular example was chosen because it directly relates to the experiments presented in section 4 2 fig 3 shows the adjoint sst field at the end of the 3 day adjoint integration 22 july 2015 and represents the sensitivity of the cross isobath transport to changes in sst in sv k 1 results from a one way and a two way nested adjoint integration are shown recalling that it is only the adjoint of g3 that is being forced then in the one way case figs 3a c the influence of information propagating out of g3 into g2 and then into g1 is very evident for example data from g3 is passed to g2 at the g3 open boundary at which time it can propagate in all directions unconstrained within g2 including the overlapping grid regions similarly information passes from g2 to g1 through the g2 open boundary and can then propagate in all directions unconstrained in g1 including the overlapping grid regions during one way nested 4d var the propagation of information in the adjoint model from a high resolution grid to a low resolution grid informs the data assimilation algorithm how the initial conditions for the entire lower resolution grid need to be adjusted in order to yield a better fit of the higher resolution grid solution to the observations in the case of two way nesting information flows from g3 to g2 at the g3 open boundary but can only influence the g2 solution in the rectangular annulus ra2 likewise information passing from g2 through the open boundary to g1 can only affect the solution in the rectangular annulus ra1 the transfer of information in the opposite direction i e from g1 to g2 and g2 to g1 is constrained by the adjoint of the averaging procedure employed in two way nesting therefore during two way nested 4d var the adjoint model informs the data assimilation algorithm how the initial conditions for the lower resolution grids in the rectangular annulus regions need to be adjusted in order to yield a better fit of the higher resolution grid solution to the observations 3 2 observations the observations assimilated span the interval 26 april 3 august 2015 a period that represents relatively good data coverage from the pioneer array see levin et al 2021b the observation data streams and preprocessing are identical to those used in previous configurations of g1 g2 and g3 by levin et al 2020 2021a 2021b hereafter l20 l21a and l21b respectively and are summarized in table 1 from l20 for all observation types super observations were formed when appropriate to avoid the assimilation of multiple observations of the same state variable into a single grid cell at the same time step this procedure improves the conditioning of the matrix inverse in 1 see daley 1991 the super observation procedure is grid resolution dependent generally less super obing is required at higher resolution as discussed in section 3 1 redundant information from the observations is present due to the repeat assimilation of data within the regions overlapped by g1 g2 and g3 in the case of one way nesting however because the super observation procedure depends on the grid resolution information from platforms in the overlapping grid regions will be processed and assimilated somewhat differently in the case of two way nesting each observation and super observation is assimilated only once based on which grid it falls in the period 26 april 3 august 2015 was subdivided into 3 day intervals and all observations falling within each window 33 windows in total were assimilated using 4d var fig 4a shows the time series of the total number of observations after super obing or thinning assimilated into the model during each 3 day 4d var cycle in the one way and two way nested experiments the number of observations assimilated in the one way cases is greater than in the two way cases which reflects the assimilation of some observational information up to three times in the former case the number of observations assimilated into each of the three grids in both cases is indicated in fig 4b in the case of g3 the number of data assimilated during the one way and two way experiments is identical for each cycle 3 3 error covariances as noted earlier l20 l21a and l21b have performed 4d var on the same three grids using a quasi one way nested approach where data were first assimilated independently into g1 for multiple years data were then assimilated independently into g2 constrained at the open boundaries by the g1 4d var estimates finally data were assimilated independently into g3 using the g2 4d var estimates to constrain the open boundaries to compare the performance of the new one way and two way nested 4d var approaches that are advocated here we have therefore used the same background and observation error covariance matrix formulations as those adopted by l20 l21a and l21b this will allow us to more directly compare the results presented here with those of the previous studies for the same overlapping period as noted in section 3 1 the background error covariance b matrix in roms is modeled following the diffusion operator approach of weaver and courtier 2001 see moore et al 2011 for technical details the decorrelation length scales assumed in b for errors in each control variable on the three model grids are summarized in table 2 these parameter choices are discussed in l20 and l21a the b matrix comprises blocks corresponding to each grid but no attempt was made to account for the covariance in the background errors between grids the observation error covariance matrix r in 1 was assumed to be a diagonal matrix table 1 summarizes the errors and uncertainties assigned to measurements from each of the different observing platforms these errors reflect the combined influence of measurement errors and representativeness errors and are also discussed in l20 l21a and l21b observation quality control was performed during each 4d var cycle following the approach developed in nwp by anderson and järvinen 1999 specifically the innovation d i associated with each observation is compared to the standard error computed from the background error σ b 2 and observation error σ o 2 variances for a chosen threshold α an observation is rejected from the analysis if d i 2 α 2 σ b 2 σ o 2 the thresholds α depend on the type of observation and are given in table 2 for the analyses on each grid 4 nested circulation estimates before examining the 4d var circulation estimates it is helpful to first compare the free run example solutions from the one way and two way nested cases shown in fig 2 for 25 july 2015 with corresponding 4d var estimates the free run solutions were started from the same initial conditions on 26 april 2015 which are taken from a longer two way nested simulation spanning the period 1 april 2014 to 26 april 2015 not too surprisingly the free run g1 solutions from the one way and two way nesting cases cf figs 2a and 2d are very similar on the other hand the details of the free run sst in g2 are quite different between the two nesting approaches cf figs 2b and 2e even though the mesoscale is conditioned on a similar larger scale circulation in the form of a gulf stream meander entering the southwest corner of g2 likewise the submesoscale features in free run g3 which are conditioned on the mesoscale circulations of g2 are also quite different cf figs 2c and 2f although they are equally energetic as illustrated in section 4 1 2 following l20 l21a and l21b two outer loops and seven inner loops were employed during each 3 day 4d var cycle the 4d var control vector comprises only the model initial conditions in the experiments presented here and the analysis x a t 2 at the end of each 4d var cycle becomes the background x b t 1 at the beginning of the next cycle cf eq 1 fig 5 compares the sst on 25 july 2015 at the end of the second outer loop for the one way and two way nested approaches for the 4d var cycle spanning the period 22 25 july the 4d var sst estimates of fig 5 differ significantly from the free run case since satellite sst observations are one of the dominant data streams see section 3 2 however the one way and two way nested 4d var estimates are generally more similar to each other than the corresponding free run solutions for example the root mean square rms difference between the sst of the one way and two way free run solutions is 0 8 c for g1 1 1 c for g2 and 1 4 c for g3 while for the 4d var sst estimates the rms differences are 0 9 c on all three grids in the following subsections the performance of the 4d var system in one way and two way nested configurations of the model is quantified section 4 1 will focus on the performance in terms of cost function reduction in addition we also examine how data assimilation across the multiple resolved scales influences the wave number spectra of the circulation the issue of discontinuous field estimates across the grid boundaries is also addressed finally section 4 2 explores the exchange of information from the observations between each grid 4 1 4d var performance 4 1 1 cost function as an initial 4d var performance indicator we consider first the behavior of the cost function specifically we evaluate the contribution of the observations to the non linear cost function 2 namely j o y h x t r 1 y h x this is straightforward to evaluate during each 4d var cycle for both the background x b and the analysis x a at the end of each outer loop since the magnitude of j o depends on the number of observations it is helpful to normalize j o by its value in the absence of data assimilation thus if x f denotes the state vector of the free run without data assimilation then we let j f y h x f t r 1 y h x f fig 6 shows time series of the cost function ratio j o j f for each 4d var cycle for the one way fig 6a and two way fig 6e cases each time series shows the cost function ratio for the background and the analysis at the end of each outer loop at the beginning of the first 4d var cycle the background is the same as the free running model so in both the one way and two way cases j o j f 1 however figs 6a and 6e show that generally j o j f 1 for the background indicating the background is closer to the observations than the free running model there are a few exceptions such as in the 1 way nesting case fig 6a during the middle of june when j o j f 1 for three consecutive cycles and a few cycles on various dates in the two way nesting case fig 6e when j o j f 1 in general however figs 6a and 6e indicate that the model background retains information from the observations from one cycle to the next as anticipated figs 6a and 6e reveal that data assimilation significantly reduces the cost function ratio j o j f with the largest reduction generally occurring during the 1st outer loop a 2nd outer loop is clearly beneficial although the subsequent decrease in j o j f is much less this is true in the case of both one way and two way nesting time series of the contribution to j o of observations from each grid are shown in figs 6b c d for the one way nesting case and fig 6f g h for the two way nesting case for reference the contribution of each grid to the free run cost function j f is also shown in general the background solution for g1 is generally always closer to the observations than the free run in the case of one way nesting fig 6c as noted above j o j f 1 during mid june in fig 6a and figs 6c and 6d indicate that this is associated with the state vector on g2 and g3 as there are times when j o j f for the background on both grids thus the ability of the model to retain information from one assimilation to the next is resolution dependent in the case of two way nesting figs 6f g h suggest a similar behavior although j o j f for all three grids during most cycles the exception is on g3 fig 6h where j o is slightly larger than j f during much of june 4 1 2 wave number spectra one appealing aspect of data assimilation in nested grids is that it offers a way of potentially constraining the mesoscale to submesoscale circulation features in a dynamically consistent way using observations in particular the circulation at the submesoscale has attracted considerable attention and a growing body of literature demonstrates the rich nature of the circulation at these scales for example mcwilliams 2016 provides an excellent review of the submesoscale environment and associated dynamical regimes the submesoscale is thought to provide a direct route for the turbulent dissipation of energy from the mesoscale to smaller scales therefore one aspect of the submesoscale circulation that has received considerable attention is the shape of the energy and variance spectra since under certain assumptions they provide clues about the direction of the energy and variance cascades in wave number space it is of interest here then to examine the characteristics of spectra in the free running model particularly in the submesoscale resolving grid g3 and the extent to which they are modified by data assimilation a central tenet for theoretical interpretations of wave number spectra is the existence of an inertial range over which the inertial accelerations or nonlinear advection terms in the governing equations control the cascade of the variance between scales see vallis 2006 chapter 8 by invoking assumptions of isotropy homogeneity and conservation the expected slope of the wave number spectra of different properties can be predicted a priori some well known canonical regimes thought to be relevant to the ocean are 2 dimensional quasi geostrophic 2dqg turbulence and surface quasi geostrophic sqg turbulence in the case of 2dqg turbulence the kinetic energy ke spectrum is expected to follow a k 3 spectrum in the inertial range where k k 2 l 2 1 2 is the total horizontal wave number in this case energy and relative enstrophy conservation lead to an inverse cascade of ke i e toward larger scales accompanied by a forward cascade in relative enstrophy batchelor 1953 conversely in the case of sqg turbulence the ke spectrum is actually controlled by the buoyancy variance both are predicted to follow a k 5 3 spectrum and the ke and buoyancy variance ratio remains constant at all wave numbers within the inertial range characterized by an inverse energy cascade and a forward cascade of buoyancy variance capet et al 2008a within the submesoscale range however the notion of an inertial range is generally less well defined as discussed by mcwilliams 2016 and a spectrum following k 2 for kinetic energy and buoyancy variance may be more relevant in the surface boundary layer accompanied by forward cascades in both in settings more reminiscent of the real ocean the spectral slope of the variance of different properties can deviate from that expected from the canonical cases and is influenced by the presence of surface forcing dissipation and the β effect via rotation and the presence of bathymetry therefore the relevance of the aforementioned canonical cases to the circulation considered here is by no means clear e g see lapeyre 2017 for a thorough review in the context of sqg nevertheless the canonical cases provide useful reference points and we consider the extent to which they may apply in the nested roms configurations used here however before examining the details of the variance spectra it is useful to first appreciate the nature of the surface fields themselves to gain an intuitive sense of the horizontal length scales that are present to this end fig 7 shows examples of the g3 surface stream flow surface relative vorticity normalized by the coriolis parameter i e the local rossby number and the surface density anomaly δ ρ ρ ρ 0 where ρ 0 1025 kg m 3 each field is shown at the end of the two way 4d var cycle spanning the interval 22 25 july as figs 5d e f show at this time there is a gulf stream meander entering the southwest portion of the g3 domain and this is the most coherent feature of the circulation in fig 7 elsewhere in g3 the surface velocity relative vorticity and density anomaly are characterized by a mixture of mesoscale and submesoscale features in the form of eddies fronts and filaments for many of these features fig 7b demonstrates that ζ f 1 indicating that nonlinearity will be locally important these regions delineate the inertial range which controls the cascades of variance in the form of ke relative enstrophy and buoyancy fig 8 shows the wave number spectra for velocity variance i e ke relative vorticity variance i e relative enstrophy q and variance of the density anomaly δ ρ i e buoyancy variance or available potential energy at the surface for g3 for the one way and two way nesting cases in all cases the wave number spectra were computed from an ensemble of 2400 realizations i e hourly snap shot fields spanning the april august period the spectra are based on a 2 dimensional discrete cosine transform dct of the full 2 dimensional field e g ahmed et al 1974 denis et al 2002 fig 8 shows wave number spectra for each property for the free running model and for the 4d var estimates in all cases the variance of the 4d var estimates is higher than in the free run at all wave numbers the same was found for g1 and g2 also not shown thus data assimilation increases the variance of the circulation which corresponds to an increase in surface ke relative enstrophy and buoyancy variance in fig 8 closer inspection of figs 8a and 8b reveals that for horizontal scales greater than the g3 resolution i e k 2 π 0 6 km 1 the slope of the ke spectrum is approximately piecewise linear with a change in slope near k 2 π 0 1 km 1 corresponding to a horizontal scale of 10 km since the relative enstrophy and buoyancy spectra exhibit less of a linear relationship between the spectral slope and k we will confine the discussion here to the ke spectra the slope of the spectrum above and below k 2 π 0 1 km 1 was estimated using a least squares method in the case of one way nesting for k 2 π 0 1 km 1 the ke spectrum varies approximately as k 2 7 in the case of the free run while in the case of 4d var it varies as k 2 1 at shorter scales 0 1 k 2 π 0 5 km 1 the free run ke spectrum varies as k 3 5 while in the case of 4d var it varies as k 3 on the other hand in the case of two way nesting the ke varies as k 2 8 in the free run and as k 2 4 for the 4d var estimates for k 2 π 0 1 km 1 while for 0 1 k 2 π 0 5 km 1 the ke spectra vary according to k 4 3 for the free run and k 3 6 for the 4d var estimates thus in all cases the slope of the ke spectrum is smaller in the case of the 4d var estimates for both the one way and two ways nesting cases this indicates that a greater fraction of the ke resides at scales less than 10 km in the 4d var estimates compared to the free run two of these cases have spectral slopes consistent with the 2dqg canonical case one way nesting 4d var and the two way nesting free run however in both of these cases the ke spectrum is generally characterized by a forward cascade rather than the inverse cascade expected for 2dqg turbulence as demonstrated next specifically if the ke is defined as 1 2 u 2 v 2 then the horizontal spectral transfer function for ke due to the inertial accelerations in the horizontal momentum equations is given by the discrete analog of 4 π k e k k k m a x u ˆ u u x v u y v ˆ u v x v v y d k where u ˆ and v ˆ represent the dct of the surface horizontal velocity components and u u x v u y etc represent the dct of the corresponding inertial accelerations at the surface see capet et al 2008b 1 1 the contribution of vertical advection of momentum was not included since w was not archived during the 4d var analyses however a calculation of π k e for the free run that includes the influence of the vertical inertial accelerations indicates that their contribution is very small compared to the horizontal inertial terms and the same is likely to be the case for the 4d var estimates also the range of the horizontal wave number considered is k k m i n k m a x where k m i n and k m a x represent the wave numbers associated with the largest and smallest resolved horizontal scales respectively the spectral transfer function π k e k given by 4 represents the time rate of change of the domain integrated surface ke due to the horizontal inertial accelerations for all wavenumbers in the range k to k m a x the time rate of change of the total domain integrated ke within the surface layer is given by π k e k m i n in the case of closed lateral boundaries the horizontal energy fluxes will vanish at the boundaries and π k e k m i n will be associated with the vertical energy flux divergence since vertical energy fluxes will generally be very small compared to the horizontal fluxes then to a good approximation we expect π k e k m i n π k e k m a x 0 in a closed domain therefore in a closed domain the sign of π k e k indicates whether there is a forward i e π k e k 0 or inverse i e π k e k 0 energy cascade in the presence of open boundaries however there will in general be fluxes of ke across the boundaries therefore while the condition π k e k m a x 0 still applies in this situation π k e k m i n 0 which complicates the interpretation of the spectral transfer functions i e there are no conservation properties for g3 specifically if π k e k is single signed the direction of the energy cascade cannot be determined unambiguously since ke may be fluxing into or out of the domain across a range of scales when π k e k m i n 0 on the other hand if π k e k changes sign somewhere within the range k k m i n k m a x the condition π k e k m a x 0 provides an indication of the range of wavenumbers over which the cascade of ke is able to overcome the direction in which ke is fluxing through the boundaries with this in mind estimates of π k e versus k for g3 in the case of one way and two way nesting are shown in fig 8g and fig 8h respectively for both the free run and 4d var solutions 2 2 the net surface flux of ke at the open boundaries due to the inertial accelerations is given by π k e k m i n while there is considerable variation in π k e k m i n through time there is most often a net flux of ke out of the g3 domain at the boundaries not shown however during the free run there are some short periods characterized by large fluxes of ke into g3 and these tend to dominate the ensemble estimate of π k e k m i n therefore for ease of presentation the boundary fluxes π k e k m i n are not shown in figs 8g and 8h figs 8g and 8h both indicate that π k e k changes sign at k 2 π 3 5 1 0 2 km 1 i e a horizontal scale 29 km and π k e k 0 for k 2 π 3 5 1 0 2 km 1 with a peak value close to the break point in the spectral slope discussed above i e near k 2 π 0 1 km 1 since we expect π k e k m a x 0 ke must be accumulating in the near surface circulation at scales shorter than 29 km due to nonlinearity in other words there is a forward cascade of ke in part of wavenumber range in both the free run and the 4d var estimates which is the opposite of what is expected for 2dqg turbulence conversely for k 2 π 3 5 1 0 2 km 1 the spectral transfer function π k e k is generally negative however since in general π k e k m i n 0 due to non zero fluxes of ke at the g3 open boundaries we cannot unambiguously attribute the condition π k e k 0 to an inverse cascade since π k e k here may simply be a consequence of ke fluxing out of the domain over a range of wavenumbers the larger amplitude of π k e k for the 4d var estimates compared to the free run note the rescaling used in figs 8g and 8h for the latter is consistent with the difference in amplitude of the wave number spectra in figs 8a and 8d as noted above the ratio of ke and buoyancy variance can also provide clues about the possible dynamical regime fig 8i shows the ke to buoyancy variance ratio versus k in the case of two way nesting the one way nesting is similar in both cases the ratio is relatively constant over much of the spectrum until k 2 π 0 1 km 1 which corresponds to the peak of the spectral transfer function in fig 8h the region of constant ratio is reminiscent of sqg where an inverse ke energy cascade would be expected at odds with figs 8g and 8h furthermore the expected ke spectral slope for sqg is proportional to k 5 3 which is inconsistent with fig 8h while the spectral analyses of fig 8 indicate that the surface circulation in g3 is not described by one of the canonical cases discussed earlier we should probably not place too much importance on this given that the g3 circulations are strongly forced subject to non conservative open boundary fluxes of variance and are far from being isotropic and homogeneous cf fig 7 as the assumptions underlying the aforementioned canonical spectral slopes demand here we note only that the variance in the nested circulation is enhanced at all scales by data assimilation and that the direction of the ke cascade within the inertial range at the submesoscale in g3 is not affected by the data assimilation procedure our findings are somewhat at odds with the arguments set forth by sandery and sakov 2017 hereafter s17 who reasoned that data assimilation at submesoscales could lead to a deterioration of the circulation estimates at the larger mesoscales in their study s17 explored data assimilation in models of the east australia current a subtropical western boundary current with horizontal resolutions of 10 km and 2 5 km where they argued that an inverse energy cascade from the smallest resolved scales would lead to a deterioration of the circulation at larger scales in s17 however the inverse energy cascade is argued based on a presupposed assumption about the possible canonical turbulent regime present however as shown above the circulation may not necessarily behave in a canonical way in addition the highest horizontal resolution of 2 5 km considered by s17 would be expected to only marginally resolve the largest submesoscale features if at all given that the effective resolution of such a model would more likely be 10 km i e approximately four times the grid resolution see haltiner and williams 1980 in the experiments presented in our study the horizontal resolution of g3 is 0 8 km significantly higher than that considered by s17 as noted above we find that the submesoscale circulation of g3 is generally characterized by a forward cascade of ke at the surface for scales shorter than 29 km indicating that errors in the near surface circulation estimates below this scale would move to smaller scales not larger scales indeed as argued by mcwilliams 2016 one would ultimately expect a forward cascade of energy via secondary instabilities and fronts to ever smaller scales where dissipation must eventually occur nonetheless figs 8g and 8h do perhaps hint at a possible inverse cascade of ke for scales larger than 29 km which is consistent with the arguments set forth by s17 although as discussed above the non conservative property of the g3 open boundary domain does not allow us to unambiguously identify π k e k 0 with an inverse cascade the elevated levels of variance evident in fig 8 only persist while data assimilation is in place if data assimilation is terminated the variance returns to the same level as the free run this is demonstrated in fig 9 which shows log10 of the ratio of the g3 surface ke spectra of the two way nested 4d var analyses and free run versus wave number for each analysis cycle for the case where data assimilation is performed every cycle fig 9a and where data assimilation is terminated on 13 june fig 9b within the scale range characterized by the forward energy cascade of fig 8h the kinetic energy returns to the level of the free run i e log 10 of the ke ratio 0 after 15 days 4 1 3 open boundary discontinuities in two way nested 4d var the one potentially significant detrimental issue that can develop during two way nested 4d var is discontinuities at the grid open boundaries in the analysis increments the most egregious example identified during the total period considered here is illustrated in fig 10 for the two way nested 4d var cycle spanning the interval 16 19 june 2015 discontinuities if present develop in the increment fields at the beginning of the 4d var analysis window this is illustrated in fig 10a which shows a close up view of the g1 sst analysis near the g2 boundary for 16 june although discontinuities in other state vector fields are also present at the same time not shown a significant discontinuity in sst is evident near a where the circulation from g1 enters g2 however the discontinuities quickly dissipate and by the end of the assimilation cycle on 19 june the sst and other state vector fields are smooth as shown in fig 10b and there is no evidence of discontinuities at the g2 boundaries this aspect of 4d var in two way nested models has been discussed by simon et al 2011 they propose a solution to the problem by adding a smoothness constraint to the cost function 3 similar to the conventional approach commonly used in optimal control problems e g bertsekas 1982 while such techniques warrant further investigation in the roms 4d var system we do not view the discontinuous nature of the state vector fields at the beginning of the analysis cycle as a significant impediment recall that 4d var acts in much the same way as a smoother by assimilating observations over some past time window up to the current time therefore it is the state vector at the end of the 4d var window that is the most relevant in many applications since this represents the best estimate of the ocean state at the current time for example the state estimate at this time would be used as the initial condition for an ocean forecast thus the smoothness of the state vector fields that is naturally re established by the end of the assimilation window by dynamic adjustment during the 4d var cycle can be considered an inherent form of dynamical smoothing constraint while the example of fig 10 focuses on discontinuities that develop at the g1 g2 boundary similar issues can develop at the g2 g3 boundary although we found these discontinuities to be typically less obvious and less frequent wavenumber spectra computed at the end of each 4d var cycle following the action of the inherent dynamical smoothing in g3 are indistinguishable from those in fig 8 not shown indicating that the presence of initial time discontinuities does not introduce significant high wave number variance 4 2 downscaling and upscaling as discussed in section 1 data assimilation in nested grid configurations is one possible approach for downscaling regional ocean analyses and for making more effective use of high resolution observations such as those from the pioneer array however the potential also exists for information to be transferred upscale within the nested system in this section we explore the flow of information between grids by quantifying the impact that each observation has on circulation indices in the examples considered here we evaluate the impact of the observations on the increments of cross shelf transport at two different locations the first location considered coincides with the pioneer array and takes the form of cross shelf transport across a section of the 200 m isobath shown in figs 5c and 5f which passes through the middle of the array this section was chosen because it has also been studied extensively by l20 l21a and l21b specifically we consider the mab transport across this section in the g3 grid as in fig 3 if we denote by i m a b the cross shelf transport across the g3 section averaged over a 3 day 4d var cycle then i m a b x h t n 1 n x n where x n denotes the state vector at time step n and n is the number of time steps spanning the assimilation window here h represents a vector with all zero elements except those that correspond to u and v that define the normal component of velocity along the section throughout the water column in g3 the non zero elements take the form h i β i a i n where β i are the projection coefficients that locally define the normal component of velocity and a i are the appropriate grid cell areas along the 200 m isobath section following the approach of langland and baker 2004 the change in i m a b due to assimilating the data is given by 5 δ i m a b i m a b x a i m a b x b d t k t i m a b x where k b h t hb h t r 1 is the gain matrix cf eq 1 the last approximate equality in 5 results from a 1st order taylor expansion of i m a b x and the operation g k t i m a b x can be achieved by one integration of the adjoint model to evaluate i m a b x and one integration of the tangent linear model to evaluate k t see l20 for practical details multiplication by the matrix inverse hb h t r 1 is performed using the archived conjugate gradient vectors employed to minimize 3 during each 4d var cycle the resulting dot product δ i m a b d t g j 1 m d j g j can then be parsed according to the contribution of each observation j to the increment δ i m a b in the case of multiple outer loops as here 5 is formally applicable to only the 1st outer loop however in the case where the 1st outer loop accounts for most of the increment trémolet 2008 demonstrates that only the 1st outer loop needs to be considered the derivative i m a b x represents the sensitivity of i m a b to variations in all elements of x in space and time fig 3 shows i m a b x with respect to the sst components of x on 22 july 2015 for the 4d var cycle spanning the interval 22 25 july 2015 for both the one way and two way nested cases as discussed in section 3 1 fig 3 clearly illustrates how information can propagate between grids for these two different nesting strategies the operation k t hb h t r 1 hb in 5 propagates i m a b x cf fig 3 forward through time samples the resulting tangent linear fields at the observation locations and times and weights them by the inverse expected total error variance hb h t r time series of the i m a b cross shelf transport index are shown in figs 11a and 11c for the background and the two outer loop state estimates for each 4d var cycle for the one way and two way nested cases the corresponding transport from the free run without data assimilation is also shown for reference in both cases data assimilation modifies the cross shelf transport index significantly compared to the free run however during each data assimilation cycle fig 11 shows that 4d var makes relatively modest changes to i m a b which indicates that after the data assimilation system has settled down large potentially disruptive adjustments are not being made furthermore the cost functions of fig 6 suggest that the majority of the fit of the model to the observations occurs during the 1st outer loop thus we can use 5 to quantify the extent to which the observations on each nested grid contribute to the transport increments on g3 however since 5 is predicated on a tangent linear approximation it is essential first to establish the veracity of the approach in the present system to this end figs 11b and 11d also show time series of δ i m a b computed from the linear approximation in 5 and computed directly from the nonlinear model solutions x a and x b clearly the degree of correspondence between these two estimates of δ i m a b is excellent during most cycles which gives us confidence in the reliability of the observation impacts derived from 5 the root mean square rms contributions of each type of observation to δ i m a b aka observation impact are shown in fig 12 for the one way and two way nested cases the rms impacts are shown for all three grids combined labeled all and for each grid separately for all three grids combined velocity observations contribute the most to δ i m a b for both the one way and two way nested cases recall that in the case of one way nesting data from some platforms are assimilated multiple times if they lie within the rectangular annulus ra2 or in g3 cf fig 1 although the data values assimilated in the different grids may not be identical because the formation of super observations depends on the grid resolution thus in the case of one way nesting fig 12a shows that velocity observations in g2 have almost as much impact on δ i m a b as velocity observations in g3 these data come primarily from the pioneer array moorings in the case of g1 the grid resolution is too coarse to resolve the pioneer mooring array in any meaningful way so these data do not appear as significant in fig 12a instead the g1 in situ temperature and salinity observations mainly from gliders and satellite sst are more substantial players the impact of satellite altimetry on δ i m a b is very small in the case of two way nesting all observations that fall within g3 are assimilated while only observations that fall within the annulus regions ra1 and ra2 see fig 1 are assimilated in g1 and g2 respectively thus in this case fig 12b indicates that most of the impact on δ i m a b is associated with observations within the g3 grid however there are some significant contributions to δ i m a b from in situ salinity observations from the ra1 region of g1 as in the one way nesting case the impact of satellite altimetry on δ i m a b is very small fig 12 indicates that information from the observations can be downscaled in both one way and two way 4d var nesting strategies although in the case of one way nesting there is redundant information from the observations in the overlapping grid regions to explore the extent to which information from observations assimilated in the higher resolution grids can be upscaled to inform the circulation at lower resolution and or larger scales we also considered the transport across a section of the 200 m isobath in the southern mid atlantic bight smab hereafter denoted by i s m a b in this case i s m a b is defined only on grid g1 and the location of the section is shown in figs 5a and 5d this approximately corresponds to where the pioneer array will be relocated beginning in 2024 time series of i s m a b for the one way and two way nested cases are shown in fig 13 for the free run background and 4d var analyses again data assimilation causes significant modifications to the transport in both cases compared to the free run although the transport increments are generally smaller than for i m a b the rms impact of the different types of observations is shown in fig 14 in aggregate and for the individual grids and comparison with fig 12 confirms that the rms transport increments are generally smaller than those in i m a b fig 14a shows that on g1 in situ salinity observations have the largest impact on δ i s m a b while on g2 and g3 it is velocity observations that have the largest impact fig 14b indicates that in the case of two way nesting observations from g1 and g3 typically have the largest impact on δ i s m a b specifically the in situ velocity and temperature observations the sst observations typically have largest impact during the first few cycles in april when the 4d var system has not yet reached an equilibrium not shown as in the case of the mab transport increment the impact of satellite altimetry on δ i s m a b is very small the impact of observations in g3 on δ i s m a b for both the one way and two way cases indicates there is a transfer of information upscale from the observations during 4d var for both nesting strategies as discussed on l20 l21a and l21b the observation impacts depend on several factors that include a the background circulation x b which of course is highly resolution dependent across the three grids b the background error covariance b and c the observation error covariance r as described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the parameters used to compute b and r were not the same across all three grids since different error statistics are appropriate for each grid as such some of the changes in the relative impact of the various observing system components on the three grids will depend on variations in the error covariances the observation error covariance matrix r is generally dominated by errors of representativeness which are challenging to estimate a priori as noted earlier we have used the same choices as those of l20 l21a and l21b for their quasi one way nested assimilation experiments specifically for the in situ temperature observations the standard deviations assumed for r are similar across all three grids and range from 0 6 c on g1 to 0 4 c on g2 and g3 however as discussed in l21a and l21b an a posteriori analysis of the innovation statistics following desroziers et al 2005 suggests that these standard deviations should be closer to 1 c for in situ salinity observations the a priori observation errors were assumed to be 0 2 on g1 although the a posteriori innovation statistics indicate that a more appropriate choice is 0 4 which is the value used for both g2 and g3 similarly for velocity measurements the standard deviation of the observation error on g1 was assumed to be 0 6 m s 1 for hf radar surface current estimates and 0 3 m s 1 for moorings these values were adjusted downwards to 0 1 m s 1 for hf radar observations and 0 04 m s 1 for moorings for g2 and g3 and are more in line with the a posteriori innovation statistics rather than attempt to refine the choice of r for the present study we intentionally used the same r as l20 l21a and l21b to provide a direct comparison with the performance of their related quasi one way nested system that being the case the observation impact calculations for δ i m a b presented in fig 12 are consistent with the findings of l21a and l21b as noted above the larger impact of salinity observations on δ i m a b in g1 is consistent with the lower observation errors on this grid similarly the larger impact of velocity observations on δ i m a b in g3 is partly associated with the reduction in observation error assigned to these data compared to g1 and g2 however the detailed analysis of l21b also suggests that the larger impact of the velocity observations collected at the pioneer array mooring sites can be attributed to a reduction in the horizontal length scale resolved by the g3 grid despite the inhomogeneous and non geostrophic nature of the submesoscale circulation the expectations of quasi geostrophic adjustment theory i e temperton 1973 gill 1982 appear to explain the increasing importance of velocity observations in constraining the circulation at smaller scales due the rapid decrease in the rossby radius of deformation from 20 km to 5 km moving inshore across the shelf 5 summary and conclusions a new nested 4d var capability has been developed for roms a popular community ocean model and is described here for the first time the strategy adopted for 4d var is demonstrated for one way and two way nesting in roms configured for the mid atlantic bight where the highest resolution grid targets the nsf ooi pioneer array it was found that 4d var generally performs well under both one way and two way nesting strategies furthermore the fit of the 4d var background to the observations is usually superior on all grids to that of a free running model demonstrating that the model is able to retain information from the observations from one cycle to the next the ability of the model to retain information is generally scale dependent performing best for the quasi geostrophic and mesoscale circulations of grids g1 and g2 whereas the highly nonlinear submesoscale environment of grid g3 presents more of a challenge the most appropriate choice of nesting strategy employed by future users will most likely depend on the region considered and the problem to be addressed while roms supports both one and two way nesting the two way nesting is generally more computationally demanding than one way nesting as currently implemented because the additional interpolation step from a high resolution grid to the next lower resolution grid that must be performed at each time step represents a bottleneck for parallel computations in light of this one way nesting may be preferable if computing resources are limited or constrained by operational constraints however while two way nesting may be the more intellectually appealing strategy for nested grid applications the authors are not aware of any study that has demonstrated that two way nesting yields a more accurate analysis forecast system than a one way nested approach in ocean applications this is a topic that requires more investigation data assimilation was also found to energize the circulation compared to the free running model as evidenced by an increased surface kinetic energy relative enstrophy and buoyancy variance i e available potential energy the increase is particularly marked within the inertial range of the horizontal wavenumber spectra in the case of kinetic energy and relative enstrophy in addition data assimilation does not modify the fundamental character of the kinetic energy cascade at the submesoscale on the highest resolution grid however if data assimilation is terminated then in the inertial range the energy returns to the level of the free running model within 2 weeks the reason for the elevated variance in the 4d var analyses presented here requires further investigation dynamical imbalances at the beginning of each data assimilation window so called initialization shock can excite inertia gravity waves igws which could account for some of increase in variance however the variance remains elevated throughout the 3 day assimilation window even though igws typically dissipate significantly within a day or two e g raghukumar et al 2015 while methods exist for suppressing igws resulting from initialization shock such as digital filters gauthier and thépaut 2001 igws can be coupled to the submesoscale circulation and it can be difficult to separate igws from submesoscale features mcwilliams 2016 therefore distinguishing between igws resulting from initialization shocks and igw like submesoscale flows during any initialization procedure will likely be very challenging and deserves further attention elevated variance in the 4d var analyses will also result from information provided the observations similar increases in eddy kinetic energy following data assimilation have also been documented in other applications of roms 4d var for example neveu et al 2016 hereafter n16 found that the kinetic energy of the offshore mesoscale eddy field associated with the california current system is similarly elevated following 4d var data assimilation n16 found that the development of eddies via baroclinic instability and the subsequent westward propagation and subduction farther offshore was considerably enhanced by 4d var the conclusion from n16 then is that the elevation of eddy kinetic energy due to data assimilation is associated with a data informed enhancement of the dynamical processes responsible for eddy generation and ocean variance it seems likely therefore that just as in the study of n16 the increase of circulation variance across all three nested grids in the mab configuration considered here will be similarly data informed by the observations in other words the circulation of the roms free run may not be as energetic as the observations indicate there are a several possible factors that may contribute to the general deficiency in the free run circulation variance which include the choice of horizontal and vertical resolution short comings in ocean mixing parameterizations and forcing strategies for stand alone ocean models that neglect important coupled air sea interaction processes while the extent to which each of these factors limit the variance of the model circulation clearly requires further investigation our main aim here is to demonstrate the feasibility of performing 4d var data assimilation across multiple nested grids and across a range of scales and dynamical regimes and to demonstrate the utility of the new roms system the transfer of information across grids and scales during data assimilation was demonstrated by computing the contribution of each observation aka observation impact to the 4d var analysis increments in cross shelf transport at the shelf break at two different locations the observation impact calculations indicate that the information from the observing network can move both downscale and upscale demonstrating that data assimilation within nested grids can take full advantage of high resolution observing networks such as the nsf ooi pioneer array considered here two outstanding issues with the current roms nested 4d var system deserve further investigation first discontinuities in the 4d var state estimates can develop at the grid open boundaries at the beginning of each assimilation window this problem could be potentially alleviated by adding a term to the 4d var cost functions 2 and 3 that acts as a smoothness constraint by penalizing the state vector field gradients simon et al 2011 have discussed some practical approaches based on these ideas in a nested shallow water model nonetheless the initial time state vector discontinuities that develop near the grid boundaries are quickly ameliorated by dynamic adjustment of the model fields so that by the end of the 4d var data assimilation window appropriate dynamical balances of the state vector fields have been restored since the state estimate at the end of the 4d var window represents the circulation estimate at the current time we view the discontinuities in the increments at the initial time as a secondary concern however further investigation is warranted secondly in the present 4d var formulation no attempt has been made to account for correlations between errors in the background fields on the three overlapping nested grids such correlations will clearly be present given the relationship between the state vectors of each grid experience gained from multigrid approaches to data assimilation offer potential ways forward to address this issue e g robert et al 2005 attempts to ameliorate the

23757,this study uses three simulations exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 from a nested basin scale regional eddy permitting indian ocean model forced with core ii inter annual forcing to study the impact of initial and lateral open boundary conditions on bay of bengal bob circulation it also evaluates the state of art reanalysis products from godas soda3 and oras5 sensitivity studies using more realistic initial and lateral boundary conditions suggest that accurate initial conditions are essential for realistic simulation of the mean and the variability of temperature and salinity in the upper ocean we also show that accurate lateral boundary conditions are also essential for realistic basin scale simulations for the upper ocean circulation in the bob the model captured well the observed seasonal and inter annual variability of salinity in the bob the comparison of surface currents from the regional simulations and reanalysis products with oscar analyses shows exp 3 with improved initial and lateral boundary conditions to be the closest among all three the summer monsoon current is also most realistic in exp 3 while the reanalysis products are unable to reproduce the bob coastal current structure and magnitude this study also reports the first evidence of a coastally trapped narrow boundary current at thermocline depth along the eastern boundary of bob the presence of this boundary current is noticed in all three regional solutions while most prominent in exp 3 and nearly absent in the reanalysis products the salt transport across 8 n shows large seasonal and inter annual variations during 2003 2009 in the best simulation exp 3 with standard deviation ranging between 77 150 psu m3 s up to 1000 m depth apart from summer and winter monsoon periods which show the intrusion of salt into bob from the equatorial indian ocean in the upper layers we found significant salt transport at deeper depths 300 1500 m as well the integrated inter annual variations of the seasonal salt flux at different depths across 8 n show presence of strong seasonal cycle in the upper layer 0 200 m however the seasonality is most prominent in the upper 50 m the intra seasonal variation in the deeper layers are more prominent as compared to the upper layer keywords bay of bengal nested regional ocean model salt flux salt transport reanalysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sea surface salinity sss affects sea water density which in turn impact ocean circulation and climate subsurface salinity particularly in the upper ocean up to 200 m also controls the density stratification and hence changes in circulation capotondi et al 2012 therefore accurate simulations of sss and subsurface salinity are essential for a better understanding of the circulation in the mixed layer and deeper ocean vialard and delecluse 1998 durand et al 2004 although recent models have included freshwater forcing they have had difficulties in reproducing the observed features of the salinity distribution especially in the bay of bengal bob and the southeastern arabian sea seas han et al 2001 deboyermontégutet et al 2007 durand et al 2007 kurian and vinayachandran 2007 the sss simulation errors are as large as 2 3 psu over northern bob murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 han et al 2001 han and mccreary 2001 deboyermontégutet et al 2007 although the upper ocean heat budget studies are available with reasonable accuracy of 10 w m2 bradley and weller 1995 the quantification of salt or equivalently freshwater fw flux is much more difficult than that of heat flux this is mainly due to the different spatial scales of the atmospheric input functions such as solar radiation and precipitation over large oceanic areas the radiative heating of the ocean during daytime is relatively uniform on the other hand the fw input is closely coupled to the existence of atmospheric convection cells which are relatively small in size and irregularly distributed in space and have no clear diurnal signal like the heat flux salinity in the north indian ocean nio is strongly influenced by river inflows in bob the influx of low salinity pacific water throughflow in the indonesian archipelago and the inflow of saltier water from the persian gulf and red sea bob also receives a large quantity of fw local rainfall and river discharge during the summer monsoon season june september sengupta et al 2006 in contrast excessive evaporation and uneven distribution of precipitation and river discharge make the arabian sea as saltier than bob under steady state conditions fw from bob should be exported to as and salt water from as to bob the inter ocean exchange and transport of fw have been studied in detail by gordon 2001 and wijffels 2001 many previous studies have shown the locations of inter basin exchange of fw and salt between bob and as nyadjro et al 2010 2011 jensen 2001 2003 jensen et al 2016 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 sanchez franks et al 2019 sheehan et al 2020 however the details on the magnitude of the freshwater transport and its seasonal and inter annual variability are not as well known recent hycom model simulations jensen et al 2016 show a large persistent flow of high salinity water from the equatorial indian ocean into bob during the northeast monsoon but weaker than during the southwest monsoon jain et al 2017 have shown that three high salinity water masses i e arabian sea high salinity water ashsw persian gulf water pgw and red sea water rsw are advected into bob by the summer monsoon current smc which is a deep current extending to a depth of about 1000 m vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 sanchez franks et al 2019 sheehan et al 2020 sengupta et al 2006 have shown that fw from bob river runoff reaches remote regions of as it also crosses the equator in the eastern bob and subsequently flows across the southern tropical indian ocean several studies also show that low salinity surface water from northern bob flows down the east coast of india in october december through the east india coastal current eicc shetye et al 1996 prasanna kumar et al 2004 gopalakrishna et al 2005 rao and sivakumar 2003 modeling experiments show bob water enters the tropical equatorial indian ocean eio to the east and south in the second half of the year crossing the equator mainly in the east jensen 2003 miyama et al 2003 using reanalysis data nyadjro et al 2013 describe near surface horizontal salt flux in the indian ocean during 1960 2008 kantha et al 2008 studied nio circulation and its variability as well as meridional heat fluxes using a 0 5 degree resolution numerical hindcast model assimilating altimetric and sst data for the years 1993 to 2004 however they did not investigate salt fluxes in nio because at the study time remotely sensed sss was not yet available for assimilation into the model the readers are referred to this paper for a nice summary of nio circulation and relevant issues as explained in the previous section previous studies have reported that the inter basin exchange of subsurface salt transport to and from bob to seas and eio and vice versa occurs however despite the extensive studies of salt exchange between the two basins bob and as on its mean state its seasonal and inter annual variability and their frequencies are not very well known particularly in the deep ocean one of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic simulation of meridional currents in bob see kantha et al 2008 in this study to overcome this deficiency we use simulations from a nested indian ocean model developed by rahaman et al 2014 which show realistic boundary current and fw transport in bob we compare the model simulated currents and salinity with observations modeling the oceanic circulation is made difficult by the wide range of spatial scales from the rossby radius of deformation 10 to 50 km to the basin scales global ocean general circulation models ogcm require high spatial resolution to represent geostrophic eddies narrow boundary currents and flows through passages available computer resources often limit the development of high resolution global models to represent all these physical phenomena alternative option is to develop a basin scale high resolution regional models to meet this challenge with a reasonable amount of computer resource consumption griffies 2009 treguier et al 2001 however to work with a basin scale regional model open boundary conditions obcs must be applied at the lateral open boundaries which permit fluxes of mass heat momentum into and out of the model domain from an outer larger scale model e g global ogcm often called a parent model open boundaries which naturally occur in a regional model are often difficult to handle due to an inherently mathematically ill posed problem at the boundary the numerical solution near a boundary is always a superposition of outgoing and incoming waves as well as scalar and momentum fluxes which cannot be separated and there is no universally perfect scheme for open boundary conditions stevens 1991 griffies 2009 two types of lateral open boundary conditions are used in regional ocean models which are generally referred to as active or passive in the passive type the obcs are determined solely from model solution within the computational domain on the other hand in an active type data are prescribed from an external source e g a larger scale model to force the interior solution since the behavior of the model interior is rarely consistent with data prescribed at the boundary the model may become prone to errors due to under specification not enough information describing external processes is provided or over specification obc information is incompatible with interior state reader may refer marchesiello et al 2001 for a thorough discussion of the active versus passive boundaries and over vs under specification of data when the interior model solutions are determined only by the information imposed at the boundaries from outer models and interior child solutions do not affect the exterior parent solutions it is called one way nesting on the other hand if the interior solutions also affect the exterior solutions across the boundaries between the two it is called two way nesting one way nested models have been developed with great success for instance in the california current region penven et al 2006 and benguela upwelling area off the coast of namibia herzfeld et al 2011 recently two way nesting using finite difference models has gained popularity in refining solution in the regional domain e g cailleau et al 2008 jouanno et al 2008 barth et al 2005 sheng et al 2005 for a detailed review of two way nesting readers are referred to debreu and blayo 2008 one way nested approach has been adopted in the present study and obcs are prescribed from a global model solutions flather radiation condition flather 1976 has been used for the depth averaged normal velocity at the eastern and southern boundary of the indian ocean model the flow relaxation scheme of martinsen and engedahl 1987 has been used for the temperature and salinity at the boundary the details of obcs and other model configurations can be found in rahaman et al 2014 for the earth system model s or climate model s simulation accuracy in terms of hindcast or predictions on different time scales accurate initialization of ocean plays a major role the skill of climate system forecasts at the sub seasonal to seasonal s2s seasonal to inter annual s2i and seasonal to decadal s2d scales depends on the oceanic initial conditions fed into the models in particular information on the ocean s upper thermal and salinity structure alves et al 2004 balmaseda and anderson 2009 balmaseda et al 2013 2015 meehl et al 2021 halliwell et al 2011 have demonstrated that accurate ocean model initialization with respect to the upper ocean temperature and salinity density profiles along with the correct location of ocean currents and eddies is the most important factor influencing the accuracy of sst forecast by an ocean model over the northwest caribbean sea and gulf of mexico recently zhou et al 2019 have shown that the initial conditions errors occurring in the indian ocean temperature cause spring predictability barrier for el niño in the pacific ocean however to our knowledge no such studies showing the impact of ocean initial conditions on indian ocean simulations or forecasts from a forced ocean model are available hence in this study we demonstrate the impact of ocean initial conditions on bob simulation in recent times global reanalyses are available at 1 4 degree resolution based on nemo from ecmwf cmcc etc and at 1 12 degree resolution from hycom consortium and glorys12 reanalysis data set produced by mercator ocean international forecasting center verezemskaya et al 2021 lellouche et al 2018 however assimilation into global models often degrades the circulation features mercator ocean 2018 in most of these global models during ocean grid generation the bathymetry is often smoothed to avoid numerical instability as a result topography can be too deep near the coast and narrow channel can be deeper and wider than they should be for example the bathymetry used in the global model configuration in godas opened the palk strait and made it deeper which is not realistic fig 1b the coastal regions also became deeper hence the coastal circulation patterns are not realistically represented in global models in this study we used the modified bathymetry from sindhu et al 2007 in the regional model most of the ocean model configurations are based on smoothed bathymetric data sets like etopo5 and etopo2 sindhu et al 2007 have shown that these bathymetries are inaccurate in depths of less than 200 m along the coast of india they modified etopo bathymetry along the indian ocean coast by digitizing the depth contours and sounding depths less than 200 m from the hydrographic charts published by the national hydrographic office india in the present study we used this modified bathymetry fig 1a for the regional ocean model configuration the differences near the indian coast in regional and global models can be seen in fig 1a b more accurate shallow coastal bathymetry leads to significantly improved and realistic coastal circulation compared to that from global model simulations see the discussions in section 3 2 near the coast data are often sparse particularly in a basin like bob due to lack of observations often few data are assimilated in a global model hence configuration of a basin scale model with realistic bathymetry is essential recently rahaman et al 2020 have shown how the circulation patterns even in the open ocean change in the indian ocean with different bathymetries used in a suite of 16 global models we show here the improved circulation features in the regional models as compared to the state of the art reanalysis data from godas soda3 and oras5 we also show the subsurface salt transport and its interannual variability from bob to eio and vice versa along with the seasonal and inter annual variability of salt flux section 2 describes the data sets used in this study and the model configuration model results and discussion are presented in section 3 and finally summary and conclusions are provided in section 4 2 model and data we have adopted a nested multi model approach using mom4p0d mom4p1 global ocean general circulation model ogcm and a regional model of the indian ocean rahaman et al 2014 based on mom4p1 the regional model domain covers the indian ocean between 30 s and 30 n and 30 e and 120 e with a uniform horizontal resolution of 0 25 there are 50 levels in the vertical with 1 m resolution in the upper 10 m the regional model is forced by coordinated ocean reference experiments core ii inter annual data the global model uses annual river runoff but the regional model uses seasonal river runoff dai and trenberth 2002 distributed over several grid points near the river mouths into the upper 5 m of the water column more realistic simulation of north bob salinity stratification can be attributed to this refined resolution 1 m near the surface more realistic topography and the inclusion of seasonal river runoff rahaman et al 2014 the circulation and the wave propagation in the bob are more realistic in these model simulations when compared with observations rahaman et al 2014 a detailed description of the model configuration and validation can be found in rahaman et al 2014 all global ogcms suffer from excessive thermocline diffusion and hence a deeper thermocline when compared to observations rahaman et al 2020 this was also the case in the regional model which uses initial conditions from mom4p1 global ogcm rahaman et al 2014 the problem of the diffuse thermocline is rectified in a data assimilative global model ravichandran et al 2013 behringer 2007 rahaman et al 2016 2018 the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the indian national centre for ocean information services incois produce global ocean analyses reanalysis based on the global ocean data assimilation system godas this system uses a state of the art ocean general circulation model called modular ocean model mom4p0d and the 3d variational 3dvar data assimilation technique to assimilate observed temperature and salinity profiles from in situ observations argo buoy xbt etc we used incois godas reanalysis for the initial and lateral boundary conditions in the indian ocean model for this study we used the same reanalysis products based on mom4p0d as in ravichandran et al 2013 and rahaman et al 2016 in this study we demonstrate how the upper ocean simulations improved in a regional model by initializing with reanalysis data also we show that the improved lateral boundary conditions also affect the bob simulation we performed three indian ocean regional model simulations 1 exp 1 using initial and lateral boundary conditions from 1 mom4p1 global model rahaman et al 2014 2 exp 2 using initial conditions for 2003 from incois godas reanalysis ravichandran et al 2013 rahaman et al 2016 but lateral boundary conditions from 1 mom4p1 global model rahaman et al 2014 3 exp 3 using both initial and lateral boundary conditions from incois godas reanalysis ravichandran et al 2013 rahaman et al 2016 the details of the boundary conditions applied can be found in rahaman et al 2014 in exp 1 we used both initial and boundary conditions from mom4p1 and in exp 2 we just changed the initial conditions of mom4p1 with godas reanalysis but used same lateral boundary conditions of exp 1 so that comparison of exp 1 and exp 2 will give the impact of initial conditions in exp3 we also replaced the lateral boundary conditions with godas reanalysis hence comparison of exp 2 and exp 3 gives the impact of lateral boundary conditions temperature and salinity from argo profiling floats were used to ascertain the impact of initial and boundary conditions on temperature and salinity observed in the regional model the observed gridded subsurface temperature and salinity data from coriolis ocean dataset for reanalysis cora were also used to determine the seasonal and inter annual variability of temperature and salinity and geostrophic currents the geostrophic currents for both observations and model simulations were computed using dynamic height the comparisons were then made with the 100 500 m depth average current we used the latest version cora5 2 cabanes et al 2013 szekely et al 2019 for this study the cora dataset is distributed by copernicus marine and environment service https resources marine copernicus eu products this dataset used many types of in situ temperature and salinity measurements with a maximal sampling including high frequency profilers argo ctd surface and sub surface time series thermosalinographs and surface drifters most of these cora profiles are collected by the coriolis data center the cora 5 2 dataset is an incremental version of the previous cora datasets covering the period 1950 to the present we also used aviso monthly gridded sea level anomaly data to show the presence of eddies in bob to evaluate the circulation features of regional model simulations in the bob we used the most recent version of 1 4 degree ocean surface currents analyses real time oscar surface currents bonjean and lagerloef 2002 we also used 1 4 degree surface currents from diagnostic model scud based on a simple diagnostic model which combines aviso maps of sea level anomalies and quikscat surface winds and is tuned to best reproduce trajectories of real drifters drogued at 15 m depth maximenko and hafner 2010 simple ocean data assimilation ocean sea ice reanalysis soda is the most widely used reanalysis data since late 20th century carton et al 2000a 2000b carton and giese 2008 recent soda version 3 release now uses gfdl mom5 sis numerics at finer 1 4 1 4 50 level resolution 28 km at the equator down to 10 km at polar latitudes similar to the ocean component of the gfdl cm2 5 coupled climate model and includes an active sea ice component the optimal interpolation filter has also been augmented relative to previous releases with bias correction to reduce bias in estimates of long term trends of variables such as heat content carton et al 2018 we used soda3 to compare the bob circulation features with iom simulations exp 1 2 3 we also included 1 1 resolution oras5 reanalysis products produced by ecmwf using the estimates of the state of the global ocean from the operational system ocean5 zuo et al 2017 2019 the general expression for the transport or flux f of a property is the integral of the property p times velocity v over the area da the area is a cross section i e the width of the current times its depth f p v da here in this study we used p s where s is the salinity in psu finally a we show the schematic of major currents along the indian coast during summer and winter seasons in fig 1c adapted from bharti et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of initial and boundary conditions on temperature and salinity the temperature and salinity determine the density and hence the ocean structure and dynamics cooper 1988 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 have shown that salinity plays an important role in the model dynamics and thermodynamics hence a realistic model simulated circulation requires realistic simulations of ocean mean temperature and salinity and their variability as discussed in the previous section three different experiments are performed to determine the impact of initial and boundary conditions using regional model solutions to see how well the model simulates temperature and salinity with respect to observations we have used individual argo temperature and salinity profiles as well as gridded data fig 2a shows the upper ocean mean 2006 2009 collocated and concurrent temperature from the three different experiments with argo profiling float observations the trajectory of the argo float used for the co location can be found in the subset of each panel the magenta color profile is from exp 1 the cyan colored profile shows the temperature from exp 2 which used warm start 1 january 2003 with initial conditions from godas reanalysis and lateral boundary conditions from the inter annual global model solutions 1992 2009 based on mom4p1 same lateral boundary conditions of exp 1 it can be seen that the large thermocline bias in the exp 1 magenta lines is drastically reduced and the profiles are closer to argo observations in exp 2 cyan line it is worth mentioning that for exp 2 we used godas reanalysis data to initialize whereas exp 1 used solutions from a non data assimilative global model see rahaman et al 2014 for details this demonstrates that better initial conditions have improved model simulations furthermore when lateral open boundary conditions from godas reanalysis are also used exp 3 the simulated temperature blue line almost matches the argo observations black line it is worth mentioning that even 3 years after initialization the thermocline is well maintained in the model and it persists even until the 7th year the 0 500 m depth mean bias in exp 1 is 2 1 c which is reduced to 1 1 c in exp 2 and only 0 41 c in exp 3 fig 2b shows the monthly standard deviation std in the upper ocean 0 500 m similar results can be seen in the std of temperature as well the argo observed variability black line in terms of std is most accurately captured by exp 3 the highest observed std values of 2 3 c at 90 m depth is almost reproduced in exp 3 2 0 c blue line the 70 110 m depth averaged std in argo observations is 2 2 c while it is 1 78 c 1 79 c and 1 92 c for exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 respectively however the root mean square deviation rmsd value increased slightly in exp 3 0 85 c as compared to exp 2 0 81 c and exp 1 0 78 c this slight increase may be due to the bias present in 2006 in the original godas reanalysis data the co located and concurrent mean salinity from the three experiments in the upper ocean are shown in fig 2c the observation black line shows salinity increases gradually in the upper ocean until a depth of 150 m and afterward it is almost constant exp 1 magenta shows a slight underestimation of salinity in the upper layers 150 m and a slight overestimation in the deeper layers deeper than 150 m compared to observations however although experiments with godas initial as well as boundary conditions exp 2 and exp 3 show somewhat lower salinity values in the upper ocean to 150 m they follow the observed argo mean values quite well below 150 m the freshening in the upper 100 m may be due to higher vertical resolution of the model in the upper 100 m the model has 23 levels starting from 0 5 m up to 20 m the resolution is 1 3 m thereafter it slowly increases to 10 m at 103 m depth in contrast the argo profiling float has uniform resolution of 5 m in 0 100 m depth and 10 m between 100 500 m all the three experiments miss some of the structure in the upper 75 m for temperature and salinity when compared with argo observations this could also be due to the refined vertical resolution in the model as compared to argo observations the mean bias in exp 1 is 0 01 psu which is slightly saltier when compared to argo observations however with godas initial and boundary conditions it becomes slightly fresh with mean bias of 0 11 psu and 0 09 psu in exp 2 and exp 3 respectively salinity bias in exp 1 in the thermocline region 150 500 m depth is 0 08 psu which is significant for the spiciness variability the same for exp 2 and 3 is 0 01 psu the spiciness variability in the thermocline is believed to be an important subsurface ocean process affecting sea surface temperature sst and climate variability over the tropical indian ocean li and wang 2014 the observed salinity variability represented by the std is also picked up by all three experiments and the solutions with godas initial and boundary conditions closely follow the observed variability fig 2d the argo std is 0 07 psu exp 2 and 3 show 0 09 psu which is the closest to the observed value in contrast to exp 1 which shows slightly higher std value of 0 11 psu the rmsd value is also lowest in exp 3 0 09 psu compared to exp 2 0 1 psu and exp 1 0 12 psu this is the first co located and concurrent salinity comparison of the impact of initial and lateral boundary conditions in a regional model simulations of bob wakelin et al 2009 have shown the impact of initial and open boundary conditions for a northeast atlantic implementation of the proudman oceanographic laboratory coastal ocean model system polcoms from woa observations and two large scale operational ocean models forecasting ocean assimilation model foam uk met office and the navy coastal ocean model ncom us naval research laboratory they show that in the shelf region after 15 months of model integration the effect of the temperature and salinity initial conditions was negligible and the model dynamics and surface forcing play a dominant role however in the deep regions ncom boundary conditions resulted in smaller rms errors in the sst simulations than the foam boundary conditions these results further confirm the finding in bob in order to see the seasonal behavior of the model solutions we show the comparison of seasonal average co located and concurrent upper ocean temperature from the three experiments with argo observations during 2007 2008 fig 3 the trajectory of the argo used for the co location can be found in fig 3b on seasonal scale it also shows similar results for the mean fig 3a in the mean plot the exp 3 closely follows the argo observations but in 2007 08 there is a slight warm bias in the thermocline in exp 3 in summer july aug and fall sept oct it should however be noted that the trajectory of argo float was confined to the southwest bob in order to see whether the same results hold for the entire basin as well we compared the subsurface temperature from orca5 2 gridded observations see figs 5 7 seasonal comparison of subsurface salinity along the argo trajectory in 2007 2008 are shown in fig 4 in contrast to temperature which shows that the impact of initial and boundary conditions is uniform in different seasons the salinity comparison shows the impact is most prominent during summer and fall the observed salinity profile is well reproduced in exp 2 and exp 3 during summer and fall except in the upper 100 m in which the model shows fresher values compared to argo profiling float observation this could be due to the higher vertical resolution in model than in argo observations same as for the temperature during winter and spring the salinity simulation shows degradation in the thermocline region in exp 2 and exp 3 when compared to exp 1 the degradation in winter spring vs summer fall could be due to the deficiencies in the forcing fields or could be related to the model itself and its inability to capture physical processes in winter spring vs summer fall for 2007 2008 however below the thermocline salinity simulations in exp 2 and exp 3 are almost reproduced in all seasons seasonal monsoon rain and river runoff create shallow pools of freshwater in the north bob in summer gopalakrishna et al 2002 vinayachandran and kurian 2007 and autumn in situ observations in the north bob sengupta et al 2006 shetye et al 1996 often show an intense shallow halocline at 5 20 m in depth our model simulations reproduce this observed strong salinity stratification in the upper layers of the northern bob however the argo profiling float is unable to capture this due to its coarse vertical resolution 5 m between 5 100 m 10 m between 100 500 m and 25 m between 500 2000 m model reproduced the salinity profiles well when compared with high vertical resolution specially operated individual argo float data as well as ctd observation figure not shown the comparisons above were made with a single profile data in order to see the robustness of this comparison we used the latest gridded subsurface temperature and salinity observations from cora5 2 fig 5 shows comparisons of model simulated mean temperature and salinity from the three experiments to cora5 2 observations in the northern bob results in the northern bob are very much similar to those in fig 2 but the impact of initial and boundary conditions is more prominent in the temperature fields than in salinity fig 5a b godas assimilates actual salinity and temperature profiles we used the initial conditions from 2003 in 2003 the number of salinity profiles over the northern bob are fewer than the number of temperature profiles that goes into the godas analysis hence the simulated reanalysis temperature fields are more accurate than the salinity fields this is reflected in regional model solutions also from fig 5 it is difficult to judge whether the large warm bias in exp 1 in 200 800 m depth is uniform or has interannual variation therefore we present the depth vs time plots of the difference between the three model simulations and the observed gridded temperature showing interannual variations over northern bob in fig 6 it can be seen that large warm bias of 3 c in the thermocline in exp 1 is uniform throughout the entire time period this bias is reduced to 1 c in exp 2 and further to only 0 5 c in exp 3 in all three experiments the upper ocean 0 100 m is cooler by 0 5 1 c this cooler bias could be due to the biases in the core ii forcing fields used or in accurate mixed layer mixing scheme rahaman and ravichandran 2013 rahaman et al 2020 all three experiments show fresher waters in the upper ocean 0 200 m fig 7 the subsurface bias is within 0 1 psu in all these experiments fig 7 as explained above the improvement in salinity is not as significant as temperature in exp 2 and 3 this could again may be due to the salinity bias in the original godas reanalysis data itself or forcing fields or deficiencies in model physics it is clear that the salinity bias is the lowest in exp 3 therefore we look further at the salinity bias in exp 3 in a smaller region fig 8 shows the depth vs time plots of model minus observation averaged over 80 92 e and in two sections one over central bob r1 12 16 n fig 8a and another over southern bob r2 6 10 n fig 8b see fig 1a for the geographical location of these regions the upper 40 m shows that the model overestimates salinity by 0 4 0 6 psu in central bob fig 8a below this layer model salinity is fresher by 0 2 psu w r t gridded observations in the southern bob the model shows freshening compared to observations sharma et al 2010 have reported model simulated sss with root mean square error rmse of 0 4 psu when compared with rama research moored array for african asian australian monsoon analysis and prediction buoy observations however their results are from the equatorial indian ocean buoy this low bias of 0 2 0 6 psu at seasonal and inter annual time scales has not been reported in any of the earlier model simulations in the bob deboyermontégutet et al 2007 sharma et al 2010 jensen et al 2016 3 2 impact of initial and boundary conditions on bay of bengal circulation in the regional model and reanalysis data as explained in the introduction the circulation pattern can change with bathymetry particularly in the coastal region in this section we present bob circulation features in our simulations and how they differ from state of the art reanalysis data we compared the spatial current patterns from regional model simulations exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 and from godas soda3 and oras5 reanalysis data with the oscar and scud analysis data we also compared model simulated geostrophic currents computed with 100 500 m temperature and salinity fields with that of gridded observations fig 9 shows the time series of meridional currents averaged over central and southern bob i e the same regions as that of fig 8 it can be seen that the model was able to capture the meridional component of geostrophic current quite well fig 9a b the hydrographic observations show the east west salinity gradient during winter time along the east and west coast of india shetye et al 1991a 1996 the model captured this east west gradient also with good accuracy not shown the oscar analysis is widely used to evaluate the spatial variation of surface currents from model simulations it is considered independent observations since as per our knowledge no reanalysis products with assimilation of currents are available we used oscar analysis bonjean and lagerloef 2002 to evaluate how the modeled currents compared with observations in the regional models exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 and also from recent state of the art reanalysis products from godas soda3 and oras5 we also used another observation scud which is produced from the combination of geostrophic and ekman currents derived from sla and quikscat wind observation maximenko and hafner 2010 see section 2 for more details about the data sets fig 10 shows 2003 2009 mean upper ocean currents 0 30 m from the three experiments and oscar scud analysis and three reanalysis products i e godas soda3 and oras5 the circulation features in both observed data show similar variations along the east coast of india and southern tip of sri lanka but they differ in circulation features along the west coast of india and eastern bob the eicc structure is very prominent even in the seven year 2003 2009 mean in observations fig 10a b the regional models accurately simulate the width of the eicc structure as seen in the observations the model currents are in good agreement with the oscar analysis they are also in good agreement with previously reported model simulations jensen 1991 vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 vinayachandran et al 2005 however the global reanalysis products are unable to reproduce the narrow eicc structure fig 10d f h in exp 1 the eicc shows weak circulation with improved initialization in exp 2 its magnitude is enhanced and further with both updated initialization and boundary condition in exp 3 the eicc structure is close to observations fig 10a b c e and g as explained in the introduction section without realistic bathymetry representation in a global model the coastal circulation may not be realistic this can be seen in fig 10d for godas reanalysis product which shows strong flow through palk strait whereas in reality there is no flow rao et al 2011 fig 11 shows the surface current 0 30 m monthly variability in terms of std from oscar and scud analyses all regional model simulations and reanalysis products the two analysis based observations show large variability to the east of sri lanka and over the southern tip of india if we take oscar as the reference the regional simulations with updated initial and boundary conditions reproduced the observed spatial variability closest to the observed variability among all regional simulations fig 11a g however all the regional simulations underestimate the magnitude among the reanalysis products godas is closer to observations but it overestimates the observed std over the southern tip of india accurate seasonal variation of ocean currents are crucial to determining salt balance in bob nyadjro et al 2010 2011 jensen 2001 2003 jensen et al 2016 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 2018 on the east coast of india during inter monsoon period a strong coastal current named eicc flows towards the pole equator during february may october december and peaks in april november shetye et al 1993 1996 many observational and modeling studies have reported the transport of low salinity north bob water by eicc into the eastern arabian sea in october and november e g han et al 2001 this equatorward poleward eicc during november april and monsoon currents in the open ocean are responsible for maintaining the salinity balance in the bob as such accurate representation of eicc is crucial for the salt balance in the bob global models are unable to capture this strong narrow eicc hence we evaluated the surface circulations of regional model simulations and reanalysis products with analysis based observations oscar and sucd in january two anti cyclonic circulations one over northwest bob and another over southeast bob prevail within a basin wide anti cyclonic gyre in the southwestern bob along the east coast of sri lanka and the southern part of the east coast of india one can see the presence of strong narrow equatorward currents just east of this equatorward current a strong broad poleward current is present as part of the basin wide cyclonic gyre this observed circulation pattern is very well reproduced by the regional model simulations figure not shown fig 12 shows the upper ocean 0 to 30 m mean 2003 2009 current for april representative of spring season from the regional model simulation i e exp 1 2 and 3 and godas soda3 and oras5 reanalysis products observation shows that at 8 n the westward flowing north east monsoon nem current bifurcates into two branches when it reaches sri lankan coast the northern branch flows as a strong narrow eicc along the east coast of the india flowing from 8 n to 16 n where it leaves the coast the other branch flows towards west around the tip of sri lanka this detachment from coast of eicc has been reported by babu et al 2003 the observed eicc structure is well reproduced in regional model simulations as compared to the reanalysis products in april the bob circulation pattern shows a single weak gyre with strong eicc as part of it shetye et al 1996 this gyre structure is well reproduced in all the simulations the northeastward current at 4 n along 86 96 e splits into two at 6 n which is well reproduced in regional simulations and godas reanalysis but is weak in soda3 this splitting is absent in oras5 godas reanalysis shows unrealistic strong flow through palk strait north of sri lanka whereas it is realistic in all other simulations it is worth mentioning that in many earlier modeling studies the malacca strait was closed however in reality the strait the world s busiest ship route with a 25 m deep narrow channel has considerable flow through it daryabor et al 2016 in the present regional model set up this channel is kept open with realistic bathymetry see fig 1a this can be seen in the flow coming from the east china sea through the malacca strait fig 12 fig 13 shows the upper ocean 0 30 m mean current in july the spatial structure resembles the monsoon current driven by the southwest monsoon wind both observations show the presence of strong southwest monsoon current smc which flows eastward below south of india turns around sri lanka and flows northeastward into the bob all three regional model simulations and reanalysis products were able to capture this smc over the east of sri lanka the magnitude is closest to observation in exp 3 however south of sri lanka smc magnitude is better represented in exp 1 as compared to other experiments the improvement of magnitude from exp 1 to exp 3 clearly signifies that the improved initial and lateral open boundary conditions improve the smc simulation among the reanalysis products godas overestimates the current and its direction also differs compared to both the observations as well as other simulations soda3 shows the weakest smc among all observations show that at the height of summer monsoon there is a western boundary confluence near 10 n with the eicc flowing northward to the north of 10 n and southward south of it vinayachandran et al 1999 eigenheer and quadfasel 2000 this bifurcation of the current near to the coast at about 10 n is most realistically present in exp 3 fig 13a b e all the reanalysis products show weaker southward component as compared to observations fig 13a b d f h however in the regional model simulations with improved initial and lateral boundary conditions exp 3 it is realistic compared to observations fig 13a e g the strong wicc flowing equatorward along the west coast of india driven by strong summer monsoon wind is prominently seen in both observations fig 13a b cutler and swallow 1984 shetye and shenoi 1988 however they differ in magnitude all the simulations are able to reproduce this wicc but differ in magnitude exp 3 among the regional models and oras5 among the reanalysis products are closest to observations the circulation in the western bob and in the andaman sea differs significantly in the regional model simulations and reanalysis products over this region the two observations shows similar circulation pattern with oscar weaker compared to scud the reanalysis products somewhat match the oscar observation the accurate bathymetry representation leads to realistic coastal circulation in the regional simulations the strong southeastward current at the tip of northern andaman island is present only in the regional model simulations this also may be due to topography induced enhancement of current gopalakrishnan and cornuelle 2019 all three regional models show broader southwestward currents along 90 98 e towards the equator observations also show this but with much narrower width reanalysis products are close to observations the southern bay reflects two different paths narrow strong northward current in the western part and a relatively weak broader southward current in the eastern part fig 14 shows the mean surface currents over the bob in november a narrow current flows from north bob along the east coast of india and after turning around sri lanka it reaches till gujarat coast with a slightly broader band along the west coast of india it is worth mentioning that the palk strait is closed in exp 1 3 this narrow modeled current along the coast is quite realistic in regional models exp 1 3 fig 14a c e g when compared with oscar observations as expected the reanalysis products are unable to reproduce the structure and magnitude of equatorward eicc wijesekera et al 2015 have shown that the tracks of eight drifters deployed east of sri lanka and southern bob between 24 october and 23 december 2013 show a similar narrow current see their fig 4 along 85 90 e a strong poleward current can be seen which extends to northern bob the thermocline temperature and salinity shows large variability in 50 200 m depth fig 2b d and this variability must be reflected in the circulation near thermocline region also the temperature and salinity gradient is more prominent at 50 200 m depth range fig 2a c hence in order to see the seasonal spatial variation of thermocline current we choose 50 200 m depth average current we have shown the mean thermocline current for april in fig 15 the circulation pattern in the thermocline resembles the surface circulation features seen in fig 12 but is much weaker the prominent cyclonic and anti cyclonic eddy structures are seen in the sea level data fig 15b the geostrophic current computed with cora5 2 temperature and salinity data is shown in fig 15a presence of basin wide prominent anti cyclonic gyre can be seen which supports earlier findings varkey et al 1996 in the spring the anti cyclonic circulation seen in southeastern bob in the surface current is associated with the presence of anti cyclonic eddy over this region which extends vertically to thermocline depth this signature can be seen most prominently in the anti cyclonic circulation in the thermocline current over this region in the regional simulations fig 15c e g among the reanalysis products this anti cyclonic circulation can be seen in soda3 and oras5 but is almost absent in godas it is to be noted that below 200 m this anticyclonic eddy is absent in all simulations not shown this implies that the vertical extent of anti cyclonic eddy over southwest bob is up to the upper thermocline the thermocline current structure in the western bob is different than its surface structure marked differences can be seen in eastern and southern bob figs 12 and 15 the weak anti cyclonic circulation in the southern bob in the surface current becomes very prominent at the thermocline depth figs 12 and 15 another feature is the presence of an eastern boundary current along the coast near andaman sea till northern bob at thermocline depth which is completely absent at the surface this thermocline current could have been triggered by the propagating coastal kelvin waves generated at the eastern equatorial indian ocean by eastward propagating equatorial kelvin waves rao et al 2010 although in this study we did not analyze the sla from these experiments the sla from exp 1 shows clear kelvin wave propagation see figs 11 and 14 in rahaman et al 2014 this coastally trapped thermocline current is not very prominent in the reanalysis products except godas which shows its presence with broader width fig 15d f h in july the circulation at thermocline depth in the bob more or less resembles the mixed layer current pattern the boundary currents in northern bob and east of andaman island are very prominent in the regional models fig 16c e g but almost absent in the reanalysis products fig 16d f h the northeastward smc current east of sri lanka seen at the surface is very strong 70 cm s and is also present at the thermocline depth but with reduced speed 25 cm s this strong current mostly transports the high salinity water into the bob from arabian sea via the equatorial indian ocean in november even at the thermocline depth the eicc structure is very prominently seen but currents in the interior bay are different than mixed layer currents not shown 3 3 salt transport at 8 n the analysis in the previous section shows that the regional simulation in exp 3 is able to capture the upper ocean mean and variability of temperature salinity and currents with good accuracy now in this section we discuss the seasonal and inter annual salt transport into and out of bob it has been reported in earlier studies that during the summer monsoon the highly saline as water intrudes into the south bob schott et al 1994 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 recent studies show that the high salinity water enters the bob centered between 75 130 m depth along 83 90 e sanchez franks et al 2019 most of the studies on salt transport into bob are concentrated in the upper ocean 0 400 m vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 2018 however below 400 m at what depth it occurs and how much is the salt flux is not known from previous studies we have therefore computed the salt transport along 8 n up to 2000 m depth as described in section 2 before computing salt transport we show the mean and monthly std of meridional current from all three regional simulations and three reanalysis products along the 8 n figs 17 18 mean meridional current is week below 100 m in all simulations fig 17 all simulations show equatorward poleward currents along 80 84 e 84 88 e in the upper 100 m this structure resembles the eicc and smc currents and in oras5 the meridional current speed is stronger as compared to other products the presence of strong northward current along 82 84 e up to 1500 m can be seen in oras5 this deeper current is also present in all regional models but its magnitude is weak fig 17 this deeper flow is mostly from summer monsoon season the presence of summer time deeper meridional current has also been reported in glider observation by anutaliya et al 2017 see their figure 2 the standard deviation of the meridional current is shown in fig 18 the variability is large along the eicc path up to 1500 m depth with large values near the mixed layer regional model simulations match oras5 std distribution the variability near the surface is also large in all simulations but in godas its magnitude is too high it is to be noted that the std value along the eicc pathways is larger than its mean for the meridional current figs 17 18 from the above analysis we can see that regional model simulations with improved initial and open lateral boundary conditions i e exp 3 reproduces the temperature salinity and circulation in the bob with good accuracy hence we used exp 3 for estimating the salt transport into out the bob from arabian sea fig 19 shows the seasonal average salt transport in the upper ocean 0 2000 m across 8 n during winter southward salt transport 4 psu m s is observed along 82 e up to 1000 m depth with a maximum in the narrow surface layer fig 19a this southward transport is associated with the eicc which is most prominent during nov dec the surface layers of the rest of the basin 82 92 e show northward transport most prominent in the east of eicc this result corroborates the observation based findings of wijesekera et al 2015 it shows that the eicc is approximately 100 km wide with speeds exceeding 1 m s in the upper 75 m and east of the eicc a subsurface intensified 300 km wide northward current is observed with maximum speeds as high as 1 m s between 50 m and 75 m it is interesting to note that west of 82 e there exists a very thin surface layer that shows southward transport in the mixed layer in the upper 100 m below this layer a band of northward transport in the thermocline region can be seen further below this layer from 100 m depth a much deeper southward transport can be seen the existence of these three narrow currents has been reported in hydrographic observations by shetye et al 1996 their fig 13 wijesekera et al 2015 with more recent observations and gordon et al 2016 using model simulations show that arabian sea water also enters the bob as a subsurface flow during the northeast monsoon season december to march both these observational and modeling studies show a persistent northward flow of high salinity water 34 5 psu found between 82 e and 85 e from december to february djf at 50 m depth this study shows similar features but it also shows a subsurface salt flux along 96 e to 98 e at 0 50 m depth which has not been reported in both these earlier studies fig 19a this northward transport could be due to the presence of northward current over this region fig 14g presence of similar northward current in may 2016 has been reported by webber et al 2018 see their fig 12a in spring large salt flux towards the equator in a narrow band off sri lanka with a peak in the thermocline is observed 8 psu m s this southward salt flux is associated with the strong narrow southward current observed in the thermocline fig 15g east of this southward salt flux a strong northward salt flux is seen in the thermocline as well very weak southward transport is seen on the surface west of 90 e and also in the deeper ocean below 400 m west of 90 e fig 19b during summer it can be seen that the core of the salt transport salt flux 12 psu m s lies below the mixed layer at around 50 150 m depth along 84 e earlier studies also reported salt transport at similar depth and location vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 sanchez franks et al 2019 sheehan et al 2020 jensen et al 2016 webber et al 2018 reported northward transport ranging between 16 7 and 24 5 sv during july 2016 using data from high resolution in situ measurements along an east west section at 8 n in southern bob however all these studies focused on the upper 250 m we have found another deeper path for salt intrusion at 300 1500 m depth along 82 e fig 19c this deeper transport is associated with the deeper currents present along the coast hydrographic survey showed the presence of a boundary current eicc between 81 e and 82 e up to 300 m depth shcherbinin et al 1979 further a series of hydrographic surveys shetye et al 1991b 1993 1996 showed that during february may eicc extends to greater depths than during the summer monsoon months of june august when the poleward eicc is shallow 70 m deep shetye et al 1991b 1993 1996 however the presence of eicc transport to 1000 m depth was reported by shetye et al 1991b all these observations are north of 10 n south of this the bathymetry shows a steep slope and a very narrow shelf the well defined strong current along the east coast of sri lanka follows the bathymetry rahaman et al 2014 it is also observed that during summer along the coast salt is transported southward in the mixed layer the magnitude of the salt flux is 12 psu m s the same order as subsurface northward transport southward transport is also observed along 88 95 e in the entire upper ocean with a core at 96 e in the upper 100 m significant northward salt transport was also observed during fall in the upper ocean 50 400 m just below the mixed layer along the coast of sri lanka along 82 83 e fig 19d the southward salt flux of 2 6 psu m s is observed during fall in a narrow band of 10 20 m depth and also below 400 m depth along the east coast of sri lanka this southward salt transport along the east coast of sri lanka is seen in all seasons with varying magnitudes with a maximum in summer and a minimum in spring in the mixed layer just east of sri lanka significantly large salt flux 16 psu m s north of 14 n can be seen along the east coast of india during spring and is associated with the eicc figure not shown the reversal of this salt transport during fall also has a similar magnitude salt flux of 16 psu m s figure not shown fig 20 shows the time series of inter annual variation of depth integrated salt transport across 8 n during 2003 2009 the upper ocean 0 200 m salt transport shows peak northward transport during april may and november december of each year with large inter annual variability fig 20a it is southward during june july again with large inter annual variations but with much reduced magnitude during iod year 2006 the southward salt transport during summer monsoon is due to the ekman transport associated with smc schott and mccreary 2001 vinayachandran et al 1999 this southward salt transport is mainly confined to the sri lanka coast and east of 90 e fig 19c in the upper ocean 0 200 m salt transport shows very prominent inter annual variation broadly consisting of two peaks one in spring and another in autumn fig 20a in the top 1000 m there is also a marked inter annual variability similar to the top 200 m transport fig 20b presence of prominent intra seasonal variability can be seen when integrating transports over the top 2000 m or over the full depth fig 20c d this intra seasonal variability is more active in some years than others i e it varies inter annually the transport for the entire depth also shows large inter annual variability it is worth mentioning that the full depth transports are much weaker than the variability shown for 0 200 0 1000 and 0 2000 m the largest variability is seen for 0 1000 m and the values decrease when the vertical integral covers the top 2000 m or the full depth this suggests a degree of compensation between the variability above and below 1000 m unlike prominent seasonal cycle in upper ocean up to 1000 m depth transport up to deeper depth shows more prominent intra seasonal component as well fig 20c d the reason could be due to eastward propagating oceanic equatorial kelvin waves forced by madden julian oscillation observed using the argo array of profiling floats matthews et al 2007 extend downward to 1500 m and having larger amplitude than the annual cycle they have shown that the amplitude of the deep ocean anomalies is up to six times the amplitude of the observed annual cycle it is worth mentioning that when this equatorial kelvin wave reaches the sumatran coast it triggers northward propagating coastal kelvin wave into the bay of bengal rao et al 2010 heywood et al 1994 have reported a 50 day oscillation in the observed currents down to 3000 m depth in the indian ocean consistent with a zonally propagating rossby wave however more detailed analysis is required to find out the exact reason for the prominent intra seasonal variation of deeper salt transport which is beyond the scope of this study the upper ocean 0 200 m seasonal mean salt transport table 1 is northward in all seasons mam 72 psu m3 s son 42 psu m3 s djf 12 psu m3 s except during the summer monsoon when it is southward 99 psu m3 s the total depth integrated transport is also southward during the monsoon season jja 23 psu m3 s and during fall son 17 psu m3 s it can be seen that large variability exists in the seasonal transport table 1 in all other seasons the std values are much higher in the upper ocean 0 200 m compared to its mean other depth averaged values are similar except in son for example during winter djf the transport is southward for january february of 2004 2005 and 2006 with the highest lowest value of 155 psu m3 s 29 psu m3 s in january 2004 2005 but northward in 2003 and 2007 the transport during spring mam is mostly northward with peak values reached in either april or may and with the highest transport 300 psu m3 s in may 2004 however in some years the transport is southward also with a peak value of 120 psu m3 s in march 2006 the mean fall transport is also northward with a southward transport in either september or october with a large inter annual variation november transport is northward in all years with a range of 30 309 psu m3 s the mean depth averaged transport is however southward during fall in order to see transport variability with depth we show hovmollar depth vs time plot in the upper ocean 0 500 m in fig 21 a strong seasonal salt transport confined up to 50 m depth can be seen as shown in the time series plots during winter summer the strong northward southward transport is confined to 50 m depth the contribution in the strong northward transport during april may as shown in fig 20a is mostly from 50 150 m depths 4 summary and conclusions accurate initial and lateral boundary conditions are essential for realistic simulations of the water mass structure and currents in any regional ocean model one way nesting of the regional model with a global model is one of the techniques to overcome the lateral boundary conditions issue we have demonstrated this by performing three experiments using a nested indian ocean regional model see details about the model configuration in rahaman et al 2014 we performed three experiments in exp 1 we used initial and lateral boundary conditions from the original nested global model in exp 2 we used initial conditions from incois godas reanalysis but lateral boundary conditions were the same as exp 1 and finally in exp 3 we used both initial and lateral boundary conditions from incois godas reanalysis of the three experiments exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 we conducted the one with accurate initial and lateral boundary conditions exp 3 provided the best agreement of temperature and salinity fields with co located and concurrent argo profiling floats observations the mean and variability in terms of standard deviation std of the upper ocean temperature and salinity are drastically improved in exp 3 the mean bias of 3 4 c in exp 1 in the thermocline is reduced to 1 5 2 c in exp 2 and furthermore to 0 5 1 5 c in exp 3 similarly the upper ocean 0 500 m mean bias in exp 1 is 2 1 c which reduced to 1 1 c in exp 2 and only 0 41 c in exp 3 the mean salinity bias in exp 1 is 0 01 psu which is slight saltier compared to argo observations become slightly fresher with mean bias of 0 11 psu and 0 09 psu in exp 2 and exp 3 respectively comparison with gridded salinity and temperature observations also shows similar improvement in the bob needless to say that in addition to accurate water mass structure another prerequisite for accurate simulations of narrow energetic coastal currents is high horizontal spatial resolution in the model coupled with correspondingly accurate bathymetry we compared surface currents from all three simulations exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 and three reanalysis products godas soda3 and oras5 we used oscar analysis which is widely used for the surface current variability and model evaluation studies as a reference and also another analysis product scud the mean spatial pattern of surface currents in the regional model simulations are more realistic than reanalysis products godas soda3 and oras5 when compared with oscar and scud observations in all reanalysis products boundary currents eicc and wicc are weak and wide compared to oscar and scud observations whereas in the regional model simulations they are more realistically reproduced of all the three simulations exp 3 provides the best simulation of coastal currents in bob as suggested by good agreement of meridional currents in central and southern bob with the geostrophic currents computed with temperature and salinity from cora5 2 observations and exp 3 simulations the spatial pattern of monthly variability standard deviation is also captured by all regional simulations but is most realistic in exp 3 compared to reanalysis products godas soda3 and oras5 summer monsoon current smc which is the key circulation feature through which the salty arabian sea water mass enters bob and maintains salt balance in the bob jensen 2001 vinayachandran et al 2013 is most realistic in exp 2 and exp 3 when compared with oscar and scud reanalysis products capture the observed spatial structure but they underestimate smc speed we found the effect of improvement in temperature and salinity at the thermocline depth in the thermocline current as well the presence of anti cyclonic gyre associated with the warm core anti cyclonic eddy in western bob off the east coast of india is most prominent in exp 2 and exp 3 the geostrophic current also shows the presence of this anti cyclonic eddy this anti cyclonic eddy is absent in oras5 probably due to its coarse resolution 1 degree its presence is seen in soda3 and godas but with weak circulation we also discovered a narrow band of coastal currents flowing along the east coast of bob during spring and summer at the thermocline depth in april thermocline currents reveal a narrow band of poleward currents along the north and east coast of bob possibly driven by coastal kelvin wave this boundary current is most defined in exp 2 and exp 3 and weaker in exp 1 godas and oras5 reanalysis products also show the presence of this which is completely absent in soda3 this boundary current changes its direction towards the equator in july and again is only prominently seen in regional simulations and absent in reanalysis products in all regional simulations it appears as a loop current present in almost the entire bob along its boundary except for a small stretch of southwest bob it is worth mentioning that the coastally trapped kelvin wave is well reproduced in exp 1 see more details in rahaman et al 2014 along 94 e and 12 16 n a narrow current enters andaman sea from northern bob kiran 2017 has shown the presence of a strong flow through a shallow 250 m channel named preparis channel pc which separates south myanmar from north andaman the strong current in the regional simulations is due to realistic bathymetry and is absent in all reanalysis products the regional simulations also show strong flow out of andaman sea along 93 e centered at 10 n towards equator this flow is also present only in the regional simulations this also may be due to the realistic representation of ten degree channel in the regional model which is 600 m deep and lies between little andaman and car nicobar kiran 2017 as expected the reanalysis products do not show this flow in many earlier studies it has been shown that 8 n is the gateway to bob basin the smc is an eastward jet along 8 n between 85 and 92 e present during the southwest monsoon and its peak velocity can exceed 1 5 m s 1 associated with this smc northward transport has been estimated to be in the range 10 27 sv 1sv 106 m3 s 1 wijesekera et al 2016 vinayachandran et al 1999 webber et al 2018 this estimation has uncertainty and is an overestimate due to the presence of recirculation cherian et al 2020 accurate simulation of currents in the water column especially the narrow energetic coastal currents results in better estimation of salt transport into and out of bob we found that apart from summer and inter monsoon significant salt transport also occurs in spring and fall particularly near the coast of sri lanka this study also found that during the peak of summer significant salt transport into the bob occurs across 8 n in the 300 1500 m layer depth the salt transport during the monsoon season shows a core along 84 e with peak values of 8 psu m3 s just below the mixed layer 50 200 m the upper ocean depth averaged 0 200 m salt transport shows prominent seasonal cycle with large inter annual variability with peak northward transports occurring during spring apr may and early winter nov dec however during the summer monsoon it is southward most prominent transport is confined to 50 m depth in the deeper layers apart from seasonal cycle intra seasonal cycle also is prominent up to 2000 m and at all depths we hope that these new findings such as the narrow band of coastal currents along the east coast of india at the thermocline depth and salt transport below 250 m depth may provide new insights into the

23757,this study uses three simulations exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 from a nested basin scale regional eddy permitting indian ocean model forced with core ii inter annual forcing to study the impact of initial and lateral open boundary conditions on bay of bengal bob circulation it also evaluates the state of art reanalysis products from godas soda3 and oras5 sensitivity studies using more realistic initial and lateral boundary conditions suggest that accurate initial conditions are essential for realistic simulation of the mean and the variability of temperature and salinity in the upper ocean we also show that accurate lateral boundary conditions are also essential for realistic basin scale simulations for the upper ocean circulation in the bob the model captured well the observed seasonal and inter annual variability of salinity in the bob the comparison of surface currents from the regional simulations and reanalysis products with oscar analyses shows exp 3 with improved initial and lateral boundary conditions to be the closest among all three the summer monsoon current is also most realistic in exp 3 while the reanalysis products are unable to reproduce the bob coastal current structure and magnitude this study also reports the first evidence of a coastally trapped narrow boundary current at thermocline depth along the eastern boundary of bob the presence of this boundary current is noticed in all three regional solutions while most prominent in exp 3 and nearly absent in the reanalysis products the salt transport across 8 n shows large seasonal and inter annual variations during 2003 2009 in the best simulation exp 3 with standard deviation ranging between 77 150 psu m3 s up to 1000 m depth apart from summer and winter monsoon periods which show the intrusion of salt into bob from the equatorial indian ocean in the upper layers we found significant salt transport at deeper depths 300 1500 m as well the integrated inter annual variations of the seasonal salt flux at different depths across 8 n show presence of strong seasonal cycle in the upper layer 0 200 m however the seasonality is most prominent in the upper 50 m the intra seasonal variation in the deeper layers are more prominent as compared to the upper layer keywords bay of bengal nested regional ocean model salt flux salt transport reanalysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sea surface salinity sss affects sea water density which in turn impact ocean circulation and climate subsurface salinity particularly in the upper ocean up to 200 m also controls the density stratification and hence changes in circulation capotondi et al 2012 therefore accurate simulations of sss and subsurface salinity are essential for a better understanding of the circulation in the mixed layer and deeper ocean vialard and delecluse 1998 durand et al 2004 although recent models have included freshwater forcing they have had difficulties in reproducing the observed features of the salinity distribution especially in the bay of bengal bob and the southeastern arabian sea seas han et al 2001 deboyermontégutet et al 2007 durand et al 2007 kurian and vinayachandran 2007 the sss simulation errors are as large as 2 3 psu over northern bob murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 han et al 2001 han and mccreary 2001 deboyermontégutet et al 2007 although the upper ocean heat budget studies are available with reasonable accuracy of 10 w m2 bradley and weller 1995 the quantification of salt or equivalently freshwater fw flux is much more difficult than that of heat flux this is mainly due to the different spatial scales of the atmospheric input functions such as solar radiation and precipitation over large oceanic areas the radiative heating of the ocean during daytime is relatively uniform on the other hand the fw input is closely coupled to the existence of atmospheric convection cells which are relatively small in size and irregularly distributed in space and have no clear diurnal signal like the heat flux salinity in the north indian ocean nio is strongly influenced by river inflows in bob the influx of low salinity pacific water throughflow in the indonesian archipelago and the inflow of saltier water from the persian gulf and red sea bob also receives a large quantity of fw local rainfall and river discharge during the summer monsoon season june september sengupta et al 2006 in contrast excessive evaporation and uneven distribution of precipitation and river discharge make the arabian sea as saltier than bob under steady state conditions fw from bob should be exported to as and salt water from as to bob the inter ocean exchange and transport of fw have been studied in detail by gordon 2001 and wijffels 2001 many previous studies have shown the locations of inter basin exchange of fw and salt between bob and as nyadjro et al 2010 2011 jensen 2001 2003 jensen et al 2016 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 sanchez franks et al 2019 sheehan et al 2020 however the details on the magnitude of the freshwater transport and its seasonal and inter annual variability are not as well known recent hycom model simulations jensen et al 2016 show a large persistent flow of high salinity water from the equatorial indian ocean into bob during the northeast monsoon but weaker than during the southwest monsoon jain et al 2017 have shown that three high salinity water masses i e arabian sea high salinity water ashsw persian gulf water pgw and red sea water rsw are advected into bob by the summer monsoon current smc which is a deep current extending to a depth of about 1000 m vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 sanchez franks et al 2019 sheehan et al 2020 sengupta et al 2006 have shown that fw from bob river runoff reaches remote regions of as it also crosses the equator in the eastern bob and subsequently flows across the southern tropical indian ocean several studies also show that low salinity surface water from northern bob flows down the east coast of india in october december through the east india coastal current eicc shetye et al 1996 prasanna kumar et al 2004 gopalakrishna et al 2005 rao and sivakumar 2003 modeling experiments show bob water enters the tropical equatorial indian ocean eio to the east and south in the second half of the year crossing the equator mainly in the east jensen 2003 miyama et al 2003 using reanalysis data nyadjro et al 2013 describe near surface horizontal salt flux in the indian ocean during 1960 2008 kantha et al 2008 studied nio circulation and its variability as well as meridional heat fluxes using a 0 5 degree resolution numerical hindcast model assimilating altimetric and sst data for the years 1993 to 2004 however they did not investigate salt fluxes in nio because at the study time remotely sensed sss was not yet available for assimilation into the model the readers are referred to this paper for a nice summary of nio circulation and relevant issues as explained in the previous section previous studies have reported that the inter basin exchange of subsurface salt transport to and from bob to seas and eio and vice versa occurs however despite the extensive studies of salt exchange between the two basins bob and as on its mean state its seasonal and inter annual variability and their frequencies are not very well known particularly in the deep ocean one of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic simulation of meridional currents in bob see kantha et al 2008 in this study to overcome this deficiency we use simulations from a nested indian ocean model developed by rahaman et al 2014 which show realistic boundary current and fw transport in bob we compare the model simulated currents and salinity with observations modeling the oceanic circulation is made difficult by the wide range of spatial scales from the rossby radius of deformation 10 to 50 km to the basin scales global ocean general circulation models ogcm require high spatial resolution to represent geostrophic eddies narrow boundary currents and flows through passages available computer resources often limit the development of high resolution global models to represent all these physical phenomena alternative option is to develop a basin scale high resolution regional models to meet this challenge with a reasonable amount of computer resource consumption griffies 2009 treguier et al 2001 however to work with a basin scale regional model open boundary conditions obcs must be applied at the lateral open boundaries which permit fluxes of mass heat momentum into and out of the model domain from an outer larger scale model e g global ogcm often called a parent model open boundaries which naturally occur in a regional model are often difficult to handle due to an inherently mathematically ill posed problem at the boundary the numerical solution near a boundary is always a superposition of outgoing and incoming waves as well as scalar and momentum fluxes which cannot be separated and there is no universally perfect scheme for open boundary conditions stevens 1991 griffies 2009 two types of lateral open boundary conditions are used in regional ocean models which are generally referred to as active or passive in the passive type the obcs are determined solely from model solution within the computational domain on the other hand in an active type data are prescribed from an external source e g a larger scale model to force the interior solution since the behavior of the model interior is rarely consistent with data prescribed at the boundary the model may become prone to errors due to under specification not enough information describing external processes is provided or over specification obc information is incompatible with interior state reader may refer marchesiello et al 2001 for a thorough discussion of the active versus passive boundaries and over vs under specification of data when the interior model solutions are determined only by the information imposed at the boundaries from outer models and interior child solutions do not affect the exterior parent solutions it is called one way nesting on the other hand if the interior solutions also affect the exterior solutions across the boundaries between the two it is called two way nesting one way nested models have been developed with great success for instance in the california current region penven et al 2006 and benguela upwelling area off the coast of namibia herzfeld et al 2011 recently two way nesting using finite difference models has gained popularity in refining solution in the regional domain e g cailleau et al 2008 jouanno et al 2008 barth et al 2005 sheng et al 2005 for a detailed review of two way nesting readers are referred to debreu and blayo 2008 one way nested approach has been adopted in the present study and obcs are prescribed from a global model solutions flather radiation condition flather 1976 has been used for the depth averaged normal velocity at the eastern and southern boundary of the indian ocean model the flow relaxation scheme of martinsen and engedahl 1987 has been used for the temperature and salinity at the boundary the details of obcs and other model configurations can be found in rahaman et al 2014 for the earth system model s or climate model s simulation accuracy in terms of hindcast or predictions on different time scales accurate initialization of ocean plays a major role the skill of climate system forecasts at the sub seasonal to seasonal s2s seasonal to inter annual s2i and seasonal to decadal s2d scales depends on the oceanic initial conditions fed into the models in particular information on the ocean s upper thermal and salinity structure alves et al 2004 balmaseda and anderson 2009 balmaseda et al 2013 2015 meehl et al 2021 halliwell et al 2011 have demonstrated that accurate ocean model initialization with respect to the upper ocean temperature and salinity density profiles along with the correct location of ocean currents and eddies is the most important factor influencing the accuracy of sst forecast by an ocean model over the northwest caribbean sea and gulf of mexico recently zhou et al 2019 have shown that the initial conditions errors occurring in the indian ocean temperature cause spring predictability barrier for el niño in the pacific ocean however to our knowledge no such studies showing the impact of ocean initial conditions on indian ocean simulations or forecasts from a forced ocean model are available hence in this study we demonstrate the impact of ocean initial conditions on bob simulation in recent times global reanalyses are available at 1 4 degree resolution based on nemo from ecmwf cmcc etc and at 1 12 degree resolution from hycom consortium and glorys12 reanalysis data set produced by mercator ocean international forecasting center verezemskaya et al 2021 lellouche et al 2018 however assimilation into global models often degrades the circulation features mercator ocean 2018 in most of these global models during ocean grid generation the bathymetry is often smoothed to avoid numerical instability as a result topography can be too deep near the coast and narrow channel can be deeper and wider than they should be for example the bathymetry used in the global model configuration in godas opened the palk strait and made it deeper which is not realistic fig 1b the coastal regions also became deeper hence the coastal circulation patterns are not realistically represented in global models in this study we used the modified bathymetry from sindhu et al 2007 in the regional model most of the ocean model configurations are based on smoothed bathymetric data sets like etopo5 and etopo2 sindhu et al 2007 have shown that these bathymetries are inaccurate in depths of less than 200 m along the coast of india they modified etopo bathymetry along the indian ocean coast by digitizing the depth contours and sounding depths less than 200 m from the hydrographic charts published by the national hydrographic office india in the present study we used this modified bathymetry fig 1a for the regional ocean model configuration the differences near the indian coast in regional and global models can be seen in fig 1a b more accurate shallow coastal bathymetry leads to significantly improved and realistic coastal circulation compared to that from global model simulations see the discussions in section 3 2 near the coast data are often sparse particularly in a basin like bob due to lack of observations often few data are assimilated in a global model hence configuration of a basin scale model with realistic bathymetry is essential recently rahaman et al 2020 have shown how the circulation patterns even in the open ocean change in the indian ocean with different bathymetries used in a suite of 16 global models we show here the improved circulation features in the regional models as compared to the state of the art reanalysis data from godas soda3 and oras5 we also show the subsurface salt transport and its interannual variability from bob to eio and vice versa along with the seasonal and inter annual variability of salt flux section 2 describes the data sets used in this study and the model configuration model results and discussion are presented in section 3 and finally summary and conclusions are provided in section 4 2 model and data we have adopted a nested multi model approach using mom4p0d mom4p1 global ocean general circulation model ogcm and a regional model of the indian ocean rahaman et al 2014 based on mom4p1 the regional model domain covers the indian ocean between 30 s and 30 n and 30 e and 120 e with a uniform horizontal resolution of 0 25 there are 50 levels in the vertical with 1 m resolution in the upper 10 m the regional model is forced by coordinated ocean reference experiments core ii inter annual data the global model uses annual river runoff but the regional model uses seasonal river runoff dai and trenberth 2002 distributed over several grid points near the river mouths into the upper 5 m of the water column more realistic simulation of north bob salinity stratification can be attributed to this refined resolution 1 m near the surface more realistic topography and the inclusion of seasonal river runoff rahaman et al 2014 the circulation and the wave propagation in the bob are more realistic in these model simulations when compared with observations rahaman et al 2014 a detailed description of the model configuration and validation can be found in rahaman et al 2014 all global ogcms suffer from excessive thermocline diffusion and hence a deeper thermocline when compared to observations rahaman et al 2020 this was also the case in the regional model which uses initial conditions from mom4p1 global ogcm rahaman et al 2014 the problem of the diffuse thermocline is rectified in a data assimilative global model ravichandran et al 2013 behringer 2007 rahaman et al 2016 2018 the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the indian national centre for ocean information services incois produce global ocean analyses reanalysis based on the global ocean data assimilation system godas this system uses a state of the art ocean general circulation model called modular ocean model mom4p0d and the 3d variational 3dvar data assimilation technique to assimilate observed temperature and salinity profiles from in situ observations argo buoy xbt etc we used incois godas reanalysis for the initial and lateral boundary conditions in the indian ocean model for this study we used the same reanalysis products based on mom4p0d as in ravichandran et al 2013 and rahaman et al 2016 in this study we demonstrate how the upper ocean simulations improved in a regional model by initializing with reanalysis data also we show that the improved lateral boundary conditions also affect the bob simulation we performed three indian ocean regional model simulations 1 exp 1 using initial and lateral boundary conditions from 1 mom4p1 global model rahaman et al 2014 2 exp 2 using initial conditions for 2003 from incois godas reanalysis ravichandran et al 2013 rahaman et al 2016 but lateral boundary conditions from 1 mom4p1 global model rahaman et al 2014 3 exp 3 using both initial and lateral boundary conditions from incois godas reanalysis ravichandran et al 2013 rahaman et al 2016 the details of the boundary conditions applied can be found in rahaman et al 2014 in exp 1 we used both initial and boundary conditions from mom4p1 and in exp 2 we just changed the initial conditions of mom4p1 with godas reanalysis but used same lateral boundary conditions of exp 1 so that comparison of exp 1 and exp 2 will give the impact of initial conditions in exp3 we also replaced the lateral boundary conditions with godas reanalysis hence comparison of exp 2 and exp 3 gives the impact of lateral boundary conditions temperature and salinity from argo profiling floats were used to ascertain the impact of initial and boundary conditions on temperature and salinity observed in the regional model the observed gridded subsurface temperature and salinity data from coriolis ocean dataset for reanalysis cora were also used to determine the seasonal and inter annual variability of temperature and salinity and geostrophic currents the geostrophic currents for both observations and model simulations were computed using dynamic height the comparisons were then made with the 100 500 m depth average current we used the latest version cora5 2 cabanes et al 2013 szekely et al 2019 for this study the cora dataset is distributed by copernicus marine and environment service https resources marine copernicus eu products this dataset used many types of in situ temperature and salinity measurements with a maximal sampling including high frequency profilers argo ctd surface and sub surface time series thermosalinographs and surface drifters most of these cora profiles are collected by the coriolis data center the cora 5 2 dataset is an incremental version of the previous cora datasets covering the period 1950 to the present we also used aviso monthly gridded sea level anomaly data to show the presence of eddies in bob to evaluate the circulation features of regional model simulations in the bob we used the most recent version of 1 4 degree ocean surface currents analyses real time oscar surface currents bonjean and lagerloef 2002 we also used 1 4 degree surface currents from diagnostic model scud based on a simple diagnostic model which combines aviso maps of sea level anomalies and quikscat surface winds and is tuned to best reproduce trajectories of real drifters drogued at 15 m depth maximenko and hafner 2010 simple ocean data assimilation ocean sea ice reanalysis soda is the most widely used reanalysis data since late 20th century carton et al 2000a 2000b carton and giese 2008 recent soda version 3 release now uses gfdl mom5 sis numerics at finer 1 4 1 4 50 level resolution 28 km at the equator down to 10 km at polar latitudes similar to the ocean component of the gfdl cm2 5 coupled climate model and includes an active sea ice component the optimal interpolation filter has also been augmented relative to previous releases with bias correction to reduce bias in estimates of long term trends of variables such as heat content carton et al 2018 we used soda3 to compare the bob circulation features with iom simulations exp 1 2 3 we also included 1 1 resolution oras5 reanalysis products produced by ecmwf using the estimates of the state of the global ocean from the operational system ocean5 zuo et al 2017 2019 the general expression for the transport or flux f of a property is the integral of the property p times velocity v over the area da the area is a cross section i e the width of the current times its depth f p v da here in this study we used p s where s is the salinity in psu finally a we show the schematic of major currents along the indian coast during summer and winter seasons in fig 1c adapted from bharti et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of initial and boundary conditions on temperature and salinity the temperature and salinity determine the density and hence the ocean structure and dynamics cooper 1988 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 have shown that salinity plays an important role in the model dynamics and thermodynamics hence a realistic model simulated circulation requires realistic simulations of ocean mean temperature and salinity and their variability as discussed in the previous section three different experiments are performed to determine the impact of initial and boundary conditions using regional model solutions to see how well the model simulates temperature and salinity with respect to observations we have used individual argo temperature and salinity profiles as well as gridded data fig 2a shows the upper ocean mean 2006 2009 collocated and concurrent temperature from the three different experiments with argo profiling float observations the trajectory of the argo float used for the co location can be found in the subset of each panel the magenta color profile is from exp 1 the cyan colored profile shows the temperature from exp 2 which used warm start 1 january 2003 with initial conditions from godas reanalysis and lateral boundary conditions from the inter annual global model solutions 1992 2009 based on mom4p1 same lateral boundary conditions of exp 1 it can be seen that the large thermocline bias in the exp 1 magenta lines is drastically reduced and the profiles are closer to argo observations in exp 2 cyan line it is worth mentioning that for exp 2 we used godas reanalysis data to initialize whereas exp 1 used solutions from a non data assimilative global model see rahaman et al 2014 for details this demonstrates that better initial conditions have improved model simulations furthermore when lateral open boundary conditions from godas reanalysis are also used exp 3 the simulated temperature blue line almost matches the argo observations black line it is worth mentioning that even 3 years after initialization the thermocline is well maintained in the model and it persists even until the 7th year the 0 500 m depth mean bias in exp 1 is 2 1 c which is reduced to 1 1 c in exp 2 and only 0 41 c in exp 3 fig 2b shows the monthly standard deviation std in the upper ocean 0 500 m similar results can be seen in the std of temperature as well the argo observed variability black line in terms of std is most accurately captured by exp 3 the highest observed std values of 2 3 c at 90 m depth is almost reproduced in exp 3 2 0 c blue line the 70 110 m depth averaged std in argo observations is 2 2 c while it is 1 78 c 1 79 c and 1 92 c for exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 respectively however the root mean square deviation rmsd value increased slightly in exp 3 0 85 c as compared to exp 2 0 81 c and exp 1 0 78 c this slight increase may be due to the bias present in 2006 in the original godas reanalysis data the co located and concurrent mean salinity from the three experiments in the upper ocean are shown in fig 2c the observation black line shows salinity increases gradually in the upper ocean until a depth of 150 m and afterward it is almost constant exp 1 magenta shows a slight underestimation of salinity in the upper layers 150 m and a slight overestimation in the deeper layers deeper than 150 m compared to observations however although experiments with godas initial as well as boundary conditions exp 2 and exp 3 show somewhat lower salinity values in the upper ocean to 150 m they follow the observed argo mean values quite well below 150 m the freshening in the upper 100 m may be due to higher vertical resolution of the model in the upper 100 m the model has 23 levels starting from 0 5 m up to 20 m the resolution is 1 3 m thereafter it slowly increases to 10 m at 103 m depth in contrast the argo profiling float has uniform resolution of 5 m in 0 100 m depth and 10 m between 100 500 m all the three experiments miss some of the structure in the upper 75 m for temperature and salinity when compared with argo observations this could also be due to the refined vertical resolution in the model as compared to argo observations the mean bias in exp 1 is 0 01 psu which is slightly saltier when compared to argo observations however with godas initial and boundary conditions it becomes slightly fresh with mean bias of 0 11 psu and 0 09 psu in exp 2 and exp 3 respectively salinity bias in exp 1 in the thermocline region 150 500 m depth is 0 08 psu which is significant for the spiciness variability the same for exp 2 and 3 is 0 01 psu the spiciness variability in the thermocline is believed to be an important subsurface ocean process affecting sea surface temperature sst and climate variability over the tropical indian ocean li and wang 2014 the observed salinity variability represented by the std is also picked up by all three experiments and the solutions with godas initial and boundary conditions closely follow the observed variability fig 2d the argo std is 0 07 psu exp 2 and 3 show 0 09 psu which is the closest to the observed value in contrast to exp 1 which shows slightly higher std value of 0 11 psu the rmsd value is also lowest in exp 3 0 09 psu compared to exp 2 0 1 psu and exp 1 0 12 psu this is the first co located and concurrent salinity comparison of the impact of initial and lateral boundary conditions in a regional model simulations of bob wakelin et al 2009 have shown the impact of initial and open boundary conditions for a northeast atlantic implementation of the proudman oceanographic laboratory coastal ocean model system polcoms from woa observations and two large scale operational ocean models forecasting ocean assimilation model foam uk met office and the navy coastal ocean model ncom us naval research laboratory they show that in the shelf region after 15 months of model integration the effect of the temperature and salinity initial conditions was negligible and the model dynamics and surface forcing play a dominant role however in the deep regions ncom boundary conditions resulted in smaller rms errors in the sst simulations than the foam boundary conditions these results further confirm the finding in bob in order to see the seasonal behavior of the model solutions we show the comparison of seasonal average co located and concurrent upper ocean temperature from the three experiments with argo observations during 2007 2008 fig 3 the trajectory of the argo used for the co location can be found in fig 3b on seasonal scale it also shows similar results for the mean fig 3a in the mean plot the exp 3 closely follows the argo observations but in 2007 08 there is a slight warm bias in the thermocline in exp 3 in summer july aug and fall sept oct it should however be noted that the trajectory of argo float was confined to the southwest bob in order to see whether the same results hold for the entire basin as well we compared the subsurface temperature from orca5 2 gridded observations see figs 5 7 seasonal comparison of subsurface salinity along the argo trajectory in 2007 2008 are shown in fig 4 in contrast to temperature which shows that the impact of initial and boundary conditions is uniform in different seasons the salinity comparison shows the impact is most prominent during summer and fall the observed salinity profile is well reproduced in exp 2 and exp 3 during summer and fall except in the upper 100 m in which the model shows fresher values compared to argo profiling float observation this could be due to the higher vertical resolution in model than in argo observations same as for the temperature during winter and spring the salinity simulation shows degradation in the thermocline region in exp 2 and exp 3 when compared to exp 1 the degradation in winter spring vs summer fall could be due to the deficiencies in the forcing fields or could be related to the model itself and its inability to capture physical processes in winter spring vs summer fall for 2007 2008 however below the thermocline salinity simulations in exp 2 and exp 3 are almost reproduced in all seasons seasonal monsoon rain and river runoff create shallow pools of freshwater in the north bob in summer gopalakrishna et al 2002 vinayachandran and kurian 2007 and autumn in situ observations in the north bob sengupta et al 2006 shetye et al 1996 often show an intense shallow halocline at 5 20 m in depth our model simulations reproduce this observed strong salinity stratification in the upper layers of the northern bob however the argo profiling float is unable to capture this due to its coarse vertical resolution 5 m between 5 100 m 10 m between 100 500 m and 25 m between 500 2000 m model reproduced the salinity profiles well when compared with high vertical resolution specially operated individual argo float data as well as ctd observation figure not shown the comparisons above were made with a single profile data in order to see the robustness of this comparison we used the latest gridded subsurface temperature and salinity observations from cora5 2 fig 5 shows comparisons of model simulated mean temperature and salinity from the three experiments to cora5 2 observations in the northern bob results in the northern bob are very much similar to those in fig 2 but the impact of initial and boundary conditions is more prominent in the temperature fields than in salinity fig 5a b godas assimilates actual salinity and temperature profiles we used the initial conditions from 2003 in 2003 the number of salinity profiles over the northern bob are fewer than the number of temperature profiles that goes into the godas analysis hence the simulated reanalysis temperature fields are more accurate than the salinity fields this is reflected in regional model solutions also from fig 5 it is difficult to judge whether the large warm bias in exp 1 in 200 800 m depth is uniform or has interannual variation therefore we present the depth vs time plots of the difference between the three model simulations and the observed gridded temperature showing interannual variations over northern bob in fig 6 it can be seen that large warm bias of 3 c in the thermocline in exp 1 is uniform throughout the entire time period this bias is reduced to 1 c in exp 2 and further to only 0 5 c in exp 3 in all three experiments the upper ocean 0 100 m is cooler by 0 5 1 c this cooler bias could be due to the biases in the core ii forcing fields used or in accurate mixed layer mixing scheme rahaman and ravichandran 2013 rahaman et al 2020 all three experiments show fresher waters in the upper ocean 0 200 m fig 7 the subsurface bias is within 0 1 psu in all these experiments fig 7 as explained above the improvement in salinity is not as significant as temperature in exp 2 and 3 this could again may be due to the salinity bias in the original godas reanalysis data itself or forcing fields or deficiencies in model physics it is clear that the salinity bias is the lowest in exp 3 therefore we look further at the salinity bias in exp 3 in a smaller region fig 8 shows the depth vs time plots of model minus observation averaged over 80 92 e and in two sections one over central bob r1 12 16 n fig 8a and another over southern bob r2 6 10 n fig 8b see fig 1a for the geographical location of these regions the upper 40 m shows that the model overestimates salinity by 0 4 0 6 psu in central bob fig 8a below this layer model salinity is fresher by 0 2 psu w r t gridded observations in the southern bob the model shows freshening compared to observations sharma et al 2010 have reported model simulated sss with root mean square error rmse of 0 4 psu when compared with rama research moored array for african asian australian monsoon analysis and prediction buoy observations however their results are from the equatorial indian ocean buoy this low bias of 0 2 0 6 psu at seasonal and inter annual time scales has not been reported in any of the earlier model simulations in the bob deboyermontégutet et al 2007 sharma et al 2010 jensen et al 2016 3 2 impact of initial and boundary conditions on bay of bengal circulation in the regional model and reanalysis data as explained in the introduction the circulation pattern can change with bathymetry particularly in the coastal region in this section we present bob circulation features in our simulations and how they differ from state of the art reanalysis data we compared the spatial current patterns from regional model simulations exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 and from godas soda3 and oras5 reanalysis data with the oscar and scud analysis data we also compared model simulated geostrophic currents computed with 100 500 m temperature and salinity fields with that of gridded observations fig 9 shows the time series of meridional currents averaged over central and southern bob i e the same regions as that of fig 8 it can be seen that the model was able to capture the meridional component of geostrophic current quite well fig 9a b the hydrographic observations show the east west salinity gradient during winter time along the east and west coast of india shetye et al 1991a 1996 the model captured this east west gradient also with good accuracy not shown the oscar analysis is widely used to evaluate the spatial variation of surface currents from model simulations it is considered independent observations since as per our knowledge no reanalysis products with assimilation of currents are available we used oscar analysis bonjean and lagerloef 2002 to evaluate how the modeled currents compared with observations in the regional models exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 and also from recent state of the art reanalysis products from godas soda3 and oras5 we also used another observation scud which is produced from the combination of geostrophic and ekman currents derived from sla and quikscat wind observation maximenko and hafner 2010 see section 2 for more details about the data sets fig 10 shows 2003 2009 mean upper ocean currents 0 30 m from the three experiments and oscar scud analysis and three reanalysis products i e godas soda3 and oras5 the circulation features in both observed data show similar variations along the east coast of india and southern tip of sri lanka but they differ in circulation features along the west coast of india and eastern bob the eicc structure is very prominent even in the seven year 2003 2009 mean in observations fig 10a b the regional models accurately simulate the width of the eicc structure as seen in the observations the model currents are in good agreement with the oscar analysis they are also in good agreement with previously reported model simulations jensen 1991 vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 vinayachandran et al 2005 however the global reanalysis products are unable to reproduce the narrow eicc structure fig 10d f h in exp 1 the eicc shows weak circulation with improved initialization in exp 2 its magnitude is enhanced and further with both updated initialization and boundary condition in exp 3 the eicc structure is close to observations fig 10a b c e and g as explained in the introduction section without realistic bathymetry representation in a global model the coastal circulation may not be realistic this can be seen in fig 10d for godas reanalysis product which shows strong flow through palk strait whereas in reality there is no flow rao et al 2011 fig 11 shows the surface current 0 30 m monthly variability in terms of std from oscar and scud analyses all regional model simulations and reanalysis products the two analysis based observations show large variability to the east of sri lanka and over the southern tip of india if we take oscar as the reference the regional simulations with updated initial and boundary conditions reproduced the observed spatial variability closest to the observed variability among all regional simulations fig 11a g however all the regional simulations underestimate the magnitude among the reanalysis products godas is closer to observations but it overestimates the observed std over the southern tip of india accurate seasonal variation of ocean currents are crucial to determining salt balance in bob nyadjro et al 2010 2011 jensen 2001 2003 jensen et al 2016 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 2018 on the east coast of india during inter monsoon period a strong coastal current named eicc flows towards the pole equator during february may october december and peaks in april november shetye et al 1993 1996 many observational and modeling studies have reported the transport of low salinity north bob water by eicc into the eastern arabian sea in october and november e g han et al 2001 this equatorward poleward eicc during november april and monsoon currents in the open ocean are responsible for maintaining the salinity balance in the bob as such accurate representation of eicc is crucial for the salt balance in the bob global models are unable to capture this strong narrow eicc hence we evaluated the surface circulations of regional model simulations and reanalysis products with analysis based observations oscar and sucd in january two anti cyclonic circulations one over northwest bob and another over southeast bob prevail within a basin wide anti cyclonic gyre in the southwestern bob along the east coast of sri lanka and the southern part of the east coast of india one can see the presence of strong narrow equatorward currents just east of this equatorward current a strong broad poleward current is present as part of the basin wide cyclonic gyre this observed circulation pattern is very well reproduced by the regional model simulations figure not shown fig 12 shows the upper ocean 0 to 30 m mean 2003 2009 current for april representative of spring season from the regional model simulation i e exp 1 2 and 3 and godas soda3 and oras5 reanalysis products observation shows that at 8 n the westward flowing north east monsoon nem current bifurcates into two branches when it reaches sri lankan coast the northern branch flows as a strong narrow eicc along the east coast of the india flowing from 8 n to 16 n where it leaves the coast the other branch flows towards west around the tip of sri lanka this detachment from coast of eicc has been reported by babu et al 2003 the observed eicc structure is well reproduced in regional model simulations as compared to the reanalysis products in april the bob circulation pattern shows a single weak gyre with strong eicc as part of it shetye et al 1996 this gyre structure is well reproduced in all the simulations the northeastward current at 4 n along 86 96 e splits into two at 6 n which is well reproduced in regional simulations and godas reanalysis but is weak in soda3 this splitting is absent in oras5 godas reanalysis shows unrealistic strong flow through palk strait north of sri lanka whereas it is realistic in all other simulations it is worth mentioning that in many earlier modeling studies the malacca strait was closed however in reality the strait the world s busiest ship route with a 25 m deep narrow channel has considerable flow through it daryabor et al 2016 in the present regional model set up this channel is kept open with realistic bathymetry see fig 1a this can be seen in the flow coming from the east china sea through the malacca strait fig 12 fig 13 shows the upper ocean 0 30 m mean current in july the spatial structure resembles the monsoon current driven by the southwest monsoon wind both observations show the presence of strong southwest monsoon current smc which flows eastward below south of india turns around sri lanka and flows northeastward into the bob all three regional model simulations and reanalysis products were able to capture this smc over the east of sri lanka the magnitude is closest to observation in exp 3 however south of sri lanka smc magnitude is better represented in exp 1 as compared to other experiments the improvement of magnitude from exp 1 to exp 3 clearly signifies that the improved initial and lateral open boundary conditions improve the smc simulation among the reanalysis products godas overestimates the current and its direction also differs compared to both the observations as well as other simulations soda3 shows the weakest smc among all observations show that at the height of summer monsoon there is a western boundary confluence near 10 n with the eicc flowing northward to the north of 10 n and southward south of it vinayachandran et al 1999 eigenheer and quadfasel 2000 this bifurcation of the current near to the coast at about 10 n is most realistically present in exp 3 fig 13a b e all the reanalysis products show weaker southward component as compared to observations fig 13a b d f h however in the regional model simulations with improved initial and lateral boundary conditions exp 3 it is realistic compared to observations fig 13a e g the strong wicc flowing equatorward along the west coast of india driven by strong summer monsoon wind is prominently seen in both observations fig 13a b cutler and swallow 1984 shetye and shenoi 1988 however they differ in magnitude all the simulations are able to reproduce this wicc but differ in magnitude exp 3 among the regional models and oras5 among the reanalysis products are closest to observations the circulation in the western bob and in the andaman sea differs significantly in the regional model simulations and reanalysis products over this region the two observations shows similar circulation pattern with oscar weaker compared to scud the reanalysis products somewhat match the oscar observation the accurate bathymetry representation leads to realistic coastal circulation in the regional simulations the strong southeastward current at the tip of northern andaman island is present only in the regional model simulations this also may be due to topography induced enhancement of current gopalakrishnan and cornuelle 2019 all three regional models show broader southwestward currents along 90 98 e towards the equator observations also show this but with much narrower width reanalysis products are close to observations the southern bay reflects two different paths narrow strong northward current in the western part and a relatively weak broader southward current in the eastern part fig 14 shows the mean surface currents over the bob in november a narrow current flows from north bob along the east coast of india and after turning around sri lanka it reaches till gujarat coast with a slightly broader band along the west coast of india it is worth mentioning that the palk strait is closed in exp 1 3 this narrow modeled current along the coast is quite realistic in regional models exp 1 3 fig 14a c e g when compared with oscar observations as expected the reanalysis products are unable to reproduce the structure and magnitude of equatorward eicc wijesekera et al 2015 have shown that the tracks of eight drifters deployed east of sri lanka and southern bob between 24 october and 23 december 2013 show a similar narrow current see their fig 4 along 85 90 e a strong poleward current can be seen which extends to northern bob the thermocline temperature and salinity shows large variability in 50 200 m depth fig 2b d and this variability must be reflected in the circulation near thermocline region also the temperature and salinity gradient is more prominent at 50 200 m depth range fig 2a c hence in order to see the seasonal spatial variation of thermocline current we choose 50 200 m depth average current we have shown the mean thermocline current for april in fig 15 the circulation pattern in the thermocline resembles the surface circulation features seen in fig 12 but is much weaker the prominent cyclonic and anti cyclonic eddy structures are seen in the sea level data fig 15b the geostrophic current computed with cora5 2 temperature and salinity data is shown in fig 15a presence of basin wide prominent anti cyclonic gyre can be seen which supports earlier findings varkey et al 1996 in the spring the anti cyclonic circulation seen in southeastern bob in the surface current is associated with the presence of anti cyclonic eddy over this region which extends vertically to thermocline depth this signature can be seen most prominently in the anti cyclonic circulation in the thermocline current over this region in the regional simulations fig 15c e g among the reanalysis products this anti cyclonic circulation can be seen in soda3 and oras5 but is almost absent in godas it is to be noted that below 200 m this anticyclonic eddy is absent in all simulations not shown this implies that the vertical extent of anti cyclonic eddy over southwest bob is up to the upper thermocline the thermocline current structure in the western bob is different than its surface structure marked differences can be seen in eastern and southern bob figs 12 and 15 the weak anti cyclonic circulation in the southern bob in the surface current becomes very prominent at the thermocline depth figs 12 and 15 another feature is the presence of an eastern boundary current along the coast near andaman sea till northern bob at thermocline depth which is completely absent at the surface this thermocline current could have been triggered by the propagating coastal kelvin waves generated at the eastern equatorial indian ocean by eastward propagating equatorial kelvin waves rao et al 2010 although in this study we did not analyze the sla from these experiments the sla from exp 1 shows clear kelvin wave propagation see figs 11 and 14 in rahaman et al 2014 this coastally trapped thermocline current is not very prominent in the reanalysis products except godas which shows its presence with broader width fig 15d f h in july the circulation at thermocline depth in the bob more or less resembles the mixed layer current pattern the boundary currents in northern bob and east of andaman island are very prominent in the regional models fig 16c e g but almost absent in the reanalysis products fig 16d f h the northeastward smc current east of sri lanka seen at the surface is very strong 70 cm s and is also present at the thermocline depth but with reduced speed 25 cm s this strong current mostly transports the high salinity water into the bob from arabian sea via the equatorial indian ocean in november even at the thermocline depth the eicc structure is very prominently seen but currents in the interior bay are different than mixed layer currents not shown 3 3 salt transport at 8 n the analysis in the previous section shows that the regional simulation in exp 3 is able to capture the upper ocean mean and variability of temperature salinity and currents with good accuracy now in this section we discuss the seasonal and inter annual salt transport into and out of bob it has been reported in earlier studies that during the summer monsoon the highly saline as water intrudes into the south bob schott et al 1994 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 recent studies show that the high salinity water enters the bob centered between 75 130 m depth along 83 90 e sanchez franks et al 2019 most of the studies on salt transport into bob are concentrated in the upper ocean 0 400 m vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 2018 however below 400 m at what depth it occurs and how much is the salt flux is not known from previous studies we have therefore computed the salt transport along 8 n up to 2000 m depth as described in section 2 before computing salt transport we show the mean and monthly std of meridional current from all three regional simulations and three reanalysis products along the 8 n figs 17 18 mean meridional current is week below 100 m in all simulations fig 17 all simulations show equatorward poleward currents along 80 84 e 84 88 e in the upper 100 m this structure resembles the eicc and smc currents and in oras5 the meridional current speed is stronger as compared to other products the presence of strong northward current along 82 84 e up to 1500 m can be seen in oras5 this deeper current is also present in all regional models but its magnitude is weak fig 17 this deeper flow is mostly from summer monsoon season the presence of summer time deeper meridional current has also been reported in glider observation by anutaliya et al 2017 see their figure 2 the standard deviation of the meridional current is shown in fig 18 the variability is large along the eicc path up to 1500 m depth with large values near the mixed layer regional model simulations match oras5 std distribution the variability near the surface is also large in all simulations but in godas its magnitude is too high it is to be noted that the std value along the eicc pathways is larger than its mean for the meridional current figs 17 18 from the above analysis we can see that regional model simulations with improved initial and open lateral boundary conditions i e exp 3 reproduces the temperature salinity and circulation in the bob with good accuracy hence we used exp 3 for estimating the salt transport into out the bob from arabian sea fig 19 shows the seasonal average salt transport in the upper ocean 0 2000 m across 8 n during winter southward salt transport 4 psu m s is observed along 82 e up to 1000 m depth with a maximum in the narrow surface layer fig 19a this southward transport is associated with the eicc which is most prominent during nov dec the surface layers of the rest of the basin 82 92 e show northward transport most prominent in the east of eicc this result corroborates the observation based findings of wijesekera et al 2015 it shows that the eicc is approximately 100 km wide with speeds exceeding 1 m s in the upper 75 m and east of the eicc a subsurface intensified 300 km wide northward current is observed with maximum speeds as high as 1 m s between 50 m and 75 m it is interesting to note that west of 82 e there exists a very thin surface layer that shows southward transport in the mixed layer in the upper 100 m below this layer a band of northward transport in the thermocline region can be seen further below this layer from 100 m depth a much deeper southward transport can be seen the existence of these three narrow currents has been reported in hydrographic observations by shetye et al 1996 their fig 13 wijesekera et al 2015 with more recent observations and gordon et al 2016 using model simulations show that arabian sea water also enters the bob as a subsurface flow during the northeast monsoon season december to march both these observational and modeling studies show a persistent northward flow of high salinity water 34 5 psu found between 82 e and 85 e from december to february djf at 50 m depth this study shows similar features but it also shows a subsurface salt flux along 96 e to 98 e at 0 50 m depth which has not been reported in both these earlier studies fig 19a this northward transport could be due to the presence of northward current over this region fig 14g presence of similar northward current in may 2016 has been reported by webber et al 2018 see their fig 12a in spring large salt flux towards the equator in a narrow band off sri lanka with a peak in the thermocline is observed 8 psu m s this southward salt flux is associated with the strong narrow southward current observed in the thermocline fig 15g east of this southward salt flux a strong northward salt flux is seen in the thermocline as well very weak southward transport is seen on the surface west of 90 e and also in the deeper ocean below 400 m west of 90 e fig 19b during summer it can be seen that the core of the salt transport salt flux 12 psu m s lies below the mixed layer at around 50 150 m depth along 84 e earlier studies also reported salt transport at similar depth and location vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 sanchez franks et al 2019 sheehan et al 2020 jensen et al 2016 webber et al 2018 reported northward transport ranging between 16 7 and 24 5 sv during july 2016 using data from high resolution in situ measurements along an east west section at 8 n in southern bob however all these studies focused on the upper 250 m we have found another deeper path for salt intrusion at 300 1500 m depth along 82 e fig 19c this deeper transport is associated with the deeper currents present along the coast hydrographic survey showed the presence of a boundary current eicc between 81 e and 82 e up to 300 m depth shcherbinin et al 1979 further a series of hydrographic surveys shetye et al 1991b 1993 1996 showed that during february may eicc extends to greater depths than during the summer monsoon months of june august when the poleward eicc is shallow 70 m deep shetye et al 1991b 1993 1996 however the presence of eicc transport to 1000 m depth was reported by shetye et al 1991b all these observations are north of 10 n south of this the bathymetry shows a steep slope and a very narrow shelf the well defined strong current along the east coast of sri lanka follows the bathymetry rahaman et al 2014 it is also observed that during summer along the coast salt is transported southward in the mixed layer the magnitude of the salt flux is 12 psu m s the same order as subsurface northward transport southward transport is also observed along 88 95 e in the entire upper ocean with a core at 96 e in the upper 100 m significant northward salt transport was also observed during fall in the upper ocean 50 400 m just below the mixed layer along the coast of sri lanka along 82 83 e fig 19d the southward salt flux of 2 6 psu m s is observed during fall in a narrow band of 10 20 m depth and also below 400 m depth along the east coast of sri lanka this southward salt transport along the east coast of sri lanka is seen in all seasons with varying magnitudes with a maximum in summer and a minimum in spring in the mixed layer just east of sri lanka significantly large salt flux 16 psu m s north of 14 n can be seen along the east coast of india during spring and is associated with the eicc figure not shown the reversal of this salt transport during fall also has a similar magnitude salt flux of 16 psu m s figure not shown fig 20 shows the time series of inter annual variation of depth integrated salt transport across 8 n during 2003 2009 the upper ocean 0 200 m salt transport shows peak northward transport during april may and november december of each year with large inter annual variability fig 20a it is southward during june july again with large inter annual variations but with much reduced magnitude during iod year 2006 the southward salt transport during summer monsoon is due to the ekman transport associated with smc schott and mccreary 2001 vinayachandran et al 1999 this southward salt transport is mainly confined to the sri lanka coast and east of 90 e fig 19c in the upper ocean 0 200 m salt transport shows very prominent inter annual variation broadly consisting of two peaks one in spring and another in autumn fig 20a in the top 1000 m there is also a marked inter annual variability similar to the top 200 m transport fig 20b presence of prominent intra seasonal variability can be seen when integrating transports over the top 2000 m or over the full depth fig 20c d this intra seasonal variability is more active in some years than others i e it varies inter annually the transport for the entire depth also shows large inter annual variability it is worth mentioning that the full depth transports are much weaker than the variability shown for 0 200 0 1000 and 0 2000 m the largest variability is seen for 0 1000 m and the values decrease when the vertical integral covers the top 2000 m or the full depth this suggests a degree of compensation between the variability above and below 1000 m unlike prominent seasonal cycle in upper ocean up to 1000 m depth transport up to deeper depth shows more prominent intra seasonal component as well fig 20c d the reason could be due to eastward propagating oceanic equatorial kelvin waves forced by madden julian oscillation observed using the argo array of profiling floats matthews et al 2007 extend downward to 1500 m and having larger amplitude than the annual cycle they have shown that the amplitude of the deep ocean anomalies is up to six times the amplitude of the observed annual cycle it is worth mentioning that when this equatorial kelvin wave reaches the sumatran coast it triggers northward propagating coastal kelvin wave into the bay of bengal rao et al 2010 heywood et al 1994 have reported a 50 day oscillation in the observed currents down to 3000 m depth in the indian ocean consistent with a zonally propagating rossby wave however more detailed analysis is required to find out the exact reason for the prominent intra seasonal variation of deeper salt transport which is beyond the scope of this study the upper ocean 0 200 m seasonal mean salt transport table 1 is northward in all seasons mam 72 psu m3 s son 42 psu m3 s djf 12 psu m3 s except during the summer monsoon when it is southward 99 psu m3 s the total depth integrated transport is also southward during the monsoon season jja 23 psu m3 s and during fall son 17 psu m3 s it can be seen that large variability exists in the seasonal transport table 1 in all other seasons the std values are much higher in the upper ocean 0 200 m compared to its mean other depth averaged values are similar except in son for example during winter djf the transport is southward for january february of 2004 2005 and 2006 with the highest lowest value of 155 psu m3 s 29 psu m3 s in january 2004 2005 but northward in 2003 and 2007 the transport during spring mam is mostly northward with peak values reached in either april or may and with the highest transport 300 psu m3 s in may 2004 however in some years the transport is southward also with a peak value of 120 psu m3 s in march 2006 the mean fall transport is also northward with a southward transport in either september or october with a large inter annual variation november transport is northward in all years with a range of 30 309 psu m3 s the mean depth averaged transport is however southward during fall in order to see transport variability with depth we show hovmollar depth vs time plot in the upper ocean 0 500 m in fig 21 a strong seasonal salt transport confined up to 50 m depth can be seen as shown in the time series plots during winter summer the strong northward southward transport is confined to 50 m depth the contribution in the strong northward transport during april may as shown in fig 20a is mostly from 50 150 m depths 4 summary and conclusions accurate initial and lateral boundary conditions are essential for realistic simulations of the water mass structure and currents in any regional ocean model one way nesting of the regional model with a global model is one of the techniques to overcome the lateral boundary conditions issue we have demonstrated this by performing three experiments using a nested indian ocean regional model see details about the model configuration in rahaman et al 2014 we performed three experiments in exp 1 we used initial and lateral boundary conditions from the original nested global model in exp 2 we used initial conditions from incois godas reanalysis but lateral boundary conditions were the same as exp 1 and finally in exp 3 we used both initial and lateral boundary conditions from incois godas reanalysis of the three experiments exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 we conducted the one with accurate initial and lateral boundary conditions exp 3 provided the best agreement of temperature and salinity fields with co located and concurrent argo profiling floats observations the mean and variability in terms of standard deviation std of the upper ocean temperature and salinity are drastically improved in exp 3 the mean bias of 3 4 c in exp 1 in the thermocline is reduced to 1 5 2 c in exp 2 and furthermore to 0 5 1 5 c in exp 3 similarly the upper ocean 0 500 m mean bias in exp 1 is 2 1 c which reduced to 1 1 c in exp 2 and only 0 41 c in exp 3 the mean salinity bias in exp 1 is 0 01 psu which is slight saltier compared to argo observations become slightly fresher with mean bias of 0 11 psu and 0 09 psu in exp 2 and exp 3 respectively comparison with gridded salinity and temperature observations also shows similar improvement in the bob needless to say that in addition to accurate water mass structure another prerequisite for accurate simulations of narrow energetic coastal currents is high horizontal spatial resolution in the model coupled with correspondingly accurate bathymetry we compared surface currents from all three simulations exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 and three reanalysis products godas soda3 and oras5 we used oscar analysis which is widely used for the surface current variability and model evaluation studies as a reference and also another analysis product scud the mean spatial pattern of surface currents in the regional model simulations are more realistic than reanalysis products godas soda3 and oras5 when compared with oscar and scud observations in all reanalysis products boundary currents eicc and wicc are weak and wide compared to oscar and scud observations whereas in the regional model simulations they are more realistically reproduced of all the three simulations exp 3 provides the best simulation of coastal currents in bob as suggested by good agreement of meridional currents in central and southern bob with the geostrophic currents computed with temperature and salinity from cora5 2 observations and exp 3 simulations the spatial pattern of monthly variability standard deviation is also captured by all regional simulations but is most realistic in exp 3 compared to reanalysis products godas soda3 and oras5 summer monsoon current smc which is the key circulation feature through which the salty arabian sea water mass enters bob and maintains salt balance in the bob jensen 2001 vinayachandran et al 2013 is most realistic in exp 2 and exp 3 when compared with oscar and scud reanalysis products capture the observed spatial structure but they underestimate smc speed we found the effect of improvement in temperature and salinity at the thermocline depth in the thermocline current as well the presence of anti cyclonic gyre associated with the warm core anti cyclonic eddy in western bob off the east coast of india is most prominent in exp 2 and exp 3 the geostrophic current also shows the presence of this anti cyclonic eddy this anti cyclonic eddy is absent in oras5 probably due to its coarse resolution 1 degree its presence is seen in soda3 and godas but with weak circulation we also discovered a narrow band of coastal currents flowing along the east coast of bob during spring and summer at the thermocline depth in april thermocline currents reveal a narrow band of poleward currents along the north and east coast of bob possibly driven by coastal kelvin wave this boundary current is most defined in exp 2 and exp 3 and weaker in exp 1 godas and oras5 reanalysis products also show the presence of this which is completely absent in soda3 this boundary current changes its direction towards the equator in july and again is only prominently seen in regional simulations and absent in reanalysis products in all regional simulations it appears as a loop current present in almost the entire bob along its boundary except for a small stretch of southwest bob it is worth mentioning that the coastally trapped kelvin wave is well reproduced in exp 1 see more details in rahaman et al 2014 along 94 e and 12 16 n a narrow current enters andaman sea from northern bob kiran 2017 has shown the presence of a strong flow through a shallow 250 m channel named preparis channel pc which separates south myanmar from north andaman the strong current in the regional simulations is due to realistic bathymetry and is absent in all reanalysis products the regional simulations also show strong flow out of andaman sea along 93 e centered at 10 n towards equator this flow is also present only in the regional simulations this also may be due to the realistic representation of ten degree channel in the regional model which is 600 m deep and lies between little andaman and car nicobar kiran 2017 as expected the reanalysis products do not show this flow in many earlier studies it has been shown that 8 n is the gateway to bob basin the smc is an eastward jet along 8 n between 85 and 92 e present during the southwest monsoon and its peak velocity can exceed 1 5 m s 1 associated with this smc northward transport has been estimated to be in the range 10 27 sv 1sv 106 m3 s 1 wijesekera et al 2016 vinayachandran et al 1999 webber et al 2018 this estimation has uncertainty and is an overestimate due to the presence of recirculation cherian et al 2020 accurate simulation of currents in the water column especially the narrow energetic coastal currents results in better estimation of salt transport into and out of bob we found that apart from summer and inter monsoon significant salt transport also occurs in spring and fall particularly near the coast of sri lanka this study also found that during the peak of summer significant salt transport into the bob occurs across 8 n in the 300 1500 m layer depth the salt transport during the monsoon season shows a core along 84 e with peak values of 8 psu m3 s just below the mixed layer 50 200 m the upper ocean depth averaged 0 200 m salt transport shows prominent seasonal cycle with large inter annual variability with peak northward transports occurring during spring apr may and early winter nov dec however during the summer monsoon it is southward most prominent transport is confined to 50 m depth in the deeper layers apart from seasonal cycle intra seasonal cycle also is prominent up to 2000 m and at all depths we hope that these new findings such as the narrow band of coastal currents along the east coast of india at the thermocline depth and salt transport below 250 m depth may provide new insights into the

23758,in the last decades climate change has been accelerating affecting directly and indirectly the environment animal habitats and daily human life earth system models esms are valuable tools for studying these impacts and their performance over coastal regions is critical for understanding how physical and biogeochemical processes are evolving through time and how they may change in the future the continental portuguese coast characterized by an important upwelling system hosts highly productive and nutrient rich regions with a large diversity of transitional habitats and systems therefore this study aims to evaluate and score the esms from the 5th and 6th phases of the coupled model intercomparison project that better reproduce simultaneously physical and biogeochemical ocean properties along the continental portuguese coast the analysis was carried out through the computation of a score sr between cmip historical outputs and data from the iberian biscay ireland ocean reanalysis system at four selected locations along the coast considering two physical and four biochemical variables results reveal that esms perform better for the physical properties than for the biochemical ones as well as lower differences and variance between cmip6 models reflecting an improvement from cmip5 the max planck institute mpi models obtained the best overall classification by delivering a consistently good performance for all variables keywords cmip esms performance evaluation score hydrography biogeochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change is a complex phenomenon that has been intensifying over the last decades with strong impacts on the environment atmosphere land and ocean and human life increased frequency and intensity of heat waves on land and ocean heavy precipitation events droughts ocean acidification sea level rise and irreversible losses in terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems are among others some of the consequences of climate change ipcc 2021 2022 these impacts can vary in time and space so understanding and predicting the effects of resulting changes around the world is crucial earth system models esms are the best tools for studying the future impacts of climate change these models can make up for the discontinuity of observation based data so assessing the several simulated variables is important for further model development and reliable future projection of climate change the coupled model intercomparison project cmip https www wcrp climate org is centered on understanding the past present and future climate changes resulting from natural evolution and the possible modifications caused by anthropogenic pressures this project has evolved over five phases currently in phase 6 and provides a platform for the comparison of several esms in the world in the past decade the cmip5 outputs have been used in numerous ocean studies results have shown that these models can accurately reproduce the patterns of physical properties such as water temperature and salinity liu et al 2022 ruela et al 2020 although the results for the biogeochemical properties are less accurate bopp et al 2013 echevin et al 2020 tan et al 2020 phase 6 of cmip presents some changes compared with phase 5 cmip6 esms are expected to span a wider range of warming responses than cmip5 with equilibrium climate sensitivity values higher than esms from cmip5 tokarska et al 2020 and have evolved toward more comprehensive representations of plankton communities and sediment biogeochemistry séférian et al 2020 nevertheless the horizontal resolution of the oceanic component of esms is generally very coarse ranging from 50 to 200 km which can lead to uncertainty and misrepresentation of phenomena in coastal regions laurent et al 2021 thus the evaluation of the model s performance over these regions is critical for assessing the accuracy of model outputs and understanding how ocean biogeochemistry and climate variability are evolving through time and how they could change in the future the continental portuguese coast located in the westernmost region of the european continent fig 1 is included in the eastern north atlantic upwelling system it is situated in a biogeographic transition zone between temperate and subtropical waters and presents specific oceanographic features the dynamic oceanography of the continental portuguese coast is heavily influenced by seasonal atmospheric conditions portugal is located on the eastern coast of a large ocean atlantic ocean and on the northern fringe of the north atlantic subtropical anticyclone belt affecting the climate and oceanography of its coastal area the interplay between high and low pressure systems during summer and winter generates different wind patterns affecting the ocean s surface circulation and deep levels for example the coastal upwelling on the continental portuguese coast is essentially seasonal between april and october bringing nutrient rich waters from the low to the top layers during winter a poleward flow dominates carrying relatively warm and saline water along the portuguese continental coast the interface region between the cold upwelled waters vertically mixed and the offshore oceanic waters thermally stratified known as the coastal transition zone is a turbulent region populated by eddies and smaller scale instabilities cardoso et al 2019 these oceanographic features impact the diversity and distribution of marine and coastal habitats with fish species vulnerable to climate change cabral et al 2001 vinagre et al 2011 climate change impacts such as the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events can cause changes in the composition and functioning of biological communities with decreased diversity and production cardoso et al 2019 previous studies reported a decrease in temperate species and an increase in tropical species these changes can lead to an increase in coastal pelagic species that compete with and prey on other species affecting the region s sustainability and economy garrido et al 2015 szalaj et al 2021 over the last years several studies about climate change have been developed along the continental portuguese coast some evaluated the impacts on the continental shelf considering different properties such as sea temperature salinity or current velocities which can affect the vulnerability of commercial marine fish bueno pardo et al 2021 szalaj et al 2022 thus although there is high uncertainty on the evolution of upwelling systems under climate change scenarios several studies point to an increase in the number of upwelling events in the next years bakun et al 2015 barton et al 2013 leitão et al 2019 pires et al 2016 sousa et al 2020 resulting from the intensification of upwelling favorable winds and promoting the offshore advection the upwelling of nutrient rich deep water to the surface could favor larval survival nevertheless stronger upwelling currents could wash larvae offshore causing an increase in their mortality pires et al 2016 weidberg et al 2020 most of these studies are based on the use of cmip5 outputs but none focused on a comparative assessment of the cmip5 and cmip6 model s performance in the region this evaluation could help to understand how models are evolving and the possible improvements from cmip5 to cmip6 in this context this study aims to evaluate and score the esms from cmip5 and cmip6 to find which better reproduces the most important physical and biogeochemical ocean properties along the continental portuguese coast a quantitative assessment is conducted by comparing the cmip outputs against data from the iberian biscay ireland ibi https marine copernicus eu about producers ibi mfc ocean reanalysis system provided by the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems https marine copernicus eu for this comparison four points minho mi ria de aveiro ra sado sa and ria formosa rf along the continental portuguese coast were selected based on three aspects the location should be representative of the portuguese west and south coasts the points should be near the coast to test the models under unfavorable conditions considering the esms performance is less accurate in this region to provide conditions for an accurate selection of ocean boundary conditions for studies about climate change impact on smaller coastal systems such as estuaries and lagoons selecting points located in front of some of these systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 cmip5 and cmip6 models this study aims to evaluate the esm from cmip5 and cmip6 that better reproduce the water temperature salinity chlorophyll a chl a dissolved oxygen do nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 along the continental portuguese coast therefore monthly outputs of 11 esms from cmip5 and 7 from cmip6 table 1 were selected to assess the available historical simulations 1850 2005 in cmip5 and 1850 2014 in cmip6 since they were the only ones providing all the six variables simultaneously moreover cmip models have different variants ensembles their designations indexes are constructed as follows realization or ensemble member r initialization method i physical parameterizations p and forcing f in cmip6 taylor et al 2018 the integer 1 a single or primary variant of each model is typically chosen for fair comparisons kim et al 2020 2 2 copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems reliable water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 data are essential for comparison with each esm historical output in order to assess the model s performance the cmems through the marine service https marine copernicus eu provides regular free hindcast data on the physical and biogeochemical status variability and dynamics of the ocean and marine ecosystems for the global ocean and european regional seas particularly the ibi monitoring forecasting centre delivers an operational marine forecasting regional service for the european atlantic area the iberia biscay ireland zone ibi model results have previously been selected as a good choice to represent physical and biogeochemical oceanic variables along the european atlantic region and have been used for different purposes for example for numerical models validation lorente et al 2016 reale et al 2020 for model downscaling chaigneau et al 2022 or as ocean boundaries for modeling studies brito et al 2023 declerck et al 2019 des et al 2019 pereira et al 2022 sousa et al 2018 therefore data from the ibi reanalysis were also used in this study ibi has two reanalysis products the ibi multiyear phy 005 002 https doi org 10 48670 moi 00029 which is focused on the physical component of the ocean and the ibi multiyear bgc 005 003 https doi org 10 48670 moi 00028 that includes data on biogeochemical variables these data are available from 1993 to 2020 with an hourly to yearly temporal resolution and 9 km of spatial resolution 2 3 observational dataset satellite products of sea surface temperature sst and chl a concentration were used to validate the outputs from ibi reanalysis for the continental portuguese coast chlorophyll data were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov data aqua and sst data from the multi scale ultra high resolution mur https podaac jpl nasa gov measures mur the modis projected by the american national aeronautics and space administration nasa is a sensor included in the aqua and terra satellites belonging to the earth observations system eos that captures the earth s surface every 1 to 2 days in 36 spectral bands modis has several products available for the atmosphere land and ocean being one of them the near surface concentration of chlorophyll a the mur is a widely used merged multiple satellite sst dataset incorporated in nasa s program making earth system data records for use in research environments measures with a spatial resolution of 0 01 chin et al 2017 to analyze the modis observations a quality filter to find valid modis images considering that an image is valid when more than 75 of the study area is covered with chl a data li et al 2019 was applied for the year 2013 which is within the assessment period 1993 2014 and has a considerable number of available images after that all the selected images were separated by season i e winter january february and march spring april may and june summer july august and september and autumn october november and december then satellite surface chlorophyll observations were interpolated onto the ibi model grid finally taylor diagrams taylor 2001 were computed for each season to compare the ibi model outputs with modis images regarding the sst the analysis was also conducted seasonally but since mur data is derived from merged multiple satellite sst datasets it was not necessary to apply the filter previously referred 2 4 esms ranking to evaluate the esms performance a statistical comparison between these models outputs and ibi hindcast was performed previous studies laurent et al 2021 rickard et al 2016 have used the root mean square error rmse and bias errors to calculate a score for each property to rank the climate model s capability therefore based on the methodology developed by those authors the rmse bias and correlation coefficient r for each property were used in eq 1 to calculate the score sr which indicates the accuracy and variance between the esms outputs and ibi hindcast 1 s r r m s e b i a s 1 r the lower the sr the better the agreement between esms outputs and ibi hindcasts results it should be noted that the contribution of r in the sr calculus is intended to reduce fallacious values resulting from low rmse and low bias but with opposing or inexistent patterns thus to reach the final ranking and choose the best esm a score sr was firstly computed for each model variable water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 and location mi ra sa and rf shown in fig 1 then the average sr of the 4 stations was computed for each model finally considering each variable the esms were sorted from the best low average score to the worst high average score and the final ranking was then obtained by averaging each variable ranking for each model 3 results and discussion 3 1 ibi hindcast performance although the ibi s good model performance has been reported in several studies over the last decade throughout the study area aznar et al 2016 lorente et al 2016 reale et al 2020 in the present study the skill of ibi hindcasts to reproduce satellite derived chl a and sst was also quantified to assure the good quality of this product within the scope of this investigation s objectives figs 2 and 3 show the taylor diagrams computed to compare the ibi hindcasts with modis and mur observations considering the chl a taylor diagrams for spring fig 2a the average rms is approximately 1 00 μ g l 1 with a standard deviation std between 0 50 and 1 50 and a mean correlation coefficient of 0 50 for summer fig 2b although the rms and std are higher than for spring the correlation coefficient is higher and centered at 0 60 0 70 the best results are obtained for autumn maps fig 2c where rms is under 1 00 μ g l 1 the average std is 0 80 and r is around 0 70 finally for winter fig 2d only a few valid images were found since there was a more significant occurrence of clouds despite this limitation ibi model results can replicate the few available images with an rms and std lower than 1 00 and a correlation of 0 60 regarding the sea water temperature taylor diagrams fig 3 show the excellent quality of the ibi model results in representing this property over the continental portuguese coast the best results are found for the spring maps fig 3a where the correlation coefficient is around 0 95 and the average rms and std are small 0 50 c and 1 00 respectively during summer fig 3b the results are still excellent but r 0 90 is lower compared with the other seasons and rms around 0 50 c or higher and std over 1 00 are the highest for autumn and winter the statistics are similar rms 0 50 c std 1 00 and r 0 95 due to the good results of the ibi model presented in the taylor diagrams for chl a and sst a spatial visual comparison for one day representing each season was performed figs 4 and 5 show the visual comparison of the surface chl a and water temperature between the ibi outputs and the modis and mur data for the 3rd of january 2013 winter the 12th of may 2013 spring the 30th of july 2013 summer and the 9th of october 2013 autumn these days were selected because they were among the ones with the higher number of pixels available in the images obtained from the quality filter it should be noted that the 12th of may 2013 represents a typical situation of upwelling along the portuguese coast considering chl a concentration for winter fig 4a and e the spatial rms is 0 78 μ g l 1 with an std normalized of 0 48 and a correlation coefficient of 0 64 the highest differences between both datasets occur near the coastal region with ibi model results underestimating the surface chl a concentrations by 2 μ g l 1 along the western coast and overestimating this concentration by 0 50 μ g l 1 fig 4i on the southern coast on the one hand these differences could result from some inaccuracy in the rivers discharges considered in the ibi model set up the river discharge inputs for 33 rivers are implemented as lateral open boundary conditions these data are based on a combination of daily observations from the previmer project model results from the hype hydrological model of the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi and climatology using monthly climatological data from the global runoff data centre grdc and the french banque hydro dataset on top of the 33 major rivers forcings an extra monthly climatology of coastal runoff is used to complement the ibi model s fluvial forcing baladrón et al 2022 in addition regarding the supply of nutrients from rivers the ibi model uses an annual climatology from the global nutrient export from watersheds 2 news 2 model which underestimates the nutrient runoffs in western europe and is therefore insufficient to represent the high coastal biological production mayorga et al 2010 thus nitrate and phosphate are introduced into the system on annual averages at the 33 main rivers of the ibi model extended domain mcgovern et al 2022 on the other hand chl a concentrations resulting from satellite observation are frequently overestimated near the coastal regions due to the high content of suspended matter and colored dissolved organic matter discharged from the rivers arun kumar et al 2015 lacava et al 2018 sá et al 2015 which may also contribute to the differences found for spring the differences fig 4j between modis observations fig 4b and ibi hindcasts fig 4f show a general overestimation between 0 50 and 1 50 μ g l 1 by the ibi model in the offshore of the western continental portuguese coast these differences may be related to the wind regime used in the ibi model in other words probably on may 10 and 11 the atmospheric forcing should have occurred with strong northerly winds leading to higher advection of the surface waters near the coast to offshore coriolis effect thus the deeper waters emerge leading to a decrease in water temperature fig 5j and an increase in the concentration of chl a along the portuguese west coast fig 4j regarding the summer and autumn seasons the ibi s model outputs of chl a concentration fig 4g and h are similar to the modis data fig 4c and d and the main differences fig 4k and l are located near the sa station in summer and near the mi station in autumn in the first fig 4k the average rms is 1 14 μ g l 1 the std is 1 51 and the r is 0 66 due to an overestimation of around 1 50 μ g l 1 by the ibi model however in autumn fig 4l since the differences are lower than in summer the average rms 0 71 μ g l 1 and std 0 74 are small and the correlation r 0 70 is high this last result probably reflects the reduced influence of the rivers compared with the winter and spring seasons additionally the satellite observations may be more realistic considering the smaller amount of suspended matter that could interfere with the measurements of chl a the ibi model accurately reproduces the sst in the whole domain for all seasons fig 5 during winter fig 5a and e sst presents a north south gradient from 12 to 18 c with an average rms and std of 0 34 c and 1 04 respectively and a very high correlation 0 94 the difference map fig 5i reflects the very good ibi results in spring fig 5b and f the gradient is similar to winter however on the south continental coast of portugal near the rf station the water temperature is 1 2 c higher compared to winter the spatial rms 0 31 c and std 0 89 c are the lowest and r 0 95 the highest for all stations and the respective difference map fig 5j shows this excellent result regarding summer fig 5c and g and autumn fig 5d and h the spatial distribution of sst is different from winter and spring the minimum and maximum sst ranges from 18 c near the mi station to 24 c near the rf station compared with winter and spring the average rms for summer 0 43 c and winter 0 38 c are slightly higher and the correlation coefficients r 0 91 and 0 93 are lower nevertheless these results are still very good the normalized std is around 1 for both the summer and autumn seasons the difference maps fig 5k and l present a more pronounced underestimation around 2 c on the south coast by the ibi model the surface differences between ibi and mur results fig 5i j k and l indicate a general underestimation by the ibi model this result may be associated with the characteristics of the sst provided by mur that represent the ocean surface layer skin temperature which is highly affected by solar radiation while the ibi model results represent the average of the upper layer 0 51 m of the model vertical grid which should have a lower temperature than the superficial layer under distinct conditions e g high insolation solar radiation causes higher diurnal heating leading to overestimated satellite observations gentemann et al 2009 yang et al 2021 in general the assessment of ibi s model performance near the iberian west coast shows a good match between the model hindcasts and satellite data the high quality of ibi results combined with the lack of in situ data on the continental portuguese coast make this model an important source of reliable continuous data in this context the time series provided by the ibi hindcast will be used in this study for comparison with the esms 3 2 esms assessment the sr score was calculated at the mi ra sa and rf stations fig 1 to evaluate the esms capacity to reproduce the water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 along the continental portuguese coast given the data periods of the ibi outputs and the esms of cmip5 and cmip6 this assessment was performed for 1993 2005 ibi cmip5 and 1993 2014 ibi cmip6 figs 6 and 7 present the sr results for the cmip5 and cmip6 models respectively among the cmip5 models fig 6 for the water temperature the mpi esm lr model presents the lowest sr for stations mi sr 0 34 ra sr 0 20 and sa sr 0 28 while at the rf station is the cmcc cesm model that shows the best result sr 0 39 for salinity the lowest sr at stations mi sr 0 60 sa sr 0 66 and rf sr 0 39 are obtained by the cmcc cesm model while the mpi esm lr model presents the smallest score sr 0 48 at station ra in contrast the ipsl cm5b lr presents the poorest results for these two physical properties at all stations regarding the biogeochemical variables at all stations the mpi esm lr has the lowest sr for chl a the lowest sr is found at the southern station rf sr 0 72 for the do the lowest scores belong to the ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cm5 models where the mi station presents the best result sr 0 28 finally the no3 and po4 are better replicated by the mpi models with the mr version slightly better than the lr version along the coast concerning the cmip6 models fig 7 for the water temperature the ipsl cm6a lr model has the lowest sr at mi sr 0 27 and ra sr 0 39 stations and the mpi esm1 2 hr model at the sa sr 0 38 and rf sr 0 72 for salinity the mpi esm1 2 lr model shows the best results at all stations with the lowest score sr 0 42 at the southern region rf station and the highest sr 0 84 at the northern region mi station on the opposite side is the noresm2 mm model with the weakest matches for these two variables at all locations the mpi esm1 2 lr model better reproduces the chl a at mi sr 0 99 ra sr 0 70 and rf sr 0 90 stations however at the sa station the noresm2 mm model has the best match sr 0 80 the ipsl and mpi models present the best do results with the lowest score at mi sr 0 26 and the highest at rf sr 0 70 the no3 is better replicated along the coast by the mpi esm1 2 lr model fig 7 for the po4 at mi and ra stations the cmcc esm2 model has the lowest scores sr 0 0036 and 0 0053 respectively whereas at the sa and rf stations the mpi esm1 2 lr sr 0 0058 and mpi esm1 2 hr sr 0 0038 have the better matches with ibi model results the scores achieved by the cmip5 and cmip6 models individually along the continental portuguese coast exhibit a similar performance between each station figs 6 and 7 therefore the score sr for each variable was averaged and presented in fig 8 also the final ranks of each model for all the variables under analysis are available in table 2 generally higher differences between the scores of cmip5 models are found when compared with cmip6 models indicating an improvement of the latter the overall variance between the models considering all the properties is 0 95 for cmip5 and 0 50 for cmip6 this result is visually confirmed in fig 8 where blue bars cmip5 present higher variability between models than red bars cmip6 both cmip5 and cmip6 models can represent the water temperature and salinity along the continental portuguese coast fig 8 mpi esm lr and cmcc cesm obtained the best cmip5 results table 2 for the water temperature sr 0 46 and salinity sr 0 60 respectively however for salinity the mpi esm lr score sr 0 66 indicates an excellent result for this property in cmip6 these properties are better replicated by the mpi models mpi esm1 2 hr for the water temperature sr 0 51 and mpi esm1 2 lr for salinity sr 0 62 concerning biogeochemical variables the chl a scores presented in fig 8 show the mpi models mpi esm mr sr 0 92 and mpi esm1 2 lr sr 0 91 as the best esms modeling this property table 2 do variability in the marine environment is fairly captured by the cmip models cnrm cm5 sr 0 34 and ipsl cm6a lr sr 0 47 have the lowest sr for cmip5 and cmip6 models respectively for no3 the mpi models have the best result with the mpi esm mr scoring 0 05 and the mpi esm1 2 lr 0 04 at last for po4 the cmip6 models are more efficient in reproducing this variable since the scores are lower than for the cmip5 models the best esms are the mpi esm mr sr 0 006 and the cmcc esm2 gfdl esm4 and mpi esm1 2 lr all with a rounded sr of 0 005 for cmip5 and cmip6 respectively globally mpi models obtained the best overall results table 2 however the available literature suggests that the final rankings for similar assessments may vary regionally and or according to the variables under consideration for example in a comparison between cmip5 and cmip6 laurent et al 2021 classified the mpi esm1 2 hr as the best overall esm for the north atlantic coast considering two physical salinity and water temperature and two biogeochemical properties chl a and no3 for the ross sea antarctic rickard and behrens 2016 found the mpi esm lr and mpi esm mr as the overall poorest models for this region in addition rickard et al 2016 by analyzing the cmip5 esms for the southwest pacific ocean highlighted the performances of models like cesm1 bgc gfdl esm2m and gfdl esm2g which in this study obtained final ranks of 4 9 and 10 respectively the esms provide several results for the planet meaning that the best model for one location may not be the same for another indeed near the shelf areas esms do not appropriately capture some ocean physical and biogeochemical conditions lavoie et al 2019 some authors holt et al 2017 mckiver et al 2015 suggest that a refinement of the esm grids as well as an improvement of the tidal forcing vertical coordinates river inflows and mixing schemes could allow the models to enhance their results mainly in the nearshore regions where processes such as upwelling occur hence the higher horizontal resolution versions were expected to obtain the best performance which was not the case laurent et al 2021 had already discussed this topic since in their analysis of the northwest coast of the north atlantic some lower resolution esms scored better than higher resolution ones also séférian et al 2020 and zhi et al 2022 stated that neither increasing resolution nor increasing bgc complexity leads automatically to model improvement concluding that a combination of enhanced ocean physical and biogeochemical processes is the best path thus research institutes have taken different approaches to improve their bgc models from cmip5 to cmip6 some groups have updated their models with more comprehensive and complex biogeochemical processes cesm ipsl but others mpi mri have limited them séférian et al 2020 moreover distinct scores and rankings were obtained by esms with the same bgc model as the ibi model as well as esms sharing the same bgc model for instance ipsl and ibi models share the same bgc model pisces however due to different configurations only ipsl cm6a lr obtained rank 1 for one variable do furthermore cmip6 s best and worst overall models mpi esm1 2 lr and noresm2 mm respectively share the same bgc model hamocc table 1 with contrasting results mpi esm1 2 lr obtained the best classification rank 1 for salinity chl a and no3 whereas the best result of noresm2 mm was rank 2 for chl a these results are in line with laurent et al 2021 3 3 esms selection the above results highlight the performance of mpi esm mr cmip5 and mpi esm1 2 lr cmip6 as the best models and therefore their time series were compared with the ibi reanalysis historical periods from 1993 to 2005 for mpi esm mr and from 1993 to 2014 for mpi esm1 2 lr were considered as they are concurrent with the ibi hindcasts fig 9 shows the average time series of the water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 variables for stations mi ra sa and rf generally both esms reproduce the annual patterns of all variables appropriately fig 9 considering the water temperature both mpi esm mr and mpi esm1 2 lr fairly replicate the annual variations r 0 80 with the highest temperatures in the summer and the lowest in winter the rmse is lower for mpi esm mr than for mpi esm1 2 lr 1 47 and 2 28 c respectively with positive bias 0 03 and 1 29 indicating an overestimation by the esms for salinity the mpi esm1 2 lr represents the magnitude of the ibi model results consistently except at the end of the data set while the mpi esm mr presents lower values than ibi outputs the rmse 0 25 and bias 0 05 of the mpi esm1 2 lr model are lower than for mpi esm mr rmse 0 56 and bias 0 47 regarding chl a concentration the best results are obtained for mpi esm mr and mpi esm1 2 lr with low correlations 0 19 and 0 22 and low rmse 0 60 and 0 62 respectively however the bias for the first model 0 12 is 75 smaller than for the second 0 39 indicating an underestimation by the mpi models in fact especially near the coastal areas the model s accuracy in reproducing biochemical conditions reduce due to the complexity of all the biological and chemical processes and the successive approximations and parameterizations adopted by the models laurent et al 2021 lavoie et al 2019 for do mpi esm mr and mpi esm1 2 lr patterns match the variation of ibi hindcasts fig 9 with a correlation coefficient of 0 35 and 0 47 and an average underestimation of 0 41 and 0 59 mg l 1 respectively this pattern agrees with that found for water temperature time series since an increase in water temperature causes a decrease in do concentration regarding no3 and po4 both mpi models reproduce the historical patterns of ibi hindcasts with a correlation of approximately 0 60 the variability of ibi model results for nitrate and phosphate shows that their maximum concentration occurs in the winter months fig 9 the opposite is observed for the summer months for nitrate the rmse and bias of mpi esm mr 0 07 and 0 008 and mpi esm1 2 lr 0 06 and 0 002 indicate a slight improvement from cmip5 to cmip6 regarding the phosphate the cmip5 model presented a smaller rmse 0 007 and bias 0 002 than cmip6 rmse of 0 008 and bias of 0 005 fig 9 highlights a seasonal pattern in the properties under analysis and therefore a seasonal evaluation was also performed fig 10 shows the monthly mean of water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 for 1993 2005 cmip5 and 1993 2014 cmip6 concerning the accuracy of the cmip5 and cmip6 models in reproducing the seasonal variation of the ibi hindcasts fig 10 shows that the main differences in water temperature occur in summer and autumn as mentioned previously the continental portuguese coast is part of the eastern north atlantic upwelling system this phenomenon induces higher surface temperature variations particularly during summer months which represents an additional challenge for the esms and therefore justifies the higher differences salinity presents a minimal seasonal variation along the year with the mpi esm1 2 lr model capable of capturing the magnitude of ibi hindcasts for all seasons the chl a and do seasonal patterns in fig 10 show the mismatch between mpi models and ibi hindcasts mainly in the summer and autumn seasons as for the water temperature these differences may be caused by the upwelling phenomena which is more regular and intense on the continental portuguese west coast in summer when northerly winds occur leitão et al 2019 relvas et al 2007 in the southern region upwelling also occurs but is less frequent and more dependent on local and timely processes such as predominant westerly winds ferreira et al 2022 fiúza 1983 the esms fairly replicate the annual patterns of no3 and po4 with the highest concentrations during autumn and winter in winter the nutrient load to the coast is higher due to the increase in river flow whereas in the summer the increase in biological activity promoted by upwelling leads to more consumption and a decrease in the amount of nutrients cravo et al 2006 picado et al 2014 4 conclusions esms are valuable tools for studying the impacts of climate change currently in the ocean these models can accurately reproduce physical patterns of water temperature and salinity however due to the intricacy of the biological and chemical processes the results for the biogeochemical properties are less accurate this study analyzed the physical and biochemical outcomes of 18 esms from cmip5 and cmip6 to assess their historical performance on the western iberian coast overall cmip6 models obtained the lowest scores and less variance representing an improvement from cmip5 the max planck institute earth system model mpi esm ranked 1st in both cmips by delivering a consistently good performance for the 6 variables proving their excellent capacity to mimic the properties variability and magnitude for the whole period analogous analysis must be conducted for each coastal area before using the esm outputs although it is unclear how the mpi model skill will perform in other locations it is expected that most of the esms will underperform near the coastal regions a direct relationship between model skill and higher horizontal resolution might not always exist since the mpi esm1 2 lr model obtained the best overall results despite not being the model with the lowest resolution of the analyzed set the evaluation carried out in this study can support the choice of esms outputs to use as oceanic boundary conditions to force regional models in studies about future impacts of climate change in this region or indicate which are the best esms outputs to use to downscale global models to regional models and increase the model s resolution close to the coast credit authorship contribution statement humberto pereira conceptualization methodology software validation formal

23758,in the last decades climate change has been accelerating affecting directly and indirectly the environment animal habitats and daily human life earth system models esms are valuable tools for studying these impacts and their performance over coastal regions is critical for understanding how physical and biogeochemical processes are evolving through time and how they may change in the future the continental portuguese coast characterized by an important upwelling system hosts highly productive and nutrient rich regions with a large diversity of transitional habitats and systems therefore this study aims to evaluate and score the esms from the 5th and 6th phases of the coupled model intercomparison project that better reproduce simultaneously physical and biogeochemical ocean properties along the continental portuguese coast the analysis was carried out through the computation of a score sr between cmip historical outputs and data from the iberian biscay ireland ocean reanalysis system at four selected locations along the coast considering two physical and four biochemical variables results reveal that esms perform better for the physical properties than for the biochemical ones as well as lower differences and variance between cmip6 models reflecting an improvement from cmip5 the max planck institute mpi models obtained the best overall classification by delivering a consistently good performance for all variables keywords cmip esms performance evaluation score hydrography biogeochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change is a complex phenomenon that has been intensifying over the last decades with strong impacts on the environment atmosphere land and ocean and human life increased frequency and intensity of heat waves on land and ocean heavy precipitation events droughts ocean acidification sea level rise and irreversible losses in terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems are among others some of the consequences of climate change ipcc 2021 2022 these impacts can vary in time and space so understanding and predicting the effects of resulting changes around the world is crucial earth system models esms are the best tools for studying the future impacts of climate change these models can make up for the discontinuity of observation based data so assessing the several simulated variables is important for further model development and reliable future projection of climate change the coupled model intercomparison project cmip https www wcrp climate org is centered on understanding the past present and future climate changes resulting from natural evolution and the possible modifications caused by anthropogenic pressures this project has evolved over five phases currently in phase 6 and provides a platform for the comparison of several esms in the world in the past decade the cmip5 outputs have been used in numerous ocean studies results have shown that these models can accurately reproduce the patterns of physical properties such as water temperature and salinity liu et al 2022 ruela et al 2020 although the results for the biogeochemical properties are less accurate bopp et al 2013 echevin et al 2020 tan et al 2020 phase 6 of cmip presents some changes compared with phase 5 cmip6 esms are expected to span a wider range of warming responses than cmip5 with equilibrium climate sensitivity values higher than esms from cmip5 tokarska et al 2020 and have evolved toward more comprehensive representations of plankton communities and sediment biogeochemistry séférian et al 2020 nevertheless the horizontal resolution of the oceanic component of esms is generally very coarse ranging from 50 to 200 km which can lead to uncertainty and misrepresentation of phenomena in coastal regions laurent et al 2021 thus the evaluation of the model s performance over these regions is critical for assessing the accuracy of model outputs and understanding how ocean biogeochemistry and climate variability are evolving through time and how they could change in the future the continental portuguese coast located in the westernmost region of the european continent fig 1 is included in the eastern north atlantic upwelling system it is situated in a biogeographic transition zone between temperate and subtropical waters and presents specific oceanographic features the dynamic oceanography of the continental portuguese coast is heavily influenced by seasonal atmospheric conditions portugal is located on the eastern coast of a large ocean atlantic ocean and on the northern fringe of the north atlantic subtropical anticyclone belt affecting the climate and oceanography of its coastal area the interplay between high and low pressure systems during summer and winter generates different wind patterns affecting the ocean s surface circulation and deep levels for example the coastal upwelling on the continental portuguese coast is essentially seasonal between april and october bringing nutrient rich waters from the low to the top layers during winter a poleward flow dominates carrying relatively warm and saline water along the portuguese continental coast the interface region between the cold upwelled waters vertically mixed and the offshore oceanic waters thermally stratified known as the coastal transition zone is a turbulent region populated by eddies and smaller scale instabilities cardoso et al 2019 these oceanographic features impact the diversity and distribution of marine and coastal habitats with fish species vulnerable to climate change cabral et al 2001 vinagre et al 2011 climate change impacts such as the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events can cause changes in the composition and functioning of biological communities with decreased diversity and production cardoso et al 2019 previous studies reported a decrease in temperate species and an increase in tropical species these changes can lead to an increase in coastal pelagic species that compete with and prey on other species affecting the region s sustainability and economy garrido et al 2015 szalaj et al 2021 over the last years several studies about climate change have been developed along the continental portuguese coast some evaluated the impacts on the continental shelf considering different properties such as sea temperature salinity or current velocities which can affect the vulnerability of commercial marine fish bueno pardo et al 2021 szalaj et al 2022 thus although there is high uncertainty on the evolution of upwelling systems under climate change scenarios several studies point to an increase in the number of upwelling events in the next years bakun et al 2015 barton et al 2013 leitão et al 2019 pires et al 2016 sousa et al 2020 resulting from the intensification of upwelling favorable winds and promoting the offshore advection the upwelling of nutrient rich deep water to the surface could favor larval survival nevertheless stronger upwelling currents could wash larvae offshore causing an increase in their mortality pires et al 2016 weidberg et al 2020 most of these studies are based on the use of cmip5 outputs but none focused on a comparative assessment of the cmip5 and cmip6 model s performance in the region this evaluation could help to understand how models are evolving and the possible improvements from cmip5 to cmip6 in this context this study aims to evaluate and score the esms from cmip5 and cmip6 to find which better reproduces the most important physical and biogeochemical ocean properties along the continental portuguese coast a quantitative assessment is conducted by comparing the cmip outputs against data from the iberian biscay ireland ibi https marine copernicus eu about producers ibi mfc ocean reanalysis system provided by the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems https marine copernicus eu for this comparison four points minho mi ria de aveiro ra sado sa and ria formosa rf along the continental portuguese coast were selected based on three aspects the location should be representative of the portuguese west and south coasts the points should be near the coast to test the models under unfavorable conditions considering the esms performance is less accurate in this region to provide conditions for an accurate selection of ocean boundary conditions for studies about climate change impact on smaller coastal systems such as estuaries and lagoons selecting points located in front of some of these systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 cmip5 and cmip6 models this study aims to evaluate the esm from cmip5 and cmip6 that better reproduce the water temperature salinity chlorophyll a chl a dissolved oxygen do nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 along the continental portuguese coast therefore monthly outputs of 11 esms from cmip5 and 7 from cmip6 table 1 were selected to assess the available historical simulations 1850 2005 in cmip5 and 1850 2014 in cmip6 since they were the only ones providing all the six variables simultaneously moreover cmip models have different variants ensembles their designations indexes are constructed as follows realization or ensemble member r initialization method i physical parameterizations p and forcing f in cmip6 taylor et al 2018 the integer 1 a single or primary variant of each model is typically chosen for fair comparisons kim et al 2020 2 2 copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems reliable water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 data are essential for comparison with each esm historical output in order to assess the model s performance the cmems through the marine service https marine copernicus eu provides regular free hindcast data on the physical and biogeochemical status variability and dynamics of the ocean and marine ecosystems for the global ocean and european regional seas particularly the ibi monitoring forecasting centre delivers an operational marine forecasting regional service for the european atlantic area the iberia biscay ireland zone ibi model results have previously been selected as a good choice to represent physical and biogeochemical oceanic variables along the european atlantic region and have been used for different purposes for example for numerical models validation lorente et al 2016 reale et al 2020 for model downscaling chaigneau et al 2022 or as ocean boundaries for modeling studies brito et al 2023 declerck et al 2019 des et al 2019 pereira et al 2022 sousa et al 2018 therefore data from the ibi reanalysis were also used in this study ibi has two reanalysis products the ibi multiyear phy 005 002 https doi org 10 48670 moi 00029 which is focused on the physical component of the ocean and the ibi multiyear bgc 005 003 https doi org 10 48670 moi 00028 that includes data on biogeochemical variables these data are available from 1993 to 2020 with an hourly to yearly temporal resolution and 9 km of spatial resolution 2 3 observational dataset satellite products of sea surface temperature sst and chl a concentration were used to validate the outputs from ibi reanalysis for the continental portuguese coast chlorophyll data were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov data aqua and sst data from the multi scale ultra high resolution mur https podaac jpl nasa gov measures mur the modis projected by the american national aeronautics and space administration nasa is a sensor included in the aqua and terra satellites belonging to the earth observations system eos that captures the earth s surface every 1 to 2 days in 36 spectral bands modis has several products available for the atmosphere land and ocean being one of them the near surface concentration of chlorophyll a the mur is a widely used merged multiple satellite sst dataset incorporated in nasa s program making earth system data records for use in research environments measures with a spatial resolution of 0 01 chin et al 2017 to analyze the modis observations a quality filter to find valid modis images considering that an image is valid when more than 75 of the study area is covered with chl a data li et al 2019 was applied for the year 2013 which is within the assessment period 1993 2014 and has a considerable number of available images after that all the selected images were separated by season i e winter january february and march spring april may and june summer july august and september and autumn october november and december then satellite surface chlorophyll observations were interpolated onto the ibi model grid finally taylor diagrams taylor 2001 were computed for each season to compare the ibi model outputs with modis images regarding the sst the analysis was also conducted seasonally but since mur data is derived from merged multiple satellite sst datasets it was not necessary to apply the filter previously referred 2 4 esms ranking to evaluate the esms performance a statistical comparison between these models outputs and ibi hindcast was performed previous studies laurent et al 2021 rickard et al 2016 have used the root mean square error rmse and bias errors to calculate a score for each property to rank the climate model s capability therefore based on the methodology developed by those authors the rmse bias and correlation coefficient r for each property were used in eq 1 to calculate the score sr which indicates the accuracy and variance between the esms outputs and ibi hindcast 1 s r r m s e b i a s 1 r the lower the sr the better the agreement between esms outputs and ibi hindcasts results it should be noted that the contribution of r in the sr calculus is intended to reduce fallacious values resulting from low rmse and low bias but with opposing or inexistent patterns thus to reach the final ranking and choose the best esm a score sr was firstly computed for each model variable water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 and location mi ra sa and rf shown in fig 1 then the average sr of the 4 stations was computed for each model finally considering each variable the esms were sorted from the best low average score to the worst high average score and the final ranking was then obtained by averaging each variable ranking for each model 3 results and discussion 3 1 ibi hindcast performance although the ibi s good model performance has been reported in several studies over the last decade throughout the study area aznar et al 2016 lorente et al 2016 reale et al 2020 in the present study the skill of ibi hindcasts to reproduce satellite derived chl a and sst was also quantified to assure the good quality of this product within the scope of this investigation s objectives figs 2 and 3 show the taylor diagrams computed to compare the ibi hindcasts with modis and mur observations considering the chl a taylor diagrams for spring fig 2a the average rms is approximately 1 00 μ g l 1 with a standard deviation std between 0 50 and 1 50 and a mean correlation coefficient of 0 50 for summer fig 2b although the rms and std are higher than for spring the correlation coefficient is higher and centered at 0 60 0 70 the best results are obtained for autumn maps fig 2c where rms is under 1 00 μ g l 1 the average std is 0 80 and r is around 0 70 finally for winter fig 2d only a few valid images were found since there was a more significant occurrence of clouds despite this limitation ibi model results can replicate the few available images with an rms and std lower than 1 00 and a correlation of 0 60 regarding the sea water temperature taylor diagrams fig 3 show the excellent quality of the ibi model results in representing this property over the continental portuguese coast the best results are found for the spring maps fig 3a where the correlation coefficient is around 0 95 and the average rms and std are small 0 50 c and 1 00 respectively during summer fig 3b the results are still excellent but r 0 90 is lower compared with the other seasons and rms around 0 50 c or higher and std over 1 00 are the highest for autumn and winter the statistics are similar rms 0 50 c std 1 00 and r 0 95 due to the good results of the ibi model presented in the taylor diagrams for chl a and sst a spatial visual comparison for one day representing each season was performed figs 4 and 5 show the visual comparison of the surface chl a and water temperature between the ibi outputs and the modis and mur data for the 3rd of january 2013 winter the 12th of may 2013 spring the 30th of july 2013 summer and the 9th of october 2013 autumn these days were selected because they were among the ones with the higher number of pixels available in the images obtained from the quality filter it should be noted that the 12th of may 2013 represents a typical situation of upwelling along the portuguese coast considering chl a concentration for winter fig 4a and e the spatial rms is 0 78 μ g l 1 with an std normalized of 0 48 and a correlation coefficient of 0 64 the highest differences between both datasets occur near the coastal region with ibi model results underestimating the surface chl a concentrations by 2 μ g l 1 along the western coast and overestimating this concentration by 0 50 μ g l 1 fig 4i on the southern coast on the one hand these differences could result from some inaccuracy in the rivers discharges considered in the ibi model set up the river discharge inputs for 33 rivers are implemented as lateral open boundary conditions these data are based on a combination of daily observations from the previmer project model results from the hype hydrological model of the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi and climatology using monthly climatological data from the global runoff data centre grdc and the french banque hydro dataset on top of the 33 major rivers forcings an extra monthly climatology of coastal runoff is used to complement the ibi model s fluvial forcing baladrón et al 2022 in addition regarding the supply of nutrients from rivers the ibi model uses an annual climatology from the global nutrient export from watersheds 2 news 2 model which underestimates the nutrient runoffs in western europe and is therefore insufficient to represent the high coastal biological production mayorga et al 2010 thus nitrate and phosphate are introduced into the system on annual averages at the 33 main rivers of the ibi model extended domain mcgovern et al 2022 on the other hand chl a concentrations resulting from satellite observation are frequently overestimated near the coastal regions due to the high content of suspended matter and colored dissolved organic matter discharged from the rivers arun kumar et al 2015 lacava et al 2018 sá et al 2015 which may also contribute to the differences found for spring the differences fig 4j between modis observations fig 4b and ibi hindcasts fig 4f show a general overestimation between 0 50 and 1 50 μ g l 1 by the ibi model in the offshore of the western continental portuguese coast these differences may be related to the wind regime used in the ibi model in other words probably on may 10 and 11 the atmospheric forcing should have occurred with strong northerly winds leading to higher advection of the surface waters near the coast to offshore coriolis effect thus the deeper waters emerge leading to a decrease in water temperature fig 5j and an increase in the concentration of chl a along the portuguese west coast fig 4j regarding the summer and autumn seasons the ibi s model outputs of chl a concentration fig 4g and h are similar to the modis data fig 4c and d and the main differences fig 4k and l are located near the sa station in summer and near the mi station in autumn in the first fig 4k the average rms is 1 14 μ g l 1 the std is 1 51 and the r is 0 66 due to an overestimation of around 1 50 μ g l 1 by the ibi model however in autumn fig 4l since the differences are lower than in summer the average rms 0 71 μ g l 1 and std 0 74 are small and the correlation r 0 70 is high this last result probably reflects the reduced influence of the rivers compared with the winter and spring seasons additionally the satellite observations may be more realistic considering the smaller amount of suspended matter that could interfere with the measurements of chl a the ibi model accurately reproduces the sst in the whole domain for all seasons fig 5 during winter fig 5a and e sst presents a north south gradient from 12 to 18 c with an average rms and std of 0 34 c and 1 04 respectively and a very high correlation 0 94 the difference map fig 5i reflects the very good ibi results in spring fig 5b and f the gradient is similar to winter however on the south continental coast of portugal near the rf station the water temperature is 1 2 c higher compared to winter the spatial rms 0 31 c and std 0 89 c are the lowest and r 0 95 the highest for all stations and the respective difference map fig 5j shows this excellent result regarding summer fig 5c and g and autumn fig 5d and h the spatial distribution of sst is different from winter and spring the minimum and maximum sst ranges from 18 c near the mi station to 24 c near the rf station compared with winter and spring the average rms for summer 0 43 c and winter 0 38 c are slightly higher and the correlation coefficients r 0 91 and 0 93 are lower nevertheless these results are still very good the normalized std is around 1 for both the summer and autumn seasons the difference maps fig 5k and l present a more pronounced underestimation around 2 c on the south coast by the ibi model the surface differences between ibi and mur results fig 5i j k and l indicate a general underestimation by the ibi model this result may be associated with the characteristics of the sst provided by mur that represent the ocean surface layer skin temperature which is highly affected by solar radiation while the ibi model results represent the average of the upper layer 0 51 m of the model vertical grid which should have a lower temperature than the superficial layer under distinct conditions e g high insolation solar radiation causes higher diurnal heating leading to overestimated satellite observations gentemann et al 2009 yang et al 2021 in general the assessment of ibi s model performance near the iberian west coast shows a good match between the model hindcasts and satellite data the high quality of ibi results combined with the lack of in situ data on the continental portuguese coast make this model an important source of reliable continuous data in this context the time series provided by the ibi hindcast will be used in this study for comparison with the esms 3 2 esms assessment the sr score was calculated at the mi ra sa and rf stations fig 1 to evaluate the esms capacity to reproduce the water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 along the continental portuguese coast given the data periods of the ibi outputs and the esms of cmip5 and cmip6 this assessment was performed for 1993 2005 ibi cmip5 and 1993 2014 ibi cmip6 figs 6 and 7 present the sr results for the cmip5 and cmip6 models respectively among the cmip5 models fig 6 for the water temperature the mpi esm lr model presents the lowest sr for stations mi sr 0 34 ra sr 0 20 and sa sr 0 28 while at the rf station is the cmcc cesm model that shows the best result sr 0 39 for salinity the lowest sr at stations mi sr 0 60 sa sr 0 66 and rf sr 0 39 are obtained by the cmcc cesm model while the mpi esm lr model presents the smallest score sr 0 48 at station ra in contrast the ipsl cm5b lr presents the poorest results for these two physical properties at all stations regarding the biogeochemical variables at all stations the mpi esm lr has the lowest sr for chl a the lowest sr is found at the southern station rf sr 0 72 for the do the lowest scores belong to the ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cm5 models where the mi station presents the best result sr 0 28 finally the no3 and po4 are better replicated by the mpi models with the mr version slightly better than the lr version along the coast concerning the cmip6 models fig 7 for the water temperature the ipsl cm6a lr model has the lowest sr at mi sr 0 27 and ra sr 0 39 stations and the mpi esm1 2 hr model at the sa sr 0 38 and rf sr 0 72 for salinity the mpi esm1 2 lr model shows the best results at all stations with the lowest score sr 0 42 at the southern region rf station and the highest sr 0 84 at the northern region mi station on the opposite side is the noresm2 mm model with the weakest matches for these two variables at all locations the mpi esm1 2 lr model better reproduces the chl a at mi sr 0 99 ra sr 0 70 and rf sr 0 90 stations however at the sa station the noresm2 mm model has the best match sr 0 80 the ipsl and mpi models present the best do results with the lowest score at mi sr 0 26 and the highest at rf sr 0 70 the no3 is better replicated along the coast by the mpi esm1 2 lr model fig 7 for the po4 at mi and ra stations the cmcc esm2 model has the lowest scores sr 0 0036 and 0 0053 respectively whereas at the sa and rf stations the mpi esm1 2 lr sr 0 0058 and mpi esm1 2 hr sr 0 0038 have the better matches with ibi model results the scores achieved by the cmip5 and cmip6 models individually along the continental portuguese coast exhibit a similar performance between each station figs 6 and 7 therefore the score sr for each variable was averaged and presented in fig 8 also the final ranks of each model for all the variables under analysis are available in table 2 generally higher differences between the scores of cmip5 models are found when compared with cmip6 models indicating an improvement of the latter the overall variance between the models considering all the properties is 0 95 for cmip5 and 0 50 for cmip6 this result is visually confirmed in fig 8 where blue bars cmip5 present higher variability between models than red bars cmip6 both cmip5 and cmip6 models can represent the water temperature and salinity along the continental portuguese coast fig 8 mpi esm lr and cmcc cesm obtained the best cmip5 results table 2 for the water temperature sr 0 46 and salinity sr 0 60 respectively however for salinity the mpi esm lr score sr 0 66 indicates an excellent result for this property in cmip6 these properties are better replicated by the mpi models mpi esm1 2 hr for the water temperature sr 0 51 and mpi esm1 2 lr for salinity sr 0 62 concerning biogeochemical variables the chl a scores presented in fig 8 show the mpi models mpi esm mr sr 0 92 and mpi esm1 2 lr sr 0 91 as the best esms modeling this property table 2 do variability in the marine environment is fairly captured by the cmip models cnrm cm5 sr 0 34 and ipsl cm6a lr sr 0 47 have the lowest sr for cmip5 and cmip6 models respectively for no3 the mpi models have the best result with the mpi esm mr scoring 0 05 and the mpi esm1 2 lr 0 04 at last for po4 the cmip6 models are more efficient in reproducing this variable since the scores are lower than for the cmip5 models the best esms are the mpi esm mr sr 0 006 and the cmcc esm2 gfdl esm4 and mpi esm1 2 lr all with a rounded sr of 0 005 for cmip5 and cmip6 respectively globally mpi models obtained the best overall results table 2 however the available literature suggests that the final rankings for similar assessments may vary regionally and or according to the variables under consideration for example in a comparison between cmip5 and cmip6 laurent et al 2021 classified the mpi esm1 2 hr as the best overall esm for the north atlantic coast considering two physical salinity and water temperature and two biogeochemical properties chl a and no3 for the ross sea antarctic rickard and behrens 2016 found the mpi esm lr and mpi esm mr as the overall poorest models for this region in addition rickard et al 2016 by analyzing the cmip5 esms for the southwest pacific ocean highlighted the performances of models like cesm1 bgc gfdl esm2m and gfdl esm2g which in this study obtained final ranks of 4 9 and 10 respectively the esms provide several results for the planet meaning that the best model for one location may not be the same for another indeed near the shelf areas esms do not appropriately capture some ocean physical and biogeochemical conditions lavoie et al 2019 some authors holt et al 2017 mckiver et al 2015 suggest that a refinement of the esm grids as well as an improvement of the tidal forcing vertical coordinates river inflows and mixing schemes could allow the models to enhance their results mainly in the nearshore regions where processes such as upwelling occur hence the higher horizontal resolution versions were expected to obtain the best performance which was not the case laurent et al 2021 had already discussed this topic since in their analysis of the northwest coast of the north atlantic some lower resolution esms scored better than higher resolution ones also séférian et al 2020 and zhi et al 2022 stated that neither increasing resolution nor increasing bgc complexity leads automatically to model improvement concluding that a combination of enhanced ocean physical and biogeochemical processes is the best path thus research institutes have taken different approaches to improve their bgc models from cmip5 to cmip6 some groups have updated their models with more comprehensive and complex biogeochemical processes cesm ipsl but others mpi mri have limited them séférian et al 2020 moreover distinct scores and rankings were obtained by esms with the same bgc model as the ibi model as well as esms sharing the same bgc model for instance ipsl and ibi models share the same bgc model pisces however due to different configurations only ipsl cm6a lr obtained rank 1 for one variable do furthermore cmip6 s best and worst overall models mpi esm1 2 lr and noresm2 mm respectively share the same bgc model hamocc table 1 with contrasting results mpi esm1 2 lr obtained the best classification rank 1 for salinity chl a and no3 whereas the best result of noresm2 mm was rank 2 for chl a these results are in line with laurent et al 2021 3 3 esms selection the above results highlight the performance of mpi esm mr cmip5 and mpi esm1 2 lr cmip6 as the best models and therefore their time series were compared with the ibi reanalysis historical periods from 1993 to 2005 for mpi esm mr and from 1993 to 2014 for mpi esm1 2 lr were considered as they are concurrent with the ibi hindcasts fig 9 shows the average time series of the water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 variables for stations mi ra sa and rf generally both esms reproduce the annual patterns of all variables appropriately fig 9 considering the water temperature both mpi esm mr and mpi esm1 2 lr fairly replicate the annual variations r 0 80 with the highest temperatures in the summer and the lowest in winter the rmse is lower for mpi esm mr than for mpi esm1 2 lr 1 47 and 2 28 c respectively with positive bias 0 03 and 1 29 indicating an overestimation by the esms for salinity the mpi esm1 2 lr represents the magnitude of the ibi model results consistently except at the end of the data set while the mpi esm mr presents lower values than ibi outputs the rmse 0 25 and bias 0 05 of the mpi esm1 2 lr model are lower than for mpi esm mr rmse 0 56 and bias 0 47 regarding chl a concentration the best results are obtained for mpi esm mr and mpi esm1 2 lr with low correlations 0 19 and 0 22 and low rmse 0 60 and 0 62 respectively however the bias for the first model 0 12 is 75 smaller than for the second 0 39 indicating an underestimation by the mpi models in fact especially near the coastal areas the model s accuracy in reproducing biochemical conditions reduce due to the complexity of all the biological and chemical processes and the successive approximations and parameterizations adopted by the models laurent et al 2021 lavoie et al 2019 for do mpi esm mr and mpi esm1 2 lr patterns match the variation of ibi hindcasts fig 9 with a correlation coefficient of 0 35 and 0 47 and an average underestimation of 0 41 and 0 59 mg l 1 respectively this pattern agrees with that found for water temperature time series since an increase in water temperature causes a decrease in do concentration regarding no3 and po4 both mpi models reproduce the historical patterns of ibi hindcasts with a correlation of approximately 0 60 the variability of ibi model results for nitrate and phosphate shows that their maximum concentration occurs in the winter months fig 9 the opposite is observed for the summer months for nitrate the rmse and bias of mpi esm mr 0 07 and 0 008 and mpi esm1 2 lr 0 06 and 0 002 indicate a slight improvement from cmip5 to cmip6 regarding the phosphate the cmip5 model presented a smaller rmse 0 007 and bias 0 002 than cmip6 rmse of 0 008 and bias of 0 005 fig 9 highlights a seasonal pattern in the properties under analysis and therefore a seasonal evaluation was also performed fig 10 shows the monthly mean of water temperature salinity chl a do no3 and po4 for 1993 2005 cmip5 and 1993 2014 cmip6 concerning the accuracy of the cmip5 and cmip6 models in reproducing the seasonal variation of the ibi hindcasts fig 10 shows that the main differences in water temperature occur in summer and autumn as mentioned previously the continental portuguese coast is part of the eastern north atlantic upwelling system this phenomenon induces higher surface temperature variations particularly during summer months which represents an additional challenge for the esms and therefore justifies the higher differences salinity presents a minimal seasonal variation along the year with the mpi esm1 2 lr model capable of capturing the magnitude of ibi hindcasts for all seasons the chl a and do seasonal patterns in fig 10 show the mismatch between mpi models and ibi hindcasts mainly in the summer and autumn seasons as for the water temperature these differences may be caused by the upwelling phenomena which is more regular and intense on the continental portuguese west coast in summer when northerly winds occur leitão et al 2019 relvas et al 2007 in the southern region upwelling also occurs but is less frequent and more dependent on local and timely processes such as predominant westerly winds ferreira et al 2022 fiúza 1983 the esms fairly replicate the annual patterns of no3 and po4 with the highest concentrations during autumn and winter in winter the nutrient load to the coast is higher due to the increase in river flow whereas in the summer the increase in biological activity promoted by upwelling leads to more consumption and a decrease in the amount of nutrients cravo et al 2006 picado et al 2014 4 conclusions esms are valuable tools for studying the impacts of climate change currently in the ocean these models can accurately reproduce physical patterns of water temperature and salinity however due to the intricacy of the biological and chemical processes the results for the biogeochemical properties are less accurate this study analyzed the physical and biochemical outcomes of 18 esms from cmip5 and cmip6 to assess their historical performance on the western iberian coast overall cmip6 models obtained the lowest scores and less variance representing an improvement from cmip5 the max planck institute earth system model mpi esm ranked 1st in both cmips by delivering a consistently good performance for the 6 variables proving their excellent capacity to mimic the properties variability and magnitude for the whole period analogous analysis must be conducted for each coastal area before using the esm outputs although it is unclear how the mpi model skill will perform in other locations it is expected that most of the esms will underperform near the coastal regions a direct relationship between model skill and higher horizontal resolution might not always exist since the mpi esm1 2 lr model obtained the best overall results despite not being the model with the lowest resolution of the analyzed set the evaluation carried out in this study can support the choice of esms outputs to use as oceanic boundary conditions to force regional models in studies about future impacts of climate change in this region or indicate which are the best esms outputs to use to downscale global models to regional models and increase the model s resolution close to the coast credit authorship contribution statement humberto pereira conceptualization methodology software validation formal

forcing lsf terms are introduced to the model to represent the effects of submesoscale eddies using the scale separation approach although re stratification is observed at the arrival of the eddy center consistent with previous studies strong mixing and deepening is detected before after the arrival of the eddy center les experiments are conducted to investigate the mechanism behind these dynamical responses and explore the relative importance of the lsf terms the interaction among these forcing terms is shown to be highly nonlinear and the combined effects of buoyancy and momentum eddy forcing dominate the boundary layer response to the submesoscale eddy while buoyancy flux is responsible for the enhanced mixing in the boundary layer our analysis suggests that the momentum eddy forcing can significantly alter the timing of the enhanced mixing and boost its strength through generating strong mean current in the water column that accelerates westward density advection generated by the buoyancy eddy forcing the lighter heavier fluid intrusion brought by the mean flow leads to strong upwelling downwelling enhanced mixing and deepening of the mixed layer before the arrival of the eddy simulations using a general circulation model do not show similar response in the upper ocean because the k profile parameterization used in the model is a function of vertical shear only and cannot represent the enhanced turbulence due to lateral mixing brought by the submesoscale eddy eddy distortion due to its asymmetric decay with time and northward ekman transport generated by the wind stress also leads to substantial differences in boundary layer responses at different locations relative to the eddy center keywords boundary layer dynamics turbulence simulation submesoscale eddy mixing data availability i have shared the link to my data code in the manuscript 1 introduction the surface ocean is filled with fronts and eddies they are commonly categorized into mesoscale and submesoscale based on their length and time scales submesoscale eddies are defined as small scale eddies with rossby number ro v fl and froude number fr v nh of order 1 where v is a characteristic horizontal velocity scale ℓ and h are horizontal and vertical length scales f is the coriolis frequency and n is the brunt vaisala or stratification frequency in the vicinity of weakly stratified surface and bottom turbulent boundary layers where submesoscale eddies are particularly active the generation and evolution of submesoscale currents is intimately related to the smaller scale turbulence in these boundary layers and thus the local richardson number or its vertical profile r i n 2 z v 2 f r 2 also can assume intermediate values in the submesoscale currents mcwilliams 2016 the submesoscale eddies have a typical horizontal scale ranging from tens to ten thousands of meters and a vertical height of ten to hundreds of meters mcwilliams 2019 and are particularly active in the weakly stratified upper ocean i e the mixed layer thus overlapping vertically with the ocean surface boundary layer turbulence sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 submesoscale eddies with scales larger than a few kilometers and yet much smaller than the mesoscale eddy field are commonly observed in the upper ocean pollard and regier 1992 munk et al 2000 thomas 2005 large submesoscale eddies can reach a size of tens of kilometers such as the mediterranean eddies meddy mcwilliams 1985 they primarily obey gradient wind balance where the planetary vorticity is balanced by pressure and advection capet et al 2008 since their motion is less constrained by the earth s rotation submesoscales induce large vertical velocities mahadevan and tandon 2006 and thus were suggested to play an important role in restratifying the upper ocean after strong mixing events boccaletti et al 2007 both the analysis of in situ data yu et al 2019 and high resolution numerical simulations with data assimilation d addezio et al 2020 demonstrated that submesoscale eddy vorticity and density anomalies penetrate well below the mixed layer while submesoscale motions associated with mixed layer baroclinic instability have been studied e g boccaletti et al 2007 fox kemper et al 2008 mensa et al 2013 sasaki et al 2014 callies et al 2015 2016 and parameterized fox kemper et al 2011 the impact of balanced submesoscale motions in the open ocean remains relatively understudied yu et al 2019 recent studies suggest that these flows may play an important role in vertical exchanges across and below the mixed layer base e g brannigan 2016 parameterization for baroclinic submesoscale mixed layer eddies smles was proposed by fox kemper et al 2008 which is cast in terms of an overturning streamfunction that advects ocean tracers within the mixed layer acting to slump isopycnals and restratify the upper ocean the main impact of this scheme is therefore a shoaling of the mixed layer fox kemper et al 2011 simulations with this scheme fox kemper et al 2011 weijer et al 2012 bentsen et al 2013 swapna et al 2015 calvert et al 2020 all demonstrate a reduction in the magnitude of deep mixed layer depth mld biases and an increase in that of shallow mld biases this suggests there may be other dynamic effects associated with the submesoscale eddies that can deepen the mixed layer besides the restratification effect and was not captured by the fox kemper et al 2008 parameterization furthermore the fox kemper et al 2008 parameterization considers the submesoscale eddies as an averaged effect which is a reasonable assumption when the resolutions of the ocean models are coarse i e at 10 km or greater however the computational resources now permit much higher resolutions basin scale ocean circulation models can often have kilometer resolutions and resolution of hundreds of meters in regional models are quite normal such as gula et al 2015 jacobs et al 2016 kamidaira et al 2018 gula et al 2019 d addezio et al 2020 etc now it is feasible for these models to resolve the large submesoscale eddies that have length scales of 10 20 km data assimilation with these submesoscale features are also doable now with the new wide swath surface water ocean topography swot satellite mission that can resolve sea surface height ssh features associated with mesoscale submesoscale and internal wave activities on a global scale d addezio et al 2020 in this study we investigate the boundary layer responses during the passage of a large submesoscale eddy 20 km in diameter using the large eddy simulation les model developed at the national center for atmospheric research ncar due to the enormous range of spatial and temporal scales that must be resolved in order to simultaneously capture both boundary layer turbulence and submesoscale processes the interactions between these phenomena could not be examined in detail until recently with the continuous increase of computational power researchers were able to use les models to simulate the evolution of density fronts and their interaction with boundary layer turbulence using large horizontal domains of 10 km and with o 1010 grid points i e hamlington et al 2014 skyllingstad and samelson 2012 skyllingstad et al 2017 sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 mcwilliams 2019 yuan and liang 2021 while some of these studies i e hamlington et al 2014 yuan and liang 2021 also looked at the effect of submesoscale eddies emerging from density fronts these eddies are on a much smaller scale of o 100m in order to study the interaction of large submesoscale eddies 20 km in diameter and boundary layer turbulence a much larger model domain on the order of 100 km with o 1012 grid points is needed this is currently a task that is not feasible for les models to conduct thus in this study we will use the scale separation approach developed by wang et al 1998 to introduce the effect of a submesoscale eddy in the les simulations through the large scale forcing lsf terms the details of numerical models used for this study the scale separation approach vortex generation method and experimental design are described in section 2 model results are analyzed in section 3 and discussion and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 method 2 1 large eddy simulation model the les model used for this study was first introduced by mcwilliams et al 1997 to study ocean surface boundary layer turbulence by solving the wave phase averaged craik leibovich equations craik and leibovich 1976 1 d u d t f z u u s t π g z ρ ρ 0 u s t ω s g s m where g is the gravitational acceleration d d t t u u u v w is the current velocity vector u s t u s x u s y is the stokes drift vector π p ρ 0 2 3 e 1 2 u u s t 2 u 2 is a generalized pressure and s g s m represent the subgrid scale model the temperature and salinity equations are given as 2 d t d t u s t t sgs t 3 d s d t u s t s sgs s where t is temperature s is salinity and sgs t and sgs s represent the subgrid scale model the surface freshwater flux term is omitted because there is no precipitation during the study period and the surface evaporation is negligible the details on the subgrid scale model can be found in sullivan et al 2007 who introduced the stokes production into the subgrid scale model the conservative wave induced additional diffusivity e g mcwilliams et al 2004 uchiyama et al 2010 is insignificant compared with other diffusivity sources and thus ignored in our model the dynamical equations are integrated in time using third order runge kutta methods horizontal derivatives are evaluated using the fourier pseudo spectral methods vertical derivatives are approximated using a high resolution scheme with a flux limiter to suppress spurious oscillations e g sullivan et al 1996 sullivan and patton 2011 the model has been shown to accurately reproduce observed upper ocean responses to different meteorological forcing with relatively simple ocean conditions e g kukulka et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2017 fan et al 2020 liang et al 2020 due to its periodic boundary conditions along the horizontal boundaries the les model suffers serious limitations in predicting turbulence in inhomogeneous flow fields especially those strongly influenced by submesoscale features to study effects of submesoscale eddies on oceanic boundary layer turbulence lsf is introduced following wang et al 1998 to allow the presence of the submesoscale eddy to influence the les model resolved upper ocean structures and turbulence fields computational constraints preclude the possibility of a 2 way coupling of the les model with a general ocean circulation model therefore a one way interaction approach is adopted the underlying assumption is the scale separation hypothesis it states that the horizontal scales of the large scale fluxes are much larger than the scales of motion that are contained within the domain of the les model such that the horizontal derivatives of the large scale terms are unaffected by the small scale motions thus in this study we deliberately distinguished between the submesoscale and turbulent scales by employing a large submesoscale eddy with a diameter of 20 km and a shallow initial mixed layer depth of 20 m as a result the time and length scales of the submesoscale eddy on the order of 10 days and 10 km respectively are two to three orders of magnitude greater than those of the turbulent eddies on the order of 1 hr and 10 m respectively this arrangement ensures that the large scale advection is at least two orders of magnitude smaller compared to the small scale advection allowing it to be safely disregarded by using the scale separation approach we can account for the submesoscale eddy influence on the small scale turbulence while still keeping the periodic boundary conditions the advantage of this approach is that there is no need to impose vertical profiles of velocities temperature and salinity as horizontal boundary conditions which may cause wave reflections at the lateral boundaries and interfere with small scale turbulent motions inside the model domain the inclusion of lsf of temperature salinity and momentum in the les simulations are crucial for sustaining realistic ocean structures and enables the les model to accurately represent the upper ocean dynamics in areas strongly influenced by large scale motions that cannot be captured in the small les model domain several les studies have adapted this approach such as the work done by wang et al 1998 and large and gent 1999 to understand the deep diurnal cycle of turbulence in the equatorial region kukulka et al 2011 that focus on coastal responses modulated by crosswind tidal currents fan et al 2018 that studied boundary layer evolutions forced by strong horizontal density gradient and whitt et al 2022 that investigated turbulent vertical heat transport across the equatorial pacific cold tongue please note that the scale separation approach may not be applicable in scenarios where small submesoscale eddies interact with boundary layer turbulence in a deep mixed layer such that the length scale of the turbulent eddies is on the same order of magnitude as the submesoscale eddies fan et al 2018 introduced a large scale gradient forcing into the les model to account for strong horizontal density gradient across the model domain using this method 4 d t d t u s t t sgs t u t l x l v t l y l h u l t l 5 d s d t u s t s sgs s u s l x l v s l y l h u l s l the terms in the parentheses on the right hand side of eqs 4 and 5 are the large scale interaction terms for temperature and salinity with the overbar and superscript l i e t l standing for the mean field

simulations within a strong salinity gradient region in the gulf of mexico in this study we expand the equations further to include lsf in the momentum equations following wang et al 1998 6 d u d t f

eddy buoyancy fluxes or eddy form stresses 2 2 hycom the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom is used to simulate the evolution of an idealized submesoscale eddy and generate lsf for the les model hycom is a primitive equation general ocean circulation model applied to large scale regional and coastal studies hycom solves five prognostic equations two for horizontal velocity components a mass continuity equation and two conservative equations that govern temperature and salinity the prognostic equations are time integrated using a split explicit treatment of barotropic and baroclinic modes it employs potential density referenced to 2000 m and includes effects of thermobaricity chassignet et al 2003 a more complete description of hycom physics can be found in bleck 2002 and yu et al 2018 hycom uses a hybrid vertical coordinate system interchanging between z levels near the surface which are parallel layers with equal distance between them to isopycnal levels ρ in ocean interior where the layers follow the constant density contours and σ layers near the bottom which follow the topography the model makes a dynamically smooth transition between coordinate types by using the layered continuity equation and thus can take advantage of the different coordinate types to optimally simulate ocean circulation features in both the coastal and open ocean the k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 is used as the mixing model in hycom for this study and wind stress calculation takes into account of the ocean surface current yu et al 2017 2 3 baroclinic vortex generation the development of a subroutine to generate an idealized baroclinic vortex within the hycom initial conditions greatly benefited from previous work documented in penven et al 2006 as well as spall and holland 1991 in short we generate a geostrophically balanced baroclinic vortex in an idealized ocean on an f plane the vortex is defined by a warm temperature anomaly at the surface that exponentially decays downward in the water column and is in dynamically equilibrium with the free surface and 3d velocity a brief summary of this setup and related equations are documented below using the formulation of a baroclinic vortex documented in spall and holland 1991 and penven et al 2006 that yu et al 2020 subsequently modified the following equations describe the dynamic and thermodynamic fields the density is written as 8 ρ x y z ρ 0 ρ 0 n 2 g z p 0 g e h 1 1 e 1 z h 1 e x 2 y 2 2 λ 2 z h 1 ρ 0 ρ 0 n 2 g z z h 1 where ρ 0 is the mean surface density 1025 0 kg m 3 h1 is the depth of no

simulations the hycom domain is set up to be 540 km by 540 km in the horizontal direction with 1 km resolution and 450 m in the vertical direction with 122 layers 1 m resolution was used for the top 50 m stretched grids are used below 50 meters with the thickest layer of 27 5 m near the bottom periodic boundary conditions are specified for the horizontal directions outward wave radiation and zero stress are set for the bottom the rather large horizontal domain size of the model sufficiently distances lateral boundary effects from the eddy evolution at the model center stratified ocean initial conditions are prescribed for the idealized experiments with a constant density layer from the surface to a depth of 20 m below that layer stable stratification of d θ d z 0 01 k m is prescribed with the thermal expansion coefficient α 2 1 0 4 k 1 weak constant westward wind forcing is applied at the ocean surface for all experiments with wind stress τ 0 006 n m 2 corresponding to a wind speed of about 2 m s 1 no heat flux is used an idealized submesoscale eddy is generated using a gaussian surface pressure distribution as described in section 2 3 and imposed onto the hycom model domain with the eddy center position located 25 km away from the domain center point c the initial eddy maximum surface current is set to be 1 m s 1 with a maximum temperature anomaly of 1 5 c the vertical eddy decay scale is 300 m the initial state of sea surface temperature sst sea surface height ssh cross section of potential density ρ θ and current speed of the imposed eddy are given in fig 2 for illustration after initialization the eddy is advected to the west by a uniform steady current at 10 km day and is allowed to freely evolve with time the model is integrated forward for 5 days with 60 s baroclinic and 6 s barotropic time steps five locations from a to e along the middle cross section of the model domain positioned at 10 km away from each other are selected for the detailed analysis of model results the time series of the lsf terms calculated from the hycom simulations at all five locations can be downloaded at https github com yalinfan upper ocean response to submesoscale eddies for interested readers time series of the eddy forcing terms at location c are plotted in fig a 1 appendix a for illustration les experiments were conducted at the five locations using the lsf as detailed in table 1 experiment 0 is the control experiment that does not have any lsf applied while experiment 7 uses all lsf terms in the model simulation to quantify the relative importance of each lsf terms on the boundary layer response to the submesoscale eddy experiments 1 through 6 are designed so that each experiment uses one of these forcing terms respectively experiments 8 through 10 explore the effect of different combinations of the lsf terms these experiments were also conducted with stokes drift forcing not shown since the effect of langmuir turbulence on the boundary layer response was found to be negligible in all experiments due to the weak wind forcing 2 m s they are not further discussed in this study the les model is configured to have a rectangular domain of 300 m 300 m in the horizontal and 200 m in vertical directions there were 250 grid points in both horizontal directions with a uniform spacing of 1 2 m the vertical grid was stretched with 128 layers and a smallest spacing of 0 15 m is used near the surface to better resolve the boundary layer turbulence mcwilliams et al 2014 periodic boundary conditions are specified for the horizontal directions outward wave radiation and zero stress are set for the bottom and no normal flow is used at the surface weak constant westward wind forcing is applied at the ocean surface for all experiments with wind stress τ 0 006 n m 2 same as the hycom experiment no heat flux is used the model is initialized using the same ocean stratification profiles as the hycom initial condition the lsf terms in eqs 4 to 6 are applied through the whole les domain they are spatially uniform and time varying with hourly increment since the time scale of the submesoscale eddy o 10 day is much longer than the turbulence solved in the les model o 10 minute hourly input of the lsf terms are sufficient for this study 3 results the boundary layer responses to the perturbation of the submesoscale eddy are analyzed in this section 3 1 mixed layer depth in this study we define the mixed layer depth mld as the depth where changes of the potential density from surface are less than 0 1 kg m3 the mld is compared at the five chosen locations fig 1 between the experiments with and without lsf i e experiments 0 and 7 in fig 3 since all locations have the same initial condition and constant wind forcing the mld are the same among them without the lsf black lines however with the approaching of the eddy the mld variations become very different at different locations relative to the eddy center red lines the responses are stronger on the right hand side of the eddy than the left hand side and the deepening of the mixed layer strengthens towards the center of the eddy with point c having the strongest deepening and variation of the mixed layer furthermore the timing of the strongest deepening and restratification is also different at different locations part of the reason for the different mixed layer behavior on the two sides of the eddy is due to the asymmetric decay and distortion of the eddy with time there is more stretching in the longitudinal direction that leads to a more oval shaped eddy after hour 40 and its major axis rotates with time fig b 1 in appendix b the eddy also becomes more contracted in the horizontal with deeper vertical extent more details on the eddy distortion will be discussed in section 3 4 since the differences in mld are small between experiments 0 and 7 at point a and e indicating weak impact from the submesoscale eddy we focus on points b c and d hereafter 3 2 relative importance of different lsf terms in order to quantify the relative importance of each lsf terms on the response of the boundary layer the mld in experiments 0 to 7 are compared in fig 4 these results seem to suggest that temperature and salinity horizontal gradient forcing experiment 1 blue line and eddy forcing experiment 2 green lines are the dominant terms all other terms experiments 3 through 6 when used alone produce a mixed layer that is not evidently different from the one without any lsf experiment 0 since the results of experiments 3 through 6 are on top of each other and very close to experiment 0 we can only see the red lines in these figures apparently linearly adding the mld in experiment 0 and the mld departures relative to experiment 0 from experiment 1 through 6 cannot reproduce the results from experiment 7 that uses all lsf terms especially at point d while experiment 2 the temperature and salinity eddy forced experiment and experiment 7 with all lsf forcing shows deepening of the mixed layer experiment 1 that uses temperature and salinity horizontal gradient forcing gives a shoaling effect clearly the interactions among the different forcing terms are highly nonlinear to investigate whether some terms are more important than others in these nonlinear processes experiments 8 through 10 are conducted to explore the different combinations of the lsf terms we found that the temperature and salinity eddy forcing dominate over the temperature and salinity horizontal gradient forcing when they were used together in experiment 8 detailed comparisons are given in appendix c when the temperature and salinity eddy forcing was combined with the momentum eddy forcing experiment 10 the model perfectly reproduces the results in experiment 7 that uses all lsf there are no differences in the vertical structure of the potential density ρ θ and mld in the water column between experiments 7 and 10 at all five selected locations and the results at location b c and d are shown in fig 5 while the momentum eddy forcing brings no noticeable impact on the variation of ρ θ and mld in the water column when operating alone it can work with the temperature and salinity eddy forcing to change the ρ θ structure in the water column through enhancing horizontal advection the mechanism behind this is explored in section 3 3 3 3 boundary layer responses to an approaching submesoscale eddy we will take location c as an example to explore the mechanisms behind boundary layer responses to the approaching of the submesoscale eddy in this section first we analyze the energetics in the water column through the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget the horizontal domain averaged tke equation can be written as 14 e t t u r t s h e a r p b u o y p p r s t s t o k e s p ɛ s g s where t u r t 1 2 u 2 w z v 2 w z w 2 w z is the turbulent transport term s h e a r p u w u z v w v z is the shear production term b u o y p α g θ w β g s w is the buoyancy production term p r s t 1 ρ 0 p w z is the pressure transport term s t o k e s p u w u s x z v w u s y z is the stokes production term e is the total tke ɛ is the kinetic energy dissipation rate and sgs is the subgrid scale contribution the angle brackets in the above equations represent the horizontal domain averages and the superscript prime denotes a departure from the mean value comparisons of total tke dissipation buoyancy production and shear production among experiments 2 4 and 10 are presented in fig 6 when only the momentum eddy forcing was applied in the model simulation experiment 4 the passage of the eddy has no noticeable impact on the vertical structure of the water column we only observe very weak tke and shear production near the surface due to the weak wind forcing and some weak buoyancy flux and shear production at the arrival of the eddy center when the temperature and salinity eddy forcing is applied experiment 2 much stronger tke generation notice the color bar range is 3 times higher than experiment 4 and associated sharp deepening of the mixed layer is observed around the arrival time of the eddy center indicated by the two white vertical lines and this mixed layer deepening persisted through the rest of the simulation period when the eddy approaches point c around hour 36 the strong intrusion of lighter fluid brought by the eddy leads to convection fig 7b and enhanced buoyancy flux fig 6e and thus a sharp deepening of the mixed layer the water column become uniformly mixed around hour 52 54 fig 7a and the fluid motion in the mixed layer is clearly separated into two regions afterwards with upwelling associated with negative buoyancy flux more upwelling of lighter water above 30 m and downwelling associated with positive buoyancy flux more downwelling of denser water beneath it fig 6e fig 7b this occurs because the potential density field of the eddy fig 2c is lighter denser than the mixed layer density above below 30 m depth thus the intrusion of lighter denser fluid brought by the eddy above below 30 m has led to upwelling downwelling in the water column and kept the water column well mixed the wind generated currents are very weak up to 3 cm s and only produce small shear production near the surface of the water column fig 6h when we combine the temperature and salinity eddy forcing and momentum eddy forcing in experiment 10 dramatically different response of the boundary layer is observed although the momentum eddy forcing does not bring any enhanced turbulence on its own when combined with the temperature and salinity eddy forcing it helps the system gain much stronger buoyancy production fig 6f and shear production fig 6i and the enhanced mixing starts at a much earlier stage this is due to the large currents generated in the water column by the application of the momentum eddy forcing the magnitude of the currents quickly reaches 15 to 20 cm s shortly after hour 12 and intensifies to 30 cm s after hour 24 fig 7c the current vector rotates clockwise with time fig 7f due to the strong vorticity added to the system by the eddy before the arrival of the eddy center the strong westward component of the mean current fig 7e accelerates the density advection brought by the eddy westward if we compare the density structure between the eddy fig 2c and that at point c we can see that the westward mean flow advects lighter fluid beneath denser fluid at point c and causes enhanced upwelling in the water column 10 to 12 hours before the edge of the eddy reaches point c fig 7d this leads to a rapid deepening of the mixed layer by the time the edge of the eddy reaches point c around hour 36 the strong density intrusion of the eddy has led to significantly enhanced upwelling and mixing and a sharp deepening of the mixed layer to almost 60 m in depth with a fully mixed surface layer fig 5d as the eddy propagates farther west we are now looking at two different dynamical processes in the water column in the top 20 m or so the intrusion of the eddy brings lighter fluid into the water column and leading to upwelling below 20 m the intrusion of the eddy brings denser fluid into the water column and causes strong downwelling fig 6f fig 7d the strong upwelling and downwelling leads to enhanced convection and turbulent mixing that keeps the water column well mixed the reason that we see a relatively shallower mixed layer depth shortly after the mixed layer reaches its maximum depth a 7 hour window between hour 46 and 53 shown by the red box in fig 5c d is because the mld in this study is defined as the depth where changes of the potential density from the surface are less than 0 1 kg m3 although the density structure did not change in the water column fig 5c d the intrusion of lighter water into the surface has lowered the density at the surface and thus reduced the mld defined by the density criteria when the eddy center arrives at point c the timing is indicated by the two white bars the density distribution of the surface layer in the water column is dominated by the eddy structure fig 5d turbulence ceased to exist in the mixed layer figs 6 7d and the mixed layer rapidly restratifies to 15 m or so however upwelling and downwelling persisted beneath the mixed layer fig 7d to keep the water column well mixed and that promotes enhanced upwelling and downwelling and thus strong turbulent mixing after the passing of the eddy center the density distribution and turbulent structures in the water column as well as the mld become similar to experiment 2 after the passage of the eddy center figs 5 6 7 as the momentum eddy forcing generated mean flow weakens and the dynamical response in the water column is dominated by the buoyancy flux due to the intrusion of the eddy the reason that we do not see this restratification effect in experiment 2 at the arrival of the eddy center is due to a lack of strong vorticity associated with the momentum eddy forcing that helps to maintain the density structure at the eddy center as observed in experiment 10 3 4 asymmetric boundary layer behavior from the mld comparisons in fig 4 we see that the behavior of the mixed layer is very different on the two sides of the eddy with significant deepening at point b on the northern side of the eddy and only mild variation of the mld at point d on the southern side to better understand the mechanism for this asymmetric behavior two more hycom experiments are conducted using stationary eddy with and without surface wind stress τ 0 006 n m 2 same as the moving eddy case we find that part of the reason for the different mixed layer behaviors on the two sides of the eddy is due to the asymmetric decay and distortion of the eddy with time as illustrated by both the stationary eddy simulation fig 8 and moving eddy simulation figure b1 there are more stretching in the longitudinal direction that leads to a more oval shaped eddy after hour 40 and its major axis rotates with time the eddy also becomes more contracted in the horizontal with deeper vertical extent ekman transport due to the wind forcing is another reason for the eddy distortion the westward wind stress generates northward ekman transport that gradually move the fluid from south to north although the magnitude of the ekman transport is small due to the weak wind stress the persistent forcing is able to shift a significant amount of water to the north and lead to strong asymmetry in the eddy field after tens of hours we can see significant deflection of the eddy towards the north fig 8a c with the wind forcing while the eddy is more axisymmetric without the wind forcing fig 8b d due to the eddy distortion the difference of density structures becomes stronger weaker between the eddy and point b d and thus results in very different mixed layer behaviors between the two locations the momentum eddy forcing is also impacted by the eddy deformation while the magnitude of the mean flow generated by the momentum eddy forcing is comparable at locations b and d the vertical extent of the mean flow is much shallower at d figs 9a and 9c the dynamical processes associated with the mixed layer responses at b are very similar with what we discussed for location c in section 3 3 except there is no restratification associated with the arrival of the eddy center much weaker turbulence is observed at location d fig 9d because the density structures associated with the eddy are not so different from the background only small upwelling and downwelling are generated at d due to the intrusion of the eddy 3 5 comparison between hycom and les the variation of the mld and eddy viscosity k m are compared between hycom and les at point c fig 10 to illustrate the similarities and differences in boundary layer responses between these two models and the need to include lsf effect in mixing parameterizations instead of resolved turbulence as in the les model the eddy viscosity is parameterized using the kpp scheme in hycom that does not consider the effect of lsf on ocean surface boundary layer turbulence and directly outputted from the simulation the eddy viscosity from the les simulation is calculated using the reynolds stress and mean shear following mcwilliams et al 2012 15 k m l e s u w z u l g here u w is the horizontal domain averaged total reynold stress and u l g is the horizontal domain averaged lagrangian velocity as we can see the mld variations are qualitatively similar between the two models the mixed layer deepens shortly after hour 24 reaches the maximum mld before the arrival of the eddy center rapidly restratifies to 15 m when the eddy center arrives and deepens again after the passing of the eddy center fig 10a however the timing and magnitude of enhanced mixing and deepening are very different between the two models the eddy viscosity in hycom is more than an order of magnitude smaller than what is observed in the les model resulting in a much shallower mld the onsite of the enhanced mixing in hycom is also many hours later than the les fig 10c d as we discussed in section 3 3 strong mean flow is generated in the les model that accelerates westward density advection and leads to enhanced mixing and rapid deepening of the mixed layer before the arrival of the eddy however these processes are not parameterized by kpp in the hycom simulation since its mixing coefficient is a function of the surface boundary forcing and the state of the resolved velocity and potential density fields instantaneously in the vertical water column the kpp parameterization is insensitive to horizontal gradients which as demonstrated by the les simulations are the main source of turbulent mixing before the arrival of the eddy thus hycom shows barely any changes in the mixed layer until around hour 48 fig 10b when a sudden deepening occurred that is caused by the enhanced turbulent mixing in the water column fig 10c due to the strong vertical shear brought by the eddy as its center gets closer to point c the comparisons in this section demonstrated the limitations of the kpp type of parameterization that assumes small negligible anisotropy and thus cannot represent the enhanced lateral mixing brought by large scale strong horizontal gradients 4 discussion and conclusion in this study carefully designed numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of a submesoscale eddy on oceanic boundary layer turbulence using the ncar large eddy simulation les model large scale forcing lsf terms based on the scale separation assumption are introduced to the model to represent the effects of submesocale eddies following wang et al 1998 these lsf terms are calculated using the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom simulations with an idealized submesoscale eddy imposed on the model domain the eddy is initialized by a gaussian surface pressure distribution with a specified maximum surface geostrophic velocity following penven et al 2006 and yu et al 2020 advected westward by a steady uniform current and allowed to freely evolve after initialization les experiments are conducted to explore the relative importance of the lsf terms the interaction among these forcing terms is shown to be highly nonlinear and the combined effects of buoyancy and momentum eddy forcing dominates the boundary layer response to the submesoscale eddy the boundary layer response to the eddy can be separated into three stages before the arrival of the eddy momentum eddy forcing generates strong mean current in the water column that accelerate westward density advection generated by the temperature and salinity eddy forcing the lighter heavier fluid intrusion brought by the mean flow leads to strong upwelling downwelling enhanced mixing and deepening of the mixed layer before the arrival of the eddy after the eddy reaches the study location the strong density intrusion of the eddy leads to significantly enhanced upwelling downwelling and mixing with a fully mixed surface layer and further deepens the mixed layer at the arrival of the eddy center the density structure in the water column is dominated by the eddy and the mixed layer re stratifies the eddy is gradually distorted in time with a strong deflection towards the north due to its asymmetric decay and northward ekman transport generated by the wind stress this has resulted in substantial difference in the boundary layer responses on the two sides of the eddy with significant deepening on the northern side of the eddy and only mild variation of the mixed layer on the southern side the findings in this study are consistent with yuan and liang 2021 who looked at the boundary layer responses to small submesoscale eddies emerged from a density front using les simulations while the authors did not look at the evolution of the boundary depth and the eddies in their study are on a much smaller scale of o 100 m they have shown greatly enhanced horizontal mixing in the boundary layer with strong downwelling that implies a deepening of the mixed layer the authors also noted that the eddy induced mixing is anisotropic with stronger enhancement to the right of the wind direction similar to what we found in our study our study has demonstrated the significant and complex impact of submesoscale features on the dynamics and structure of the upper ocean the comparisons of mixed layer evolutions between the les model and hycom illustrated the limitations of the kpp type of parameterization that assumes small negligible anisotropy and thus cannot represent the enhanced lateral mixing brought by submesoscale features that has strong large scale horizontal gradients this also applies to the second order turbulent closure models through observations off north carolina coast savelyev et al 2022 found the turbulence field is dominated by signals associated with submesoscales activities at their study site and none the second order turbulent closure models explored in their study is equipped with the physics necessary to address the submesoscale turbulence challenge during the past two decades new developments of turbulent mixing parameterizations were mainly focused on the effect of langmuir turbulence and many new parameterizations were proposed in the literatures i e harcourt 2013 2015 li and fox kemper 2017 large et al 2019a b solano and fan 2022 etc the effect of submesoscale activities on boundary layer turbulence remains under studied the only available parameterization to represent the submesoscale effect in the oceanic boundary layer for ocean general circulation models is given by fox kemper et al 2011 which is cast as an overturning stream function and has the effect to slump isopycnals and restratify the upper ocean thus its main impact is a reduction of the mixed layer depth mld calvert et al 2020 has shown that this parameterization reduces the magnitude of deep mld biases but increases the magnitude of shallow biases this is because due to the low resolution used in their simulation fox kemper et al 2008 2011 did not observe the enhanced mixing and deepening of the mixed layer during the passage of submesoscale eddies as we have demonstrated in this study they only parameterized the restratification effect at the eddy center as suggested by yuan and liang 2021 future improvement of ocean surface boundary layer turbulence parameterizations could include additional parameters including wind front angle and horizontal buoyancy gradients that determine the depth dependent ekman buoyancy flux geostrophic shear and submesoscale eddies this study also has some limitations by using the large scale forcing terms to represent submesoscale effect in the les we ignored the effect of small scale turbulence on submesoscale features the nonlinear interaction between these two processes may bring further complications to the dynamical responses during the passage of a submesoscale eddy more research needs to be conducted to study the two way interactions between the submesoscale processes and small scale turbulence in order to adequately parameterize the submesoscale effects in large scale ocean circulation models credit authorship contribution

23759,in this study a large eddy simulation model les is used to investigate the effect of an idealized westward propagating submesoscale eddy on ocean surface boundary layer turbulence large scale forcing lsf terms are introduced to the model to represent the effects of submesoscale eddies using the scale separation approach although re stratification is observed at the arrival of the eddy center consistent with previous studies strong mixing and deepening is detected before after the arrival of the eddy center les experiments are conducted to investigate the mechanism behind these dynamical responses and explore the relative importance of the lsf terms the interaction among these forcing terms is shown to be highly nonlinear and the combined effects of buoyancy and momentum eddy forcing dominate the boundary layer response to the submesoscale eddy while buoyancy flux is responsible for the enhanced mixing in the boundary layer our analysis suggests that the momentum eddy forcing can significantly alter the timing of the enhanced mixing and boost its strength through generating strong mean current in the water column that accelerates westward density advection generated by the buoyancy eddy forcing the lighter heavier fluid intrusion brought by the mean flow leads to strong upwelling downwelling enhanced mixing and deepening of the mixed layer before the arrival of the eddy simulations using a general circulation model do not show similar response in the upper ocean because the k profile parameterization used in the model is a function of vertical shear only and cannot represent the enhanced turbulence due to lateral mixing brought by the submesoscale eddy eddy distortion due to its asymmetric decay with time and northward ekman transport generated by the wind stress also leads to substantial differences in boundary layer responses at different locations relative to the eddy center keywords boundary layer dynamics turbulence simulation submesoscale eddy mixing data availability i have shared the link to my data code in the manuscript 1 introduction the surface ocean is filled with fronts and eddies they are commonly categorized into mesoscale and submesoscale based on their length and time scales submesoscale eddies are defined as small scale eddies with rossby number ro v fl and froude number fr v nh of order 1 where v is a characteristic horizontal velocity scale ℓ and h are horizontal and vertical length scales f is the coriolis frequency and n is the brunt vaisala or stratification frequency in the vicinity of weakly stratified surface and bottom turbulent boundary layers where submesoscale eddies are particularly active the generation and evolution of submesoscale currents is intimately related to the smaller scale turbulence in these boundary layers and thus the local richardson number or its vertical profile r i n 2 z v 2 f r 2 also can assume intermediate values in the submesoscale currents mcwilliams 2016 the submesoscale eddies have a typical horizontal scale ranging from tens to ten thousands of meters and a vertical height of ten to hundreds of meters mcwilliams 2019 and are particularly active in the weakly stratified upper ocean i e the mixed layer thus overlapping vertically with the ocean surface boundary layer turbulence sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 submesoscale eddies with scales larger than a few kilometers and yet much smaller than the mesoscale eddy field are commonly observed in the upper ocean pollard and regier 1992 munk et al 2000 thomas 2005 large submesoscale eddies can reach a size of tens of kilometers such as the mediterranean eddies meddy mcwilliams 1985 they primarily obey gradient wind balance where the planetary vorticity is balanced by pressure and advection capet et al 2008 since their motion is less constrained by the earth s rotation submesoscales induce large vertical velocities mahadevan and tandon 2006 and thus were suggested to play an important role in restratifying the upper ocean after strong mixing events boccaletti et al 2007 both the analysis of in situ data yu et al 2019 and high resolution numerical simulations with data assimilation d addezio et al 2020 demonstrated that submesoscale eddy vorticity and density anomalies penetrate well below the mixed layer while submesoscale motions associated with mixed layer baroclinic instability have been studied e g boccaletti et al 2007 fox kemper et al 2008 mensa et al 2013 sasaki et al 2014 callies et al 2015 2016 and parameterized fox kemper et al 2011 the impact of balanced submesoscale motions in the open ocean remains relatively understudied yu et al 2019 recent studies suggest that these flows may play an important role in vertical exchanges across and below the mixed layer base e g brannigan 2016 parameterization for baroclinic submesoscale mixed layer eddies smles was proposed by fox kemper et al 2008 which is cast in terms of an overturning streamfunction that advects ocean tracers within the mixed layer acting to slump isopycnals and restratify the upper ocean the main impact of this scheme is therefore a shoaling of the mixed layer fox kemper et al 2011 simulations with this scheme fox kemper et al 2011 weijer et al 2012 bentsen et al 2013 swapna et al 2015 calvert et al 2020 all demonstrate a reduction in the magnitude of deep mixed layer depth mld biases and an increase in that of shallow mld biases this suggests there may be other dynamic effects associated with the submesoscale eddies that can deepen the mixed layer besides the restratification effect and was not captured by the fox kemper et al 2008 parameterization furthermore the fox kemper et al 2008 parameterization considers the submesoscale eddies as an averaged effect which is a reasonable assumption when the resolutions of the ocean models are coarse i e at 10 km or greater however the computational resources now permit much higher resolutions basin scale ocean circulation models can often have kilometer resolutions and resolution of hundreds of meters in regional models are quite normal such as gula et al 2015 jacobs et al 2016 kamidaira et al 2018 gula et al 2019 d addezio et al 2020 etc now it is feasible for these models to resolve the large submesoscale eddies that have length scales of 10 20 km data assimilation with these submesoscale features are also doable now with the new wide swath surface water ocean topography swot satellite mission that can resolve sea surface height ssh features associated with mesoscale submesoscale and internal wave activities on a global scale d addezio et al 2020 in this study we investigate the boundary layer responses during the passage of a large submesoscale eddy 20 km in diameter using the large eddy simulation les model developed at the national center for atmospheric research ncar due to the enormous range of spatial and temporal scales that must be resolved in order to simultaneously capture both boundary layer turbulence and submesoscale processes the interactions between these phenomena could not be examined in detail until recently with the continuous increase of computational power researchers were able to use les models to simulate the evolution of density fronts and their interaction with boundary layer turbulence using large horizontal domains of 10 km and with o 1010 grid points i e hamlington et al 2014 skyllingstad and samelson 2012 skyllingstad et al 2017 sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 mcwilliams 2019 yuan and liang 2021 while some of these studies i e hamlington et al 2014 yuan and liang 2021 also looked at the effect of submesoscale eddies emerging from density fronts these eddies are on a much smaller scale of o 100m in order to study the interaction of large submesoscale eddies 20 km in diameter and boundary layer turbulence a much larger model domain on the order of 100 km with o 1012 grid points is needed this is currently a task that is not feasible for les models to conduct thus in this study we will use the scale separation approach developed by wang et al 1998 to introduce the effect of a submesoscale eddy in the les simulations through the large scale forcing lsf terms the details of numerical models used for this study the scale separation approach vortex generation method and experimental design are described in section 2 model results are analyzed in section 3 and discussion and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 method 2 1 large eddy simulation model the les model used for this study was first introduced by mcwilliams et al 1997 to study ocean surface boundary layer turbulence by solving the wave phase averaged craik leibovich equations craik and leibovich 1976 1 d u d t f z u u s t π g z ρ ρ 0 u s t ω s g s m where g is the gravitational acceleration d d t t u u u v w is the current velocity vector u s t u s x u s y is the stokes drift vector π p ρ 0 2 3 e 1 2 u u s t 2 u 2 is a generalized pressure and s g s m represent the subgrid scale model the temperature and salinity equations are given as 2 d t d t u s t t sgs t 3 d s d t u s t s sgs s where t is temperature s is salinity and sgs t and sgs s represent the subgrid scale model the surface freshwater flux term is omitted because there is no precipitation during the study period and the surface evaporation is negligible the details on the subgrid scale model can be found in sullivan et al 2007 who introduced the stokes production into the subgrid scale model the conservative wave induced additional diffusivity e g mcwilliams et al 2004 uchiyama et al 2010 is insignificant compared with other diffusivity sources and thus ignored in our model the dynamical equations are integrated in time using third order runge kutta methods horizontal derivatives are evaluated using the fourier pseudo spectral methods vertical derivatives are approximated using a high resolution scheme with a flux limiter to suppress spurious oscillations e g sullivan et al 1996 sullivan and patton 2011 the model has been shown to accurately reproduce observed upper ocean responses to different meteorological forcing with relatively simple ocean conditions e g kukulka et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2017 fan et al 2020 liang et al 2020 due to its periodic boundary conditions along the horizontal boundaries the les model suffers serious limitations in predicting turbulence in inhomogeneous flow fields especially those strongly influenced by submesoscale features to study effects of submesoscale eddies on oceanic boundary layer turbulence lsf is introduced following wang et al 1998 to allow the presence of the submesoscale eddy to influence the les model resolved upper ocean structures and turbulence fields computational constraints preclude the possibility of a 2 way coupling of the les model with a general ocean circulation model therefore a one way interaction approach is adopted the underlying assumption is the scale separation hypothesis it states that the horizontal scales of the large scale fluxes are much larger than the scales of motion that are contained within the domain of the les model such that the horizontal derivatives of the large scale terms are unaffected by the small scale motions thus in this study we deliberately distinguished between the submesoscale and turbulent scales by employing a large submesoscale eddy with a diameter of 20 km and a shallow initial mixed layer depth of 20 m as a result the time and length scales of the submesoscale eddy on the order of 10 days and 10 km respectively are two to three orders of magnitude greater than those of the turbulent eddies on the order of 1 hr and 10 m respectively this arrangement ensures that the large scale advection is at least two orders of magnitude smaller compared to the small scale advection allowing it to be safely disregarded by using the scale separation approach we can account for the submesoscale eddy influence on the small scale turbulence while still keeping the periodic boundary conditions the advantage of this approach is that there is no need to impose vertical profiles of velocities temperature and salinity as horizontal boundary conditions which may cause wave reflections at the lateral boundaries and interfere with small scale turbulent motions inside the model domain the inclusion of lsf of temperature salinity and momentum in the les simulations are crucial for sustaining realistic ocean structures and enables the les model to accurately represent the upper ocean dynamics in areas strongly influenced by large scale motions that cannot be captured in the small les model domain several les studies have adapted this approach such as the work done by wang et al 1998 and large and gent 1999 to understand the deep diurnal cycle of turbulence in the equatorial region kukulka et al 2011 that focus on coastal responses modulated by crosswind tidal currents fan et al 2018 that studied boundary layer evolutions forced by strong horizontal density gradient and whitt et al 2022 that investigated turbulent vertical heat transport across the equatorial pacific cold tongue please note that the scale separation approach may not be applicable in scenarios where small submesoscale eddies interact with boundary layer turbulence in a deep mixed layer such that the length scale of the turbulent eddies is on the same order of magnitude as the submesoscale eddies fan et al 2018 introduced a large scale gradient forcing into the les model to account for strong horizontal density gradient across the model domain using this method 4 d t d t u s t t sgs t u t l x l v t l y l h u l t l 5 d s d t u s t s sgs s u s l x l v s l y l h u l s l the terms in the parentheses on the right hand side of eqs 4 and 5 are the large scale interaction terms for temperature and salinity with the overbar and superscript l i e t l standing for the mean field

eddy buoyancy fluxes or eddy form stresses 2 2 hycom the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom is used to simulate the evolution of an idealized submesoscale eddy and generate lsf for the les model hycom is a primitive equation general ocean circulation model applied to large scale regional and coastal studies hycom solves five prognostic equations two for horizontal velocity components a mass continuity equation and two conservative equations that govern temperature and salinity the prognostic equations are time integrated using a split explicit treatment of barotropic and baroclinic modes it employs potential density referenced to 2000 m and includes effects of thermobaricity chassignet et al 2003 a more complete description of hycom physics can be found in bleck 2002 and yu et al 2018 hycom uses a hybrid vertical coordinate system interchanging between z levels near the surface which are parallel layers with equal distance between them to isopycnal levels ρ in ocean interior where the layers follow the constant density contours and σ layers near the bottom which follow the topography the model makes a dynamically smooth transition between coordinate types by using the layered continuity equation and thus can take advantage of the different coordinate types to optimally simulate ocean circulation features in both the coastal and open ocean the k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 is used as the mixing model in hycom for this study and wind stress calculation takes into account of the ocean surface current yu et al 2017 2 3 baroclinic vortex generation the development of a subroutine to generate an idealized baroclinic vortex within the hycom initial conditions greatly benefited from previous work documented in penven et al 2006 as well as spall and holland 1991 in short we generate a geostrophically balanced baroclinic vortex in an idealized ocean on an f plane the vortex is defined by a warm temperature anomaly at the surface that exponentially decays downward in the water column and is in dynamically equilibrium with the free surface and 3d velocity a brief summary of this setup and related equations are documented below using the formulation of a baroclinic vortex documented in spall and holland 1991 and penven et al 2006 that yu et al 2020 subsequently modified the following equations describe the dynamic and thermodynamic fields the density is written as 8 ρ x y z ρ 0 ρ 0 n 2 g z p 0 g e h 1 1 e 1 z h 1 e x 2 y 2 2 λ 2 z h 1 ρ 0 ρ 0 n 2 g z z h 1 where ρ 0 is the mean surface density 1025 0 kg m 3 h1 is the depth of no

simulations the hycom domain is set up to be 540 km by 540 km in the horizontal direction with 1 km resolution and 450 m in the vertical direction with 122 layers 1 m resolution was used for the top 50 m stretched grids are used below 50 meters with the thickest layer of 27 5 m near the bottom periodic boundary conditions are specified for the horizontal directions outward wave radiation and zero stress are set for the bottom the rather large horizontal domain size of the model sufficiently distances lateral boundary effects from the eddy evolution at the model center stratified ocean initial conditions are prescribed for the idealized experiments with a constant density layer from the surface to a depth of 20 m below that layer stable stratification of d θ d z 0 01 k m is prescribed with the thermal expansion coefficient α 2 1 0 4 k 1 weak constant westward wind forcing is applied at the ocean surface for all experiments with wind stress τ 0 006 n m 2 corresponding to a wind speed of about 2 m s 1 no heat flux is used an idealized submesoscale eddy is generated using a gaussian surface pressure distribution as described in section 2 3 and imposed onto the hycom model domain with the eddy center position located 25 km away from the domain center point c the initial eddy maximum surface current is set to be 1 m s 1 with a maximum temperature anomaly of 1 5 c the vertical eddy decay scale is 300 m the initial state of sea surface temperature sst sea surface height ssh cross section of potential density ρ θ and current speed of the imposed eddy are given in fig 2 for illustration after initialization the eddy is advected to the west by a uniform steady current at 10 km day and is allowed to freely evolve with time the model is integrated forward for 5 days with 60 s baroclinic and 6 s barotropic time steps five locations from a to e along the middle cross section of the model domain positioned at 10 km away from each other are selected for the detailed analysis of model results the time series of the lsf terms calculated from the hycom simulations at all five locations can be downloaded at https github com yalinfan upper ocean response to submesoscale eddies for interested readers time series of the eddy forcing terms at location c are plotted in fig a 1 appendix a for illustration les experiments were conducted at the five locations using the lsf as detailed in table 1 experiment 0 is the control experiment that does not have any lsf applied while experiment 7 uses all lsf terms in the model simulation to quantify the relative importance of each lsf terms on the boundary layer response to the submesoscale eddy experiments 1 through 6 are designed so that each experiment uses one of these forcing terms respectively experiments 8 through 10 explore the effect of different combinations of the lsf terms these experiments were also conducted with stokes drift forcing not shown since the effect of langmuir turbulence on the boundary layer response was found to be negligible in all experiments due to the weak wind forcing 2 m s they are not further discussed in this study the les model is configured to have a rectangular domain of 300 m 300 m in the horizontal and 200 m in vertical directions there were 250 grid points in both horizontal directions with a uniform spacing of 1 2 m the vertical grid was stretched with 128 layers and a smallest spacing of 0 15 m is used near the surface to better resolve the boundary layer turbulence mcwilliams et al 2014 periodic boundary conditions are specified for the horizontal directions outward wave radiation and zero stress are set for the bottom and no normal flow is used at the surface weak constant westward wind forcing is applied at the ocean surface for all experiments with wind stress τ 0 006 n m 2 same as the hycom experiment no heat flux is used the model is initialized using the same ocean stratification profiles as the hycom initial condition the lsf terms in eqs 4 to 6 are applied through the whole les domain they are spatially uniform and time varying with hourly increment since the time scale of the submesoscale eddy o 10 day is much longer than the turbulence solved in the les model o 10 minute hourly input of the lsf terms are sufficient for this study 3 results the boundary layer responses to the perturbation of the submesoscale eddy are analyzed in this section 3 1 mixed layer depth in this study we define the mixed layer depth mld as the depth where changes of the potential density from surface are less than 0 1 kg m3 the mld is compared at the five chosen locations fig 1 between the experiments with and without lsf i e experiments 0 and 7 in fig 3 since all locations have the same initial condition and constant wind forcing the mld are the same among them without the lsf black lines however with the approaching of the eddy the mld variations become very different at different locations relative to the eddy center red lines the responses are stronger on the right hand side of the eddy than the left hand side and the deepening of the mixed layer strengthens towards the center of the eddy with point c having the strongest deepening and variation of the mixed layer furthermore the timing of the strongest deepening and restratification is also different at different locations part of the reason for the different mixed layer behavior on the two sides of the eddy is due to the asymmetric decay and distortion of the eddy with time there is more stretching in the longitudinal direction that leads to a more oval shaped eddy after hour 40 and its major axis rotates with time fig b 1 in appendix b the eddy also becomes more contracted in the horizontal with deeper vertical extent more details on the eddy distortion will be discussed in section 3 4 since the differences in mld are small between experiments 0 and 7 at point a and e indicating weak impact from the submesoscale eddy we focus on points b c and d hereafter 3 2 relative importance of different lsf terms in order to quantify the relative importance of each lsf terms on the response of the boundary layer the mld in experiments 0 to 7 are compared in fig 4 these results seem to suggest that temperature and salinity horizontal gradient forcing experiment 1 blue line and eddy forcing experiment 2 green lines are the dominant terms all other terms experiments 3 through 6 when used alone produce a mixed layer that is not evidently different from the one without any lsf experiment 0 since the results of experiments 3 through 6 are on top of each other and very close to experiment 0 we can only see the red lines in these figures apparently linearly adding the mld in experiment 0 and the mld departures relative to experiment 0 from experiment 1 through 6 cannot reproduce the results from experiment 7 that uses all lsf terms especially at point d while experiment 2 the temperature and salinity eddy forced experiment and experiment 7 with all lsf forcing shows deepening of the mixed layer experiment 1 that uses temperature and salinity horizontal gradient forcing gives a shoaling effect clearly the interactions among the different forcing terms are highly nonlinear to investigate whether some terms are more important than others in these nonlinear processes experiments 8 through 10 are conducted to explore the different combinations of the lsf terms we found that the temperature and salinity eddy forcing dominate over the temperature and salinity horizontal gradient forcing when they were used together in experiment 8 detailed comparisons are given in appendix c when the temperature and salinity eddy forcing was combined with the momentum eddy forcing experiment 10 the model perfectly reproduces the results in experiment 7 that uses all lsf there are no differences in the vertical structure of the potential density ρ θ and mld in the water column between experiments 7 and 10 at all five selected locations and the results at location b c and d are shown in fig 5 while the momentum eddy forcing brings no noticeable impact on the variation of ρ θ and mld in the water column when operating alone it can work with the temperature and salinity eddy forcing to change the ρ θ structure in the water column through enhancing horizontal advection the mechanism behind this is explored in section 3 3 3 3 boundary layer responses to an approaching submesoscale eddy we will take location c as an example to explore the mechanisms behind boundary layer responses to the approaching of the submesoscale eddy in this section first we analyze the energetics in the water column through the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget the horizontal domain averaged tke equation can be written as 14 e t t u r t s h e a r p b u o y p p r s t s t o k e s p ɛ s g s where t u r t 1 2 u 2 w z v 2 w z w 2 w z is the turbulent transport term s h e a r p u w u z v w v z is the shear production term b u o y p α g θ w β g s w is the buoyancy production term p r s t 1 ρ 0 p w z is the pressure transport term s t o k e s p u w u s x z v w u s y z is the stokes production term e is the total tke ɛ is the kinetic energy dissipation rate and sgs is the subgrid scale contribution the angle brackets in the above equations represent the horizontal domain averages and the superscript prime denotes a departure from the mean value comparisons of total tke dissipation buoyancy production and shear production among experiments 2 4 and 10 are presented in fig 6 when only the momentum eddy forcing was applied in the model simulation experiment 4 the passage of the eddy has no noticeable impact on the vertical structure of the water column we only observe very weak tke and shear production near the surface due to the weak wind forcing and some weak buoyancy flux and shear production at the arrival of the eddy center when the temperature and salinity eddy forcing is applied experiment 2 much stronger tke generation notice the color bar range is 3 times higher than experiment 4 and associated sharp deepening of the mixed layer is observed around the arrival time of the eddy center indicated by the two white vertical lines and this mixed layer deepening persisted through the rest of the simulation period when the eddy approaches point c around hour 36 the strong intrusion of lighter fluid brought by the eddy leads to convection fig 7b and enhanced buoyancy flux fig 6e and thus a sharp deepening of the mixed layer the water column become uniformly mixed around hour 52 54 fig 7a and the fluid motion in the mixed layer is clearly separated into two regions afterwards with upwelling associated with negative buoyancy flux more upwelling of lighter water above 30 m and downwelling associated with positive buoyancy flux more downwelling of denser water beneath it fig 6e fig 7b this occurs because the potential density field of the eddy fig 2c is lighter denser than the mixed layer density above below 30 m depth thus the intrusion of lighter denser fluid brought by the eddy above below 30 m has led to upwelling downwelling in the water column and kept the water column well mixed the wind generated currents are very weak up to 3 cm s and only produce small shear production near the surface of the water column fig 6h when we combine the temperature and salinity eddy forcing and momentum eddy forcing in experiment 10 dramatically different response of the boundary layer is observed although the momentum eddy forcing does not bring any enhanced turbulence on its own when combined with the temperature and salinity eddy forcing it helps the system gain much stronger buoyancy production fig 6f and shear production fig 6i and the enhanced mixing starts at a much earlier stage this is due to the large currents generated in the water column by the application of the momentum eddy forcing the magnitude of the currents quickly reaches 15 to 20 cm s shortly after hour 12 and intensifies to 30 cm s after hour 24 fig 7c the current vector rotates clockwise with time fig 7f due to the strong vorticity added to the system by the eddy before the arrival of the eddy center the strong westward component of the mean current fig 7e accelerates the density advection brought by the eddy westward if we compare the density structure between the eddy fig 2c and that at point c we can see that the westward mean flow advects lighter fluid beneath denser fluid at point c and causes enhanced upwelling in the water column 10 to 12 hours before the edge of the eddy reaches point c fig 7d this leads to a rapid deepening of the mixed layer by the time the edge of the eddy reaches point c around hour 36 the strong density intrusion of the eddy has led to significantly enhanced upwelling and mixing and a sharp deepening of the mixed layer to almost 60 m in depth with a fully mixed surface layer fig 5d as the eddy propagates farther west we are now looking at two different dynamical processes in the water column in the top 20 m or so the intrusion of the eddy brings lighter fluid into the water column and leading to upwelling below 20 m the intrusion of the eddy brings denser fluid into the water column and causes strong downwelling fig 6f fig 7d the strong upwelling and downwelling leads to enhanced convection and turbulent mixing that keeps the water column well mixed the reason that we see a relatively shallower mixed layer depth shortly after the mixed layer reaches its maximum depth a 7 hour window between hour 46 and 53 shown by the red box in fig 5c d is because the mld in this study is defined as the depth where changes of the potential density from the surface are less than 0 1 kg m3 although the density structure did not change in the water column fig 5c d the intrusion of lighter water into the surface has lowered the density at the surface and thus reduced the mld defined by the density criteria when the eddy center arrives at point c the timing is indicated by the two white bars the density distribution of the surface layer in the water column is dominated by the eddy structure fig 5d turbulence ceased to exist in the mixed layer figs 6 7d and the mixed layer rapidly restratifies to 15 m or so however upwelling and downwelling persisted beneath the mixed layer fig 7d to keep the water column well mixed and that promotes enhanced upwelling and downwelling and thus strong turbulent mixing after the passing of the eddy center the density distribution and turbulent structures in the water column as well as the mld become similar to experiment 2 after the passage of the eddy center figs 5 6 7 as the momentum eddy forcing generated mean flow weakens and the dynamical response in the water column is dominated by the buoyancy flux due to the intrusion of the eddy the reason that we do not see this restratification effect in experiment 2 at the arrival of the eddy center is due to a lack of strong vorticity associated with the momentum eddy forcing that helps to maintain the density structure at the eddy center as observed in experiment 10 3 4 asymmetric boundary layer behavior from the mld comparisons in fig 4 we see that the behavior of the mixed layer is very different on the two sides of the eddy with significant deepening at point b on the northern side of the eddy and only mild variation of the mld at point d on the southern side to better understand the mechanism for this asymmetric behavior two more hycom experiments are conducted using stationary eddy with and without surface wind stress τ 0 006 n m 2 same as the moving eddy case we find that part of the reason for the different mixed layer behaviors on the two sides of the eddy is due to the asymmetric decay and distortion of the eddy with time as illustrated by both the stationary eddy simulation fig 8 and moving eddy simulation figure b1 there are more stretching in the longitudinal direction that leads to a more oval shaped eddy after hour 40 and its major axis rotates with time the eddy also becomes more contracted in the horizontal with deeper vertical extent ekman transport due to the wind forcing is another reason for the eddy distortion the westward wind stress generates northward ekman transport that gradually move the fluid from south to north although the magnitude of the ekman transport is small due to the weak wind stress the persistent forcing is able to shift a significant amount of water to the north and lead to strong asymmetry in the eddy field after tens of hours we can see significant deflection of the eddy towards the north fig 8a c with the wind forcing while the eddy is more axisymmetric without the wind forcing fig 8b d due to the eddy distortion the difference of density structures becomes stronger weaker between the eddy and point b d and thus results in very different mixed layer behaviors between the two locations the momentum eddy forcing is also impacted by the eddy deformation while the magnitude of the mean flow generated by the momentum eddy forcing is comparable at locations b and d the vertical extent of the mean flow is much shallower at d figs 9a and 9c the dynamical processes associated with the mixed layer responses at b are very similar with what we discussed for location c in section 3 3 except there is no restratification associated with the arrival of the eddy center much weaker turbulence is observed at location d fig 9d because the density structures associated with the eddy are not so different from the background only small upwelling and downwelling are generated at d due to the intrusion of the eddy 3 5 comparison between hycom and les the variation of the mld and eddy viscosity k m are compared between hycom and les at point c fig 10 to illustrate the similarities and differences in boundary layer responses between these two models and the need to include lsf effect in mixing parameterizations instead of resolved turbulence as in the les model the eddy viscosity is parameterized using the kpp scheme in hycom that does not consider the effect of lsf on ocean surface boundary layer turbulence and directly outputted from the simulation the eddy viscosity from the les simulation is calculated using the reynolds stress and mean shear following mcwilliams et al 2012 15 k m l e s u w z u l g here u w is the horizontal domain averaged total reynold stress and u l g is the horizontal domain averaged lagrangian velocity as we can see the mld variations are qualitatively similar between the two models the mixed layer deepens shortly after hour 24 reaches the maximum mld before the arrival of the eddy center rapidly restratifies to 15 m when the eddy center arrives and deepens again after the passing of the eddy center fig 10a however the timing and magnitude of enhanced mixing and deepening are very different between the two models the eddy viscosity in hycom is more than an order of magnitude smaller than what is observed in the les model resulting in a much shallower mld the onsite of the enhanced mixing in hycom is also many hours later than the les fig 10c d as we discussed in section 3 3 strong mean flow is generated in the les model that accelerates westward density advection and leads to enhanced mixing and rapid deepening of the mixed layer before the arrival of the eddy however these processes are not parameterized by kpp in the hycom simulation since its mixing coefficient is a function of the surface boundary forcing and the state of the resolved velocity and potential density fields instantaneously in the vertical water column the kpp parameterization is insensitive to horizontal gradients which as demonstrated by the les simulations are the main source of turbulent mixing before the arrival of the eddy thus hycom shows barely any changes in the mixed layer until around hour 48 fig 10b when a sudden deepening occurred that is caused by the enhanced turbulent mixing in the water column fig 10c due to the strong vertical shear brought by the eddy as its center gets closer to point c the comparisons in this section demonstrated the limitations of the kpp type of parameterization that assumes small negligible anisotropy and thus cannot represent the enhanced lateral mixing brought by large scale strong horizontal gradients 4 discussion and conclusion in this study carefully designed numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of a submesoscale eddy on oceanic boundary layer turbulence using the ncar large eddy simulation les model large scale forcing lsf terms based on the scale separation assumption are introduced to the model to represent the effects of submesocale eddies following wang et al 1998 these lsf terms are calculated using the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom simulations with an idealized submesoscale eddy imposed on the model domain the eddy is initialized by a gaussian surface pressure distribution with a specified maximum surface geostrophic velocity following penven et al 2006 and yu et al 2020 advected westward by a steady uniform current and allowed to freely evolve after initialization les experiments are conducted to explore the relative importance of the lsf terms the interaction among these forcing terms is shown to be highly nonlinear and the combined effects of buoyancy and momentum eddy forcing dominates the boundary layer response to the submesoscale eddy the boundary layer response to the eddy can be separated into three stages before the arrival of the eddy momentum eddy forcing generates strong mean current in the water column that accelerate westward density advection generated by the temperature and salinity eddy forcing the lighter heavier fluid intrusion brought by the mean flow leads to strong upwelling downwelling enhanced mixing and deepening of the mixed layer before the arrival of the eddy after the eddy reaches the study location the strong density intrusion of the eddy leads to significantly enhanced upwelling downwelling and mixing with a fully mixed surface layer and further deepens the mixed layer at the arrival of the eddy center the density structure in the water column is dominated by the eddy and the mixed layer re stratifies the eddy is gradually distorted in time with a strong deflection towards the north due to its asymmetric decay and northward ekman transport generated by the wind stress this has resulted in substantial difference in the boundary layer responses on the two sides of the eddy with significant deepening on the northern side of the eddy and only mild variation of the mixed layer on the southern side the findings in this study are consistent with yuan and liang 2021 who looked at the boundary layer responses to small submesoscale eddies emerged from a density front using les simulations while the authors did not look at the evolution of the boundary depth and the eddies in their study are on a much smaller scale of o 100 m they have shown greatly enhanced horizontal mixing in the boundary layer with strong downwelling that implies a deepening of the mixed layer the authors also noted that the eddy induced mixing is anisotropic with stronger enhancement to the right of the wind direction similar to what we found in our study our study has demonstrated the significant and complex impact of submesoscale features on the dynamics and structure of the upper ocean the comparisons of mixed layer evolutions between the les model and hycom illustrated the limitations of the kpp type of parameterization that assumes small negligible anisotropy and thus cannot represent the enhanced lateral mixing brought by submesoscale features that has strong large scale horizontal gradients this also applies to the second order turbulent closure models through observations off north carolina coast savelyev et al 2022 found the turbulence field is dominated by signals associated with submesoscales activities at their study site and none the second order turbulent closure models explored in their study is equipped with the physics necessary to address the submesoscale turbulence challenge during the past two decades new developments of turbulent mixing parameterizations were mainly focused on the effect of langmuir turbulence and many new parameterizations were proposed in the literatures i e harcourt 2013 2015 li and fox kemper 2017 large et al 2019a b solano and fan 2022 etc the effect of submesoscale activities on boundary layer turbulence remains under studied the only available parameterization to represent the submesoscale effect in the oceanic boundary layer for ocean general circulation models is given by fox kemper et al 2011 which is cast as an overturning stream function and has the effect to slump isopycnals and restratify the upper ocean thus its main impact is a reduction of the mixed layer depth mld calvert et al 2020 has shown that this parameterization reduces the magnitude of deep mld biases but increases the magnitude of shallow biases this is because due to the low resolution used in their simulation fox kemper et al 2008 2011 did not observe the enhanced mixing and deepening of the mixed layer during the passage of submesoscale eddies as we have demonstrated in this study they only parameterized the restratification effect at the eddy center as suggested by yuan and liang 2021 future improvement of ocean surface boundary layer turbulence parameterizations could include additional parameters including wind front angle and horizontal buoyancy gradients that determine the depth dependent ekman buoyancy flux geostrophic shear and submesoscale eddies this study also has some limitations by using the large scale forcing terms to represent submesoscale effect in the les we ignored the effect of small scale turbulence on submesoscale features the nonlinear interaction between these two processes may bring further complications to the dynamical responses during the passage of a submesoscale eddy more research needs to be conducted to study the two way interactions between the submesoscale processes and small scale turbulence in order to adequately parameterize the submesoscale effects in large scale ocean circulation models credit authorship contribution

terms an idealized hycom simulation is conducted fig 1 to provide lsf for the les simulations the time series of the eddy forcing terms at location c are presented in fig a 1 we can see that the maximum forcing is concentrated around 30 40 m depth for temperature and salinity but much deeper for momentum around 60 70 m appendix b eddy distortion the temporal evolution of sst from hour 12 to 120 at 12 hour interval are given in fig b 1 the eddies were able to maintain relatively circular shape during the first 24 hours or so while its strength decay with time distortion becomes obvious after that the eddy becomes more oval shaped and the eddy center moves northward with time appendix c temperature and salinity tendency term the mixed layer depth mld is compared among experiments 1 2 and 8 in this section figure c1 while both the temperature and salinity horizontal gradient forcing experiment 1 blue line and eddy forcing experiment 2 green lines have a strong impact on the boundary layer responses when they acted alone the responses in the water column is dominated by the temperature and salinity eddy forcing when we apply the two types of forcing together experiment 8 red dashed lines notice that the mld from experiments 2 and 8 are on top of each other the impact of the temperature and salinity horizontal gradient forcing seem to diminish when it is combined with the eddy forcing even though it can produce stronger mixed layer responses when used alone see fig c 1
