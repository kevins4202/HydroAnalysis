3515,compound extremes have increasingly become the focus of research in recent years due to the strong impact they have upon society and ecosystems few studies however address the role of teleconnection patterns in these compound extremes and how the former can be used to predict the latter the present study quantifies the changes observed in the monthly frequencies of dry warm dry cold wet warm and wet cold concurrent extremes in the mediterranean basin during the 1951 2020 period and assesses the effect of different regional continental and oceanic teleconnections upon the frequency of such concurrent extremes results reveal a significant increase especially in dry warm months in large areas of the mediterranean basin mainly in summer and spring as well as a decrease in wet cold extremes in these seasons on the other hand the positive phase of the mediterranean oscillation mo has a strong capacity to drive dry warm months in the western mediterranean basin as well as wet cold extremes in the southern east part of the mediterranean basin this role becomes inverted during the negative phase of this teleconnection furthermore due to its subtropical linkage the positive phase of the east atlantic ea oscillation also plays an important role in accounting for the occurrence of dry warm months in most of the mediterranean basin especially in the west and the north during its negative mode the configuration of the ea dipole favours the occurrence of wet cold months especially in the north and western part of the basin the east atlantic western russia oscillation proved to be highly capable of inferring the ocurrence of dry warm and wet cold events in the eastern mediterranean the other teleconnections analysed the north atlantic oscillation nao the western mediterranean oscillation wemo and the scandinavian scand an polar eurasia poleur oscillations played a minor role in driving these monthly concurrent extremes the results provided by the present paper are intended to guide future research addressing the potential of teleconnection patterns to drive the temporal variability of compound extremes keywords concurrent extremes compound extremes teleconnection patterns mediterranean 1 introduction compound analysis of two or more extremes enables estimation of the real risk posed by several climate variables occurring simultaneously zscheischler et al 2018 of special interest in fragile and vulnerable areas such as the mediterranean basin giorgi 2006 cramer et al 2018 tuel and eltahir 2020 vogel et al 2021 within a context of anthropogenic climate change in this sense one of the compound extremes that has aroused considerable interest is that of droughts and heat waves with many studies focusing on various regions of the world such as russo et al 2019 for the mediterranean manning et al 2019 for europe or zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 at the global level because these events have been shown to have major environmental and social impacts such as crop yields losses ribeiro et al 2020 moreover they can trigger large fires turco et al 2019 or negatively affect human health bandyopadhyay et al 2012 on the contrary wet cold extremes can have beneficial effects in spring in the mediterranean area such as reducing the risk of fire nevertheless they can also trigger crop yield losses comparable to those occurring during dry warm extremes li et al 2019 finally dry cold and wet warm extremes have negligible ramifications in the mediterranean area and in general at medium and low latitudes mueller and seneviratne 2012 because no positive correlation exists between temperature and precipitation tencer et al 2014 results from previous studies show an overall increase in dry warm and wet warm months at global level over the last few decades hao et al 2013 thus indicating that the thermal component predominates over precipitation this is also the case when changes in these compound extremes are analyzed at the regional level such as in us mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 india sharma and mujumdar 2017 or china wu et al 2019 among others fewer studies evaluate the impact of teleconnections and circulation patterns on compound extremes seneviratne et al 2012 kopp et al 2017 de luca et al 2020b in this sense hao et al 2018 performed a global approximation of the impact of the enso on dry warm months to estimate the likelihood of such extremes lópez moreno et al 2011 investigated the effects of the north atlantic oscillation nao on combined temperature and precipitation winter modes in the mediterranean mountains ranges finally de luca et al 2020b analysed at the relationship between the nao and the occurrence of compound precipitation and wind extremes in europe however most studies focus on estimating the relationship individually i e either with precipitation or with temperature for example in the mediterranean area it has been estimated that teleconnections have had a greater influence upon the distribution and frequency of precipitation and its variability krichak et al 2014 lopez bustins and lemus canovas 2020 mathbout et al 2020 martinez artigas et al 2021 among others as well as on temperature ben gai et al 2001 ríos cornejo et al 2015 baltacı et al 2018 etc there is currently a need for studies that analyse the impact of several teleconnections on the behaviour of compound extremes in the entire mediterranean basin highlighting the novel contribution of the present research it is therefore vital to establish the teleconnections that most intensely regulate the frequency of monthly concurrent extremes in order to promote future studies on the predictive capacity of these circulation patterns during the occurrence of compound extremes hao et al 2019 de luca et al 2020a the present paper attempts i to characterize the frequency of dry warm dry cold wet warm and wet cold monthly concurrent extremes as well as to evaluate changes therein in recent years ii to identify the influence of different regional continental and oceanic teleconnection patterns on the occurrence of dry warm and wet cold monthly compound extremes iii and finally to establish the empirical probability of dry warm and wet cold monthly compound extremes occurring by means of the different teleconnections and to determine the dominant pattern in the mediterranean area our study is intended to constitute a roadmap for future research into the relationship between the co occurrence of extremes and the different modes of atmospheric variability provided by the teleconnection patterns 2 data and methods 2 1 data to identify dry warm wet cold dry cold and wet warm extremes we used the monthly temperature and precipitation variables from the era 5 reanalysis dataset hersbach et al 2020 for the 1951 2020 period with a spatial resolution of 0 25 the use of the eobs grid cornes et al 2018 was discarded following several tests and due to the fact that there are scarce data for north africa and little spatial continuity with regard to ensuring proper identification of events of interest a fact already pointed out in previous articles manning et al 2019 herrera et al 2019 the use of the era 5 grid was considered to be sufficient with regard to estimating spatial patterns and occurrences of compound events based on percentiles additionally the teleconnection patterns influencing compound events were divided into three groups based on the position of its dipole mediterranean western mediterranean oscillation wemo martin vide lopez bustins 2006 mediterranean oscillation mo conte et al 1989 both indices were provided by the climatic research unit cru https crudata uea ac uk cru data pci htm accessed on sep 2021 eurasia east atlantic western russia pattern eawr barnston and livezey 1987 scandinavian pattern scand barnston and livezey 1987 polar eurasian pattern poleur cpc 2021 all indices were retrived from the climate prediction center cpc https www

also obtained from the cpc all teleconnection patterns were aggregated on a monthly basis and for the 1951 2020 period we created the atmospheric composites associated with the teleconnection phases using monthly geopotential height at 500 hpa z500 and mean sea level pressure standarized anomalies slp with respect to the reference period 1981 2010 using the era 5 dataset 2 2 event definition following previous studies defining compound extremes beniston 2009 hao et al 2013 wu et al 2019 the 25th and 75th percentiles of precipitation and temperature were computed for each month and for the reference period 1981 2010 then we used the abovementioned thresholds defined in the reference period to estimate the exceedances over the entire study period 1951 2020 the wet extreme occurs individually for each month when precipitation is above the 75th percentile while the dry extreme occurs when precipitation is below the 25th percentile similarly the warm extreme occurs when the temperature is above the 75th percentile while the cold extreme occurs when the temperature is below the 25th percentile the compound extreme is therefore defined as the co occurrence of two extremes in the same month note that the 75 25 percentiles employed to define extreme months involve a moderate deviation from the mean however the joint precipitation temperature statistics are found to be relatively insensitive to the choice of quantile levels producing similar patterns of changes in concurrent extremes hao et al 2013 in addition selecting a more extreme threshold i e the 90 10 percentiles would give rise to a very low co occurrence of extremes which would make it difficult to analyse changes in the frequency of concurrent extremes according to subperiods 2 3 comparison of periods and impact of teleconnections on compound extremes we first estimated the grid based monthly occurrence of dry warm dry cold wet warm and wet cold compound extremes aggregated at seasonal level autumn sep oct nov winter dec jan feb spring mar apr may summer jun jul aug for the 1951 1985 and 1986 2020 periods to determine whether there was an increase in events in the latter period to estimate the significance of such differences a two sample t test wilks 2019 was performed which indicated that the significant difference occurred at the 95 confidence level on assessing the impacts of the teleconnections we only employed the dry warm and wet cold events since these are more frequent in the mediterranean area due to the negative correlation they present between temperature and precipitation fig s1 we also included the summer season in this analysis although its observed weak atmospheric circulation in the mediterranean area during this season martin vide lopez bustins 2006 lemus canovas et al 2019 a fact that implies that some teleconnections could play an irrelevant role during this period of the year to estimate this relationship between teleconnection patterns and compound extremes we first defined the dichotomous variable y to represent the occurrence y 1 or non occurrence y 0 of a compound extreme using the logistic regression model we estimated this binary variable from an independent variable x which in our case is the teleconnection index this relationship can be expressed by the following equation 1 agresti 2006 1 logit p x α β x where p x p y 1 x which can be referred to as the probability of a compound extreme occurrence given a value of the corresponding teleconnection pattern with α and β being the coefficients of the model the left side of the equation is known as the logit transformation the logit is a linking function and can be expressed as logit p x ln p x 1 p x one can then derive from eq 1 that the ratio of the odds for a one unit increase in x is exp β or the odds ratio defined as the probability of occurrence divided by the probability of non occurrence agresti 2006 the odds ratio represents the constant effect of the independent variable upon the likelihood of an outcome occurence hao et al 2018 an odds ratio greater than 1 implies the higher odds of compound extreme occurrences associated with an increase in the values of the corresponding teleconnection index and vice versa the odds ratio can then be used to evaluate the response of the occurrence of a compound extreme to the teleconnection pattern hao et al 2018 moreover the probability of occurrence of a concurrent extreme was estimated by means of a specific threshold of the teleconnection indices this probability can be calculated using the following equation 2 2 p y 1 x 1 1 exp α β x for positive negative values of β the probability p x of a compound extreme occurring increases decreases the thresholds of the teleconnection indices were selected from different quantiles because the distributions of such indices reveal different kurtoses see fig s2 specifically the 10th and 90th percentiles were used as thresholds for each index and season table 1 interestingly the probability of occurrence was estimated at seasonal scale so that a p x 1 indicates the unequivocal occurrence of at least 1 compound extreme month in the corresponding season in the same way that it does not preclude the possiblity that up to 3 compound extreme months occur as many as there are months in the season in order to understand the physical mechanisms triggering these extreme compound months we mapped the z500 and slp standardized anomalies for the 1951 2020 with respect to the reference period 1981 2010 we computed them for each season and for the values surpassing the above mentioned two quantile thresholds table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and recent changes in the frequency of compound events the frequency of compound extremes is defined as the total number of months exhibiting a co occurrence of events within each season in this sense fig 1 a shows the frequency of the 4 compound extremes for each season and during the 1951 2020 period as previously stated the dry cold and wet warm extremes display a lower frequency than the dry warm and wet cold extremes due to the negative correlation generally existing between temperature and precipitation i e dry extremes occur with high temperatures and low precipitation this however calls for consideration of several aspects in winter this correlation fig s1 becomes positive on the western and south western façades due to the fact that the polar front follows a more southerly path than in summer hall et al 2015 which implies that the frequency of wet warm and dry cold events depends more strongly on the dynamics of this front something similar occurs in the southern mediterranean basin in summer with the dry cold and wet warm events which are more frequent than in the rest of the basin due to the slightly positive correlation between temperature and precipitation trenberth and shea 2005 clearly the mediterranean basin is mainly affected by dry warm and wet cold extremes with a north south dichotomy depending on the season fig 1a for example in summer the frequency of dry extremes in the northern and eastern half of the mediterranean basin is much higher than in the southern half a fact also contrasted in de luca et al 2020a and vice versa in winter in spring the number of dry warm extremes is very high throughout the basin these spatial frequency patterns of dry warm extremes are transferable to the frequency of wet cold extremes autumn presents a similar pattern to spring but with a lesser amount of compound extremes especially for dry warm and wet cold concurrences however on quantifying the changes in frequencies between the 1986 2020 and 1951 1985 periods fig 1b for each grid point the increase in dry warm extremes is seen to be statistically significant in summer throughout large areas of the entire mediterranean basin 76 6 of the study area fig s3a with larger increases in the northern and eastern half in this sense manning et al 2019 found that balkan region showed the lowest return period of hot dry events in summer which is clearly related with the increase above mentioned this statistically significant increase can also be observed in spring accounting for 61 8 of the study area it is in these two seasons summer and spring that a bias is clearly observed in the distribution of the frequency anomalies between the two periods fig 1c indicating a sharp increase in their recurrence and in a lesser extent in winter and autumn the opposite case has been detected for the wet cold extremes in which a clearly significant decrease in this type of concurrent extreme is quantified fig 1b this covers quite a large area in summer i e 58 4 of the area and in spring 54 6 fig s3b a general pattern observed during summer dry warm and wet cold extremes is that the eastern part of the mediterranean basin responds with greater statistical robustness to the significant increases and decreases in such concurrent extremes in accordance with previous studies on precipitation in this specific area mathbout et al 2018 zittis 2018 the dry cold and wet warm extremes present a decrease and an increase respectively however all the changes in the set of compound extremes appear to indicate that the thermal component is what drives the increase in the frequency of warm months e g dry warm and wet warm whereas it causes a decrease in cold months such as the dry cold and wet cold ones a phenomenon also detected in other regions such as china wu et al 2019 or in europe in relation to dry warm extremes manning et al 2019 this thermal rise leading to an increase in dry and warm extremes has also been clearly discerned in the mediterranean basin vogel et al 2021 as well as in more local regions such as the pyrenees lemus canovas and lopez bustins 2021a 3 2 impact of teleconnections on dry warm and wet cold compound events this section analyzes the impact of teleconnection patterns on the dry warm and wet cold concurrent extremes discarding the dry cold and wet warm months which are seen to be less relevant in this region at the frequency level herein we first analyze the direction using the odds ratio of the relationship between the dry warm and wet cold compound extremes and the teleconnections capable of varying the frequency of these events fig 2 these results reveal that for dry warm and wet cold extremes the ea and mo patterns are the ones displaying the clearest significant relationship therewith the former pattern represents 83 of the area in winter for dry warm extremes and the latter one refers to 48 of the mediterranean area for this same season and kind of extremes these results show a clear dipole in their relationship with dry warm extremes with a positive relationship between the mo values and these extremes in the whole north western region during winter and spring fig 2a mo this phenomenon can also last into the autumn season but is irrelevant in summer in contrast this relationship is inverse odds ratio below 1 in the southeast of the study area fig 2a mo in its positive phase positive anomalies of slp and z500 clearly dominate in the western half of the mediterranean basin whereas the opposite situation occurs in the eastern half where negative anomalies of both variables dominate mainly in winter and spring fig 3 mo winter and spring due to the formation of the well known cyprus low hochman et al 2020 thus in this positive phase the western mediterranean basin is affected by intrusions of dry subtropical air which is clearly associated with an increase in the likelihood of dry and warm extremes occurring in this area during the four seasons analysed especially in autumn and spring fig 4 a on the contrary in a large part of northern africa under this positive phase of the mo an inverse relationship is quantified between its values and the co occurrence of dry and warm months in other words the placement of the dipole in this positive phase favours advection of the northern component with a high moisture contribution to the southern eastern basin törnros 2013 fig 3 mo winter and spring this means that under this positive mo phase months are more likely to be cold and wet in this area reaching probabilities of occurrence close to 20 30 mainly along the coasts of the southern levant and north eastern africa fig 4c during the negative phase of the mo fig 5 one would expect to observe an exchange of roles between the northwest and southeast regions of the basin with the former zone more susceptible to wet cold events however disposition of the low pressure during this winter phase is largely based on the cyclogenesis appearing in northern italy so that its disposition does favour cold advection albeit with a continental and dry track preventing wet cold synergy fig 5 mo winter this results in a very weak influence in winter which can also last until autumn fig 2b mo and in the occurrence of wet cold events over the northwestern mediterranean basin in spring the position of the low favours a high moisture flow towards the iberian peninsula together with cooler temperatures fig 5 mo spring favouring an increase in the probability of wet and cold months occurring during this negative phase probabilities of occurrence between 50 and 60 fig 4d are reached in the abovementioned region in this negative phase northeast africa and the eastern mediterranean basin are affected by positive anomalies in slp and z500 thus increasing the likelihood of dry warm events arising up to 40 in the aforementioned regions mainly in winter and spring fig 4b it should be noted that the empirical probabilities obtained for the summer season may not be linked to the internal variability of the mo teleconnection pattern since in this season the slp and z500 dipole disappears completely fig 3 and fig 5 mo summer the ea shows a positive relationship with this type of dry warm extreme practically throughout the area with very widespread coverage in winter as already mentioned but this relationship is also positive in summer spring and autumn fig 2a ea in all seasons during the positive phase of the ea the high sw ne zonality promotes the intrusion of subtropical ridges into the western mediterranean these ridges even reach the northern part of the eastern mediterranean fig 3 ea winter remarkably although the ea and nao dipoles present a similar structure the ea possesses a strong subtropical link associated with modulations in the intensity and location of the subtropical ridge while the positive phase of the nao gives rise to a dry but not warmer environment thus the positive phase of the nao exerts less influence on the occurrence of dry and warm extremes because the air mass originates at a more northerly latitude than in the positive ea fig 3 nao winter this means that there is a 30 likelihood of a dry warm month occurring during the positive phase of the ea in the eastern part of north africa and the iberian peninsula in the southern half of italy and in the balkan area especially during winter spring and summer fig 4a precisely some authors identified a strong relationship between a postive ea phase and negative precipitation anomalies and positive temperature anomalies in the northern part of the mediterranean toreti et al 2010a toreti et al 2010b rust et al 2015 the negative phase of the ea is weakly related to the occurrence of dry warm months in the mediterranean basin since under this phase neutral or negative anomalies predominate fig 5 ea this negative phase on the contrary strongly influences the occurrence of wet cold months fig 2b ea the negative phase of the ea is characterised by an anticyclonic block in the western area of the british isles in autumn this gets stronger in winter and in the following seasons becoming more intense in the north atlantic this implies that the european atlantic coast including the northwestern part of the iberian peninsula presents drier weather sousa et al 2017 whilst the western and northern half of the mediterranean is favoured by a wetter and colder weather regime with a 40 50 probability of a wet cold month occurring in the balkan area this teleconnection pattern plays a less important role in the eastern end of the mediterranean basin as mentioned above the nao has a strong link with the ea but its dipole exhibits a more northerly position transferring wet weather into the northern half of the basin philandras et al 2011 as well as into the north of morocco ahmed et al 2016 during its negative phase mainly during winter the negative phase of the nao also implies lower than average temperatures lópez moreno et al 2011 a fact which to some extent influences the occurrence of wet cold months throughout the northern half of the basin fig 2b nao albeit without providing very high probabilities of occurrence fig 4d logically its positive phase more pronounced in autumn and winter fig 3 nao restricts the position of the polar jet towards northern latitudes implying dry and warm conditions throughout the northern part of the mediterranean fig 4a however there is a lower probability of a dry warm month occurring fig 4a because the air mass is not linked to a subtropical origin as in the case of the ea nonetheless in autumn and under this positive phase slightly negative geopotential height anomalies at 500 hpa with some cyclonic airflow can be observed over northern algeria and morocco fig 3 nao this reveals a greater likelihood of wet cold events in these two regions under the positive phase of the nao which is consistent with the positive relationship between precipitation and the nao detected in the eastern atlas druing november by ahmed et al 2016 in summer the nao pattern is very weakened with a lower pressure gradient than in the rest of the seasons in fact in the summer version of the nao folland et al 2009 its positive phase implies high pressure and dry warm weather in northern europe uk and scandinavia in contrast throughout the mediterranean basin the probability of occurrence of wet cold extremes increases markedly reaching probabilities of 50 in many coastal locations in the northern and southern half of the basin fig 4c on the other hand in the negative phase of the summer nao the synoptic configuration favours intrusions of warm and dry air mainly in the eastern half of the mediterranean basin showing a pattern very similar to the positive phase of the ea fig 4b we found that the eawr is a significant modulator of the co occurrence of dry warm and wet cold months along the eastern façade of the mediterranean basin fig 2a eawr in this sense as its maximum influence is in late autumn and winter the positive phase of the eawr generates a strong central european and scandinavian anticyclonic block as a result of the northward expansion of the azores high pressure centre fig 3 eawr such an atmospheric configuration brings northerly cold air together with a large amount of moisture from the black sea towards the easternmost mediterranean krichak and alpert 2005 ionita 2014 baltacı et al 2018 from spring onwards the global geopotential height anomalies related to the eawr show a significant decrease in intensity thus weakening its dipole especially in this positive phase precisely the positive phase in winter makes wet cold months up to 30 40 more likely to occur on the easternmost mediterranean coastline fig 4c its negative phase triggers the opposite situation negative z500 and slp anomalies are established in central europe whereas in eastern europe and russia the anomalies become positive fig 5 eawr causing higher temperatures and drier weather than usual in the eastern mediterranean area with a probability of over 30 of dry warm extremes occurring in winter fig 4b although the wemo is of certain relevance in the northern part of the study area it plays a secondary role this teleconnection pattern by definition limited to controlling atmospheric variability in the western half of the mediterranean basin martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 is most pronounced between mid autumn and early spring when both the positive and negative anomalies of slp and the z500 associated with this dipole are most pronounced its positive phase characterised by a slight northerly movement of the azores high pressure centre favours inflows of air from the north and northwest in central europe as well as in the central and northern mediterranean area fig 3 wemo in addition this phase favours cyclogenesis in the gulf of genoa which eventually brings precipitation to northern italy and nearby areas trigo et al 2002 this positive phase implies a probability of up to 50 of wet cold months occurring in central france and northern italy fig 4c especially during spring and summer in the negative phase of the wemo fig 5 wemo there is an area of low pressure in the sw of the iberian peninsula during the cold period of the year which practically disappears in summer in contrast in central europe and southern scandinavia positive anomalies of slp and z500 prevails this pattern is the cause of torrential rainfall events in different parts of the eastern iberian peninsula lopez bustins et al 2020 insua costa et al 2021 lemus canovas et al 2021b due to the maritime path of the air flow despite the highs amounts of precipitation in this area the mediterranean origin of the air mass does not imply the occurrence of cold extremes in the eastern iberia only in areas of southern iberia during spring and northern morocco between autumn and spring probabilities of occurrence of around 20 30 of wet cold extremes are observed the poleur and scand teleconnections play quite an insignificant role in the modulation of concurrence extremes in the mediterranean area in the case of scand it still has a certain influence upon the variability of precipitation in the mediterranean it is characterised in its positive phase by an anticyclonic anomaly over fennoscandia and western russia as well as by negative pressure anomalies around the iberian peninsula fig 3 scand a dipole that remain fairly stable throughout the 4 seasons its positive phase enhances mediterranean cyclogenesis and causes above average precipitation in the north western part of the mediterranean it presents its precipitation maxima over the iberian peninsula and the central northern mediterranean region krichak et al 2014 in addition it involves slightly below average temperatures rust et al 2015 in these areas revealing a notable influence on the co occurrence of wet cold months fig 2b scand especially during spring and summer with a relevant impacton the co occurrence probability reaching the 50 in the western half of the basin fig 4c fig 6 provides a synthetic analysis showing for each compound extreme the teleconnection pattern that implies the strongest likelihood of such an extreme occurring along with the maximum probability value this indicates that the mo is presented as a teleconnection capable of predicting the occurrence of dry warm and wet cold months throughout much of the north western façade especially on the iberian peninsula where a strong influence of this teleconnection upon precipitation has already been observed martinez artigas et al 2021 for this area the mo plays an important role in driving dry warm months during the autumn and wet cold extremes during the spring exceeding probabilites of occurrence of 0 6 additionaly the mo also regulates the occurrence of this kind of compound extremes in the south eastern mediterranean during the three seasons and implying probability values of occurrence reaching 0 4 0 5 as previously stated the ea also plays a vital role in the occurrence of dry warm months in the northeastern mediterranean during the four seasons particularly in the area covered by balkan peninsula and the carpathians the ea also partially modulates the occurrence of wet cold extremes in the above mentioned regions extending its influence to the south western mediterranean especially in winter and spring nonetheless the probability values of ocurrence are not very high for the balkan peninsula only presenting a probability of around 0 3 during autumn in contrast in the areas influenced by the ea pattern in the italian peninsula eastern iberia northern morocco northern algeria and northern tunisia the probabilities of occurrence for these wet cold extremes reach practically 0 5 after the ea the eawr shows a stronger influence in the eastern mediterranean partially enabling the occurrence of dry warm and wet cold months to be modulated during winter and producing probabilities of around 0 4 in both types of concurrent extremes the remaining teleconnection patterns play a secondary role for example the influence of the nao is very restricted to the ocurrence of wet cold extremes in the south central mediterranean during autumn and in some areas of the south western mediterranean during summer on the other hand the wemo exerts a certain degree of influence in the centre north of the mediterranean region during autumn and spring in the concurrence of wet cold months reaching probabilities of around 0 3 05 the scand has a greater influence in the occurrence of wet cold extremes during summer north western part of the mediterranean basing reaching probabilities arround 0 4 05 finally the atmospheric variability by the poleur teleconnection is of residual relevance with regard to accounting for the occurrence of these compound extremes 4 study limitations this study is of course not free of limitations which are discussed next the first limitation relates to the selection of the threshold for defining the joint temperature and precipitation extremes the selection of the 25th and 75th percentile used in this work only represents a slight deviation from the mean although it does allow to account a certain number of concurrences often the 10th and 90th percentiles are used to define extreme thresholds i e manning et al 2019 tavakol et al 2020 however the downside is is that the number of co occurring extremes for these thresholds may be very low if the time series are short another important limitation of this work is related to the study period the influence of teleconnections in driving the probability of occurrence of a concurrent extreme may vary depending on the selection of the time period these teleconnections suffer variations with periods more linked to positive or negative phases visbeck et al 2001 mellado cano et al 2019 thus the selection of the study period may have some influence on the probability occurrence of these extreme events however in this work we used the longest period available 1951 2020 of the era 5 dataset to get the most robust results possible and avoiding major uncertainties related to the above it would be of notable interest for a future work to use atmospheric general circulation models agcms to test whether all teleconnections used in this work are robust to internal atmospheric variability as brands 2017 performed for the enso pattern in this way for each model of the ensemble we could compute robustly the probability of co occurrence of extremes and also quantifying the uncertainty of such probabilities 5 conclusions we studied the changes observed in the 4 possible types of compound extremes derived from temperature and precipitation as well as the impact of different teleconnections thereupon over the 1951 2020 period the main results indicate an increase in the frequency of those compound extremes related to the increase of temperature such as dry warm extremes mainly in summer and spring throughout much of the mediterranean basin or in a lesser extent the wet warm extremes on the contrary the frequency of wet cold and dry cold extremes exhibits a decrease throughout most of the mediterranean in these two seasons as for the impact of these teleconnections on the frequency of dry warm and wet cold compound extremes the most frequent ones in the mediterranean area results show that the mo plays a significant role in driving dry warm and wet cold extremes between autumn and spring over large areas of the north western and south eastern mediterranean basin as a consequence of the diposition of the centres of its dipole specifically we observed that the postive phase of the mo partially drives the variability of dry warm months as opposed to the negtive phase which modulates wet cold months in the above mentioned areas the ea was also seen to strongly influence the occurrence of this kind of concurrent extremes in this case this pattern was closely related to dry warm months during its positive phase due to its linkage to the dynamics of the subtropical ridges in the atlantic ocean in this sense the positive phase of the ea constitutes an important driver of dry warm extremes in most of the north eastern mediterranean basin and also of wet cold months during the negative phase of this pattern similar to the ea but presenting an eastward displacement of its dipoles we found that the eawr is a significant driver of dry warm and wet cold months in the easternmost part of the mediterranean basin however the southern half of the basin displays the weakest response to the influence of these teleconnections the ea mo and eawr teleconnections represent the three most important ones in this area finally the remaining teleconnections analysed the nao the wemo the scand and the poleur exert a much weaker influence upon the concurrence of dry warm and wet cold extremes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

3515,compound extremes have increasingly become the focus of research in recent years due to the strong impact they have upon society and ecosystems few studies however address the role of teleconnection patterns in these compound extremes and how the former can be used to predict the latter the present study quantifies the changes observed in the monthly frequencies of dry warm dry cold wet warm and wet cold concurrent extremes in the mediterranean basin during the 1951 2020 period and assesses the effect of different regional continental and oceanic teleconnections upon the frequency of such concurrent extremes results reveal a significant increase especially in dry warm months in large areas of the mediterranean basin mainly in summer and spring as well as a decrease in wet cold extremes in these seasons on the other hand the positive phase of the mediterranean oscillation mo has a strong capacity to drive dry warm months in the western mediterranean basin as well as wet cold extremes in the southern east part of the mediterranean basin this role becomes inverted during the negative phase of this teleconnection furthermore due to its subtropical linkage the positive phase of the east atlantic ea oscillation also plays an important role in accounting for the occurrence of dry warm months in most of the mediterranean basin especially in the west and the north during its negative mode the configuration of the ea dipole favours the occurrence of wet cold months especially in the north and western part of the basin the east atlantic western russia oscillation proved to be highly capable of inferring the ocurrence of dry warm and wet cold events in the eastern mediterranean the other teleconnections analysed the north atlantic oscillation nao the western mediterranean oscillation wemo and the scandinavian scand an polar eurasia poleur oscillations played a minor role in driving these monthly concurrent extremes the results provided by the present paper are intended to guide future research addressing the potential of teleconnection patterns to drive the temporal variability of compound extremes keywords concurrent extremes compound extremes teleconnection patterns mediterranean 1 introduction compound analysis of two or more extremes enables estimation of the real risk posed by several climate variables occurring simultaneously zscheischler et al 2018 of special interest in fragile and vulnerable areas such as the mediterranean basin giorgi 2006 cramer et al 2018 tuel and eltahir 2020 vogel et al 2021 within a context of anthropogenic climate change in this sense one of the compound extremes that has aroused considerable interest is that of droughts and heat waves with many studies focusing on various regions of the world such as russo et al 2019 for the mediterranean manning et al 2019 for europe or zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 at the global level because these events have been shown to have major environmental and social impacts such as crop yields losses ribeiro et al 2020 moreover they can trigger large fires turco et al 2019 or negatively affect human health bandyopadhyay et al 2012 on the contrary wet cold extremes can have beneficial effects in spring in the mediterranean area such as reducing the risk of fire nevertheless they can also trigger crop yield losses comparable to those occurring during dry warm extremes li et al 2019 finally dry cold and wet warm extremes have negligible ramifications in the mediterranean area and in general at medium and low latitudes mueller and seneviratne 2012 because no positive correlation exists between temperature and precipitation tencer et al 2014 results from previous studies show an overall increase in dry warm and wet warm months at global level over the last few decades hao et al 2013 thus indicating that the thermal component predominates over precipitation this is also the case when changes in these compound extremes are analyzed at the regional level such as in us mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 india sharma and mujumdar 2017 or china wu et al 2019 among others fewer studies evaluate the impact of teleconnections and circulation patterns on compound extremes seneviratne et al 2012 kopp et al 2017 de luca et al 2020b in this sense hao et al 2018 performed a global approximation of the impact of the enso on dry warm months to estimate the likelihood of such extremes lópez moreno et al 2011 investigated the effects of the north atlantic oscillation nao on combined temperature and precipitation winter modes in the mediterranean mountains ranges finally de luca et al 2020b analysed at the relationship between the nao and the occurrence of compound precipitation and wind extremes in europe however most studies focus on estimating the relationship individually i e either with precipitation or with temperature for example in the mediterranean area it has been estimated that teleconnections have had a greater influence upon the distribution and frequency of precipitation and its variability krichak et al 2014 lopez bustins and lemus canovas 2020 mathbout et al 2020 martinez artigas et al 2021 among others as well as on temperature ben gai et al 2001 ríos cornejo et al 2015 baltacı et al 2018 etc there is currently a need for studies that analyse the impact of several teleconnections on the behaviour of compound extremes in the entire mediterranean basin highlighting the novel contribution of the present research it is therefore vital to establish the teleconnections that most intensely regulate the frequency of monthly concurrent extremes in order to promote future studies on the predictive capacity of these circulation patterns during the occurrence of compound extremes hao et al 2019 de luca et al 2020a the present paper attempts i to characterize the frequency of dry warm dry cold wet warm and wet cold monthly concurrent extremes as well as to evaluate changes therein in recent years ii to identify the influence of different regional continental and oceanic teleconnection patterns on the occurrence of dry warm and wet cold monthly compound extremes iii and finally to establish the empirical probability of dry warm and wet cold monthly compound extremes occurring by means of the different teleconnections and to determine the dominant pattern in the mediterranean area our study is intended to constitute a roadmap for future research into the relationship between the co occurrence of extremes and the different modes of atmospheric variability provided by the teleconnection patterns 2 data and methods 2 1 data to identify dry warm wet cold dry cold and wet warm extremes we used the monthly temperature and precipitation variables from the era 5 reanalysis dataset hersbach et al 2020 for the 1951 2020 period with a spatial resolution of 0 25 the use of the eobs grid cornes et al 2018 was discarded following several tests and due to the fact that there are scarce data for north africa and little spatial continuity with regard to ensuring proper identification of events of interest a fact already pointed out in previous articles manning et al 2019 herrera et al 2019 the use of the era 5 grid was considered to be sufficient with regard to estimating spatial patterns and occurrences of compound events based on percentiles additionally the teleconnection patterns influencing compound events were divided into three groups based on the position of its dipole mediterranean western mediterranean oscillation wemo martin vide lopez bustins 2006 mediterranean oscillation mo conte et al 1989 both indices were provided by the climatic research unit cru https crudata uea ac uk cru data pci htm accessed on sep 2021 eurasia east atlantic western russia pattern eawr barnston and livezey 1987 scandinavian pattern scand barnston and livezey 1987 polar eurasian pattern poleur cpc 2021 all indices were retrived from the climate prediction center cpc https www cpc ncep noaa gov data teledoc telecontents shtml accessed on sep 2021 north atlantic north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell 1995 east atlantic pattern ea wallace and gutzler 1981 both indices were also obtained from the cpc all teleconnection patterns were aggregated on a monthly basis and for the 1951 2020 period we created the atmospheric composites associated with the teleconnection phases using monthly geopotential height at 500 hpa z500 and mean sea level pressure standarized anomalies slp with respect to the reference period 1981 2010 using the era 5 dataset 2 2 event definition following previous studies defining compound extremes beniston 2009 hao et al 2013 wu et al 2019 the 25th and 75th percentiles of precipitation and temperature were computed for each month and for the reference period 1981 2010 then we used the abovementioned thresholds defined in the reference period to estimate the exceedances over the entire study period 1951 2020 the wet extreme occurs individually for each month when precipitation is above the 75th percentile while the dry extreme occurs when precipitation is below the 25th percentile similarly the warm extreme occurs when the temperature is above the 75th percentile while the cold extreme occurs when the temperature is below the 25th percentile the compound extreme is therefore defined as the co occurrence of two extremes in the same month note that the 75 25 percentiles employed to define extreme months involve a moderate deviation from the mean however the joint precipitation temperature statistics are found to be relatively insensitive to the choice of quantile levels producing similar patterns of changes in concurrent extremes hao et al 2013 in addition selecting a more extreme threshold i e the 90 10 percentiles would give rise to a very low co occurrence of extremes which would make it difficult to analyse changes in the frequency of concurrent extremes according to subperiods 2 3 comparison of periods and impact of teleconnections on compound extremes we first estimated the grid based monthly occurrence of dry warm dry cold wet warm and wet cold compound extremes aggregated at seasonal level autumn sep oct nov winter dec jan feb spring mar apr may summer jun jul aug for the 1951 1985 and 1986 2020 periods to determine whether there was an increase in events in the latter period to estimate the significance of such differences a two sample t test wilks 2019 was performed which indicated that the significant difference occurred at the 95 confidence level on assessing the impacts of the teleconnections we only employed the dry warm and wet cold events since these are more frequent in the mediterranean area due to the negative correlation they present between temperature and precipitation fig s1 we also included the summer season in this analysis although its observed weak atmospheric circulation in the mediterranean area during this season martin vide lopez bustins 2006 lemus canovas et al 2019 a fact that implies that some teleconnections could play an irrelevant role during this period of the year to estimate this relationship between teleconnection patterns and compound extremes we first defined the dichotomous variable y to represent the occurrence y 1 or non occurrence y 0 of a compound extreme using the logistic regression model we estimated this binary variable from an independent variable x which in our case is the teleconnection index this relationship can be expressed by the following equation 1 agresti 2006 1 logit p x α β x where p x p y 1 x which can be referred to as the probability of a compound extreme occurrence given a value of the corresponding teleconnection pattern with α and β being the coefficients of the model the left side of the equation is known as the logit transformation the logit is a linking function and can be expressed as logit p x ln p x 1 p x one can then derive from eq 1 that the ratio of the odds for a one unit increase in x is exp β or the odds ratio defined as the probability of occurrence divided by the probability of non occurrence agresti 2006 the odds ratio represents the constant effect of the independent variable upon the likelihood of an outcome occurence hao et al 2018 an odds ratio greater than 1 implies the higher odds of compound extreme occurrences associated with an increase in the values of the corresponding teleconnection index and vice versa the odds ratio can then be used to evaluate the response of the occurrence of a compound extreme to the teleconnection pattern hao et al 2018 moreover the probability of occurrence of a concurrent extreme was estimated by means of a specific threshold of the teleconnection indices this probability can be calculated using the following equation 2 2 p y 1 x 1 1 exp α β x for positive negative values of β the probability p x of a compound extreme occurring increases decreases the thresholds of the teleconnection indices were selected from different quantiles because the distributions of such indices reveal different kurtoses see fig s2 specifically the 10th and 90th percentiles were used as thresholds for each index and season table 1 interestingly the probability of occurrence was estimated at seasonal scale so that a p x 1 indicates the unequivocal occurrence of at least 1 compound extreme month in the corresponding season in the same way that it does not preclude the possiblity that up to 3 compound extreme months occur as many as there are months in the season in order to understand the physical mechanisms triggering these extreme compound months we mapped the z500 and slp standardized anomalies for the 1951 2020 with respect to the reference period 1981 2010 we computed them for each season and for the values surpassing the above mentioned two quantile thresholds table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and recent changes in the frequency of compound events the frequency of compound extremes is defined as the total number of months exhibiting a co occurrence of events within each season in this sense fig 1 a shows the frequency of the 4 compound extremes for each season and during the 1951 2020 period as previously stated the dry cold and wet warm extremes display a lower frequency than the dry warm and wet cold extremes due to the negative correlation generally existing between temperature and precipitation i e dry extremes occur with high temperatures and low precipitation this however calls for consideration of several aspects in winter this correlation fig s1 becomes positive on the western and south western façades due to the fact that the polar front follows a more southerly path than in summer hall et al 2015 which implies that the frequency of wet warm and dry cold events depends more strongly on the dynamics of this front something similar occurs in the southern mediterranean basin in summer with the dry cold and wet warm events which are more frequent than in the rest of the basin due to the slightly positive correlation between temperature and precipitation trenberth and shea 2005 clearly the mediterranean basin is mainly affected by dry warm and wet cold extremes with a north south dichotomy depending on the season fig 1a for example in summer the frequency of dry extremes in the northern and eastern half of the mediterranean basin is much higher than in the southern half a fact also contrasted in de luca et al 2020a and vice versa in winter in spring the number of dry warm extremes is very high throughout the basin these spatial frequency patterns of dry warm extremes are transferable to the frequency of wet cold extremes autumn presents a similar pattern to spring but with a lesser amount of compound extremes especially for dry warm and wet cold concurrences however on quantifying the changes in frequencies between the 1986 2020 and 1951 1985 periods fig 1b for each grid point the increase in dry warm extremes is seen to be statistically significant in summer throughout large areas of the entire mediterranean basin 76 6 of the study area fig s3a with larger increases in the northern and eastern half in this sense manning et al 2019 found that balkan region showed the lowest return period of hot dry events in summer which is clearly related with the increase above mentioned this statistically significant increase can also be observed in spring accounting for 61 8 of the study area it is in these two seasons summer and spring that a bias is clearly observed in the distribution of the frequency anomalies between the two periods fig 1c indicating a sharp increase in their recurrence and in a lesser extent in winter and autumn the opposite case has been detected for the wet cold extremes in which a clearly significant decrease in this type of concurrent extreme is quantified fig 1b this covers quite a large area in summer i e 58 4 of the area and in spring 54 6 fig s3b a general pattern observed during summer dry warm and wet cold extremes is that the eastern part of the mediterranean basin responds with greater statistical robustness to the significant increases and decreases in such concurrent extremes in accordance with previous studies on precipitation in this specific area mathbout et al 2018 zittis 2018 the dry cold and wet warm extremes present a decrease and an increase respectively however all the changes in the set of compound extremes appear to indicate that the thermal component is what drives the increase in the frequency of warm months e g dry warm and wet warm whereas it causes a decrease in cold months such as the dry cold and wet cold ones a phenomenon also detected in other regions such as china wu et al 2019 or in europe in relation to dry warm extremes manning et al 2019 this thermal rise leading to an increase in dry and warm extremes has also been clearly discerned in the mediterranean basin vogel et al 2021 as well as in more local regions such as the pyrenees lemus canovas and lopez bustins 2021a 3 2 impact of teleconnections on dry warm and wet cold compound events this section analyzes the impact of teleconnection patterns on the dry warm and wet cold concurrent extremes discarding the dry cold and wet warm months which are seen to be less relevant in this region at the frequency level herein we first analyze the direction using the odds ratio of the relationship between the dry warm and wet cold compound extremes and the teleconnections capable of varying the frequency of these events fig 2 these results reveal that for dry warm and wet cold extremes the ea and mo patterns are the ones displaying the clearest significant relationship therewith the former pattern represents 83 of the area in winter for dry warm extremes and the latter one refers to 48 of the mediterranean area for this same season and kind of extremes these results show a clear dipole in their relationship with dry warm extremes with a positive relationship between the mo values and these extremes in the whole north western region during winter and spring fig 2a mo this phenomenon can also last into the autumn season but is irrelevant in summer in contrast this relationship is inverse odds ratio below 1 in the southeast of the study area fig 2a mo in its positive phase positive anomalies of slp and z500 clearly dominate in the western half of the mediterranean basin whereas the opposite situation occurs in the eastern half where negative anomalies of both variables dominate mainly in winter and spring fig 3 mo winter and spring due to the formation of the well known cyprus low hochman et al 2020 thus in this positive phase the western mediterranean basin is affected by intrusions of dry subtropical air which is clearly associated with an increase in the likelihood of dry and warm extremes occurring in this area during the four seasons analysed especially in autumn and spring fig 4 a on the contrary in a large part of northern africa under this positive phase of the mo an inverse relationship is quantified between its values and the co occurrence of dry and warm months in other words the placement of the dipole in this positive phase favours advection of the northern component with a high moisture contribution to the southern eastern basin törnros 2013 fig 3 mo winter and spring this means that under this positive mo phase months are more likely to be cold and wet in this area reaching probabilities of occurrence close to 20 30 mainly along the coasts of the southern levant and north eastern africa fig 4c during the negative phase of the mo fig 5 one would expect to observe an exchange of roles between the northwest and southeast regions of the basin with the former zone more susceptible to wet cold events however disposition of the low pressure during this winter phase is largely based on the cyclogenesis appearing in northern italy so that its disposition does favour cold advection albeit with a continental and dry track preventing wet cold synergy fig 5 mo winter this results in a very weak influence in winter which can also last until autumn fig 2b mo and in the occurrence of wet cold events over the northwestern mediterranean basin in spring the position of the low favours a high moisture flow towards the iberian peninsula together with cooler temperatures fig 5 mo spring favouring an increase in the probability of wet and cold months occurring during this negative phase probabilities of occurrence between 50 and 60 fig 4d are reached in the abovementioned region in this negative phase northeast africa and the eastern mediterranean basin are affected by positive anomalies in slp and z500 thus increasing the likelihood of dry warm events arising up to 40 in the aforementioned regions mainly in winter and spring fig 4b it should be noted that the empirical probabilities obtained for the summer season may not be linked to the internal variability of the mo teleconnection pattern since in this season the slp and z500 dipole disappears completely fig 3 and fig 5 mo summer the ea shows a positive relationship with this type of dry warm extreme practically throughout the area with very widespread coverage in winter as already mentioned but this relationship is also positive in summer spring and autumn fig 2a ea in all seasons during the positive phase of the ea the high sw ne zonality promotes the intrusion of subtropical ridges into the western mediterranean these ridges even reach the northern part of the eastern mediterranean fig 3 ea winter remarkably although the ea and nao dipoles present a similar structure the ea possesses a strong subtropical link associated with modulations in the intensity and location of the subtropical ridge while the positive phase of the nao gives rise to a dry but not warmer environment thus the positive phase of the nao exerts less influence on the occurrence of dry and warm extremes because the air mass originates at a more northerly latitude than in the positive ea fig 3 nao winter this means that there is a 30 likelihood of a dry warm month occurring during the positive phase of the ea in the eastern part of north africa and the iberian peninsula in the southern half of italy and in the balkan area especially during winter spring and summer fig 4a precisely some authors identified a strong relationship between a postive ea phase and negative precipitation anomalies and positive temperature anomalies in the northern part of the mediterranean toreti et al 2010a toreti et al 2010b rust et al 2015 the negative phase of the ea is weakly related to the occurrence of dry warm months in the mediterranean basin since under this phase neutral or negative anomalies predominate fig 5 ea this negative phase on the contrary strongly influences the occurrence of wet cold months fig 2b ea the negative phase of the ea is characterised by an anticyclonic block in the western area of the british isles in autumn this gets stronger in winter and in the following seasons becoming more intense in the north atlantic this implies that the european atlantic coast including the northwestern part of the iberian peninsula presents drier weather sousa et al 2017 whilst the western and northern half of the mediterranean is favoured by a wetter and colder weather regime with a 40 50 probability of a wet cold month occurring in the balkan area this teleconnection pattern plays a less important role in the eastern end of the mediterranean basin as mentioned above the nao has a strong link with the ea but its dipole exhibits a more northerly position transferring wet weather into the northern half of the basin philandras et al 2011 as well as into the north of morocco ahmed et al 2016 during its negative phase mainly during winter the negative phase of the nao also implies lower than average temperatures lópez moreno et al 2011 a fact which to some extent influences the occurrence of wet cold months throughout the northern half of the basin fig 2b nao albeit without providing very high probabilities of occurrence fig 4d logically its positive phase more pronounced in autumn and winter fig 3 nao restricts the position of the polar jet towards northern latitudes implying dry and warm conditions throughout the northern part of the mediterranean fig 4a however there is a lower probability of a dry warm month occurring fig 4a because the air mass is not linked to a subtropical origin as in the case of the ea nonetheless in autumn and under this positive phase slightly negative geopotential height anomalies at 500 hpa with some cyclonic airflow can be observed over northern algeria and morocco fig 3 nao this reveals a greater likelihood of wet cold events in these two regions under the positive phase of the nao which is consistent with the positive relationship between precipitation and the nao detected in the eastern atlas druing november by ahmed et al 2016 in summer the nao pattern is very weakened with a lower pressure gradient than in the rest of the seasons in fact in the summer version of the nao folland et al 2009 its positive phase implies high pressure and dry warm weather in northern europe uk and scandinavia in contrast throughout the mediterranean basin the probability of occurrence of wet cold extremes increases markedly reaching probabilities of 50 in many coastal locations in the northern and southern half of the basin fig 4c on the other hand in the negative phase of the summer nao the synoptic configuration favours intrusions of warm and dry air mainly in the eastern half of the mediterranean basin showing a pattern very similar to the positive phase of the ea fig 4b we found that the eawr is a significant modulator of the co occurrence of dry warm and wet cold months along the eastern façade of the mediterranean basin fig 2a eawr in this sense as its maximum influence is in late autumn and winter the positive phase of the eawr generates a strong central european and scandinavian anticyclonic block as a result of the northward expansion of the azores high pressure centre fig 3 eawr such an atmospheric configuration brings northerly cold air together with a large amount of moisture from the black sea towards the easternmost mediterranean krichak and alpert 2005 ionita 2014 baltacı et al 2018 from spring onwards the global geopotential height anomalies related to the eawr show a significant decrease in intensity thus weakening its dipole especially in this positive phase precisely the positive phase in winter makes wet cold months up to 30 40 more likely to occur on the easternmost mediterranean coastline fig 4c its negative phase triggers the opposite situation negative z500 and slp anomalies are established in central europe whereas in eastern europe and russia the anomalies become positive fig 5 eawr causing higher temperatures and drier weather than usual in the eastern mediterranean area with a probability of over 30 of dry warm extremes occurring in winter fig 4b although the wemo is of certain relevance in the northern part of the study area it plays a secondary role this teleconnection pattern by definition limited to controlling atmospheric variability in the western half of the mediterranean basin martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 is most pronounced between mid autumn and early spring when both the positive and negative anomalies of slp and the z500 associated with this dipole are most pronounced its positive phase characterised by a slight northerly movement of the azores high pressure centre favours inflows of air from the north and northwest in central europe as well as in the central and northern mediterranean area fig 3 wemo in addition this phase favours cyclogenesis in the gulf of genoa which eventually brings precipitation to northern italy and nearby areas trigo et al 2002 this positive phase implies a probability of up to 50 of wet cold months occurring in central france and northern italy fig 4c especially during spring and summer in the negative phase of the wemo fig 5 wemo there is an area of low pressure in the sw of the iberian peninsula during the cold period of the year which practically disappears in summer in contrast in central europe and southern scandinavia positive anomalies of slp and z500 prevails this pattern is the cause of torrential rainfall events in different parts of the eastern iberian peninsula lopez bustins et al 2020 insua costa et al 2021 lemus canovas et al 2021b due to the maritime path of the air flow despite the highs amounts of precipitation in this area the mediterranean origin of the air mass does not imply the occurrence of cold extremes in the eastern iberia only in areas of southern iberia during spring and northern morocco between autumn and spring probabilities of occurrence of around 20 30 of wet cold extremes are observed the poleur and scand teleconnections play quite an insignificant role in the modulation of concurrence extremes in the mediterranean area in the case of scand it still has a certain influence upon the variability of precipitation in the mediterranean it is characterised in its positive phase by an anticyclonic anomaly over fennoscandia and western russia as well as by negative pressure anomalies around the iberian peninsula fig 3 scand a dipole that remain fairly stable throughout the 4 seasons its positive phase enhances mediterranean cyclogenesis and causes above average precipitation in the north western part of the mediterranean it presents its precipitation maxima over the iberian peninsula and the central northern mediterranean region krichak et al 2014 in addition it involves slightly below average temperatures rust et al 2015 in these areas revealing a notable influence on the co occurrence of wet cold months fig 2b scand especially during spring and summer with a relevant impacton the co occurrence probability reaching the 50 in the western half of the basin fig 4c fig 6 provides a synthetic analysis showing for each compound extreme the teleconnection pattern that implies the strongest likelihood of such an extreme occurring along with the maximum probability value this indicates that the mo is presented as a teleconnection capable of predicting the occurrence of dry warm and wet cold months throughout much of the north western façade especially on the iberian peninsula where a strong influence of this teleconnection upon precipitation has already been observed martinez artigas et al 2021 for this area the mo plays an important role in driving dry warm months during the autumn and wet cold extremes during the spring exceeding probabilites of occurrence of 0 6 additionaly the mo also regulates the occurrence of this kind of compound extremes in the south eastern mediterranean during the three seasons and implying probability values of occurrence reaching 0 4 0 5 as previously stated the ea also plays a vital role in the occurrence of dry warm months in the northeastern mediterranean during the four seasons particularly in the area covered by balkan peninsula and the carpathians the ea also partially modulates the occurrence of wet cold extremes in the above mentioned regions extending its influence to the south western mediterranean especially in winter and spring nonetheless the probability values of ocurrence are not very high for the balkan peninsula only presenting a probability of around 0 3 during autumn in contrast in the areas influenced by the ea pattern in the italian peninsula eastern iberia northern morocco northern algeria and northern tunisia the probabilities of occurrence for these wet cold extremes reach practically 0 5 after the ea the eawr shows a stronger influence in the eastern mediterranean partially enabling the occurrence of dry warm and wet cold months to be modulated during winter and producing probabilities of around 0 4 in both types of concurrent extremes the remaining teleconnection patterns play a secondary role for example the influence of the nao is very restricted to the ocurrence of wet cold extremes in the south central mediterranean during autumn and in some areas of the south western mediterranean during summer on the other hand the wemo exerts a certain degree of influence in the centre north of the mediterranean region during autumn and spring in the concurrence of wet cold months reaching probabilities of around 0 3 05 the scand has a greater influence in the occurrence of wet cold extremes during summer north western part of the mediterranean basing reaching probabilities arround 0 4 05 finally the atmospheric variability by the poleur teleconnection is of residual relevance with regard to accounting for the occurrence of these compound extremes 4 study limitations this study is of course not free of limitations which are discussed next the first limitation relates to the selection of the threshold for defining the joint temperature and precipitation extremes the selection of the 25th and 75th percentile used in this work only represents a slight deviation from the mean although it does allow to account a certain number of concurrences often the 10th and 90th percentiles are used to define extreme thresholds i e manning et al 2019 tavakol et al 2020 however the downside is is that the number of co occurring extremes for these thresholds may be very low if the time series are short another important limitation of this work is related to the study period the influence of teleconnections in driving the probability of occurrence of a concurrent extreme may vary depending on the selection of the time period these teleconnections suffer variations with periods more linked to positive or negative phases visbeck et al 2001 mellado cano et al 2019 thus the selection of the study period may have some influence on the probability occurrence of these extreme events however in this work we used the longest period available 1951 2020 of the era 5 dataset to get the most robust results possible and avoiding major uncertainties related to the above it would be of notable interest for a future work to use atmospheric general circulation models agcms to test whether all teleconnections used in this work are robust to internal atmospheric variability as brands 2017 performed for the enso pattern in this way for each model of the ensemble we could compute robustly the probability of co occurrence of extremes and also quantifying the uncertainty of such probabilities 5 conclusions we studied the changes observed in the 4 possible types of compound extremes derived from temperature and precipitation as well as the impact of different teleconnections thereupon over the 1951 2020 period the main results indicate an increase in the frequency of those compound extremes related to the increase of temperature such as dry warm extremes mainly in summer and spring throughout much of the mediterranean basin or in a lesser extent the wet warm extremes on the contrary the frequency of wet cold and dry cold extremes exhibits a decrease throughout most of the mediterranean in these two seasons as for the impact of these teleconnections on the frequency of dry warm and wet cold compound extremes the most frequent ones in the mediterranean area results show that the mo plays a significant role in driving dry warm and wet cold extremes between autumn and spring over large areas of the north western and south eastern mediterranean basin as a consequence of the diposition of the centres of its dipole specifically we observed that the postive phase of the mo partially drives the variability of dry warm months as opposed to the negtive phase which modulates wet cold months in the above mentioned areas the ea was also seen to strongly influence the occurrence of this kind of concurrent extremes in this case this pattern was closely related to dry warm months during its positive phase due to its linkage to the dynamics of the subtropical ridges in the atlantic ocean in this sense the positive phase of the ea constitutes an important driver of dry warm extremes in most of the north eastern mediterranean basin and also of wet cold months during the negative phase of this pattern similar to the ea but presenting an eastward displacement of its dipoles we found that the eawr is a significant driver of dry warm and wet cold months in the easternmost part of the mediterranean basin however the southern half of the basin displays the weakest response to the influence of these teleconnections the ea mo and eawr teleconnections represent the three most important ones in this area finally the remaining teleconnections analysed the nao the wemo the scand and the poleur exert a much weaker influence upon the concurrence of dry warm and wet cold extremes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

3516,while fractures are commonly filled in the subsurface they have received little attention in terms of flow and solute transport this study presents a semi analytical solution for a reactive contaminant in a five layer fracture matrix groundwater system characterized by a thin rock matrix separating the fractures which are taken to be filled with sediments under conditions of steady groundwater flow using the laplace transform for two scenarios of two dimensional unilateral and three dimensional radial flows the solutions have obtained that account for longitudinal advective transport in the mobile portion of fractures and transverse diffusion in the adjacent matrices the mathematical models in the real time domain are derived by numerically inverting the solutions from the laplace domain and validated against both the numerical and existing semi analytical solutions examples of the solution behavior are presented which demonstrate an increase in the fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratio tends to increase the solute concentration in the adjacent matrices particularly under unilateral flowrate because in addition to the groundwater velocity peclet number and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient also plays a significant role in solute transport compared to the fracture the solute behavior in the matrices particularly under the unilateral flow case is more sensitive to changes in the parameters the porosity of the rock matrix has a twofold effect since as porosity is increased the retardation factor decreases while storage capacity increases a thinner middle matrix in addition to a lower peak in tritium and uranium concentrations inside the whole system over long time periods is further accompanied by a quick overlapping the concentration penetration depth of adjacent fractures the diffusion process in the rock matrix has been further identified as important as advection in the fracture for those repositories that are planned to safely dispose wastes for a long time the idea of combining multiple fractures as a single one with a double aperture is found to be only reasonable for the conservative solute under the steady state or long time conditions while it is not to be useful for the cases of sorptive solutes under the unsteady state solute transport the findings of this study can assist for simulating tracer tests as well as fate transport and remediation of groundwater contaminants in fractured rocks to better evaluate the safety degree of deep reservoirs in regard to disposal of nuclear and chemical wastes keywords uranium and tritium transport fractured aquifers semi analytical solution laplace transform 1 introduction as a substantial volume of the world s water and energy resources exist in fractured geological systems the solute transport process in underground multi layer systems has been extensively studied by many researchers tang and aral 1992a tang and aral 1992b zhan et al 2009a zhan et al 2009b liu et al 2013 rezaei et al 2013 rezaei et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 solute transport in fractured rocks is of particular interest owing to its application to different hydrogeological and environmental aspects such as disposal of radioactive and groundwater contamination in hard rock aquifers bodin et al 2003 pouya 2012 roubinet et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 understanding contaminant transport in this type of systems is essential as for example lustgarten 2012 estimates there are 680 000 underground waste and injection wells across the us where 7 000 sites showed signs that their walls were leaking hydraulic fracturing which mostly happened in hard rocks is another case that is important for solute transport since it acts as a possible source of pollution to groundwater systems mehany and kumar 2019 rodriguez et al 2020 the fractured media contain two distinct regions of matrix and fissures each with its own specific transport behavior tang and aral 1992a the matrix is of higher storage capacity and relatively slow flow velocity while the fractures usually have a lower storage capacity and quick flow velocity wilson and witherspoon 1970 zhou et al 2017 in the ideal cases when the solute injected into the fracture does not interact with the rock matrix and does not substantially diffuse into the bounded matrices it will migrate at the same velocity as the groundwater owing to the heterogeneities of the real systems water flows with various velocities and the solute flowrate is likely dispersed around the mean moreno et al 1997 advection diffusion and retardation are the primary factors that control solute transport in groundwater systems cvetkovic and frampton 2012 in the advection mechanism groundwater flowderives and spreads a solute mainly along with fractures whileretardation decelerates the solute travel relative to water flow although diffusion into the rock matrix can be considered negligible either if the contact time between contaminants and rock matrix is too short or the diffusion coefficient is too small on the long timescale involved in the disposal of nuclear and chemical wastes diffusion into the rock matrix usually acts as a principal mechanism neretnieks 1980 while the minerals of the rock matrix can provide a capacity for storage the contaminant can pass through a thin matrix unit and diffuse into the adjacent fractures and the remains of the system over long time periods parker et al 2012 sharifi haddad et al 2012 given the long timescale involved in the disposal of nuclear and chemical wastes no experimental tests could be accomplished along with the desired distances so that prediction modeling is commonly conducted to simulate the transport of such contaminants moreno et al 1997 having fractures with a complex morphology of rough walls and variable apertures qian et al 2011a wang et al 2021 that actively interact with their surrounding rock matrices the fracture matrix system remains a difficult feature to represent accurately in mathematical flow and transport models houseworth et al 2013 nonetheless the existing solute transport semi analytical models for the fracture matrix systems have been highly simplified by considering a diffusion dominating process or single fracture tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 chen 1986 brown et al 1998 esposito and thomson 1999 roubinet et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 the existing semi analytical solutions for parallel multi fractures e g sudicky and frind 1982 barker 1982 małoszewski and zuber 1985 sharifi haddad et al 2012 chen and zhan 2018 are restricted to open fractures without any filling while fractures are typically filled with unconsolidated geologic media wealthall et al 2001 bradner and murdoch 2005 the solute transport process in a filled fracture is different from an open one owing in part to a profound impact that the filling sediments have on flow and solute transport qian et al 2011b as an example lunati et al 2003 reported that the propagation front in filled fissures is smoother than those in open ones qian et al 2011b experimentally focused on solute transport in a single fracture filled with unconsolidated sediment under non darcian flow conditions recently zhou et al 2017 derived a semi analytical mathematical model for the solute transport in a filled single fracture embedded in an impermeable rock matrix under 2d unilateral and three dimensional 3d radial flows the previous works on solute transport through the filled fractures are limited to single fracture systems bounded by matrices with an infinite thickness which may not be consistent with real cases containing matrices with finite thickness that could be passed by the solute within the long time frames of the model a thin matrix may therefore act as a pathway for exchanging water and solute mass between adjacent fractures and is no longer a barrier to solute transport zhu et al 2016 further pointed out that since either the concentration penetration depth of adjacent fractures overlapped with each other or the fractures are too closely spaced a single fracture model cannot sufficiently address the solute transport phenomena in a fracture matrix system so that developing parallel multi fractures models are essential considering now a system of five layer with two parallel filled fractures equally spaced this study attempts to extend the mobile immobile mathematical models for a single fracture system developed by zhou et al 2017 to include the effect of a thin middle rock matrix on solute transport this work addresses issues beyond those covered by zhou et al 2017 first zhou et al 2017 considered a single fracture bounded to infinite matrices while this paper solves a system with two parallel fractures intervening by a thin rock matrix which provides an opportunity to explore the effect of middle matrix properties on solute transport in the system in practice zhou s solutions can therefore be regarded as special cases of this study by assuming an infinitely thick middle matrix second they only took into account tritium a conservative radionuclide while this work compares the results from conservative tritium and sorptive uranium radionuclides and found that the solute behavior may not be the same for both conservative and sorptive solutes signifying the significant role of the contaminant type for disposals third this paper further explores the impact of the retardation factor on solute behavior in different domains which was not discussed by zhou et al 2017 fourth the choice of a thin middle matrix is to further acknowledge testing the idea of combining two parallel fractures as a single one with a double aperture for solute modeling in the present study we develop a general understanding of the behavior of tritium and uranium transport through a fracture matrix system this paper is structured as follows following this introduction as can be seen in fig 1 the conceptual model is first presented then the mathematical model section presents the solution procedure including the definition of boundary value problem bvp nondimensional equations and numerically inverting the laplace domain solutions through the de hoog s algorithm de hoog et al 1982 finally in the results and discussion section after verification of the obtained solutions against the numerical and previous semi analytical solutions the effect of different principal parameters on the solute transport in the various domains of the system is discussed 2 conceptual model fig 2 shows a conceptual model where the solute enters the fractures at the left boundary the present work considers a case of a five unit fracture matrix medium with two parallel fractures intervening by a thin rock matrix which forms the fraction of the complete fracture network at a field scale notably there are some geological cases from micro to local scale in which a couple of parallel fractures fissures are separated by a relatively thin matrix and bounded to very thick matrices see figs s1 to s4 in supporting information which are compatible with the conceptual model shown in fig 2 two parallel filled fractures with a constant aperture 2b e g b 50 μm are horizontally extended sufficiently far from the domain of interest where the solute does not reach its downstream end the steady and unidirectional groundwater flow is established horizontal along either the x or r direction in the fractures the fractures are bounded by rock matrix units of small permeability the cartesian coordinate system is centered at the left boundary upstream on the plane of symmetry of the middle rock matrix the middle matrix has a finite thickness of 2b the length of the fracture matrix system is selected infinite along the x and y directions the y axis is perpendicular to the x axis on the horizontal plane and the z axis stands vertically upward the bounding rock matrices are homogeneous and horizontally isotropic notably this study only incorporates the diffusion for modeling solute inside the rock matrix overlooking advection because its hydraulic conductivity is highly smaller than that of the adjacent fractures as an example rukavičková et al 2021 reported that the hydraulic conductivity of the fractures in the bohemian massif in the czech republic is 1000 times of the adjacent rock matrix moreover the fractures convey times more water than the matrix given a head gradient parallel to the fracture planes due to differences in their relative hydraulic conductivity this study further takes into account fractures that are filled with sediments so that transport mechanisms through them are usually different from open ones the liquid phase inside the filled fracture medium contains mobile and immobile portions van genuchten and wierenga 1976 this type of problems cannot be solved using the advection dispersion equation which is often applied for modeling transport in homogeneous porous media or open fractures when the fracture is partially filled with sediments considering a mobile immobile approach is rather essential zhou et al 2017 the infilling sediments can be considered as immobile domains since they usually cause disconnections or dead end water pockets between pore spaces inside a fracture jodar et al 2009 qian et al 2011b zhou et al 2017 demonstrated that such a system can be satisfactorily explained with mobile immobile models as initially suggested by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 in this paper the fracture mobile refers to that portion of the filled fracture medium that contains dynamic water while the fracture immobile signifies the region that encompasses stagnant water the solute injects into both fractures at x 0 with a constant concentration c 0 and spreads along the y axis to a sufficiently far distance from the domain of interest so that the case is a 2d model on the x z plane it is supposed that a zero concentration gradient exists across the width of the fracture and the transverse dispersion through it therefore exerts no significant impact on the transport mechanism because 1 a small aperture of the fractures allows a complete vertical mixing throughout the fracture aperture instantaneously roubinet et al 2012 chen and zhan 2018 and 2 although the fractures are filled they could still be very porous and very permeable compared to the matrices zhou et al 2017 in an analogous problem rezaei et al 2016 further demonstrated that horizontal dispersion in the aquitard which is similar to the matrix and has a very slow permeability is ignorable for most practical cases of transport so that longitudinal diffusion through the rock matrix is ignored for both unilateral and radial cases for the second scenario i e the 3d radial flow the conceptual model remains the same as that for the first one i e 2d unilateral flow except for 1 a cylindrical coordinate system is conducted rather than a cartesian coordinate and 2 a radial flow field is established rather than a unilateral flow owing to an injection well at a constant rate q at the left boundary of the five layer system the well is established vertically along the z axis x y 0 in fig 2 the fractures are assumed plane and infinite along the horizontal direction the groundwater flow through the matrices is taken to be neglectable while radial flow occurs in both fractures diffusion is taken into account only along the vertical direction and only in the matrix fractures are assumed vertically well mixed similar to the unilateral flow case the problem therefore has a radial symmetry along the plane fractures and a vertical diffusion problem is solved in the matrices the main assumptions for solutions include 1 the whole system is assumed to be free of solute initially 2 a complete mixing of solute occurs throughout the fracture s aperture at all times so that transverse diffusion and dispersion in each fracture exert no significant effect on solute transport consistent with the findings by roubinet et al 2012 for a classical fracture matrix system 3 the immobile zones are perfectly mixed with solute concentration throughout 4 the retardation factor describes instantaneous equilibration between dissolved and sorbed solute in the immobile zone 5 it is assumed constant first order decay rates 6 similar to van genuchten and wierenga 1976 sorption processes in both the fracture mobile and fracture immobile are assumed to be instantaneous and 7 by ignoring the effect that the boundary layer near the fracture walls may have on solute transport a common darcy velocity and fickian solute transport types are used for the fracture system of fig 2 consistent with many previous works on solute transport in fracture matrix systems e g tang et al 1981 barker 1982 sudicky and frind 1982 małoszewski and zuber 1985 sharifi haddad et al 2012 roubinet et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 chen and zhan 2018 3 mathematical model 3 1 unilateral flow case from the conceptual model made and transport processes considered the bvp of solute transport for the first scenario can be defined in the cartesian coordinate system by the following governing equations and the initial and boundary conditions note that this paper only solves the equations for the upper half part of the conceptual model owing to the symmetry with respect to the x axis at z 0 in all the equations the subscripts m im k and t represent parameters belonging to fracture mobile fracture immobile upper and middle rock matrices respectively for concentration inside the fracture mobile c m van genuchten

where b and b are the half thickness of the fracture and middle rock matrix respectively q m up and q m lw are the diffusion mass fluxes between the fracture and the upper and middle rock matrix layers respectively ω is the first order mass transfer rate between the fracture mobile and fracture immobile λ is the decay constant which is defined as ln 2 t 0 5 where t 0 5 is the half life of the radionuclide species v m signifies the groundwater flow velocity in the fracture mobile r is the retardation factor i e the ratio of total solute mass dissolved plus sorbed to dissolved solute mass in the domains d m is the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the fracture and equal to α l υ m d in which α l is the longitudinal dispersivity and d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient in the fractures mobile d d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient in the rock matrix which defined as ε d where ε relates to tortuosity and d is diffusion coefficient neuman 1972 and finally θ is the total porosity in each domain for domain s porosity of θ its corresponding linear retardation factor is therefore estimated using r 1 r b k d θ for upper and lower matrices where r b is bulk density and k d represents sorption distribution coefficient sudicky and frind 1982 for fracture mobile and fracture immobile we respectively used the linear retardation factors of r m 1 f r b k d θ m and r im 1 1 f r b k d θ im obtained by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 where f is that fraction of the sorption sites which is in direct contact with the mobile region similar to van genuchten and wierenga 1976 a constant f 0 40 is used here using a constant particle density r s of 2 65 g cm3 the bulk density of each domain is computed by r b r s 1 θ notably the total porosity of the fracture domain θ is considered equal to θ m θ im consistent with zhou et al 2017 a constant distribution coefficient of 3 95 cm3 g is also used for uranium dai et al 2009 basically the procedure for the bvp solutions can be summarized by the following steps first performing laplace transform with respect to dimensionless time td after taking the following dimensionless definitions c md c m c 0 c imd c im c 0 c kd c k c 0 c td c t c 0 θ 1 θ im θ m θ 2 θ k θ m θ 3 θ t θ m p e v m b d m α 2 θ 2 r k d d r m d m α 3 θ 3 r t d d r m d m t d d m r m b 2 t x d x b z d z b r k d m r m d d q m up θ k d d c k z z d b 2 b b r k d m r m d d q m lw θ t d d c t z z d b b r k d m r m d d where the subscript d reveals the dimensionless terms pe is peclet number in the fractures θ 1 θ 2 and θ 3 are respectively the ratio of the porosity in the fracture immobile θ im the upper rock matrix θ k and the middle rock matrix θ t to the porosity of the fracture mobile θ m zhou et al 2017 defined the diffusion mass fluxes between the fracture and the upper q m up and lower q m lw rock matrices based on fick s law second the dimensionless equations for both the fracture mobile and fracture immobile as well as both the upper and middle matrices in the laplace domain are solved simultaneously as follows 5 c md x d p 1 p exp pe p e 2 4 k 2 x d f o r f r a c t u r e m o b i l e 6 c imd x d p 1 p α 1

and c td represent the concentration in the upper and middle rock matrices in the laplace domain respectively and p is the laplace parameter α 1 is the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the fracture mobile which seems to play a significant role in solute transport as discussed in section 4 the details of the procedure used to obtain the above solutions for each medium of the system are presented in appendix a based on the above solutions the peclet number in the fracture mobile has significant importance in solute transport through the whole system as the solutions for other domains eqs 6 8 are derived based on eq 5 it is expected that the solute migration rate through the system increases with peclet number beyond the peclet number the k and u parameters of the obtained solutions can also significantly control the transport k itself mainly depends on time i e p the fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratio and the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient particularly in the fracture mobile i e α 1 the u parameter further largely depends on the middle rock matrix properties including the fracture mobile middle matrix retardation factor ratio and the middle matrix fracture thickness ratio third the equations in the laplace domain are needed to be finally inverted to the real time domain inversion of the laplace transform is a critical step however it is difficult to be inverted analytically since closed form analytical solutions require individual techniques zlotnik and ledder 1992 fetter et al 2017 thanks to the applied de hoog s algorithm de hoog et al 1982 the solutions are therefore numerically obtained in the real time domain this algorithm is straightforward to use and only involves real p it has been used successfully by several authors for similar problems wang and zhan 2015 zhou et al 2017 zhou and zhan 2018 wang and zhan 2015 further tested the accuracy of the de hoog s method against a closed form analytical solution in the aquifer aquitard systems and found it highly accurate and robust regardless of the dispersion dominated or advection dominated situations this numerical technique uses the trapezoidal rule to successfully accelerate the convergence of the fourier series retrieved from the inversion integral zhou and zhan 2018 one can refer to wang and zhan 2015 for a detailed review of the numerical laplace inversion methods in the subsurface transport process 3 2 radial flow case in the radial flow model the solvent is injected through a well at a fixed rate q if groundwater background speed is ignored then the constant flow velocity υ m in the fracture mobile area is expressed as zhou et al 2017 9 υ m a r a q 4 π b θ e where r is the horizontal radial coordinate with the same origin x 0 and z 0 as in fig 2 and θ e is the effective porosity in the fracture which equals the amount of mobile water content θ m for this case the radial hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d r is defined as follows 10 d r d v m d a r where d is the radial dispersivity the governing equations for each domain shown in fig 2 are defined in the following notably the velocity changes and near well non laminar groundwater flow are simply ignored here similar to the unilateral flow case this case is also symmetric relative to the r axis at z 0 for the fracture mobile 11 θ m r m c m t θ im r im c im t θ m d r 2 c m r 2 θ m a r c m r θ m λ 1 r m c m q m up b q m lw b 11a c m r r 0 t c 0 11b c m r t 0 11c c m r t c t r z b t c k r z b 2 b t 11d c m r

parameters are kept the same as those used for the unilateral flow case similar to the first scenario the three above steps are accomplished to solve the equations in order to nondimensionalize the governing equations and their corresponding boundary conditions the following variables are used c md c m c 0 c imd c im c 0 c kd c k c 0 c td c t c 0 θ 1 θ im θ m θ 2 θ k θ m θ 3 θ t θ m τ 1 d 2 r m

lw θ t d d c t z z d b d r k a r m d d given the procedure explained in appendix b the equations describing the concentration at each time and location of the domains in the system are then derived in the laplace domain as follows c md r d p 1 p exp 1 2 r d r 0 d a i β 1 3 r d 4 β 1 a i β 1 3 r 0 d 4 β 1 for fracture mobile 15 c imd r d p 1 p τ 1 ω p θ im r im τ 1 ω τ 1 λ 2 θ im r im exp 1 2 r d r

the de hoog s algorithm similar to the unilateral flow case 3 3 steady state solutions steady state solutions are practically important to understand the long term transport behavior of different mediums in the system an advantage of our model with respect to the existing semi analytical models such as sudicky and frind 1982 and chen and zhan 2018 is it s capable of estimating the possible deepest penetration of solute into the adjacent matrices which occurs either under steady state or at long term they solved the governing equation only for half fracture and half matrix fig s5 by assigning such a boundary condition of c x z b t z 0 at the middle of the matrix this type of boundary condition assigns the zero vertical changes in concentration around the middle line of the matrix by assuming highly overlapped penetration depths between adjacent fractures in contrast the present study for each of the domains of the whole upper matrix the half middle matrix and the entire fracture derives its own equation using the boundary conditions of c k x z t 0 eq 3b for the upper matrix and c t z z 0 0 eq 4b for the middle rock matrix in practice the whole thickness of the upper matrix has been considered for our proposed solutions which allows quantitatively capturing the deepest penetration as explained in section 4 2 5 the steady state solutions for both the unilateral and radial flow cases are derived by conducting the following conditions 19 c m t c im t c t t c k t 0 eq 19 yields the highest possible solute concentration which does not any more change with longer times the steady state solutions for each domain can be derived through computing the limits of p c md p c imd p c kd and p c td as p goes to zero zhou et al 2017 and the identity of f t d lim p p f p where f p and f t d are the laplace transform and the steady state solution for f t d respectively here f p corresponds to eqs 5 8 for the unilateral case and eqs 15 18 for the radial model the analytical solutions can therefore be derived as follows under the unilateral flow model c md exp pe p e 2 4 k 2 x d for the fracture mobile c imd α 1 ω α 1 ω α 1 λ θ im r im exp pe p e 2 4 k 2 x d

verify the validity of the proposed solutions we compared them to 1 a numerical model and 2 zhou et al s 2017 solution which deals with a similar problem but with a three unit system of infinitely thick rock matrices a two dimensional numerical finite element model with a domain of 10 m wide and 5 m deep was built by comsol multiphysics to test the semi analytical solutions derived here for the unilateral case flow such relative width and depth values are selected for the system to ensure that the impact of limit boundaries on solute behavior is insignificant during the timescale of interest fig 3 shows a segment of finite element mesh applied in the numerical model where the finest mesh grids are selected for the middle portion of the system containing the two parallel fractures separated by a relatively thin rock matrix the fracture s aperture is equal to 100 µm the thickness of the middle rock matrix is 200 μm the porosity in the fracture mobile 0 818 is selected to be 10 times that in the fracture immobile 0 0818 a fixed velocity of 0 01 m d is selected only for the fractures the porosity in the matrix is chosen to be 0 3 a constant solute concentration is injected across the left borders of the fractures an observation point is picked arbitrarily at the middle of the upper fracture 50 µm 150 µm to explore the breakthrough curve of the system fig 4 a the blue solid line in fig 4a shows the semi analytical solution derived in the present work and the red circles represents the results by numerical model from comsol as can be observed from fig 4a our semi analytical solution and the finite element simulation yield identical breakthrough curves to make our five unit model identical to the three unit medium of zhou et al 2017 with a single fracture bounded by infinitely thick rock matrices a special case example is considered here in which the upper fracture in our model is simply bounded by two infinitely thick rock matrices in other words to convert our five layer system to a three layer one the thickness of the middle rock matrix is chosen to be wide enough so that the possible effect that the limit boundary of the adjacent rock matrix may have on solute transport can be ignored the same parameter values are taken into account for both our and zhou s cases to solve the two unilateral and radial models the darcy velocity q in the fracture mobile is taken to be 0 01 m day under the unilateral flow model and the dispersion coefficient to be 0 00611 m2 s under both unilateral and radial solutions tang et al 1981 schumer et al 2003 zhou et al 2017 as an example fig 4b and c compare the concentration breakthrough curves for the fracture mobile from our and zhou s models under both unilateral and radial flows respectively the breakthrough curves from our model for both the scenarios are highly agreed with those from zhou s model signifying the correctness and robustness of the presented solutions 4 2 findings from the developed solutions unlike zhou et al s 2017 work on filled fractures which assumed a rock matrix with infinite thickness this paper by considering a thin rock matrix intervening the parallel fractures in a fracture matrix system offers an opportunity to explore some different aspects of solute behaviors than assuming infinitely thick aquitards this work also explores the effect that the retardation factor can have on solute transport by comparing the results from conservative tritium and sorptive uranium radionuclides in practice the retardation factor varies with porosity changes in each domain when the solute is sorptive notably we further explored the effect that the soil distribution coefficient has on the retardation factor and solute transport as explained in section 4 2 3 in fact a porosity dependent retardation factor is more realistic than a constant factor in all the domains some new findings are illustrated as follows notably table 1 lists the parameter values used to plot different case examples in the following sections 4 2 1 porosity effects on solute transport the porosity impacts on the transport behavior of tritium and uranium radionuclides are examined by selecting different fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratios θ m θ im as well as various porosities for rock matrices as listed in table 1 notably the variations in the porosity for the fracture mobile and fracture immobile are performed under the constraint of θ m θ im 0 9 and a fixed dispersion coefficient consistent with the work by zhou et al 2017 two distinct radionuclides are injected tritium conservative with r 1 and uranium sorptive with r values 1 which is porosity dependent figs 5 8 for uranium and s6 s7 for tritium show the breakthrough curves from the different porosity values for both the fracture mobile and fracture immobile and both the upper and middle matrices under the unilateral and radial flow models although both the conservative and sorptive radionuclides show a similar transport behavior conservative tritium spreads quicker than sorptive uranium consistent with observations from zhou et al 2017 the time taken for the concentration to reach the peak in the radial flow model is highly smaller than that of the unilateral flow model owing in part to a higher velocity of the radial flow the fracture and matrix domains do not always respond to a specific change in porosity similarly since their response is highly controlled by the solute characteristics such as retardation factor the timescale fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratio θ m θ im and the flowrate scenarios for the unilateral flow scenario the θ m θ im ratio has no significant effect on solute transport inside the fracture however although an increase in the θ m θ im ratio leads to a decrease in solute concentration inside the fracture both mobile and immobile it is associated with a little decrease in solute concentration over long times not shown for the radial flowrate the concentration in all domains decreases with porosity ratio fig 6 and s7 on contrary under both flowrate scenarios the concentration of uranium and tritium increases with the θ m θ im ratio in both the upper and middle rock matrices fig 5c 5d s6c and s6d however compared to the fracture the solute behavior in the matrices is more sensitive to the changes in the porosity ratio for both the conservative and sorptive radionuclides under the unilateral flowrate scenario this discrepancy in solute behavior of the fracture and rock matrix domains at shorter times is due to that in addition to the groundwater velocity peclet number and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient other parameters such as the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the fracture mobile i e α 1 also play a significant role in solute behavior of the system according to υ m q θ m with constant darcy s velocity q a larger porosity in the fracture mobile is associated with a smaller groundwater velocity υ m peclet number and longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient our investigations also demonstrate that the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the fracture mobile i e α 1 in the dimensionless list has a significant effect on the solute concentration when the porosity changes as an example under the same conditions for the unilateral flow case the increase of the θ m θ im ratio from 1 to 10 is associated with a 79 increase in α 1 and a 45 decrease in groundwater velocity fig 5 overall an increase in the θ m θ im ratio tends to affect the whole system particularly the adjacent matrices signifying the significant role of those materials filled the fractures these observations highlight the importance of studying the characteristics of those sediments filled fractures during solute transport investigation similar to zhou et al 2017 for a case with darcy velocity of 0 01 m d and dispersion coefficient of α l 0 5 m it is observed that the θ m θ im ratio on the whole has no significant effect on solute behavior inside the fracture mobile figs s6a and s7a although the solute concentration infinitesimally increases by decreasing the porosity ratio under unilateral flow case zhou et al 2017 observed that the smaller θ m θ im ratios lead to higher solute concentrations in the fracture mobile at earlier times which is similar to our observations in fig 5a they have not explored the effect that the ratio has on the fracture immobile and adjacent matrices however there are some discrepancies between our results and those from zhou et al 2017 that may arise from the fact that zhou et al 2017 considered a small porosity 0 01 for the rock matrix while this paper considers large porosity 0 3 for the rock matrices consistent with a large porosity i e up to 0 31 measured in clean quartz arenites subarkoses and argillaceous quartz arenites by caruso et al 1985 as an example moreover the porosity in the regional sandstone aquifer of wajid sw saudi arabia is as high as 0 45 al ajmi et al 2014 the boise sandstone also has a high porosity ranging from 0 21 to 0 35 and a vast hydraulic conductivity range from 3 6e 04 to 1 57 m day zhu and wong 1997 this work therefore selects porosity of 0 30 for the matrix and hydraulic conductivity of 0 01 m day for the fracture that lie somewhere within the measurements from the above geological cases the other notable point regarding the breakthrough curves is that the solute peak concentration occurs in the fracture sooner and at significantly higher levels than the adjacent matrices particularly in the unilateral flow case figs 5 and s6 as an example for the two dimensional unilateral case fig 5 the uranium solute for the case of θ m θ im 10 reaches to the desired point x 500 µm inside the fracture after several days while in the adjacent rock matrices after thousands of days these different times are due to the advection being the dominant process in the fracture while in the fracture immobile and the rock matrices the solute migration derives mostly from the diffusion process however although the behavior of the solute transport in both the upper or lower and middle rock matrices are roughly similar fig s6 the solute concentration in the middle rock matrix is higher particularly at longer times since beyond the thinner thickness that the middle matrix has it receives higher solute mass from both the adjacent fractures from the upper and bottom borders it is therefore expected that the safety of the deep repositories would decrease by increasing the fracture density in the geological settings even under the presence of fractures with micro scale apertures the impact of the rock matrix s porosity on uranium transport in the different domains of the system is also explored in figs 7 and 8 under the condition of constant values for particle density 2 65 g cm3 and distribution coefficient 3 95 cm3 g in practice the porosity of the rock matrix has a twofold effect on solute behavior inside the system a higher porosity in addition to providing a larger capacity for solute storage and thus reducing the solute concentration can further reduce the retardation and enhance the concentration of a reactive solute within the system when the solute transport is sufficiently fast such as the radiale flowrate scenario as the porosity of the upper rock matrix is increased the solute concentration inside the whole system decreases fig 8 signifying the storage capacity is more important compared to the retardation factor under the conditions considered for fig 8 on contrary under the unilateral case for the uranium in which the solute moves slowly the role of the retardation factor is stronger than the storage capacity fig 7c this work highlights that the porosity can have different roles on solute transport inside the fracture matrix systems under various conditions depending on the solute type and the time frame of interest moreover the solute peak concentration in the thin middle matrix is fairly larger than in the thick upper matrix under the unilateral flow case while in the radial case they have roughly the same concentration these results arise from the fact that since the thin middle matrix receives solute from both the upper and lower bounds the penetration into the middle matrix is deeper than the upper matrix particularly in short times in practice the longer the surface is exposed to the solute the higher is the diffusion effect as an example under the conditions used for fig 7d the solute penetration depth of adjacent fractures overlapped with each other after 12 000 days i e reaching the point of z 0 in the middle matrix given the above evidence the rock matrix characteristics such as porosity and thickness are of critical importance for the transport and remediation process as well as for the safety assessment of the deep geological disposals localized in the hard rocks 4 2 2 thin middle rock matrix effects on solute transport figs 9 10 and 11 analyze how the changes in the thickness of the middle matrix can affect the tritium and uranium radionuclides transport in the fracture and adjacent rock matrices under both the 2d unilateral flow and 3d radial flow models respectively in general as the thickness of the middle matrix is increased the solute concentration tends to increase in both the fracture mobile and fracture immobile as well as in the upper adjacent matrix chen and zhan 2018 likewise observed a higher solute concentration distributed at a specific time when more solutes remain inside the fractures it is worth noting that the behavior of both tritium and uranium inside the middle rock matrix during the short times is different from the long time periods there is a turning point in the breakthrough curve fig 9d and 10d and horizontal profile of the middle matrix fig s8 which is obtained from the steady state solutions the solute responses to changes in thickness are different before and after it as an example during long term periods longer than 2000 days in fig 9d it has similar behavior to other domains meanwhile the concentration increases with its thickness on contrary in the shorter time periods e g shorter than 2000 days in fig 9d the solute behavior inside the middle matrix is different from other domains of the system and the concentration tends to decrease in the thicker ones figs 9 and 11 this may arise from the fact that the diffusive flux in the thicker middle matrices tends to be larger because of the greater difference in solute concentration of the fracture and the matrix particularly when the middle matrix has not yet filled to capacity sudicky and frind 1982 as an example during the shorter times such as at t 1000 days in fig 9d the thicker middle matrix b 100 e 6 m has the lower solute concertation than the thinner ones resulting in a steeper transverse concentration gradient and eventual larger transverse diffusive flux a larger gradient on the whole is associated with a larger solute mass entering the whole fracture matrix system consistent with observations by sudicky and frind 1982 it is further observed that a thin middle rock matrix causes a more rapid increase in concentration with time and equilibrium is arrived earlier particularly in the middle matrix itself remarkably although a thicker middle matrix imposes higher tritium and uranium peak concentrations inside the whole system for long time periods fig 9d and 10d reveal that a peak concentration occurs quicker as the middle matrix is thinner owing in part to overlapping the penetration depths of adjacent fractures which changes the diffusive sink in the middle matrix zhu et al 2016 comparison of the unilateral and radial flow models demonstrate that the effect of the thickness of the middle matrix on the relative solute concentration is likely stronger for the unilateral flow case because the diffusion process which is dominant in the matrices has a longer time to contribute in solute transport the horizontal profile shown in fig 11 also depicts that the thickness of the middle matrix has a stronger effect on solute transport along the middle zone of the horizontal path 0 005 to 0 02 m these observations are somewhat similar to the largest difference in the middle concentration range observed by sudicky and frind 1982 during assessing the effect of neglecting dispersion under the condition of a small advective flux however the findings on the whole highlight the significant role of the thickness of the adjacent matrices for storing the solute within the fractured rock systems as well as those deep geological disposals buried in complex geological settings with highly dense fractures 4 2 3 retardation factor effect on solute transport as the retardation factor can play an important role in the behavior of reactive solutes in geological systems bagalkot and suresh kumar 2015 it is also explored how the retardation factor can affect the solute concentration in the different domains fig 12 shows how the retardation factor leads to a decrease in the sorptive uranium r 1 which is porosity dependent in comparison with conservative solute r 1 this reduction rate is highly smaller under the radial flow scenario as the higher speed of solute transport suppresses the retardation factor influence as an example in the unilateral flow case the retardation factor causes a 42 reduction in uranium concentration of the upper matrix at a time equal to 60 000 days on the contrary the retardation factor has led to a small increase in the solute concentration of the fracture domain owing in part to the fact that the retardation factor which itself depends on porosity can control the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient i e α 1 α 2 and α 3 in both the fracture and matrix domains notably the values of α 1 α 2 and α 3 also increase with an increase in the retardation factor as an example under the conditions used for fig 12a the value of α 1 α 2 and α 3 in the case of r 1 is respectively 1 51 4 12 and 4 12 times larger compared to the conservative case of r 1 these observations on the whole highlight the significant role of the retardation factor on solute transport in addition to porosity the soil distribution coefficient also acts as an important variable for the retardation factor so that its effects on solute transport are specifically explored figs 13 and 14 compare the breakthrough curves from enhanced soil distribution coefficients of 5 13 an increased quantity of 30 and 6 32 l kg 60 with those from the default distribution coefficients of 3 95 l kg under both the unilateral and radial flow scenarios an increase in distribution coefficients is accompanied by an enhancement in retardation factor i e a decrease in uranium concentration in all the domains of the system as shown in figs 13 and 14 the declined quantity of tritium is greater in the matrix domains than the fracture particularly under the unilateral case with lower flow and eventual solute advection rate the influence of the distribution coefficient on solute transport is stronger at the shallower parts of the matrices as an example when the soil distribution coefficient increases from 5 13 to 6 32 l kg the decreased concentration of uranium at the shallow depth of 50 μm is about 1 37 times compared to the deeper part of 100 μm in the upper matrix 4 2 4 well flowrate effect on solute transport in the 3d model the solute injects into the system via an injection well at a constant flowrate this provides an opportunity to quantify the flowrate impacts on the solute transport in a fracture matrix system fig 15 analyses the effect of the three different flowrates of 0 001 0 0008 and 0 0006 m3 d on the solute transport through different domains of the fracture both the mobile and immobile portions and rock matrices upper and middle as expected the solute concentration in all domains of the system tends to increase with well flowrate for both tritium and uranium owing to higher solute mass injection to the system during a specific time period similar to the thickness of the middle matrix the flowrate effect also strengthens over time since the larger increased rates correspond to the longer time periods it is observed that a 67 increase in flowrate from 0 6 to 1 l s is accompanied by an increase in uranium concentration inside all domains sharifi haddad et al 2012 similarly reported that an increase in the injection rate decreases the time required for the arrival of a contaminant the increased rate in the fracture mobile fracture immobile and upper and middle rock matrices is respectively equal to 17 84 15 00 15 41 and 17 60 at the time of 10 days in fig 15 which decrease at longer times in conclusion the flowrate of the injection wells is also very important during disposal meaning that when the rock matrices are thinner the flow rate should also be low to guarantee the safety of the geological disposals this process is similar to pumping wells that extract groundwater from perched fresh water aquifers overlaid on a saline aquifer such as the island aquifers in that system to prevent saline water intrusion to the well the pumping rate is controlled and remained at a very small rate mcwhorter et al 1977 todd and mays 2004 4 2 5 steady state solute profiles to explore the long term solute transport behavior in different domains of the system figs 16 and 17 present the relative tritium concentrations along with the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the concentrations shown in fig 16 are fully saturated at the left boundary i e the immediate vicinity of the solute source of both the fracture both mobile and immobile portions and middle rock matrix under the steady state conditions along the horizontal direction the solute concentrate gradually decreases to reach zero at a far distance as an example fig 16a indicates that the solute cannot spread longer than x 2 m along the horizontal direction in all the domains under the unilateral model flow it implies that the other parts of the system where are more than 2 m apart from the source are completely safe the other notable point is that under the same conditions the solute spreads a longer distance along the horizontal direction for the radial flow fig 16b compared to the unilateral case fig 16a owing to a flow that injected through a well it signifies that the safety of the repository which receives the contaminant through injection wells is lower and it can be advected into other parts of the system quicker remarkably the maximum penetration depth into the upper rock matrix is approximately the same for both the unilateral 2 05 m and radial 2 07 m flow cases not shown implying that the diffusion process acts identical for both scenarios the maximum penetration depth of 2 m into the adjacent matrices is compatible with the range of depths 1 76 to 2 93 m obtained by zhu et al 2016 for tritium solute and effective molecular diffusion coefficient of 1 16 10 10 m 2 s from the vertical profile shown in fig 17 it is observed that the middle matrix and adjacent fractures have the same solute concentration signifying that the thin middle matrix acts as a pathway at long times by generalizing this observation to the case in which a thin rock matrix separated a contaminated fracture from a clean one it is expected that the solute passes through the middle matrix wide and diffuse into the clean fracture at long times it highlights the diffusion process importance in those repositories that are planned to safely disposal wastes for a long time such as nuclear disposals by comparing figs 16 and 17 it further can be observed that the solute can diffuse through the middle matrix solely via diffusion mechanism as high as in the adjacent fractures by advection and dispersion processes in practice the longest distance passed by solute inside the fracture 2 m in fig 16a is the same as the deepest penetration depth in the adjacent thick matrix 2 m in fig 17 solely through the diffusion process neretnieks 1980 likewise argued that diffusion into the rock matrix usually acts as a principal mechanism for the long timescale involved in the disposal of nuclear and chemical wastes this high contribution of diffusion process in transport under steady state arises from the long surface i e surface between the fracture and rock matrix along the x y plane that exposed to the solute 2 m compared to the small apertures of the fracture 100 μm through which the solute advents and spreads notably similar observations are also obtained for uranium figs s9 and s10 these findings on the whole demonstrate that the safety of each repository is highly controlled by the process type advection or diffusion and geometry e g exposed surface as well as the time available for the solute to transport fig 18 indicates how the decay rate can affect the tritium transport inside the fracture mobile and the upper rock matrix under both the unilateral and radial flow scenarios the horizontal profiles obtained from tritium of the real half life of 12 35 yr are compared with those from the case in which half life is assumed to be 1 e 13 y r tritium on the whole would spread to farther distances inside the fracture and would penetrate the adjacent matrix deeper if it had an infinitely large half life particularly under the unilateral case with slower advection under the unilateral flow conditions shown in fig 18a the final distance that tritium of insignificant decay rate would spread is about six orders larger as compared to the real tritium with a half life of 12 35 yr this discrepancy in the taken path is about one order for the radial flow case fig 18b similarly the enhanced penetration depth into adjacent matrices is greater under the unilateral two orders than that the radial case one order these observations generally highlight the importance that the decay rate of the radionuclides has on transport behavior to explore whether the two fractures could behave as a single fracture of double aperture with an additional retardation factor that would arise due to retention in the intervening matrix the vertical concentration profile for the sorptive uranium under the unsteady state solute transport is further depicted in fig 19 comparison of figs 17 and 19 demonstrates that the idea of combining multiple fractures as a single one with double aperture to simplify modeling by using effective retardation coefficients that depend on the properties of the intervening matrix seems to be only reasonable when the conservative solute is injected for steady state or long time conditions on contrary the idea appears not to be useful for the cases of sorptive solutes under the unsteady state solute transport in the case of steady state solute transport the concentration level inside the middle matrix is roughly equal to that in the adjacent fractures due to the penetration depths highly overlapping between adjacent fractures so that the idea of combining multiple fractures as a single one could be reasonable in contrast fig 19 depicts that although the concentration in the middle matrix is larger than that in the upper matrix it is largely smaller than the concentrations inside the fractures meanwhile the middle rock matrix acts as a specific unit where its porosity storage capacity and thickness are important for solute transport inside the whole system 4 2 6 uncertainties and future works although this study improves our understanding from the effect of porosity thin intervening rock matrix properties retardation factor and the well flowrate on solute behavior in two filled parallel fractures separated by a thin rock matrix there are some simplifications and unfinished tasks associated with the present solutions that should be explored in the future first this work is limited to analytical and numerical simulations and no laboratory and field experimental data used to verify the presented models owing in part to the difficulty of the data collection in micro scale fractures and rock matrices in which the transport process usually needs an extremely long time to take place rezaei et al 2016 second the fracture walls are simply assumed to be smoothed and equally spaced while in the real case the roughness and variable aperture may have a significant effect on the dispersion coefficient and eventual solute transport qian et al 2011a third it is simply assumed that the darcy flow velocity and dispersivity do not change with the porosity of the fracture mobile according to the 2 500 dispersion tests on natural and artificial materials conducted by klotz and moser 1974 a higher porosity leads to higher hydraulic conductivity and a lower dispersivity chen 1991 on the other hand darcy velocity has a direct relationship with hydraulic conductivity thus one can conclude that darcy velocity increases with the porosity of fractured rocks 5 conclusions two distinct mathematical models 2d unilateral and 3d radial are semi analytically derived for a two fracture system intervening by a thin matrix these models allow one to explore the effect of thickness of the middle matrix on solute transport in a fracture matrix media the effects of porosity the middle rock matrix thickness retardation factor and well flowrates are further investigated on the transport of tritium and uranium radionuclides through the system our analysis yields the following major findings 1 the fracture and matrix domains do not always respond to a specific change in porosity similarly since their response is highly controlled by the solute characteristics such as retardation factor time scale fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratio as well as the flowrate scenarios furthermore in addition to the groundwater velocity peclet number and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient also plays a significant role in solute behavior 2 the solute behavior in the matrices is more sensitive to changes in variables than the fracture particularly under the unilateral flow case the middle rock matrix always receives a higher solute mass than the bounded matrices the porosity of the rock matrix has a twofold effect on solute behavior since a greater porosity simultaneously equates to a decrease in the retardation factor and an increase in storage capacity 3 although a thicker middle matrix is associated with higher tritium and uranium peak concentrations inside the whole system for long time periods it is observed that the solute penetration depth of adjacent fractures overlapped with each other quicker when the middle matrix is thinner 4 the retardation factor can significantly reduce the solute concentration inside the adjacent matrices particularly for the unilateral flow case in an example of the unilateral flow case the retardation factor caused a 42 reduction in uranium concentration of the upper matrix at a time equal to 60 000 days it is further observed that a larger distribution coefficient intensifies the reduction rate imposed by the retardation factor 5 the idea of combining multiple fractures as a single one with double aperture to simplify modeling by using effective retardation coefficients is tested to be only reasonable when the conservative solute enters under steady state conditions or for a long time period on the contrary the idea was found not to be useful for the cases of sorptive solutes under the unsteady state solute transport the presented model is capable of assessing how long will contaminant take to reach a layer point of interest within the groundwater system in fact the presented model helps to improve our understanding of how various processes affect fate and transport behavior in regard to the disposal of nuclear and

3516,while fractures are commonly filled in the subsurface they have received little attention in terms of flow and solute transport this study presents a semi analytical solution for a reactive contaminant in a five layer fracture matrix groundwater system characterized by a thin rock matrix separating the fractures which are taken to be filled with sediments under conditions of steady groundwater flow using the laplace transform for two scenarios of two dimensional unilateral and three dimensional radial flows the solutions have obtained that account for longitudinal advective transport in the mobile portion of fractures and transverse diffusion in the adjacent matrices the mathematical models in the real time domain are derived by numerically inverting the solutions from the laplace domain and validated against both the numerical and existing semi analytical solutions examples of the solution behavior are presented which demonstrate an increase in the fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratio tends to increase the solute concentration in the adjacent matrices particularly under unilateral flowrate because in addition to the groundwater velocity peclet number and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient also plays a significant role in solute transport compared to the fracture the solute behavior in the matrices particularly under the unilateral flow case is more sensitive to changes in the parameters the porosity of the rock matrix has a twofold effect since as porosity is increased the retardation factor decreases while storage capacity increases a thinner middle matrix in addition to a lower peak in tritium and uranium concentrations inside the whole system over long time periods is further accompanied by a quick overlapping the concentration penetration depth of adjacent fractures the diffusion process in the rock matrix has been further identified as important as advection in the fracture for those repositories that are planned to safely dispose wastes for a long time the idea of combining multiple fractures as a single one with a double aperture is found to be only reasonable for the conservative solute under the steady state or long time conditions while it is not to be useful for the cases of sorptive solutes under the unsteady state solute transport the findings of this study can assist for simulating tracer tests as well as fate transport and remediation of groundwater contaminants in fractured rocks to better evaluate the safety degree of deep reservoirs in regard to disposal of nuclear and chemical wastes keywords uranium and tritium transport fractured aquifers semi analytical solution laplace transform 1 introduction as a substantial volume of the world s water and energy resources exist in fractured geological systems the solute transport process in underground multi layer systems has been extensively studied by many researchers tang and aral 1992a tang and aral 1992b zhan et al 2009a zhan et al 2009b liu et al 2013 rezaei et al 2013 rezaei et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 solute transport in fractured rocks is of particular interest owing to its application to different hydrogeological and environmental aspects such as disposal of radioactive and groundwater contamination in hard rock aquifers bodin et al 2003 pouya 2012 roubinet et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 understanding contaminant transport in this type of systems is essential as for example lustgarten 2012 estimates there are 680 000 underground waste and injection wells across the us where 7 000 sites showed signs that their walls were leaking hydraulic fracturing which mostly happened in hard rocks is another case that is important for solute transport since it acts as a possible source of pollution to groundwater systems mehany and kumar 2019 rodriguez et al 2020 the fractured media contain two distinct regions of matrix and fissures each with its own specific transport behavior tang and aral 1992a the matrix is of higher storage capacity and relatively slow flow velocity while the fractures usually have a lower storage capacity and quick flow velocity wilson and witherspoon 1970 zhou et al 2017 in the ideal cases when the solute injected into the fracture does not interact with the rock matrix and does not substantially diffuse into the bounded matrices it will migrate at the same velocity as the groundwater owing to the heterogeneities of the real systems water flows with various velocities and the solute flowrate is likely dispersed around the mean moreno et al 1997 advection diffusion and retardation are the primary factors that control solute transport in groundwater systems cvetkovic and frampton 2012 in the advection mechanism groundwater flowderives and spreads a solute mainly along with fractures whileretardation decelerates the solute travel relative to water flow although diffusion into the rock matrix can be considered negligible either if the contact time between contaminants and rock matrix is too short or the diffusion coefficient is too small on the long timescale involved in the disposal of nuclear and chemical wastes diffusion into the rock matrix usually acts as a principal mechanism neretnieks 1980 while the minerals of the rock matrix can provide a capacity for storage the contaminant can pass through a thin matrix unit and diffuse into the adjacent fractures and the remains of the system over long time periods parker et al 2012 sharifi haddad et al 2012 given the long timescale involved in the disposal of nuclear and chemical wastes no experimental tests could be accomplished along with the desired distances so that prediction modeling is commonly conducted to simulate the transport of such contaminants moreno et al 1997 having fractures with a complex morphology of rough walls and variable apertures qian et al 2011a wang et al 2021 that actively interact with their surrounding rock matrices the fracture matrix system remains a difficult feature to represent accurately in mathematical flow and transport models houseworth et al 2013 nonetheless the existing solute transport semi analytical models for the fracture matrix systems have been highly simplified by considering a diffusion dominating process or single fracture tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 chen 1986 brown et al 1998 esposito and thomson 1999 roubinet et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 the existing semi analytical solutions for parallel multi fractures e g sudicky and frind 1982 barker 1982 małoszewski and zuber 1985 sharifi haddad et al 2012 chen and zhan 2018 are restricted to open fractures without any filling while fractures are typically filled with unconsolidated geologic media wealthall et al 2001 bradner and murdoch 2005 the solute transport process in a filled fracture is different from an open one owing in part to a profound impact that the filling sediments have on flow and solute transport qian et al 2011b as an example lunati et al 2003 reported that the propagation front in filled fissures is smoother than those in open ones qian et al 2011b experimentally focused on solute transport in a single fracture filled with unconsolidated sediment under non darcian flow conditions recently zhou et al 2017 derived a semi analytical mathematical model for the solute transport in a filled single fracture embedded in an impermeable rock matrix under 2d unilateral and three dimensional 3d radial flows the previous works on solute transport through the filled fractures are limited to single fracture systems bounded by matrices with an infinite thickness which may not be consistent with real cases containing matrices with finite thickness that could be passed by the solute within the long time frames of the model a thin matrix may therefore act as a pathway for exchanging water and solute mass between adjacent fractures and is no longer a barrier to solute transport zhu et al 2016 further pointed out that since either the concentration penetration depth of adjacent fractures overlapped with each other or the fractures are too closely spaced a single fracture model cannot sufficiently address the solute transport phenomena in a fracture matrix system so that developing parallel multi fractures models are essential considering now a system of five layer with two parallel filled fractures equally spaced this study attempts to extend the mobile immobile mathematical models for a single fracture system developed by zhou et al 2017 to include the effect of a thin middle rock matrix on solute transport this work addresses issues beyond those covered by zhou et al 2017 first zhou et al 2017 considered a single fracture bounded to infinite matrices while this paper solves a system with two parallel fractures intervening by a thin rock matrix which provides an opportunity to explore the effect of middle matrix properties on solute transport in the system in practice zhou s solutions can therefore be regarded as special cases of this study by assuming an infinitely thick middle matrix second they only took into account tritium a conservative radionuclide while this work compares the results from conservative tritium and sorptive uranium radionuclides and found that the solute behavior may not be the same for both conservative and sorptive solutes signifying the significant role of the contaminant type for disposals third this paper further explores the impact of the retardation factor on solute behavior in different domains which was not discussed by zhou et al 2017 fourth the choice of a thin middle matrix is to further acknowledge testing the idea of combining two parallel fractures as a single one with a double aperture for solute modeling in the present study we develop a general understanding of the behavior of tritium and uranium transport through a fracture matrix system this paper is structured as follows following this introduction as can be seen in fig 1 the conceptual model is first presented then the mathematical model section presents the solution procedure including the definition of boundary value problem bvp nondimensional equations and numerically inverting the laplace domain solutions through the de hoog s algorithm de hoog et al 1982 finally in the results and discussion section after verification of the obtained solutions against the numerical and previous semi analytical solutions the effect of different principal parameters on the solute transport in the various domains of the system is discussed 2 conceptual model fig 2 shows a conceptual model where the solute enters the fractures at the left boundary the present work considers a case of a five unit fracture matrix medium with two parallel fractures intervening by a thin rock matrix which forms the fraction of the complete fracture network at a field scale notably there are some geological cases from micro to local scale in which a couple of parallel fractures fissures are separated by a relatively thin matrix and bounded to very thick matrices see figs s1 to s4 in supporting information which are compatible with the conceptual model shown in fig 2 two parallel filled fractures with a constant aperture 2b e g b 50 μm are horizontally extended sufficiently far from the domain of interest where the solute does not reach its downstream end the steady and unidirectional groundwater flow is established horizontal along either the x or r direction in the fractures the fractures are bounded by rock matrix units of small permeability the cartesian coordinate system is centered at the left boundary upstream on the plane of symmetry of the middle rock matrix the middle matrix has a finite thickness of 2b the length of the fracture matrix system is selected infinite along the x and y directions the y axis is perpendicular to the x axis on the horizontal plane and the z axis stands vertically upward the bounding rock matrices are homogeneous and horizontally isotropic notably this study only incorporates the diffusion for modeling solute inside the rock matrix overlooking advection because its hydraulic conductivity is highly smaller than that of the adjacent fractures as an example rukavičková et al 2021 reported that the hydraulic conductivity of the fractures in the bohemian massif in the czech republic is 1000 times of the adjacent rock matrix moreover the fractures convey times more water than the matrix given a head gradient parallel to the fracture planes due to differences in their relative hydraulic conductivity this study further takes into account fractures that are filled with sediments so that transport mechanisms through them are usually different from open ones the liquid phase inside the filled fracture medium contains mobile and immobile portions van genuchten and wierenga 1976 this type of problems cannot be solved using the advection dispersion equation which is often applied for modeling transport in homogeneous porous media or open fractures when the fracture is partially filled with sediments considering a mobile immobile approach is rather essential zhou et al 2017 the infilling sediments can be considered as immobile domains since they usually cause disconnections or dead end water pockets between pore spaces inside a fracture jodar et al 2009 qian et al 2011b zhou et al 2017 demonstrated that such a system can be satisfactorily explained with mobile immobile models as initially suggested by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 in this paper the fracture mobile refers to that portion of the filled fracture medium that contains dynamic water while the fracture immobile signifies the region that encompasses stagnant water the solute injects into both fractures at x 0 with a constant concentration c 0 and spreads along the y axis to a sufficiently far distance from the domain of interest so that the case is a 2d model on the x z plane it is supposed that a zero concentration gradient exists across the width of the fracture and the transverse dispersion through it therefore exerts no significant impact on the transport mechanism because 1 a small aperture of the fractures allows a complete vertical mixing throughout the fracture aperture instantaneously roubinet et al 2012 chen and zhan 2018 and 2 although the fractures are filled they could still be very porous and very permeable compared to the matrices zhou et al 2017 in an analogous problem rezaei et al 2016 further demonstrated that horizontal dispersion in the aquitard which is similar to the matrix and has a very slow permeability is ignorable for most practical cases of transport so that longitudinal diffusion through the rock matrix is ignored for both unilateral and radial cases for the second scenario i e the 3d radial flow the conceptual model remains the same as that for the first one i e 2d unilateral flow except for 1 a cylindrical coordinate system is conducted rather than a cartesian coordinate and 2 a radial flow field is established rather than a unilateral flow owing to an injection well at a constant rate q at the left boundary of the five layer system the well is established vertically along the z axis x y 0 in fig 2 the fractures are assumed plane and infinite along the horizontal direction the groundwater flow through the matrices is taken to be neglectable while radial flow occurs in both fractures diffusion is taken into account only along the vertical direction and only in the matrix fractures are assumed vertically well mixed similar to the unilateral flow case the problem therefore has a radial symmetry along the plane fractures and a vertical diffusion problem is solved in the matrices the main assumptions for solutions include 1 the whole system is assumed to be free of solute initially 2 a complete mixing of solute occurs throughout the fracture s aperture at all times so that transverse diffusion and dispersion in each fracture exert no significant effect on solute transport consistent with the findings by roubinet et al 2012 for a classical fracture matrix system 3 the immobile zones are perfectly mixed with solute concentration throughout 4 the retardation factor describes instantaneous equilibration between dissolved and sorbed solute in the immobile zone 5 it is assumed constant first order decay rates 6 similar to van genuchten and wierenga 1976 sorption processes in both the fracture mobile and fracture immobile are assumed to be instantaneous and 7 by ignoring the effect that the boundary layer near the fracture walls may have on solute transport a common darcy velocity and fickian solute transport types are used for the fracture system of fig 2 consistent with many previous works on solute transport in fracture matrix systems e g tang et al 1981 barker 1982 sudicky and frind 1982 małoszewski and zuber 1985 sharifi haddad et al 2012 roubinet et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 chen and zhan 2018 3 mathematical model 3 1 unilateral flow case from the conceptual model made and transport processes considered the bvp of solute transport for the first scenario can be defined in the cartesian coordinate system by the following governing equations and the initial and boundary conditions note that this paper only solves the equations for the upper half part of the conceptual model owing to the symmetry with respect to the x axis at z 0 in all the equations the subscripts m im k and t represent parameters belonging to fracture mobile fracture immobile upper and middle rock matrices respectively for concentration inside the fracture mobile c m van genuchten

where b and b are the half thickness of the fracture and middle rock matrix respectively q m up and q m lw are the diffusion mass fluxes between the fracture and the upper and middle rock matrix layers respectively ω is the first order mass transfer rate between the fracture mobile and fracture immobile λ is the decay constant which is defined as ln 2 t 0 5 where t 0 5 is the half life of the radionuclide species v m signifies the groundwater flow velocity in the fracture mobile r is the retardation factor i e the ratio of total solute mass dissolved plus sorbed to dissolved solute mass in the domains d m is the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the fracture and equal to α l υ m d in which α l is the longitudinal dispersivity and d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient in the fractures mobile d d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient in the rock matrix which defined as ε d where ε relates to tortuosity and d is diffusion coefficient neuman 1972 and finally θ is the total porosity in each domain for domain s porosity of θ its corresponding linear retardation factor is therefore estimated using r 1 r b k d θ for upper and lower matrices where r b is bulk density and k d represents sorption distribution coefficient sudicky and frind 1982 for fracture mobile and fracture immobile we respectively used the linear retardation factors of r m 1 f r b k d θ m and r im 1 1 f r b k d θ im obtained by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 where f is that fraction of the sorption sites which is in direct contact with the mobile region similar to van genuchten and wierenga 1976 a constant f 0 40 is used here using a constant particle density r s of 2 65 g cm3 the bulk density of each domain is computed by r b r s 1 θ notably the total porosity of the fracture domain θ is considered equal to θ m θ im consistent with zhou et al 2017 a constant distribution coefficient of 3 95 cm3 g is also used for uranium dai et al 2009 basically the procedure for the bvp solutions can be summarized by the following steps first performing laplace transform with respect to dimensionless time td after taking the following dimensionless definitions c md c m c 0 c imd c im c 0 c kd c k c 0 c td c t c 0 θ 1 θ im θ m θ 2 θ k θ m θ 3 θ t θ m p e v m b d m α 2 θ 2 r k d d r m d m α 3 θ 3 r t d d r m d m t d d m r m b 2 t x d x b z d z b r k d m r m d d q m up θ k d d c k z z d b 2 b b r k d m r m d d q m lw θ t d d c t z z d b b r k d m r m d d where the subscript d reveals the dimensionless terms pe is peclet number in the fractures θ 1 θ 2 and θ 3 are respectively the ratio of the porosity in the fracture immobile θ im the upper rock matrix θ k and the middle rock matrix θ t to the porosity of the fracture mobile θ m zhou et al 2017 defined the diffusion mass fluxes between the fracture and the upper q m up and lower q m lw rock matrices based on fick s law second the dimensionless equations for both the fracture mobile and fracture immobile as well as both the upper and middle matrices in the laplace domain are solved simultaneously as follows 5 c md x d p 1 p exp pe p e 2 4 k 2 x d f o r f r a c t u r e m o b i l e 6 c imd x d p 1 p α 1

and c td represent the concentration in the upper and middle rock matrices in the laplace domain respectively and p is the laplace parameter α 1 is the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the fracture mobile which seems to play a significant role in solute transport as discussed in section 4 the details of the procedure used to obtain the above solutions for each medium of the system are presented in appendix a based on the above solutions the peclet number in the fracture mobile has significant importance in solute transport through the whole system as the solutions for other domains eqs 6 8 are derived based on eq 5 it is expected that the solute migration rate through the system increases with peclet number beyond the peclet number the k and u parameters of the obtained solutions can also significantly control the transport k itself mainly depends on time i e p the fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratio and the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient particularly in the fracture mobile i e α 1 the u parameter further largely depends on the middle rock matrix properties including the fracture mobile middle matrix retardation factor ratio and the middle matrix fracture thickness ratio third the equations in the laplace domain are needed to be finally inverted to the real time domain inversion of the laplace transform is a critical step however it is difficult to be inverted analytically since closed form analytical solutions require individual techniques zlotnik and ledder 1992 fetter et al 2017 thanks to the applied de hoog s algorithm de hoog et al 1982 the solutions are therefore numerically obtained in the real time domain this algorithm is straightforward to use and only involves real p it has been used successfully by several authors for similar problems wang and zhan 2015 zhou et al 2017 zhou and zhan 2018 wang and zhan 2015 further tested the accuracy of the de hoog s method against a closed form analytical solution in the aquifer aquitard systems and found it highly accurate and robust regardless of the dispersion dominated or advection dominated situations this numerical technique uses the trapezoidal rule to successfully accelerate the convergence of the fourier series retrieved from the inversion integral zhou and zhan 2018 one can refer to wang and zhan 2015 for a detailed review of the numerical laplace inversion methods in the subsurface transport process 3 2 radial flow case in the radial flow model the solvent is injected through a well at a fixed rate q if groundwater background speed is ignored then the constant flow velocity υ m in the fracture mobile area is expressed as zhou et al 2017 9 υ m a r a q 4 π b θ e where r is the horizontal radial coordinate with the same origin x 0 and z 0 as in fig 2 and θ e is the effective porosity in the fracture which equals the amount of mobile water content θ m for this case the radial hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d r is defined as follows 10 d r d v m d a r where d is the radial dispersivity the governing equations for each domain shown in fig 2 are defined in the following notably the velocity changes and near well non laminar groundwater flow are simply ignored here similar to the unilateral flow case this case is also symmetric relative to the r axis at z 0 for the fracture mobile 11 θ m r m c m t θ im r im c im t θ m d r 2 c m r 2 θ m a r c m r θ m λ 1 r m c m q m up b q m lw b 11a c m r r 0 t c 0 11b c m r t 0 11c c m r t c t r z b t c k r z b 2 b t 11d c m r

parameters are kept the same as those used for the unilateral flow case similar to the first scenario the three above steps are accomplished to solve the equations in order to nondimensionalize the governing equations and their corresponding boundary conditions the following variables are used c md c m c 0 c imd c im c 0 c kd c k c 0 c td c t c 0 θ 1 θ im θ m θ 2 θ k θ m θ 3 θ t θ m τ 1 d 2 r m

lw θ t d d c t z z d b d r k a r m d d given the procedure explained in appendix b the equations describing the concentration at each time and location of the domains in the system are then derived in the laplace domain as follows c md r d p 1 p exp 1 2 r d r 0 d a i β 1 3 r d 4 β 1 a i β 1 3 r 0 d 4 β 1 for fracture mobile 15 c imd r d p 1 p τ 1 ω p θ im r im τ 1 ω τ 1 λ 2 θ im r im exp 1 2 r d r

the de hoog s algorithm similar to the unilateral flow case 3 3 steady state solutions steady state solutions are practically important to understand the long term transport behavior of different mediums in the system an advantage of our model with respect to the existing semi analytical models such as sudicky and frind 1982 and chen and zhan 2018 is it s capable of estimating the possible deepest penetration of solute into the adjacent matrices which occurs either under steady state or at long term they solved the governing equation only for half fracture and half matrix fig s5 by assigning such a boundary condition of c x z b t z 0 at the middle of the matrix this type of boundary condition assigns the zero vertical changes in concentration around the middle line of the matrix by assuming highly overlapped penetration depths between adjacent fractures in contrast the present study for each of the domains of the whole upper matrix the half middle matrix and the entire fracture derives its own equation using the boundary conditions of c k x z t 0 eq 3b for the upper matrix and c t z z 0 0 eq 4b for the middle rock matrix in practice the whole thickness of the upper matrix has been considered for our proposed solutions which allows quantitatively capturing the deepest penetration as explained in section 4 2 5 the steady state solutions for both the unilateral and radial flow cases are derived by conducting the following conditions 19 c m t c im t c t t c k t 0 eq 19 yields the highest possible solute concentration which does not any more change with longer times the steady state solutions for each domain can be derived through computing the limits of p c md p c imd p c kd and p c td as p goes to zero zhou et al 2017 and the identity of f t d lim p p f p where f p and f t d are the laplace transform and the steady state solution for f t d respectively here f p corresponds to eqs 5 8 for the unilateral case and eqs 15 18 for the radial model the analytical solutions can therefore be derived as follows under the unilateral flow model c md exp pe p e 2 4 k 2 x d for the fracture mobile c imd α 1 ω α 1 ω α 1 λ θ im r im exp pe p e 2 4 k 2 x d

verify the validity of the proposed solutions we compared them to 1 a numerical model and 2 zhou et al s 2017 solution which deals with a similar problem but with a three unit system of infinitely thick rock matrices a two dimensional numerical finite element model with a domain of 10 m wide and 5 m deep was built by comsol multiphysics to test the semi analytical solutions derived here for the unilateral case flow such relative width and depth values are selected for the system to ensure that the impact of limit boundaries on solute behavior is insignificant during the timescale of interest fig 3 shows a segment of finite element mesh applied in the numerical model where the finest mesh grids are selected for the middle portion of the system containing the two parallel fractures separated by a relatively thin rock matrix the fracture s aperture is equal to 100 µm the thickness of the middle rock matrix is 200 μm the porosity in the fracture mobile 0 818 is selected to be 10 times that in the fracture immobile 0 0818 a fixed velocity of 0 01 m d is selected only for the fractures the porosity in the matrix is chosen to be 0 3 a constant solute concentration is injected across the left borders of the fractures an observation point is picked arbitrarily at the middle of the upper fracture 50 µm 150 µm to explore the breakthrough curve of the system fig 4 a the blue solid line in fig 4a shows the semi analytical solution derived in the present work and the red circles represents the results by numerical model from comsol as can be observed from fig 4a our semi analytical solution and the finite element simulation yield identical breakthrough curves to make our five unit model identical to the three unit medium of zhou et al 2017 with a single fracture bounded by infinitely thick rock matrices a special case example is considered here in which the upper fracture in our model is simply bounded by two infinitely thick rock matrices in other words to convert our five layer system to a three layer one the thickness of the middle rock matrix is chosen to be wide enough so that the possible effect that the limit boundary of the adjacent rock matrix may have on solute transport can be ignored the same parameter values are taken into account for both our and zhou s cases to solve the two unilateral and radial models the darcy velocity q in the fracture mobile is taken to be 0 01 m day under the unilateral flow model and the dispersion coefficient to be 0 00611 m2 s under both unilateral and radial solutions tang et al 1981 schumer et al 2003 zhou et al 2017 as an example fig 4b and c compare the concentration breakthrough curves for the fracture mobile from our and zhou s models under both unilateral and radial flows respectively the breakthrough curves from our model for both the scenarios are highly agreed with those from zhou s model signifying the correctness and robustness of the presented solutions 4 2 findings from the developed solutions unlike zhou et al s 2017 work on filled fractures which assumed a rock matrix with infinite thickness this paper by considering a thin rock matrix intervening the parallel fractures in a fracture matrix system offers an opportunity to explore some different aspects of solute behaviors than assuming infinitely thick aquitards this work also explores the effect that the retardation factor can have on solute transport by comparing the results from conservative tritium and sorptive uranium radionuclides in practice the retardation factor varies with porosity changes in each domain when the solute is sorptive notably we further explored the effect that the soil distribution coefficient has on the retardation factor and solute transport as explained in section 4 2 3 in fact a porosity dependent retardation factor is more realistic than a constant factor in all the domains some new findings are illustrated as follows notably table 1 lists the parameter values used to plot different case examples in the following sections 4 2 1 porosity effects on solute transport the porosity impacts on the transport behavior of tritium and uranium radionuclides are examined by selecting different fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratios θ m θ im as well as various porosities for rock matrices as listed in table 1 notably the variations in the porosity for the fracture mobile and fracture immobile are performed under the constraint of θ m θ im 0 9 and a fixed dispersion coefficient consistent with the work by zhou et al 2017 two distinct radionuclides are injected tritium conservative with r 1 and uranium sorptive with r values 1 which is porosity dependent figs 5 8 for uranium and s6 s7 for tritium show the breakthrough curves from the different porosity values for both the fracture mobile and fracture immobile and both the upper and middle matrices under the unilateral and radial flow models although both the conservative and sorptive radionuclides show a similar transport behavior conservative tritium spreads quicker than sorptive uranium consistent with observations from zhou et al 2017 the time taken for the concentration to reach the peak in the radial flow model is highly smaller than that of the unilateral flow model owing in part to a higher velocity of the radial flow the fracture and matrix domains do not always respond to a specific change in porosity similarly since their response is highly controlled by the solute characteristics such as retardation factor the timescale fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratio θ m θ im and the flowrate scenarios for the unilateral flow scenario the θ m θ im ratio has no significant effect on solute transport inside the fracture however although an increase in the θ m θ im ratio leads to a decrease in solute concentration inside the fracture both mobile and immobile it is associated with a little decrease in solute concentration over long times not shown for the radial flowrate the concentration in all domains decreases with porosity ratio fig 6 and s7 on contrary under both flowrate scenarios the concentration of uranium and tritium increases with the θ m θ im ratio in both the upper and middle rock matrices fig 5c 5d s6c and s6d however compared to the fracture the solute behavior in the matrices is more sensitive to the changes in the porosity ratio for both the conservative and sorptive radionuclides under the unilateral flowrate scenario this discrepancy in solute behavior of the fracture and rock matrix domains at shorter times is due to that in addition to the groundwater velocity peclet number and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient other parameters such as the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the fracture mobile i e α 1 also play a significant role in solute behavior of the system according to υ m q θ m with constant darcy s velocity q a larger porosity in the fracture mobile is associated with a smaller groundwater velocity υ m peclet number and longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient our investigations also demonstrate that the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the fracture mobile i e α 1 in the dimensionless list has a significant effect on the solute concentration when the porosity changes as an example under the same conditions for the unilateral flow case the increase of the θ m θ im ratio from 1 to 10 is associated with a 79 increase in α 1 and a 45 decrease in groundwater velocity fig 5 overall an increase in the θ m θ im ratio tends to affect the whole system particularly the adjacent matrices signifying the significant role of those materials filled the fractures these observations highlight the importance of studying the characteristics of those sediments filled fractures during solute transport investigation similar to zhou et al 2017 for a case with darcy velocity of 0 01 m d and dispersion coefficient of α l 0 5 m it is observed that the θ m θ im ratio on the whole has no significant effect on solute behavior inside the fracture mobile figs s6a and s7a although the solute concentration infinitesimally increases by decreasing the porosity ratio under unilateral flow case zhou et al 2017 observed that the smaller θ m θ im ratios lead to higher solute concentrations in the fracture mobile at earlier times which is similar to our observations in fig 5a they have not explored the effect that the ratio has on the fracture immobile and adjacent matrices however there are some discrepancies between our results and those from zhou et al 2017 that may arise from the fact that zhou et al 2017 considered a small porosity 0 01 for the rock matrix while this paper considers large porosity 0 3 for the rock matrices consistent with a large porosity i e up to 0 31 measured in clean quartz arenites subarkoses and argillaceous quartz arenites by caruso et al 1985 as an example moreover the porosity in the regional sandstone aquifer of wajid sw saudi arabia is as high as 0 45 al ajmi et al 2014 the boise sandstone also has a high porosity ranging from 0 21 to 0 35 and a vast hydraulic conductivity range from 3 6e 04 to 1 57 m day zhu and wong 1997 this work therefore selects porosity of 0 30 for the matrix and hydraulic conductivity of 0 01 m day for the fracture that lie somewhere within the measurements from the above geological cases the other notable point regarding the breakthrough curves is that the solute peak concentration occurs in the fracture sooner and at significantly higher levels than the adjacent matrices particularly in the unilateral flow case figs 5 and s6 as an example for the two dimensional unilateral case fig 5 the uranium solute for the case of θ m θ im 10 reaches to the desired point x 500 µm inside the fracture after several days while in the adjacent rock matrices after thousands of days these different times are due to the advection being the dominant process in the fracture while in the fracture immobile and the rock matrices the solute migration derives mostly from the diffusion process however although the behavior of the solute transport in both the upper or lower and middle rock matrices are roughly similar fig s6 the solute concentration in the middle rock matrix is higher particularly at longer times since beyond the thinner thickness that the middle matrix has it receives higher solute mass from both the adjacent fractures from the upper and bottom borders it is therefore expected that the safety of the deep repositories would decrease by increasing the fracture density in the geological settings even under the presence of fractures with micro scale apertures the impact of the rock matrix s porosity on uranium transport in the different domains of the system is also explored in figs 7 and 8 under the condition of constant values for particle density 2 65 g cm3 and distribution coefficient 3 95 cm3 g in practice the porosity of the rock matrix has a twofold effect on solute behavior inside the system a higher porosity in addition to providing a larger capacity for solute storage and thus reducing the solute concentration can further reduce the retardation and enhance the concentration of a reactive solute within the system when the solute transport is sufficiently fast such as the radiale flowrate scenario as the porosity of the upper rock matrix is increased the solute concentration inside the whole system decreases fig 8 signifying the storage capacity is more important compared to the retardation factor under the conditions considered for fig 8 on contrary under the unilateral case for the uranium in which the solute moves slowly the role of the retardation factor is stronger than the storage capacity fig 7c this work highlights that the porosity can have different roles on solute transport inside the fracture matrix systems under various conditions depending on the solute type and the time frame of interest moreover the solute peak concentration in the thin middle matrix is fairly larger than in the thick upper matrix under the unilateral flow case while in the radial case they have roughly the same concentration these results arise from the fact that since the thin middle matrix receives solute from both the upper and lower bounds the penetration into the middle matrix is deeper than the upper matrix particularly in short times in practice the longer the surface is exposed to the solute the higher is the diffusion effect as an example under the conditions used for fig 7d the solute penetration depth of adjacent fractures overlapped with each other after 12 000 days i e reaching the point of z 0 in the middle matrix given the above evidence the rock matrix characteristics such as porosity and thickness are of critical importance for the transport and remediation process as well as for the safety assessment of the deep geological disposals localized in the hard rocks 4 2 2 thin middle rock matrix effects on solute transport figs 9 10 and 11 analyze how the changes in the thickness of the middle matrix can affect the tritium and uranium radionuclides transport in the fracture and adjacent rock matrices under both the 2d unilateral flow and 3d radial flow models respectively in general as the thickness of the middle matrix is increased the solute concentration tends to increase in both the fracture mobile and fracture immobile as well as in the upper adjacent matrix chen and zhan 2018 likewise observed a higher solute concentration distributed at a specific time when more solutes remain inside the fractures it is worth noting that the behavior of both tritium and uranium inside the middle rock matrix during the short times is different from the long time periods there is a turning point in the breakthrough curve fig 9d and 10d and horizontal profile of the middle matrix fig s8 which is obtained from the steady state solutions the solute responses to changes in thickness are different before and after it as an example during long term periods longer than 2000 days in fig 9d it has similar behavior to other domains meanwhile the concentration increases with its thickness on contrary in the shorter time periods e g shorter than 2000 days in fig 9d the solute behavior inside the middle matrix is different from other domains of the system and the concentration tends to decrease in the thicker ones figs 9 and 11 this may arise from the fact that the diffusive flux in the thicker middle matrices tends to be larger because of the greater difference in solute concentration of the fracture and the matrix particularly when the middle matrix has not yet filled to capacity sudicky and frind 1982 as an example during the shorter times such as at t 1000 days in fig 9d the thicker middle matrix b 100 e 6 m has the lower solute concertation than the thinner ones resulting in a steeper transverse concentration gradient and eventual larger transverse diffusive flux a larger gradient on the whole is associated with a larger solute mass entering the whole fracture matrix system consistent with observations by sudicky and frind 1982 it is further observed that a thin middle rock matrix causes a more rapid increase in concentration with time and equilibrium is arrived earlier particularly in the middle matrix itself remarkably although a thicker middle matrix imposes higher tritium and uranium peak concentrations inside the whole system for long time periods fig 9d and 10d reveal that a peak concentration occurs quicker as the middle matrix is thinner owing in part to overlapping the penetration depths of adjacent fractures which changes the diffusive sink in the middle matrix zhu et al 2016 comparison of the unilateral and radial flow models demonstrate that the effect of the thickness of the middle matrix on the relative solute concentration is likely stronger for the unilateral flow case because the diffusion process which is dominant in the matrices has a longer time to contribute in solute transport the horizontal profile shown in fig 11 also depicts that the thickness of the middle matrix has a stronger effect on solute transport along the middle zone of the horizontal path 0 005 to 0 02 m these observations are somewhat similar to the largest difference in the middle concentration range observed by sudicky and frind 1982 during assessing the effect of neglecting dispersion under the condition of a small advective flux however the findings on the whole highlight the significant role of the thickness of the adjacent matrices for storing the solute within the fractured rock systems as well as those deep geological disposals buried in complex geological settings with highly dense fractures 4 2 3 retardation factor effect on solute transport as the retardation factor can play an important role in the behavior of reactive solutes in geological systems bagalkot and suresh kumar 2015 it is also explored how the retardation factor can affect the solute concentration in the different domains fig 12 shows how the retardation factor leads to a decrease in the sorptive uranium r 1 which is porosity dependent in comparison with conservative solute r 1 this reduction rate is highly smaller under the radial flow scenario as the higher speed of solute transport suppresses the retardation factor influence as an example in the unilateral flow case the retardation factor causes a 42 reduction in uranium concentration of the upper matrix at a time equal to 60 000 days on the contrary the retardation factor has led to a small increase in the solute concentration of the fracture domain owing in part to the fact that the retardation factor which itself depends on porosity can control the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient i e α 1 α 2 and α 3 in both the fracture and matrix domains notably the values of α 1 α 2 and α 3 also increase with an increase in the retardation factor as an example under the conditions used for fig 12a the value of α 1 α 2 and α 3 in the case of r 1 is respectively 1 51 4 12 and 4 12 times larger compared to the conservative case of r 1 these observations on the whole highlight the significant role of the retardation factor on solute transport in addition to porosity the soil distribution coefficient also acts as an important variable for the retardation factor so that its effects on solute transport are specifically explored figs 13 and 14 compare the breakthrough curves from enhanced soil distribution coefficients of 5 13 an increased quantity of 30 and 6 32 l kg 60 with those from the default distribution coefficients of 3 95 l kg under both the unilateral and radial flow scenarios an increase in distribution coefficients is accompanied by an enhancement in retardation factor i e a decrease in uranium concentration in all the domains of the system as shown in figs 13 and 14 the declined quantity of tritium is greater in the matrix domains than the fracture particularly under the unilateral case with lower flow and eventual solute advection rate the influence of the distribution coefficient on solute transport is stronger at the shallower parts of the matrices as an example when the soil distribution coefficient increases from 5 13 to 6 32 l kg the decreased concentration of uranium at the shallow depth of 50 μm is about 1 37 times compared to the deeper part of 100 μm in the upper matrix 4 2 4 well flowrate effect on solute transport in the 3d model the solute injects into the system via an injection well at a constant flowrate this provides an opportunity to quantify the flowrate impacts on the solute transport in a fracture matrix system fig 15 analyses the effect of the three different flowrates of 0 001 0 0008 and 0 0006 m3 d on the solute transport through different domains of the fracture both the mobile and immobile portions and rock matrices upper and middle as expected the solute concentration in all domains of the system tends to increase with well flowrate for both tritium and uranium owing to higher solute mass injection to the system during a specific time period similar to the thickness of the middle matrix the flowrate effect also strengthens over time since the larger increased rates correspond to the longer time periods it is observed that a 67 increase in flowrate from 0 6 to 1 l s is accompanied by an increase in uranium concentration inside all domains sharifi haddad et al 2012 similarly reported that an increase in the injection rate decreases the time required for the arrival of a contaminant the increased rate in the fracture mobile fracture immobile and upper and middle rock matrices is respectively equal to 17 84 15 00 15 41 and 17 60 at the time of 10 days in fig 15 which decrease at longer times in conclusion the flowrate of the injection wells is also very important during disposal meaning that when the rock matrices are thinner the flow rate should also be low to guarantee the safety of the geological disposals this process is similar to pumping wells that extract groundwater from perched fresh water aquifers overlaid on a saline aquifer such as the island aquifers in that system to prevent saline water intrusion to the well the pumping rate is controlled and remained at a very small rate mcwhorter et al 1977 todd and mays 2004 4 2 5 steady state solute profiles to explore the long term solute transport behavior in different domains of the system figs 16 and 17 present the relative tritium concentrations along with the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the concentrations shown in fig 16 are fully saturated at the left boundary i e the immediate vicinity of the solute source of both the fracture both mobile and immobile portions and middle rock matrix under the steady state conditions along the horizontal direction the solute concentrate gradually decreases to reach zero at a far distance as an example fig 16a indicates that the solute cannot spread longer than x 2 m along the horizontal direction in all the domains under the unilateral model flow it implies that the other parts of the system where are more than 2 m apart from the source are completely safe the other notable point is that under the same conditions the solute spreads a longer distance along the horizontal direction for the radial flow fig 16b compared to the unilateral case fig 16a owing to a flow that injected through a well it signifies that the safety of the repository which receives the contaminant through injection wells is lower and it can be advected into other parts of the system quicker remarkably the maximum penetration depth into the upper rock matrix is approximately the same for both the unilateral 2 05 m and radial 2 07 m flow cases not shown implying that the diffusion process acts identical for both scenarios the maximum penetration depth of 2 m into the adjacent matrices is compatible with the range of depths 1 76 to 2 93 m obtained by zhu et al 2016 for tritium solute and effective molecular diffusion coefficient of 1 16 10 10 m 2 s from the vertical profile shown in fig 17 it is observed that the middle matrix and adjacent fractures have the same solute concentration signifying that the thin middle matrix acts as a pathway at long times by generalizing this observation to the case in which a thin rock matrix separated a contaminated fracture from a clean one it is expected that the solute passes through the middle matrix wide and diffuse into the clean fracture at long times it highlights the diffusion process importance in those repositories that are planned to safely disposal wastes for a long time such as nuclear disposals by comparing figs 16 and 17 it further can be observed that the solute can diffuse through the middle matrix solely via diffusion mechanism as high as in the adjacent fractures by advection and dispersion processes in practice the longest distance passed by solute inside the fracture 2 m in fig 16a is the same as the deepest penetration depth in the adjacent thick matrix 2 m in fig 17 solely through the diffusion process neretnieks 1980 likewise argued that diffusion into the rock matrix usually acts as a principal mechanism for the long timescale involved in the disposal of nuclear and chemical wastes this high contribution of diffusion process in transport under steady state arises from the long surface i e surface between the fracture and rock matrix along the x y plane that exposed to the solute 2 m compared to the small apertures of the fracture 100 μm through which the solute advents and spreads notably similar observations are also obtained for uranium figs s9 and s10 these findings on the whole demonstrate that the safety of each repository is highly controlled by the process type advection or diffusion and geometry e g exposed surface as well as the time available for the solute to transport fig 18 indicates how the decay rate can affect the tritium transport inside the fracture mobile and the upper rock matrix under both the unilateral and radial flow scenarios the horizontal profiles obtained from tritium of the real half life of 12 35 yr are compared with those from the case in which half life is assumed to be 1 e 13 y r tritium on the whole would spread to farther distances inside the fracture and would penetrate the adjacent matrix deeper if it had an infinitely large half life particularly under the unilateral case with slower advection under the unilateral flow conditions shown in fig 18a the final distance that tritium of insignificant decay rate would spread is about six orders larger as compared to the real tritium with a half life of 12 35 yr this discrepancy in the taken path is about one order for the radial flow case fig 18b similarly the enhanced penetration depth into adjacent matrices is greater under the unilateral two orders than that the radial case one order these observations generally highlight the importance that the decay rate of the radionuclides has on transport behavior to explore whether the two fractures could behave as a single fracture of double aperture with an additional retardation factor that would arise due to retention in the intervening matrix the vertical concentration profile for the sorptive uranium under the unsteady state solute transport is further depicted in fig 19 comparison of figs 17 and 19 demonstrates that the idea of combining multiple fractures as a single one with double aperture to simplify modeling by using effective retardation coefficients that depend on the properties of the intervening matrix seems to be only reasonable when the conservative solute is injected for steady state or long time conditions on contrary the idea appears not to be useful for the cases of sorptive solutes under the unsteady state solute transport in the case of steady state solute transport the concentration level inside the middle matrix is roughly equal to that in the adjacent fractures due to the penetration depths highly overlapping between adjacent fractures so that the idea of combining multiple fractures as a single one could be reasonable in contrast fig 19 depicts that although the concentration in the middle matrix is larger than that in the upper matrix it is largely smaller than the concentrations inside the fractures meanwhile the middle rock matrix acts as a specific unit where its porosity storage capacity and thickness are important for solute transport inside the whole system 4 2 6 uncertainties and future works although this study improves our understanding from the effect of porosity thin intervening rock matrix properties retardation factor and the well flowrate on solute behavior in two filled parallel fractures separated by a thin rock matrix there are some simplifications and unfinished tasks associated with the present solutions that should be explored in the future first this work is limited to analytical and numerical simulations and no laboratory and field experimental data used to verify the presented models owing in part to the difficulty of the data collection in micro scale fractures and rock matrices in which the transport process usually needs an extremely long time to take place rezaei et al 2016 second the fracture walls are simply assumed to be smoothed and equally spaced while in the real case the roughness and variable aperture may have a significant effect on the dispersion coefficient and eventual solute transport qian et al 2011a third it is simply assumed that the darcy flow velocity and dispersivity do not change with the porosity of the fracture mobile according to the 2 500 dispersion tests on natural and artificial materials conducted by klotz and moser 1974 a higher porosity leads to higher hydraulic conductivity and a lower dispersivity chen 1991 on the other hand darcy velocity has a direct relationship with hydraulic conductivity thus one can conclude that darcy velocity increases with the porosity of fractured rocks 5 conclusions two distinct mathematical models 2d unilateral and 3d radial are semi analytically derived for a two fracture system intervening by a thin matrix these models allow one to explore the effect of thickness of the middle matrix on solute transport in a fracture matrix media the effects of porosity the middle rock matrix thickness retardation factor and well flowrates are further investigated on the transport of tritium and uranium radionuclides through the system our analysis yields the following major findings 1 the fracture and matrix domains do not always respond to a specific change in porosity similarly since their response is highly controlled by the solute characteristics such as retardation factor time scale fracture mobile fracture immobile porosity ratio as well as the flowrate scenarios furthermore in addition to the groundwater velocity peclet number and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient the ratio of retardation factor to hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient also plays a significant role in solute behavior 2 the solute behavior in the matrices is more sensitive to changes in variables than the fracture particularly under the unilateral flow case the middle rock matrix always receives a higher solute mass than the bounded matrices the porosity of the rock matrix has a twofold effect on solute behavior since a greater porosity simultaneously equates to a decrease in the retardation factor and an increase in storage capacity 3 although a thicker middle matrix is associated with higher tritium and uranium peak concentrations inside the whole system for long time periods it is observed that the solute penetration depth of adjacent fractures overlapped with each other quicker when the middle matrix is thinner 4 the retardation factor can significantly reduce the solute concentration inside the adjacent matrices particularly for the unilateral flow case in an example of the unilateral flow case the retardation factor caused a 42 reduction in uranium concentration of the upper matrix at a time equal to 60 000 days it is further observed that a larger distribution coefficient intensifies the reduction rate imposed by the retardation factor 5 the idea of combining multiple fractures as a single one with double aperture to simplify modeling by using effective retardation coefficients is tested to be only reasonable when the conservative solute enters under steady state conditions or for a long time period on the contrary the idea was found not to be useful for the cases of sorptive solutes under the unsteady state solute transport the presented model is capable of assessing how long will contaminant take to reach a layer point of interest within the groundwater system in fact the presented model helps to improve our understanding of how various processes affect fate and transport behavior in regard to the disposal of nuclear and

3517,spontaneous imbibition is relevant to many processes in nature and industry in this work the effect of pore structure of porous media on counter current imbibition is studied the one dimensional counter current imbibition experiments were conducted in packed porous media with different pore structure experimental results showed that counter current imbibition can only proceed for a short time in homogeneous porous media for all fluids in heterogeneous porous media counter current imbibition can only proceed a short time for water air experiments as well however imbibition can proceed continuously until the imbibition front reaches the end of packed porous media for water oil experiments and the mass of water infiltration is proportional to the square root of time the efficiency of water infiltration behind the imbibition front decreases with increase in viscosity of non wetting phase fluid in addition the numerical simulation of counter current imbibition in porous media with different pore structure were conducted using phase field method simulation results showed that very little oil was produced in homogeneous porous media and more oil was produced in heterogeneous porous media it is indicated that the difference between capillary driving pressure and capillary back pressure which are closely related to pore structure and pore size distribution of porous media has important influence on counter current imbibition furthermore the snap off of oil or gas production channels in narrow pore throats may lead to termination of imbibition when the water saturation behind the imbibition front is higher keywords counter current imbibition pore structure pore size distribution efficiency of imbibition capillary heterogeneity 1 introduction spontaneous imbibition is the process in which one fluid spontaneously enters narrow space to displace another fluid by capillary pressure washburn 1921 alava et al 2004 the displacing fluid is known as wetting phase and the displaced fluid is known as non wetting phase spontaneous imbibition is driven by surface energy through the action of capillary pressure morrow and mason 2001 imbibition can occur in two patterns co current and counter current imbibition wetting and non wetting phase flow in opposite directions and expulsion of non wetting phase must overcome the capillary back pressure under counter current imbibition nooruddin and blunt 2016 wetting and non wetting phase flows in the same direction and non wetting phase is drained out without overcoming capillary back pressure under co current imbibition abd et al 2019 therefore co current imbibition usually represents a more efficient water infiltration pattern compared to counter current imbibition rangel german and kovscek 2006 imbibition is relevant to many practical problems including remediation of soil and groundwater system li et al 2013 li et al 2019 fracking fluid retention and flowback engelder 2012 roshan et al 2016 lin et al 2021 enhanced oil and natural gas recovery mason and morrow 2013 jia et al 2016 and co2 sequestration liu et al 2020 kim et al 2021 the pattern of imbibition proceeding depends on the boundary conditions of rocks which are known as contact patterns of rocks and fluids meng and cai 2018 gao et al 2018 if rocks are completely covered by water imbibition can only proceed by counter current patterns if rocks are partially covered by water imbibition can proceed by combination of co and counter current imbibition pooladi darvish and firoozabadi 2000 many research groups focused one dimensional imbibition because flow pattern is relatively simple and it is easier to establish mathematical equations to compare with experimental results el amin et al 2013 cai et al 2014 for one dimensional counter current imbibition the mass of water infiltration is proportional to the square root of time without consideration of gravity li et al 2006 li et al 2009 for one dimensional co current imbibition the linear relationship between water infiltration and square root of time can only be obtained when the viscosity of non wetting phase can be neglected mason and morrow 2013 cai et al 2021 the pore structure of porous media has important effects on imbibition behavior alyafei and blunt 2018 wang et al 2020 wetting phase fluid preferentially enters smaller pores and non wetting phase fluid is drained out from the bigger pores in porous media because the capillary pressure in smaller pores is higher hatiboglu and babadagli 2008 unsal et al 2009 gunde et al 2013 the complex geometry of pores with different sizes will lead to entrapment of non wetting phase fluid which will reduce the efficiency of water infiltration rangel german and kovscek 2006 berg et al 2013 the stronger heterogeneity of porous media may lead to more entrapment of non wetting phase meng et al 2017 fluid properties have important effect on entrapment of non wetting phase as well the higher viscosity ratio of non wetting phase and wetting phase will reduce the efficiency of imbibition haugen et al 2014 haugen et al 2015 the study of the imbibition behavior and fundamentals with different pore structures contributes to solving the various practical problems in this work we focused on counter current imbibition in porous media with different pore structure and pore size distribution the imbibition experiments were conducted in two types of packed porous media with different particle geometry and size distribution fluids with different viscosity ratios were used and an interesting imbibition behavior was observed furthermore the phase field method is used to simulate the counter current imbibition in porous media with different pore structure the mechanism of imbibition in different porous media was discussed 2 experimental section 2 1 experimental material in this work counter current imbibition experiments were carried out using the unconsolidated glass bead and quartz sand packs the geometry of glass beads is spherical fig 1 a with a narrow range of particle size distribution fig 2 in contrast the geometry of quartz sands is irregular fig 1b with a wide range of particle size distribution fig 2 in experiments synthetic brine was used as wetting phase and air kerosene white oil 15 and white oil 32 were used as non wetting phase oil is cleaned to remove polar contaminants by flowing through alumina and silica gel packed columns the detailed properties of the fluids used in the experiments are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental apparatus a transparent plexiglass column with an inner diameter of 0 984 and a length of 19 5 cm was used as enclosure material the glass beads or quartz sands were packed tightly and homogeneously in the glass column one end of the glass column was sealed by a rubber stopper and the other end was fixed with a wire mesh to hold glass beads or quartz sands the schematic illustration of experimental apparatus for counter current imbibition is shown in fig 3 a small hole was punched at the center of rubber stopper which was connected to a pressure transducer during counter current imbibition experiments in addition the outlet tube was connected to a syringe to control the end pressure the packed column was immersed horizontally in the water and a ruler was used to measure the distance advanced by imbibition front an imbibition cell with an accuracy of 0 01 ml was used to collect air or oil produced by counter current imbibition the value of inverse bond number for every experiment ranged from 73 4 to 215 1 and it is implied that gravity could be neglected in all experiments 2 3 experimental procedure the glass beads or quartz sands are packed densely in the glass column with the help of a shaker the detailed packed procedure has been reported in the previous paper meng et al 2015 meng et al 2017 the exact length of glass bead or quartz sand packed column is 18 5 cm the porosities of glass bead and quartz sand packed column are 35 1 and 32 9 respectively the permeabilities of the packed column used in each experiment are listed in table 2 all of glass bead and quartz sand were used only once to avoid the wettability change and fluid pollution the packed column is saturated completely with air or oil when the packed column is saturated with oil the air in the column is removed by pumping vacuum firstly during the experiments the packed column is immersed in the water container and the pressure in non wetting phase at the end of packs end pressure could be measured by the sensitive pressure transducer the glass column and the pressure transducer were at the same level to avoid the influence of gravity the imbibition front was visible for both water air and water oil experiments and the distance advanced by the imbibition front was measured by the ruler when the imbibition front was not vertical we assumed that the advancing distance was equal to the average distance of the front edge and behind edge of imbibition front oil production by counter current imbibition was collected and measured by imbibition cell the position of imbibition front amount of oil production and end pressure were all recorded as a function of time 2 4 experimental results after glass bead packs or quartz sand packs were immersed in the water water began to be imbibed into the packed porous media spontaneously in glass bead packs imbibition front stop advancing after a very short time for both water air and water oil experiments and only very little air or oil was produced the imbibition front advances only 4 7 cm for water air experiment and the advancing distances are less than 3 cm for all water oil experiments in quartz sand packs water imbibition ceased as well after a short time and imbibition front advances only 5 5 cm for water air experiment the end pressure rose simultaneously with imbibition front advancing at initial imbibition time and reached a stable value eventually fig 4 after imbibition front stop moving and the stable end pressure was achieved we tried to increase the end pressure using the syringe the fluid in the syringe is the same as the saturated fluid in porous media as the end pressure rose air or oil was produced again when the end pressure exceeded a certain value then the valve at the outlet of syringe was closed and the end pressure quickly declined it is interesting to find that the imbibition front began to move again in addition the end pressure began to rise again when it dropped to a certain value however after a short time the imbibition front stopped moving again and end pressure reached a stable value again as well then we increased the end pressure once more and the similar performance was observed the change of the position of imbibition front and the end pressure over imbibition time during the entire process for water kerosene experiments in glass bead packs and water gas experiments in quartz sand packs are shown in fig 4 the average water saturation behind the imbibition front can be obtained by eq 1 1 s wf q w v l x f where s wf is the average water saturation behind the imbibition front q w is total amount of water imbibition cm3 v is the total volume of pores for packs cm3 l is exact length of packs cm x f is the advancing distance by imbibition front cm the calculated results showed that the average water saturation behind the imbibition is higher than 90 for all glass bead experiments and water gas experiment in quartz sand packs the different performance was observed for water oil experiments in quartz sand packs for these three experiments imbibition front advanced continuously until it reached the end of quartz sand packs fig 5 a oil was produced continuously as well with the advancing of imbibition front fig 5b the amount of oil production is proportional to the square root of imbibition time before the imbibition front reached the end of packed columns fig 6 in addition both average water saturation behind the imbibition front fig 7 and final oil recovery decrease with the increase in oil viscosity which is consistent with the co currently experimental results meng et al 2015 3 numerical simulation of counter current imbibition 3 1 model geometry two 2d porous media models with different pore structure and pore size distribution were used as the simulated domain with dimension of 18 mm 9 mm fig 8 one is composed of circle particles with equal diameter fig 8a and the other is composed of irregular particles with a wide range of particle size distribution fig 8b the model with circle particles was used to represent the glass bead packs i e the homogenous porous media the model with irregular particles was used to represent the quartz sand packs i e the heterogeneous porous media the porosity of homogeneous model is 54 1 and the porosity of heterogeneous model is 40 4 it is noticed that the numerical model is used to illustrate or verify the mechanism of imbibition behavior in porous media with different pore structures rather than to fully replicate the experiments the phase field method is computationally demanding and it is difficult to build a model that consists of enough pores beyond the representative elementary volume rev of porous media the porous media was saturated with oil initially a water filled flow channel was connected to one side of porous media the other three sides of porous media are closed water in the water flow channel is spontaneously imbibed into porous media and oil in the porous media is expelled to water flow channel due to capillary pressure water is injected with a constant rate from the inlet and is expelled from outlet the purpose of water injection is to expel oil droplet produced from the matrix the flow rate of water is 0 015 m s and the pressure drop in the flow channel is about 1 pa which is much lower than the capillary pressure in the porous media therefore the water injection has very little influence on the imbibition behavior in the matrix block it will only influence the timing of snap off of oil droplets and the size of oil droplets it is assumed that all fluids are incompressible and gravity is neglected by assuming 2d horizontal model 3 2 governing equations and numerical simulation in this work the incompressible navier stokes and continuity equations were employed to simulate fluid flow in capillaries which are given as follows amiri and hamouda 2013 zhu et al 2017 2 ρ u t u u p μ u u t f st 3 u 0 where p is the pressure pa u is the fluid velocity field m s t is the time s ρ is the density kg m3 μ is the viscosity pa s f st is the term representing interfacial tension n m3 the phase field method was employed to track the interface of the immiscible fluids in this work in phase field method a dimensionless phase field variable ϕpf is defined to represent the concentration fractions of the two phases the cahn hilliard equation was used to track the diffuse interface the evolution of ϕpf is governed by this equation as follows yue et al 2006 4 ϕ pf t u ϕ pf γ λ ε 2 ψ 5 ψ ε 2 ϕ pf ϕ pf 2 1 ϕ pf where γ is the mobility m3 s kg ε is the interface thickness m λ is the mixing energy density n a robust finite element solver comsol multiphysics was used to solve the governing equations triangular mesh elements were used to discretize the domain of the simulated model in this work the mobility tuning parameter χ is equal to 1 and the interface thickness is equal to half of the maximum mesh size a more detailed introduction to phase field method and numerical simulation have been discussed by many other research groups zhu et al 2016 rokhforouz and akhlaghi amiri 2017 the input parameters for numerical simulation in this section are listed in table 3 3 3 simulation results the simulation results showed that very little water was imbibed into the porous media for homogenous model fig 9 a for heterogeneous model water is continuously imbibed into the relatively smaller pores and oil is expelled from the larger flow channel until the channel for oil expulsion is cut off the plot of fraction of oil production versus imbibition time is shown in fig 10 it is indicated that the imbibition process can be divided into four stages in stage ⅰ water is imbibed into the porous media through relatively smaller pores and oil is discharged from the relatively larger flow channel continuously until the snap off occurs at the exit of oil flow channel for the first oil droplet fig 11 b in stage ⅱ oil expulsion almost ceased after the snap off of oil droplet and the oil pressure in imbibition front increases gradually oil production restart when the oil pressure in imbibition front is larger than the capillary back pressure at exit of oil flow channels fig 11c then in stage iii the second oil droplet generated fig 11d and water was imbibed into the porous media continuously again until snap off occurred again fig 11e finally oil production ceased completely after the snap off of second oil droplet fig 10 stage ⅳ and fig 11f it is noticed that the snap off location of second oil droplet is different from that of first oil droplet the first snap off occurred at the exit of oil flow channel and the second snap off occurred near the narrower pore throat of oil expulsion channel it is more difficult to overcome the capillary pressure in the narrower pore throat than that in the larger pore at exit of oil flow channel this caused oil production completely terminated after the snap off of the second oil droplet because the capillary driving force in the imbibition front cannot overcome the capillary back pressure at the narrower pore throat of the oil production channel fig 11f more detailed simulation results on the variation of water and oil distribution pressure and velocity can refer to supporting information 4 discussion the simulation results showed that whether oil can be produced by counter current imbibition is closely related to the capillary driving pressure at the imbibition front and the capillary back pressure at the exit or the location of snap off for oil production channels since the capillary pressure is dependent on the radius of curvature of meniscus the pore size distribution of porous media has a very important influence on counter current imbibition if the range of pore size distribution is narrow the capillary driving force may be very close to the capillary back pressure at the exit of oil production channel the capillary driving force may not be able to overcome the capillary back pressure and oil cannot be produced by counter current imbibition if the range of pore size distribution is wide the capillary driving pressure is much larger than the capillary back pressure the capillary driving force can overcome the capillary back pressure and oil can be produced by counter current imbibition continuously the simulation results also indicated that snap off of oil production channels especially at the narrow pore throat have great influence on counter current imbibition the snap off of oil production channels at narrow pore throat may generate a very high capillary back pressure which may cause the termination of oil production if capillary driving force cannot overcome the capillary back pressure in real porous media it is very common for snap off of oil or gas flow channel especially at relatively narrow pores kovscek and radke 1996 krummel et al 2013 if there is only a single oil production channel and the capillary driving force cannot overcome the capillary back pressure at the narrow pore oil production by counter current imbibition will terminate in experiments we increased the end pressure of the porous media after the termination of imbibition and the oil or gas was produced again this is because the increasing end pressure can overcome the capillary pressure at narrow pores and new oil production channels were established again however the snap off may occur again and oil production will terminate again as well if there are many oil production channels oil can be produced continuously even though some production channels are cut off therefore the relatively higher oil saturation before the imbibition front is important for oil production continuously by counter current imbibition the pore size distribution in glass bead packs is more uniform on the one hand the difference between capillary driving pressure at the imbibition front and the capillary back pressure at the exit of oil production channels is relatively smaller on the other hand the oil or gas saturation behind the imbibition front is very lower there may be only few channels for oil or gas production water may penetrate the pore throat of oil or gas production channels which may cause production channels to be cut off during the imbibition process if the production channel is cut off it is difficult to unchoke again because the capillary driving force in the imbibition front is not enough to overcome the capillary pressure in the narrow pore throat which leads to the termination of counter current imbibition for water air experiment in quartz sand packs the gas saturation behind the imbibition is very lower as well which leads to few channels for gas production if gas flow channels are cut off at the narrow pore throat it is difficult for capillary driving force in the imbibition front to overcome the capillary pressure at the narrow pore throat as well even though the heterogenous porous media with a wide range of pore size distribution if the end pressure is risen higher enough to overcome the capillary pressure in the blocked pore throat the channels of oil or gas production may be unchoked and the imbibition could proceed again for water oil experiments in quartz sand packs oil saturation behind the imbibition front is higher fig 7 and there are enough flow channels for oil production oil can be produced continuously by counter current imbibition even though parts of oil production channels are cut off 5 conclusion in this work one dimensional counter current imbibition experiments were conducted in packed porous media with different pore structure and numerical simulation were conducted using phase field method the main conclusions of this work are summarized as follows 1 the water saturation behind the imbibition front for counter current imbibition is related to pore structure pore size distribution and viscosity of non wetting phase fluid in homogeneous porous media the water saturation behind the imbibition front is very high in the heterogeneous porous media the water saturation behind the imbibition front decreases with increasing viscosity ratio and it is very higher only if the viscosity of non wetting phase fluid is very low 2 the difference between capillary driving force at the imbibition front and capillary back pressure at the exit of production channels which is dependent on the pore structure and pore size distribution has important influence on counter current imbibition this difference increases with increasing range of pore size distribution which will facilitate water infiltration for counter current imbibition 3 a more homogeneous porous media and lower viscosity of non wetting phase means a higher efficiency of water infiltration behind the imbibition front for counter current imbibition however it does not mean a higher efficiency of water infiltration for a total porous media the higher efficiency of water infiltration behind the imbibition front will cause that there are only few channels for oil or gas production the production channels may be cut off which may lead to completely termination of counter current imbibition 4 increasing the end pressure in non wetting phase during counter current imbibition may contribute to overcoming the capillary back pressure and increasing oil or gas production channels which may facilitate oil or gas production by counter current imbibition this may be one of mechanisms of enhanced oil recovery by cyclic or pulsing water injection which can increase the level of pressure fluctuations in reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement qingbang meng conceptualization

3517,spontaneous imbibition is relevant to many processes in nature and industry in this work the effect of pore structure of porous media on counter current imbibition is studied the one dimensional counter current imbibition experiments were conducted in packed porous media with different pore structure experimental results showed that counter current imbibition can only proceed for a short time in homogeneous porous media for all fluids in heterogeneous porous media counter current imbibition can only proceed a short time for water air experiments as well however imbibition can proceed continuously until the imbibition front reaches the end of packed porous media for water oil experiments and the mass of water infiltration is proportional to the square root of time the efficiency of water infiltration behind the imbibition front decreases with increase in viscosity of non wetting phase fluid in addition the numerical simulation of counter current imbibition in porous media with different pore structure were conducted using phase field method simulation results showed that very little oil was produced in homogeneous porous media and more oil was produced in heterogeneous porous media it is indicated that the difference between capillary driving pressure and capillary back pressure which are closely related to pore structure and pore size distribution of porous media has important influence on counter current imbibition furthermore the snap off of oil or gas production channels in narrow pore throats may lead to termination of imbibition when the water saturation behind the imbibition front is higher keywords counter current imbibition pore structure pore size distribution efficiency of imbibition capillary heterogeneity 1 introduction spontaneous imbibition is the process in which one fluid spontaneously enters narrow space to displace another fluid by capillary pressure washburn 1921 alava et al 2004 the displacing fluid is known as wetting phase and the displaced fluid is known as non wetting phase spontaneous imbibition is driven by surface energy through the action of capillary pressure morrow and mason 2001 imbibition can occur in two patterns

geometry of pores with different sizes will lead to entrapment of non wetting phase fluid which will reduce the efficiency of water infiltration rangel german and kovscek 2006 berg et al 2013 the stronger heterogeneity of porous media may lead to more entrapment of non wetting phase meng et al 2017 fluid properties have important effect on entrapment of non wetting phase as well the higher viscosity ratio of non wetting phase and wetting phase will reduce the efficiency of imbibition haugen et al 2014 haugen et al 2015 the study of the imbibition behavior and fundamentals with different pore structures contributes to solving the various practical problems in this work we focused on counter current imbibition in porous media with different pore structure and pore size distribution the imbibition experiments were conducted in two types of packed porous media with different particle geometry and size distribution fluids with different viscosity ratios were used and an interesting imbibition behavior was observed furthermore the phase field method is used to simulate the counter current imbibition in porous media with different pore structure the mechanism of imbibition in different porous media was discussed 2 experimental section 2 1 experimental material in this work counter current imbibition experiments were carried out using the unconsolidated glass bead and quartz sand packs the geometry of glass beads is spherical fig 1 a with a narrow range of particle size distribution fig 2 in contrast the geometry of quartz sands is irregular fig 1b with a wide range of particle size distribution fig 2 in experiments synthetic brine was used as wetting phase and air kerosene white oil 15 and white oil 32 were used as non wetting phase oil is cleaned to remove polar contaminants by flowing through alumina and silica gel packed columns the detailed properties of the fluids used in the experiments are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental apparatus a transparent plexiglass column with an inner diameter of 0 984 and a length of 19 5 cm was used as enclosure material the glass beads or quartz sands were packed tightly and homogeneously in the glass column one end of the glass column was sealed by a rubber stopper and the other end was fixed with a wire mesh to hold glass beads or quartz sands the schematic illustration of experimental apparatus for counter current imbibition is shown in fig 3 a small hole was punched at the center of rubber stopper which was connected to a pressure transducer during counter current imbibition experiments in addition the outlet tube was connected to a syringe to control the end pressure the packed column was immersed horizontally in the water and a ruler was used to measure the distance advanced by imbibition front an imbibition cell with an accuracy of 0 01 ml was used to collect air or oil produced by counter current imbibition the value of inverse bond number for every experiment ranged from 73 4 to 215 1 and it is implied that gravity could be neglected in all experiments 2 3 experimental procedure the glass beads or quartz sands are packed densely in the glass column with the help of a shaker the detailed packed procedure has been reported in the previous paper meng et al 2015 meng et al 2017 the exact length of glass bead or quartz sand packed column is 18 5 cm the porosities of glass bead and quartz sand packed column are 35 1 and 32 9 respectively the permeabilities of the packed column used in each experiment are listed in table 2 all of glass bead and quartz sand were used only once to avoid the wettability change and fluid pollution the packed column is saturated completely with air or oil when the packed column is saturated with oil the air in the column is removed by pumping vacuum firstly during the experiments the packed column is immersed in the water container and the pressure in non wetting phase at the end of packs end pressure could be measured by the sensitive pressure transducer the glass column and the pressure transducer were at the same level to avoid the influence of gravity the imbibition front was visible for both water air and water oil experiments and the distance advanced by the imbibition front was measured by the ruler when the imbibition front was not vertical we assumed that the advancing distance was equal to the average distance of the front edge and behind edge of imbibition front oil production by counter current imbibition was collected and measured by imbibition cell the position of imbibition front amount of oil production and end pressure were all recorded as a function of time 2 4 experimental results after glass bead packs or quartz sand packs were immersed in the water water began to be imbibed into the packed porous media spontaneously in glass bead packs imbibition front stop advancing after a very short time for both water air and water oil experiments and only very little air or oil was produced the imbibition front advances only 4 7 cm for water air experiment and the advancing distances are less than 3 cm for all water oil experiments in quartz sand packs water imbibition ceased as well after a short time and imbibition front advances only 5 5 cm for water air experiment the end pressure rose simultaneously with imbibition front advancing at initial imbibition time and reached a stable value eventually fig 4 after imbibition front stop moving and the stable end pressure was achieved we tried to increase the end pressure using the syringe the fluid in the syringe is the same as the saturated fluid in porous media as the end pressure rose air or oil was produced again when the end pressure exceeded a certain value then the valve at the outlet of syringe was closed and the end pressure quickly declined it is interesting to find that the imbibition front began to move again in addition the end pressure began to rise again when it dropped to a certain value however after a short time the imbibition front stopped moving again and end pressure reached a stable value again as well then we increased the end pressure once more and the similar performance was observed the change of the position of imbibition front and the end pressure over imbibition time during the entire process for water kerosene experiments in glass bead packs and water gas experiments in quartz sand packs are shown in fig 4 the average water saturation behind the imbibition front can be obtained by eq 1 1 s wf q w v l x f where s wf is the average water saturation behind the imbibition front q w is total amount of water imbibition cm3 v is the total volume of pores for packs cm3 l is exact length of packs cm x f is the advancing distance by imbibition front cm the calculated results showed that the average water saturation behind the imbibition is higher than 90 for all glass bead experiments and water gas experiment in quartz sand packs the different performance was observed for water oil experiments in quartz sand packs for these three experiments imbibition front advanced continuously until it reached the end of quartz sand packs fig 5 a oil was produced continuously as well with the advancing of imbibition front fig 5b the amount of oil production is proportional to the square root of imbibition time before the imbibition front reached the end of packed columns fig 6 in addition both average water saturation behind the imbibition front fig 7 and final oil recovery decrease with the increase in oil viscosity which is consistent with the co currently experimental results meng et al 2015 3 numerical simulation of counter current imbibition 3 1 model geometry two 2d porous media models with different pore structure and pore size distribution were used as the simulated domain with dimension of 18 mm 9 mm fig 8 one is composed of circle particles with equal diameter fig 8a and the other is composed of irregular particles with a wide range of particle size distribution fig 8b the model with circle particles was used to represent the glass bead packs i e the homogenous porous media the model with irregular particles was used to represent the quartz sand packs i e the heterogeneous porous media the porosity of homogeneous model is 54 1 and the porosity of heterogeneous model is 40 4 it is noticed that the numerical model is used to illustrate or verify the mechanism of imbibition behavior in porous media with different pore structures rather than to fully replicate the experiments the phase field method is computationally demanding and it is difficult to build a model that consists of enough pores beyond the representative elementary volume rev of porous media the porous media was saturated with oil initially a water filled flow channel was connected to one side of porous media the other three sides of porous media are closed water in the water flow channel is spontaneously imbibed into porous media and oil in the porous media is expelled to water flow channel due to capillary pressure water is injected with a constant rate from the inlet and is expelled from outlet the purpose of water injection is to expel oil droplet produced from the matrix the flow rate of water is 0 015 m s and the pressure drop in the flow channel is about 1 pa which is much lower than the capillary pressure in the porous media therefore the water injection has very little influence on the imbibition behavior in the matrix block it will only influence the timing of snap off of oil droplets and the size of oil droplets it is assumed that all fluids are incompressible and gravity is neglected by assuming 2d horizontal model 3 2 governing equations and numerical simulation in this work the incompressible navier stokes and continuity equations were employed to simulate fluid flow in capillaries which are given as follows amiri and hamouda 2013 zhu et al 2017 2 ρ u t u u p μ u u t f st 3 u 0 where p is the pressure pa u is the fluid velocity field m s t is the time s ρ is the density kg m3 μ is the viscosity pa s f st is the term representing interfacial tension n m3 the phase field method was employed to track the interface of the immiscible fluids in this work in phase field method a dimensionless phase field variable ϕpf is defined to represent the concentration fractions of the two phases the cahn hilliard

mobility m3 s kg ε is the interface thickness m λ is the mixing energy density n a robust finite element solver comsol multiphysics was used to solve the governing equations triangular mesh elements were used to discretize the domain of the simulated model in this work the mobility tuning parameter χ is equal to 1 and the interface thickness is equal to half of the maximum mesh size a more detailed introduction to phase field method and numerical simulation have been discussed by many other research groups zhu et al 2016 rokhforouz and akhlaghi amiri 2017 the input parameters for numerical simulation in this section are listed in table 3 3 3 simulation results the simulation results showed that very little water was imbibed into the porous media for homogenous model fig 9 a for heterogeneous model water is continuously imbibed into the relatively smaller pores and oil is expelled from the larger flow channel until the channel for oil expulsion is cut off the plot of fraction of oil production versus imbibition time is shown in fig 10 it is indicated that the imbibition process can be divided into four stages in stage ⅰ water is imbibed into the porous media through relatively smaller pores and oil is discharged from the relatively larger flow channel continuously until the snap off occurs at the exit of oil flow channel for the first oil droplet fig 11 b in stage ⅱ oil expulsion almost ceased after the snap off of oil droplet and the oil pressure in imbibition front increases gradually oil production restart when the oil pressure in imbibition front is larger than the capillary back pressure at exit of oil flow channels fig 11c then in stage iii the second oil droplet generated fig 11d and water was imbibed into the porous media continuously again until snap off occurred again fig 11e finally oil production ceased completely after the snap off of second oil droplet fig 10 stage ⅳ and fig 11f it is noticed that the snap off location of second oil droplet is different from that of first oil droplet the first snap off occurred at the exit of oil flow channel and the second snap off occurred near the narrower pore throat of oil expulsion channel it is more difficult to overcome the capillary pressure in the narrower pore throat than that in the larger pore at exit of oil flow channel this caused oil production completely terminated after the snap off of the second oil droplet because the capillary driving force in the imbibition front cannot overcome the capillary back pressure at the narrower pore throat of the oil production channel fig 11f more detailed simulation results on the variation of water and oil distribution pressure and velocity can refer to supporting information 4 discussion the simulation results showed that whether oil can be produced by counter current imbibition is closely related to the capillary driving pressure at the imbibition front and the capillary back pressure at the exit or the location of snap off for oil production channels since the capillary pressure is dependent on the radius of curvature of meniscus the pore size distribution of porous media has a very important influence on counter current imbibition if the range of pore size distribution is narrow the capillary driving force may be very close to the capillary back pressure at the exit of oil production channel the capillary driving force may not be able to overcome the capillary back pressure and oil cannot be produced by counter current imbibition if the range of pore size distribution is wide the capillary driving pressure is much larger than the capillary back pressure the capillary driving force can overcome the capillary back pressure and oil can be produced by counter current imbibition continuously the simulation results also indicated that snap off of oil production channels especially at the narrow pore throat have great influence on counter current imbibition the snap off of oil production channels at narrow pore throat may generate a very high capillary back pressure which may cause the termination of oil production if capillary driving force cannot overcome the capillary back pressure in real porous media it is very common for snap off of oil or gas flow channel especially at relatively narrow pores kovscek and radke 1996 krummel et al 2013 if there is only a single oil production channel and the capillary driving force cannot overcome the capillary back pressure at the narrow pore oil production by counter current imbibition will terminate in experiments we increased the end pressure of the porous media after the termination of imbibition and the oil or gas was produced again this is because the increasing end pressure can overcome the capillary pressure at narrow pores and new oil production channels were established again however the snap off may occur again and oil production will terminate again as well if there are many oil production channels oil can be produced continuously even though some production channels are cut off therefore the relatively higher oil saturation before the imbibition front is important for oil production continuously by counter current imbibition the pore size distribution in glass bead packs is more uniform on the one hand the difference between capillary driving pressure at the imbibition front and the capillary back pressure at the exit of oil production channels is relatively smaller on the other hand the oil or gas saturation behind the imbibition front is very lower there may be only few channels for oil or gas production water may penetrate the pore throat of oil or gas production channels which may cause production channels to be cut off during the imbibition process if the production channel is cut off it is difficult to unchoke again because the capillary driving force in the imbibition front is not enough to overcome the capillary pressure in the narrow pore throat which leads to the termination of counter current imbibition for water air experiment in quartz sand packs the gas saturation behind the imbibition is very lower as well which leads to few channels for gas production if gas flow channels are cut off at the narrow pore throat it is difficult for capillary driving force in the imbibition front to overcome the capillary pressure at the narrow pore throat as well even though the heterogenous porous media with a wide range of pore size distribution if the end pressure is risen higher enough to overcome the capillary pressure in the blocked pore throat the channels of oil or gas production may be unchoked and the imbibition could proceed again for water oil experiments in quartz sand packs oil saturation behind the imbibition front is higher fig 7 and there are enough flow channels for oil production oil can be produced continuously by counter current imbibition even though parts of oil production channels are cut off 5 conclusion in this work one dimensional counter current imbibition experiments were conducted in packed porous media with different pore structure and numerical simulation were conducted using phase field method the main conclusions of this work are summarized as follows 1 the water saturation behind the imbibition front for counter current imbibition is related to pore structure pore size distribution and viscosity of non wetting phase fluid in homogeneous porous media the water saturation behind the imbibition front is very high in the heterogeneous porous media the water saturation behind the imbibition front decreases with increasing viscosity ratio and it is very higher only if the viscosity of non wetting phase fluid is very low 2 the difference between capillary driving force at the imbibition front and capillary back pressure at the exit of production channels which is dependent on the pore structure and pore size distribution has important influence on counter current imbibition this difference increases with increasing range of pore size distribution which will facilitate water infiltration for counter current imbibition 3 a more homogeneous porous media and lower viscosity of non wetting phase means a higher efficiency of water infiltration behind the imbibition front for counter current imbibition however it does not mean a higher efficiency of water infiltration for a total porous media the higher efficiency of water infiltration behind the imbibition front will cause that there are only few channels for oil or gas production the production channels may be cut off which may lead to completely termination of counter current imbibition 4 increasing the end pressure in non wetting phase during counter current imbibition may contribute to overcoming the capillary back pressure and increasing oil or gas production channels which may facilitate oil or gas production by counter current imbibition this may be one of mechanisms of enhanced oil recovery by cyclic or pulsing water injection which can increase the level of pressure fluctuations in reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement qingbang meng conceptualization

3518,vertical circulation well vcw is a new type of groundwater heat pump gwhp system that is widely used in low enthalpy geothermal energy utilization as much attention has been given to the negative environmental impacts of gwhp cross formation flow induced by pumping or injection of hot or cold water in storage aquifer should be studied in advance in this research a conceptual model of cross formation flow induced by a thermal vcw in a leaky confined aquifer is developed and the mathematical implementation of this model is described in an analytical manner a semi analytical solution of the spatiotemporal distribution of hydraulic head in the coupled leaky confined aquifer in which the vcw is located and the overlying unconfined aquifer which is separated from the leaky confined aquifer by a thin layer aquitard is derived using laplace hankel transforms and the solution is tested against a finite element numerical solution using comsol multiphysics and an existing solution the global sensitivity analysis is conducted to quantify and prioritize the hydraulic head response to the change in each of the aquifer parameters the alteration of hydraulic head distribution in the overlying unconfined aquifer induced by the operation of vcw in the underlying leaky confined aquifer can change the groundwater flow velocity and direction in the unconfined aquifer thus may cause unwanted environmental consequences the result indicated that hydraulic head is most sensitive to the hydraulic conductance c m of the aquitard and most insensitive to the length of injection or pumping section of vcw the proposed semi analytical solutions can be used to improve the design of vertical single well circulation system for groundwater treatment or a geothermal energy engineering this is the phase i research of the thermal vcw concerning mostly the hydraulic response and it serves as the basis for the phase ii research concerning the thermal transport and environmental impact

systems are a promising new energy technology that has shown rapid increase in usage over the past 10 years to achieve regional mitigation targets against climate change stocker 2014 unfccc 2015 in the field of low enthalpy geothermal energy utilization groundwater heat pumps system gwhp which is one of the gshp systems is widely used for space heating air conditioning industrial heat supply as well as other applications rafferty 2001 the gwhp is an open loop gshp system in which groundwater is directly involved in the heat exchange process park et al 2018 the pumped groundwater is usually injected into the same thermal storage aquifer where it was extracted from garcia gil et al 2015 to achieve regional mitigation targets against climate change by limiting anthropogenic global warming to 2 c garcía gil et al 2016 the number of installations of geothermal energy utilization of ground source energy will be expected to increase further in the future epting et al 2017 lund and boyd 2016 however an increasing number of researches also start to investigate the potential negative environmental impacts induced by the exploitation storage and utilization of geothermal energy possemiers et al 2014 many researches reveal that the quality and chemical composition of groundwater may be significantly affected by the gwhp systems abesser 2010 bonte 2015 thus threatening the public health and the native subsurface ecological environment garcia gil et al 2015 simpson et al 1989 zhu et al 2010 jesußek et al 2013 revealed that the portable groundwater can be impaired by reducing metal oxides and thus possibly releasing heavy metals from the sediment with a temperature increase higher than 25 c the rate of mineral dissolution sorption geochemistry and microbial activity can also be changed when the temperature in groundwater system increases to minimize the impact of gwhp on groundwater supply it is better to install the gwhp wells in a different aquifer separated from the aquifer with portable groundwater wells with a less permeable aquitard martin and frind 1998 wagner 2011 in most previous studies farabi asl et al 2018 garcia gil et al 2015 it is usually assumed that as long as the pumping and injection groundwater volumes are the same the gwhp system will not affect the adjacent aquifer hydraulically and environmentally but in our view this statement may be only acceptable on the presumption that there is no cross formation flow and it is questionable and must be carefully revisited if cross formation flow exist this is because abundant evidence has shown that although the aquitard may be much less permeable than its neighboring aquifers cross formation flow through the aquitard almost always occurs whenever there is even a minor hydraulic head difference between the aquifer of the gwhp system and the adjacent aquifers feng et al 2020 malama et al 2008 such cross formation flow is an important hydraulic connection between different aquifers and is capable of changing the magnitude and direction of groundwater flow as well as temperature distribution in the neighboring aquifers thus affecting their groundwater chemistry and quality aiken et al 2011 garcía gil et al 2016 the single well circulation system contains an injection section and a pumping section in the same wellbore and is a new type of gwhp system that is different from the conventional double or multiple well system in which pumping and injection are conducted in different wellbores ni et al 2011 wu et al 2015 the single well circulation system as discussed in this study requires a much smaller surface area than the double or multiple well system because it only requires a relatively limited surface area to accommodate the installnation of a single wellbore rather than a relatively extended surface water to accommodate the installnation of multiple wells therefore it is a preferred choice in urban areas in which land use may be substantially limited ladislaus and rybach 2015 tu et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 this single well circulation idea was firstly used in petroleum engineering to measure the vertical permeability in petroleum reservoirs burns 1969 later on it was applied extensively in geothermal utilization and environmental remediations knox et al 1997 zhu et al 2020 for the operation of the single well circulation system groundwater is taken as a heat carrier jin et al 2016 zhou and zhou 2009 and the heat transfer is closely dependent on groundwater hydraulics pannike et al 2006 previous researches show that heat transfer around pumping and injection well is mainly controlled by convection and the extent of convection heat transfer heavily depends on the groundwater velocity zhang 2003 in fact the direction and magnitude of groundwater flow velocity directly affect the underground temperature distribution and heat pump efficiency chiasson et al 2000 hecht méndez et al 2010 therefore insight into the groundwater flow and hydraulic head distribution in the neighboring aquifers induced by a vertical single well circulation system is essential and vital prior to the onset of design of gwhp systems to our knowledge cross formation flow induced by a vertical circulation well vcw has not been investigated in both the geothermal community and the hydrological community where vcw is sometimes also called the single circulation well or standing column well both abbreviated as scw insight into the leaky process between the leaky confined aquifer and its neighboring aquifer may help better design the gwhp systems and prevent unwanted environmental problems in this research we will establish conceptual and mathematical models to study the hydraulic response in the overlying unconfined aquifer induced by a thermal vcw in the leaky confined aquifer a semi analytical solution is derived using the double laplace hankel transform to investigate the system of concern and the solution is tested by comparing with the numerical solution obtained by comsol multiphysics and an existing solution tu et al 2020 which concerns the vcw operation in a confined aquifer rather than the leaky confined aquifer the solution of tu et al 2020 can be regarded as a special case of this study when the cross formation flow does not exist a global sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the key parameters of influence this is the phase i research mostly concerning the hydraulic response which serves as the basis for the phase ii research concerning the thermal transport and environmental impact in the future the structure of this study is organized as follows we first present the conceptual and mathematical models and the semi solutions in sections 2 and 3 then test the solution against a high resolution numerical solution built with comsol multiphysics in section 4 describe the results and discussion in sections 5 and 6 respectively the summary and conclusions are in section 7 2 conceptual model and governing equations 2 1 conceptual model a schematic diagram of groundwater flow induced by a vcw located in a leaky confined aquifer is represented in fig 1 the leaky confined aquifer rests on an impermeable bedrock or aquiclude while the upper adjacent aquifer is unconfined with an instantaneous drainage water table both aquifers are assumed to be slightly compressible spatially uniform vertically anisotropic and infinite laterally with constant thickness a leaky confining layer or aquitard exists between the leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer the aquitard thickness is assumed to be small enough so that the water storage effect of the aquitard is negligible the system is hydrostatic with a uniform hydraulic head before the operation of vcw hydraulic communication between the leaky confined aquifer and the overlying unconfined aquifer can be active through vertical water flux driven by a vertical hydraulic gradient across the aquitard a fully penetrating vcw is located in the leaky confined aquifer and is divided into two sections separated by an impermeable well packer the lower part of the vcw can be taken as a pumping section and the upper part is an injection section or vice versa a uniform radial flux along both the injection and pumping well screens is adopted as the lateral boundary is sufficiently far to affect the vcw operation mishra et al 2012 in reality the injection and pumping well screens are better described using a uniform head boundary condition when the wellbore is treated as an infinite hydraulic conductivity media thus there is no energy loss or head loss for vertical conduit flow inside the wellbore which is often true when the rate of flow is relatively small zhan and bian 2006 when the rate of injection and pumping is relatively large vertical conduit flow inside the wellbore may experience sizable energy loss due to friction with the wall of wellbore then the injection and pumping sections are better described using a mixed type boundary condition yeh and chang 2013 both uniform head and mixed type boundary conditions are much more difficult to handle compared with the uniform flux boundary and are not favorable in analytical modeling but they can be handled relatively straightforwardly in numerical simulations sun and zhan 2006 fortunately abundant evidence has shown that the use of uniform flux wellbore boundary condition only causes minor discrepancy from the uniform head and mixed type boundary conditions liang et al 2017a liang et al 2017b therefore the uniform flux approximation is favorable from a practical standpoint with acceptable accuracy sun and zhan 2006 and will be used in this investigation additional assumptions made for the conceptual model are 1 pumping and injection rates q l3t 1 of the vcw negative for pumping and positive for injection are constant and start simultaneously if q of the vcw is time dependent rather than constant it can always be discretized into a sequence of stepwise constant rates over many small time intervals and one can subsequently obtain the solution with time dependent q using the superposition principle on the basis of the constant q solution 2 the well radius is infinitesimally small thus wellbore storage effect is neglected if well radius is finite and wellbore storage is non negligible one can wait for a short moment to allow the wellbore storage effect to subdue then starts to analyze the results park and zhan 2002 3 the storage or release of groundwater due to rising or falling of water table in the unconfined aquifer is instantaneous if the drainage of water table is delayed rather than instantaneous one may need to invoke the delayed water table condition moench 1995 zhan and zlotnik 2002 or incorporate the unsaturated flow process above the water table liang et al 2018 qi et al 2020 4 the unconfined aquifer is thick enough so that infiltration or evaporation is not considered in this research and the water table variation due to pumping or injection of circulation well is assumed to be much smaller than the unconfined aquifer thickness thus the nonlinear governing equation of unconfined flow can be linearized without introducing considerable errors zhan and zlotnik 2002 2 2 governing equations a cylindrical coordinate system is setup as follows the bottom of the aquitard is set as the reference datum with the origin located at the center of the vertical well the r axis is along horizontal radial water flow direction while the z axis is positive upward a is the distance from bottom of the unconfined aquifer to the initial water table and kept as a constant b is the thickness of the leaky confined aquifer the thickness of the aquitard is assumed to be much smaller than a and b thus allowing cross formation flow to occur even though the permeability of the aquitard could be several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the leaky confined aquifer below and the unconfined aquifer above the vcw consists of pumping sealed and injection sections with the length of d s l l d and b l respectively as shown in fig 1 the r is defined as the ratio of the lengths of the pumping to injection sections b l d the hydraulic heads in the following discussion are substituted by water drawdowns or buildups where drawdowns are negative and buildups are positive i e the drop or rise of hydraulic head over the spatially uniform hydraulic head at the initial time the governing equations for above coupled aquifer system are presented as follows by considering cross formation flow through the aquitard between the two adjacent aquifers for the unconfined aquifer 0 z a one has 1 k r 1 r r 1 r u r k z 1 2 u z 2 s s 1 u t for the leaky confined aquifer b z 0 one has 2 k r 2 r r 1 r h r k z 2 2 h z 2 s s 2 h t where u and h are the variations of hydraulic head l in unconfined aquifer and leaky confined aquifer respectively s s is the specific storages l 1 k r and k z denote the hydraulic conductivities in the radial and vertical directions respectively l t the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers hereinafter respectively t is the injection or pumping time r and z are the radial and vertical coordinates l respectively the initial condition before the onset of vcw can be written as 3 u r z t 0 4 h r z t 0 0 the linearized free surface boundary condition of the unconfined aquifer with an instantaneous drainage water table is approximated as neuman 1974 zhan and park 2003 5 k z 1 u z z a s y u t z a where s y is the drainable porosity or specific yield of the unconfined aquifer no flow condition is applied at the base of the leaky confined aquifer and described as 6 h z z b 0 the buildup at the infinite radial boundaries for both the unconfined and leaky confined aquafers are equal to zero and described as follows 7 u r z t 0 8 h r z t 0 similar to a partially penetrating well pumped at a constant rate feng et al 2019 liang et al 2018 malama et al 2008 the well face boundary conditions for a vcw with an infinitesimally small radius can be written as 9 l i m r 0 r u r 0 10 l i m r 0 r h r q 2 π k r 2 d d z 0 0 l z d q 2 π k r 2 b l b z l where q represents pumping negative and injection positive rates l3t 1 which is assumed to be constant over time the cross formation flow enters the unconfined aquifer should be treated as a boundary condition at the base of the unconfined aquifer rather than a volumetric effect inside the unconfined aquifer continuity of vertical water flux is maintained at the interface of layered aquifers the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the aquifer thus flow in the aquitard is nearly vertical sun and zhan 2006 and continuities of vertical flux at z 0 can be written as follows 11 c m u h z 0 k z 1 u z z 0 k z 2 h z z 0 where cm is the hydraulic conductance of aquitard and it is defined as 12 c m k m d m where k m and d m are the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and thickness l of the aquitard respectively it should be noted that only continuity of vertical flux is considered at z 0 when the thickness of aquitard is much smaller than the thickness of both the leaky confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer as described in eq 11 3 methods 3 1 laplace hankel transforms in view of the convenience for analyzing the hydrodynamic system of concern here the parameters and variables in the mathematical model are converted to dimensionless forms this dimensionless conversion can reduce the number of dimensional parameters into a fewer number of mutually independent free dimensionless parameter thus resolve the parameter correlation problem cordey et al 1996 liang et al 2017b the definitions of dimensionless parameters and variables are listed in table 1 and the dimensionless forms of eqs 1 to 11 can be obtained as follows for the unconfined aquifer 0 z d a d it becomes 13 1 r d r d r d u d r d k d 1 2 u d z d 2 s sd k rd u d t d 14 u d r d z d t d 0 15 u d r d z d t d 0 0 16 k d β u d z z d a d u d t d z d a d 17 lim r d 0 r d

of δ λ f θ and σ can be found in supplementary materials the overbar denotes a variable in the laplace domain hereinafter and the sign above the symbol implies the hankel transformed domain the details of derivation of eqs 24 and 25 are also presented in supplementary materials the groundwater specific discharge q can be easily obtained by the semi analytical solution of hydraulic head

horizontal and vertical specific discharge lt 1 in the unconfined aquifer and the q r 2 q z 2 mean the horizontal and vertical darcy velocities in the leaky confined aquifer respectively 3 2 inverse transformation to be more specific the laplace domain solution of eqs 24 and 25 should be called semi analytical solutions and must be inverted using an accurate and robust inverse laplace transform and inverse hankel transformation method to yield the spatiotemporal solution however the inverse laplace transform can rarely be done in an analytical manner given the complexity of the solution in laplace domain thus a numerical inverse laplace transform program is needed for most cases there are several numerical inverse laplace transform methods and each of those methods are best fitted for a particular type of problems davies and martin 1979 hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2007 wang and zhan 2015 the de hoog method is an improved crump method to compute the full complex fourier series and accelerates the convergence of the series de hoog et al 1982 which is one of the best numerical inverse laplace transform algorithms for dealing with pumping induced flow problems liang et al 2017a mishra and neuman 2010 as for inverse hankel transformation a numerical integration formula based on the bessel function is adopted which is convenient to implement and has a high degree of accuracy hidenori 2005 kwan et al 2015 we develop a matlab program to facilitate the computation and this program is available from the authors upon request 3 3 global sensitivity analysis in this section the critical parameters affecting the cross formation flow rate and volume are determined using a global sensitivity analysis method according to the governing equations and associated initial and boundary conditions eqs 1 12 hydraulic heads in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifers may be affected by the following nine parameters k r 1 k z 1 k r 2 k z 2 s s 1 s s 2 c m q s l compared to local sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis has two main advantages the ability to incorporate the influence of input parameters over the whole range of variation and the independent of modeler prejudice makler pick et al 2011 song et al 2012 during various global sensitivity analysis techniques the morris 1991 method is chosen to evaluate the global sensitivity of the variation of hydraulic head due to its lower computational cost and convenience of calculation to use the morris method two main parameters should be determined using the following equations the absolute mean μ i and the standard deviation σ i representing the greater sensitivity of the i th parameter on the output results and the interaction effects of the i th parameter on other parameters respectively a larger value of μ i indicates that parameter i has a more important overall influence on the output and a large σ i implies that parameter i has a nonlinear effect on the output or there are interactions between parameter i and other parameters song et al 2015 36 μ i j 1 f ee i j f i 1 2 n j 1 2 f 37 σ i 1 f j 1 f ee i j μ i 2 i 1 2 n j 1 2 f 38 μ i j 1 f ee i j f i 1 2 n j 1 2 f where n represents the total number of parameter and n 9 in this study f is the total sampling number of the elementary effects and is chosen as 20 in this study which is similar to what has been used in previous investigations such as lin et al 2019 and 39 ee i j h p 1 p 2 p i j δ p n h p 1 p 2 p i p n j δ where p i is a random value of the i th parameter in the range of p i 0 p i l i m p i 0 and p i l i m refer to the smallest and largest values of p i respectively as shown in table 3 δ represents a small increment and δ 1 f 1 in this section two observation points a with r d 1 and z d 0 3 and b r d 1 and z d 0 2 were chosen to conduct global sensitivity analysis of the nine parameters k r 1 k z 1 k r 2 k z 2 s s 1 s s 2 c m q s l the variation of μ i and σ i with time are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively a matlab program was developed to do this calculation which is available from the authors upon request from figs 2 and 3 some notable observations can be made firstly fig 2 a and fig 3 a show that the hydraulic head is very sensitive to the parameter c m q and most insensitive to s l fig 2 b and fig 3 b demonstrate that the parameters c m q have a great nonlinear interaction effect which are consistent with those in fig 2 a and fig 3 a the most sensitive parameter to variation of hydraulic head in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifer is c m which represents hydraulic properties of the aquitard therefore the cross formation flow is one of the most important controlling factors of the overall coupled aquifer system above observations can be understood based on the following observations the hydraulic head in the leaky confined aquifer is directly proportional to the pumping rate q this can also be seen from the boundary condition eq 10 which indicates that when the pumping rate q is doubled the hydraulic head h will be doubled as well the cross formation flow is directly proportional to the term cm as can be seen in eq 11 and the hydraulic head in the above unconfined aquifer is directly related to the cross formation flow as well while a stronger cross formation flow will lead a greater buildup of hydraulic head above the vcw therefore it is understandable that the hydraulic head in the system is sensitive to q and cm in particular as cm directly controls the flow between the lower leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer it becomes the most sensitive parameter for instance if cm is zero meaning that there is essentially no cross formation flow then the hydraulic head in the upper unconfined aquifer will not be affected by the vcw operation no matter what value of q is used in vcw on the other hand if cm is infinity meaning that there is no aquitard separating the lower aquifer and the upper aquifer then the whole system becomes a single unconfined aquifer and the hydraulic head in the system will be proportional to q different from q and cm sl which is the length of the impermeable or sealed section between the injection portion and the pumping portion of the vcw mostly controls the flowlines between the injection and pumping portions of vcw and volume of influence of the vcw a greater sl means longer flowlines between the injection and pumping portions of the vcw and a greater volume of influence of vcw but sl will only impose minor influence on the overall hydraulic head value this is also easily seen when conducting the computation of hydraulic heads when employing different values of sl secondly besides c m and q hydraulic head is sensitive to hydraulic parameters of its own aquifer than the adjacent aquifer hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction is more sensitive than that in the radial direction and specific storage is more sensitive than the hydraulic conductivity thirdly with the same q hydraulic head distribution in both aquifers are most insensitive to the change of length of injection or pumping section in the following section 5 the effects of above mentioned sensitive parameters c m k r k z s s on the hydraulic head distribution will be discussed in details 4 validation of solutions it is necessary to test the accuracy of the semi analytical solutions obtained above in general there are three basic methods to verify the analytical or semi analytical solutions 1 comparing to the laboratory or field testing data lin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 xian et al 2019 which is the most persuasive method but it is also the most difficult one to conduct due to limited instrument accuracy uncertainty in geological conditions and the high cost of collecting field testing data 2 comparing to the results of numerical modeling liang et al 2018 qi et al 2020 which is the most common method but the precondition is that the numerical modeling must be conducted in a robust way that the numerical errors are so small to be negligible 3 comparing to an analytical or semi analytical solution for a specific case that has already been tested in previous studies chang et al 2018 hantush 1967 sedghi and zhan 2019 which is the most efficient method we need to point out that either of above three methods will completely warrant the correctness of the developed semi analytical solution because of their own limitations for instance when the first method is used the uncertainty in the laboratory and or field conditions and measurement errors in the experiments are often unknown in advance when the second method is used the numerical errors associated with a numerical simulation are also unknown in most cases and not always negligible when the third method is used even the solutions are comparable under the conditions for the specific case one cannot guarantee that the solutions are always comparable for other cases in summary the test of semi analytical solution is necessary but one must be aware that such test should be regarded as gaining more confidence on the correctness of the developed solution rather than completely validate the solution for all cases once for all to our knowledge no such laboratory or field experiment of vcw has been conducted before therefore the second method mentioned above is adopted to test the semi analytical solutions in this section while the third method is conducted in section 5 1 to test the semi analytical solutions of eqs 24 and 25 the following default values of parameters are used based on previous similar investigations xu et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 a 10 m b 10 m d 3 m l 7 m k r 1 1 10 4 m s k z 1 1 10 5 m s k r 2 2 10 4 m s k z 2 2 10 5 m s s s 1 2 10 5 m 1 s s 2 2 10 5 m 1 s y 0 3 c m 1 10 6 s 1 the injection pumping rate q is 60 m 3 h r which is also similar to what has been used before in relevant studies jin et al 2016 tu et al 2020 the lengths of the injection portion and the pumping portion of vcw are set to be the same for the sake of illustration furthermore we set four different observation points as shown in fig 1 point a with r d 1 and z d 0 3 is in the unconfined aquifer point b r d 1 and z d 0 2 and point d r d 1 and z d 0 8 are near the injection portion and the pumping portion of vcw in the leaky confined aquifer respectively point c r d 1 and z d 0 5 is set at the middle elevation of the leaky confined aquifer one can see that all those four points are close to the vcw thus they will response to the operation of vcw quickly for the applications in gwhp it is necessary to elaborate on the choices of parameter values listed above in particularly on 1 the distance between the injection and pumping portions of vcw and 2 the rate of pumping and injection first of all we would like to point out that this study is not limited only to gwhp applications such as ooka et al 2011 rode et al 2015 jeon et al 2016 tu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and dinkel et al 2020 it can also be used for contaminant remediation such as cirpka and kitanidis 2001 and tatti et al 2019 and aquifer characterization goltz et al 2008 nevertheless the following discuss will focus on gwhp applications as an example to illustrate the first point of concern is the distance between the injection and pumping portions of vcw for some gwhp applications to allow sufficient residence time to exchange the thermal energy with the groundwater sometimes very deep circulation wells around 200 500 m below ground surface with a long distance around hundreds of meters between the pumping and injection portions are preferred jeon et al 2016 the boring costs of such deep wells are high as demonstrated by ooka et al 2011 for applications in japan and this is one of the problems for the wide spread use of this system another problem with the use of deep circulation wells with significant distances between the pumping and injection portions is that the aquifer may not be sufficiently thick to accommodate such significant distances between the pumping and injection portions in the same aquifer in contrast to the deep wells shallow vcws with a few meters to tens of meters of distance between the injection and pumping portions have also been used broadly for instance for the two single circulation wells used in the nagoya site of japan ooka et al 2011 eported that the depth of both wells was 30 m below the ground surface and the the pumping and injection screens were installed at depths of 20 23 m and 25 28 m with a distance about only a few meters between the injection and pumping portions in another study reported by dinkel et al 2020 the upper filter screens for injection were located between the depths of 9 1 m and 14 9 m and the lower screens for pumping were located between the depths of 25 4 m and 28 3 m below the land surface at the berlin mitt site the filter screens at the strausberg site were deeper than those at the berlin mitt site with the upper screens at 59 63 m and the lower screens at 70 4 73 7 m the distances between the upper and lower screens at both sites are around 10 m more or less in terms of the injection and pumping rates this study has used a relatively high rate which was also used in a recent study of tu et al 2020 the relatively high rate implies that the residence time will be relatively short in some other studies smaller rates have been used as well for instance dinkel et al 2020 have investigated systems having 60 kw capacities for heating and 14 29 kw for cooling suitable for buildings with surface areas of 1200 1600 m2 with pumping rates around 5 12 m3 h which is about 8 3 20 of what is used in this study in another study by rode et al 2015 they have used a pumping rate of 2 litters sec equivalent to 7 2 m3 h for a distance of 8 m between the injection and pumping portion of vcw jin et al 2016 demonstrated that the range of pumping rate was from 10 to 30 m 3 h in some other applications involving vcw one thing to note is that if the pumping rate is reduced the residence time of injected water in the system will increase proportionally for instance if the pumping rate drops one ten times from 60 m3 h to 6 m3 h the residence time will increase ten times accordingly in summary the chose parameters of vcw are acceptable for their relevance to applications a numerical model is established using comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa a galerkin finite element software package comsol has been used in numerous previous studies chen et al 2018 liang et al 2018 to compare with semi analytical solutions in fluid flow and solute transport in porous media and is generally successful the two dimensionally axisymmetric model is discretized using triangular elements as shown in fig 4 the elements near the interface of two aquifers and vcw are refined to ensure sufficient accuracy the number of triangular elements is 9816 the uniform time step of 0 5 s is used for the sake of simplicity the total number of time steps is 200 to simulate a total simulation time of t 100 s the reason to choose a relative short time like 100 s here is because the observation points are very close to the vcw thus they will response to the operation of vcw very quickly after the start of pumping and injection fig 5 a shows the variations of dimensionless buildup of the observation points a b c d against the dimensionless time t d using the comsol numerical solution circle symbols and the proposed semi analytical solutions of eqs 24 and 25 solid curves furthermore dimensionless hydraulic head profile as a function of z d at three different radical direction r d 0 5 1 a n d 1 5 at t 60 s is shown in fig 5 b by using the comsol numerical solution circle symbols and the semi analytical solutions solid curves both figures indicate that the proposed semi analytical solutions agree with the numerical solution very well over the entire simulation period and the fitness is over 99 5 results the main purpose of this research is to study the effect of cross formation flow on the variations of hydraulic head induced by vcw in the leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer in this section positive value of u d or h d means water buildup and hydraulic head increasing while negative value is called water drawdown indicating hydraulic head decreasing the cross formation flow not only becomes the primary exchange of water between the leaky confined aquifer and the overlying unconfined aquifer thus it will affect the magnitude and direction of groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer which is the focus of this study it also serves as the primary channel for thermal energy exchange between the two aquifers thus will alter the groundwater temperature in the unconfined aquifer as well a topic that will be investigated and reported elsewhere based on the global sensitivity analysis method shown in figs 2 and 3 c m is the most sensitive parameter so it will be discussed first as for the hydraulic parameters of aquifers k r k z s s we firstly define the ratio of the vertical direction k z to radial directions k r of each individual aquifer as media anisotropy the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers are assumed to have the same value of media anisotropy for the sake of illustration in most previous studies bear 1972 fetter 2018 the value of media anisotropy is smaller than 1 due to the layered structure of aquifer which means that radial flow component is dominant then the value of media anisotropy is set to be 0 1 and kept as a constant in this section on the other hand we defined two dimensionless ratios k xd k x 2 k x 1 k zd k z 2 k z 1 s sd s s 2 s s 1 to reflect the layered heterogeneity k ld which is set to kld kxd or kld kzd depending on whether the issue of concern is horizontal flow or vertical flow in the following discussion each aquifer itself is homogenous but the hydraulic conductivities of the upper and lower aquifers could be different significantly detailed discussion about s l is also presented in this section 5 1 effect of cross formation flow on the hydraulic head distribution as mentioned above four different observation points a b c d are set to study the variations of hydraulic head three different values of aquitard conductance c m 1 10 5 s 1 1 10 7 s 1 0 are adopted to calculate the hydraulic head distribution in the leaky confined aquifer and the other related values of parameters are listed in scenario 1 in table 2 c m 0 means no cross formation flow and a larger positive value of c m means a stronger upward cross formation flow the variations of dimensionless buildup in the leaky confined aquifer are shown in fig 6 which indicates that the cross formation flow has obvious effect on the hydraulic head distribution in the leaky confined aquifer when there is no cross formation c m 0 the hydraulic head in the observation point c is unchanged and the buildup at point b which is closer to the injection section of vcw and the drawdown at point d which is closer to the pumping section of vcw have the same magnitude all the time when c m 0 the cross formation flow leads to obvious change to hydraulic head distribution to further demonstrate the influence of cross formation on the hydraulic head distribution we display the profile contour of buildup for different c m values mentioned above at a fixed time t 60 s as shown in fig 7 several observations can be seen from figs 6 and 7 a higher value of c m leads to a smaller buildup at point b but a larger drawdown at point d and the rate of variation of buildup or drawdown slows down with time and eventually approaches a constant this observation can be understood after the following considerations at the beginning of vcw operation injection in the upper portion of vcw will generate buildup near the upper portion of vcw such as point b and pumping in the lower portion of vcw will generate drawdown near the lower portion of vcw such as point d meanwhile cross formation flow will start to play a role because of the vertical hydraulic gradient between the leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer the existence of cross formation flow from the upper portion of the leaky confined aquifer to the overlying unconfined aquifer reduces the flow imposed on the leaky confined aquifer itself in anther word the presence of upward cross formation flow is in some sense equivalent to a reduced injection strength imposed on the leaky aquifer itself therefore a reduced buildup near the injection portion such as point b will be seen furthermore because of the deviation of flow to the upper unconfined aquifer through the cross formation flow less injected water will eventually reach the lower pumping portion of the vcw this implies that additional water has to be extracted from aquifer storage from the lower portion of the leaky confined aquifer such as point d to flow to the pumping portion of the vcw such additional water extracted from the aquifer storage in the lower portion of the leaky confined aquifer will inevitably increase the drawdown in the lower portion of the leaky confined aquifer such as point d a greater cm value means a stronger cross formation flow or a greater deviation of flow from the leaky confined aquifer to the upper unconfined aquifer thus leads to a greater reduction of buildup in point b and a greater enhancement of drawdown in point d when time becomes progressively longer the quasi steady state condition will be established around vcw meaning that most injected water through the injection portion of vcw will flow back to the pumping portion of vcw with a minor portion flowing upward to the unconfined aquifer through the cross formation flow during this late stage a minor portion of water will be extracted from aquifer storage to supply the pumping of vcw and the hydraulic heads stay nearly constant with time as shown in figs 6 and 7 it appears to take longer time for the hydraulic head at point d to achieve the steady state condition than point b this point can be understood as follows because of the existence of an upper cross formation flow a certain portion of the injected water is deviated upward to serve as the cross formation flow and the rest portion of the injected water is used to create the buildup near the injection portion of vcw such as point b this means that the overall injection strength of vcw imposed on the surrounding aquifer has been weakened as compared to the case without the cross formation flow and a weaker injection strength will require less time for points near the injection portion of vcw to achieve steady state condition because point b is closer to the injection portion and point d is closer to the pumping portion so it is not surprise to see that it will take shorter time for point b to achive steady state condition than point d the point c at the middle of the leaky confined aquifer will now experience minor drawdown as compared to point d when an upward cross formation flow exists which is different from the zero drawdown at point c when the cross formation flow does not exist this is also easily understandable when there is no cross formation flow point c will have zero drawdown because it is positioned in the plane of symmetry of the injection portion and pumping portion of vcw however if an upper cross formation flow exists which is the case here the overall injection strength imposing on the aquifer will be reduced because of the deviation of cross formation flow thus less buildup will be generated by the injection portion of vcw at point c as compared to the drawdown generated by the pumping portion of vcw at point c overall the point c will experience a certain drawdown apparently there are no variations of dimensionless hydraulic head in unconfined aquifer when the cross formation flow does not exist c m 0 but water head drawdown or buildup at point a in the unconfined aquifer depends on whether the upper portion of the vcw is a pumping or injection section fig 8 shows the variations of drawdown or buildup at point a in the unconfined aquifer when the upper portion of the vcw is a pumping or injection section respectively a larger value of c m leads to a higher buildup when the upper portion of vcw is the injection section and a higher drawdown when the upper portion is the pumping section therefore it can be concluded that swifting the pumping and injection portion of vcw periodically can lessen the variations of hydraulic head in the upper unconfined aquifer thus minimize the unwanted hydraulic and environmental impact caused by the operation of the vcw 5 2 effect of layered heterogeneity on the hydraulic head distribution layered heterogeneity k ld reflect the contrasts of horizontal radial conductivity vertical hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers because the media anisotropy is fixed to 0 1 k ld is defined as either k ld k xd or k ld k zd depending on whether the issue of concern is horizontal flow or vertical flow therefore k ld 1 means that the leaky confined aquifer is more permeable than the unconfined aquifer and the opposite is true for k ld 1 three different values of k ld 5 1 0 5 are adopted to calculate the variations of hydraulic heads of b and d to be noted that the hydraulic parameters of the unconfined aquifer remain the same while different values of k ld are obtained by changing the hydraulic parameters of the leaky confined aquifer as a result the increasing value of layered heterogeneity k ld means increasing the hydraulic conductivity of the leaky confined aquifer the other parameter values are listed in scenario 2 in table 2 the calculated variations of hydraulic head value of four observation points are shown in fig 9 fig 9 a and fig 9 b clearly show the variations of hydraulic head with different values of k ld in the leaky confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer respectively some notable observations can be made here overall a larger layered heterogeneity k ld leads to smaller variations of hydraulic head in both the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers besides the rate of hydraulic head variation is quite significant at the early time and then it decreases with time and eventually approaches a constant finally with a larger value of layered heterogeneity k ld the hydraulic head of the leaky confined aquifer starts to change after a shorter period and appears to approach a constant more quickly but in the unconfined aquifer as fig 9 b shows the hydraulic head require more time to approach its asymptotic limit with a greater value of layered heterogeneity k ld this is understandable as follows a larger layered heterogeneity means a relatively more permeable leaky confined aquifer as compared to the upper unconfined aquifer therefore it requires less time for the leaky confined aquifer to achive steady state condition as shown in fig 9 a meanwhile a larger layered heterogeneity means a greater cross formation flow towards the upper unconfined aquifer which will requires longer time to dissipate the received cross formation flow in the unconfined aquifer therefore the hydraulic head in the unconfined aquifer needs more time to achieve the steady state condition as demonstrated in fig 9 b 5 3 effect of specific storages on the hydraulic head distribution specific storage s s is an important hydraulic parameter depending on the compressibility of particle skeleton of the porous media and the compressibility of water according to the global sensitivity analysis we have investigated the effect of specific storage on the buildup in both the upper and lower aquifers three s sd values 0 25 1 2 5 are adopted by setting different s s 2 value and the related values of parameters are listed in scenario 3 in table 2 some notable observations can be made here from the calculated result shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 b first of all in the leaky confined aquifer a smaller value of s sd smaller s s 2 value generates a greater rate of variation of buildup or drawdown at point b or d respectively which eventually approaches an asymptote within a relatively short period in addition a smaller s sd value leads to a larger variation of drawdown at point d near the pumping portion of vcw but the variation of buildup at point b near the injection portion has some distinctively different features for instance similar to the drawdown variation at point d the buildup at point b also changes with time with a greater rate at the beginning and approaches the asymptote faster when the s sd value is smaller however we also notice some minor overlaps of three different curves associated with s sd values of 0 25 0 5 and 2 5 at point b while such overlaps are not observed for point d furthermore in the unconfined aquifer the variation of hydraulic head at point a is similar to what has been observed at point b in the leaky confined aquifer but it increases with time with a much slower rate and takes longer time to reach a constant rate or a constant slope of the u t curve in the figure a larger s sd value leads to a larger buildup at point a eventually that is because a larger value of specific storage s s means a greater volume of groundwater released from storage or added into the storage when the hydraulic head drops or increase by a unit value when the s s 2 value of the leaky confined aquifer is larger the aquifer needs more time to add more water into the storage near the injection portion of the vcw such as point b when the hydraulic head increases by a unit value and more time to release more water from storage near the pumping portion of the vcw such as point d when the hydraulic head decreases by a unit value on the other hand a larger value of s s 2 means more cross formation flow into the unconfined aquifer leading to a larger buildup there 5 4 effect of sealed section length on the hydraulic head distribution to investigate effect of length of the sealed section sl of vcw on the hydraulic head distribution three sealed section length values 2 m 4 m 6 m are adopted and the related values of parameters are listed in scenario 4 in table 2 from the calculation results shown in fig 11 a and fig 11 b some interesting findings are summarized as follows on the one hand the length of sealed section has non negligible effect on the variations of hydraulic head a longer sealed section results in greater variations hydraulic head on the other hand the magnitude of buildup at point b or drawdown at point d increases with the sealed section length for the purpose of illustration it is assumed that the length of pumping and injection sections are the same in the above analysis which means r 1 in this part we will choose three different values r 0 5 1 2 to study the effect of different lengths of pumping and injection sections on head distribution with the same pumping and injection rates q the result is shown in fig 12 in the leaky confined aquifer the value of r imposed the greatest impact on point c as for the unconfined aquifer a smaller length of the injection portion leads to a larger buildup this can be explained as follows a smaller length of the injection portion means that the injection portion is closer to the interface of the leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer with a stronger injection strength per unit injection length leading to a greater cross formation flow to the unconfined aquifer and subsequently a larger buildup there to sum up since a shorter length of the injection section near the aquitard results in a larger cross formation flow the extension of injection section length will have the opposite effect and contribute to the reduction of cross formation flow and thus less mass and thermal transport from the storage aquifer the leaky confined aquifer to the environment the upper unconfined aquifer this finding is advisable for the actual design of the gwhp systems 5 5 the total volumetric discharge rate of the cross formation flow a fractional amount of circulated water using a vcw will flow into the unconfied aquifer through the cross formation flow through the aquitard the total volumetric discharge rate of the such cross formation flow can be easily obtained as follows 40 w 0 2 π k z 1 r u r z 0 t z d r where w is the total volume of the such cross formation flow at a given time t the calculation result of w with different operating time of vcw is shown in fig 13 the adopted values of the related paramenters is listed in scenario 5 in table 2 fig 13 demonstates that the total volumetric discharge of the cross formation flow w varies with time like an asymmetric bell shape with a steeper rising limb and a flatter falling limb the w reaches the peak value at a very short time after the onset of vcw but slowly decreases to a stable value which means that the cross formation flow keeps ongoing during the entire operation of vcw above observations can be easily understood by condiering the hydraulic heads distribution in both the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers after the onset of the vcw the hydraulic head adjaced to the aquitard in the leaky confined aquifer starts to grow quite rapidly while the hydraulic head remains nearly unchanged in the unconfined aquifer since the cross formation flow requires time to reach the unconfined aquifer as time going the hydraulic gradient between the lower leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer increaes and the volumetric discharge of the cross formation flow increases as well the continuous arrival of the cross formation flow at the unconfined aquifer will build up the hydraulic head in the unconfined aquifer and eventually decreases the hydraulic gradient between the leaky confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer and eventually reduce the total volumetric discharge rate of the cross formation flow when time gets sufficiently long the hydraulic gradient between the leaky confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer is stabilized and the total discharge of the cross formation flow is approaching the steady state value as reflected in fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 comparison with the previous solution as mentioned above cross formation flow induced by vcw is overlooked in previous investigations for instance tu et al 2020 developed a general analytical model for the single well circulation system in a confined aquifer employing the laplace and fourier cosine transforms tu et al 2020 investigated a completely confined aquifer without any cross formation flow which can be regarded as a special case of this study when the cross formation flow becomes negligible in our research no leakage will happen if the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard k m is set to zero and the solution in the leaky confined aquifer h is the same as the solution in the confined aquifer s in eq 7 obtained by tu et al 2020 fig 14 a shows that dimensionless buildups of observation points b c d obtained by the proposed solution solid curves fit very well with those obtained by tu et al 2020 circle symbols by using the same hydraulic and geometrical parameters to better demonstrate the influence of cross formation flow on the groundwater flow we compared variation of hydraulic head obtained by the presented solution considering cross formation flow with the solution by tu et al 2020 without the cross formation flow in fig 14 b observation point a is located in the unconfined aquifer and ignored by tu et al 2020 therefore the distribution of hydraulic head of a is not drawn in fig 14 b from fig 14 b differences between considering proposed solution and not considering tu et al 2020 cross flow can be concluded as follows 1 the operation of vcw has a significant impact on hydraulic head distribution in the leaky confined aquifer due to the existence of cross formation flow into the adjacent aquifer 2 the differences between the proposed solution and the solution of tu et al 2020 increase with time until reaching steady state it can be inferred that cross formation flow is closely related to the efficiency of the heat pump system and possible contamination in the adjacent aquifer through the above comparisons with tu et al 2020 the proposed solutions of eqs 24 and 25 appear to be sufficiently accurate and robust to predict the variations of hydraulic head in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifers on the other hand cross formation flow should not be neglected in gwhp system when the low permeable and thin aquitard exists 6 2 further discussion about the hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be constant during the operation of vcw in this investigation this implies that the temperature variation associated with vcw should not be too great or the system is operated under the low temperature range fleuchaus et al 2018 pointed out that 99 of the 2800 aquifer thermal energy storage ates systems reported around the world were low temperature system lt ates with tyical storage temperature less than 25 celsius for such lt ates systems the hydraulic conductivity can be assumed to be constant however if the system is operated under high temperature status ht ates in which the temperature can be as high as 45 to 150 celsius for some deep aquifer systems fleuchaus et al 2018 the hydraulic conductivity will be a function of temperature this is because hydraulic conductivity is related to viscosity and density of fluid as follows 41 k t ρ t g μ t k where kt is the temperature dependent hydraulic conductivity t is temperature ρ t is the temperature dependent fluid density g is gravity constant μ t is the temperature dependent fluid viscosity k is the intrinsic permeability of the porous media and it is usually temperature independent in above equation although the temperature dependency of fluid density can be regarded as a secondary effect at the typical operational temperature ranage of gwhp the temperature dependency of fluid viscosity usually cannot be neglected for the high temperature system consideration of the temperature dependent hydraulic conductivity will substainablly increase the degree of difficulty of modelling the operation of vcw because of the coupling of flow and thermal transport and the nonlinear relationship of hydraulic conductivity and temperature it is extremely challenging if not impossible to model such a coupled flow and thermal transport system analytically as done in this study and one must reply on a numerical simulator to address the issue which is not the focus of this investigation but will be a subject of our future investigation the main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the influence of vcw on the hydraulic head distribution on both unconfined and leaky confined aquifers under the presumption of a constant hydraulic conductivity or for the low temperature gwhp system the outcome of this analytical work can be used as a baseline reference for subsequent studies of more complex geothermal systems including the high temperature gwhp systems 6 3 applicability and limitation of the model when developing new flow and transport theories such as the theis well flow theory in a confined aquifer theis 1935 hantush s well flow theory in a leaky confined aquifer hantush 1964 and neuman s well flow theory in an unconfined aquifer neuman 1974 simplified conceptual models are always used with assumptions such as homogeneous media constant transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity etc despite of its simplicity such theories are powerful and invaluable for advancing the subsurface hydrology in a number of different ways it offers great insights on the system dynamics and help us understand the hydrological characteristics it offers a way for characterizing the aquifer and flow behavior although such theories may not be able to provide a detailed description of flow and transport in a heterogeneous porous system with complex initial and boundary conditions they can still serve several purposes for understanding flow and transport in a heterogeneous porous system for instance the hydraulic conductivity spatial distribution in a heterogeneous aquifer may be characterized using a stochastic process with an autocorrelation function with a finite correlation length if the stochastic process is stationary the deterministic theory of flow and transport developed under homogeneous media assumption can be used to describe the macroscopic behavior of the system when the scale of concern is much greater than the correlation length of the autocorrelated hydraulic conductivity spatial distribution it is true that the real world scenarios are always complex and may be very different from the highly simplified conceptual models used to develop the analytical flow and transport theories for such complex real world problems one may need to develop a numerical simulation to understand the system behavior however to use the numerical model properly the insights gained from the analytical model will be very valuable in addition one has to rely on the analytical model to benchmark the numerical simulation which is faced with numerical errors non convergence issues and sometime uniqueness solutions etc another notable point is that because of the coexistence of pumping and injection at the same wellbore at different elevation in the same aquifer the operation of vcw usually generates a much smaller volume of influence as compared with the volume of influence generated by a standard pumping or injection well provided that the same rate of pumping or injection is used because of its limited volume of influence of vcw operation the variation of hydraulic conductivity near the vcw within the limited volume of influence may be quite small and can be approximated as a homogeneous one meanwhile because of the limited volume of influence of vcw operation it is much less sensitive to the lateral boundary conditions particularly when those lateral boundaries are outside the volume of influence of vcw therefore the laterally infinite aquifer assumption works reasonably well 6 4 improvement of the presented model in addition to the uniform hydraulic conductivity adopted we make several assumptions to make the problem amendable analytically there are a number of issues that deserve discussion for the better application of this study firstly thickness of the aquitard is neglected and this limits the application of this research to some extent in further study one can look for the solution of vcw system with a relatively thick aquitard and compared with this study to determine the applicability of this study secondly multiple vertical circulation wells may be needed to meet the increasing demand for underground energy storage and recover the optimum design and layout of multiple vertical circulation wells including the spacing between the wells the rate of injection pumping regional groundwater flow thermal dispersion etc should be considered to minimize the thermal interference among different wellbores finally the lack of field scale or laboratory experimental data limits the development and validation of theoretical models such as this study in the future great attention should be paid to design in situ tests in the field or controlled laboratory experiments for assessing the effectiveness of the semi analytical solution obtained in this study the cross formation flow into the unconfined aquifer not only leads to the loss of stored thermal energy in the leaky confined aquifer but can also causes undesirable entry of contaminants from the storage leaky confined aquifer into the unconfined aquifer according to the analysis of this investigation to improve the efficiency of the gwhp systems and prevent unwanted environmental problems here are some points that need attention in practical engineering applications based on the global sensitivity analysis the hydraulic conductance c m of aquitard plays a critical role to control the cross formation flow which should be investigated carefully during in situ test and geophysical surveys great attention also should be paid to hydraulic parameters of the adjacent aquifer as those of the leaky confined aquifer used for heat storage because the contrasts of hydraulic parameters between the leaky confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer directly control the rate and volume of the cross formatiion flow the length ratio r of the injection section to the pumping section also impact the cross formation flow and a less r value is preferred to reduce the cross formation flow in summary although the presented semi analytic model in this research is a greatly simplified representation of reality it can obtain important insights into leaky behavior of a vcw system when the hydraulic and geometric features of the system are represented to be noted that this research can serve as an important phase i study to investigate the performance of thermal vcw operation considering thermal transport which will be the phase ii study that will be reported elsewhere 7 summary and conclusions in this study a conceptual model is established to investigate groundwater flow induced by a vertical circulation well system located in a leaky confined aquifer an aquitard exists between the leaky confined aquifer and the overlying unconfined aquifer the aquitard has a substantially smaller low permeability than either the leaky confined aquifer or the unconfined aquifer and its thickness is much smaller as well as compared to the thicknesses of its neighboring aquifers hydraulic communications between unconfined and leaky confined aquifers are conducted by the cross formation flow through the aquitard the governing equations of flow in the leaky confined and unconfined aquifers are coupled by the continuity of vertical flux at the aquifer aquitard interface and a semi analytical solution is derived using laplace hankel transforms the solution is tested with two other solutions a finite element numerical solution using comsol multiphysics and an existed solution for a special case when the cross formation flow ceases to exist and satisfactory agreements are found in both cases a global sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the key factors from nine parameters of concern in the model and the characteristics of groundwater flow and the effects of different parameters on drawdown or buildup are investigated this is the phase i research concerning the hydraulic response which serves as the basis for the phase ii research concerning the thermal transport and environmental impact in the future the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 semi analytical solutions of spatiotemporal variations of hydraulic head in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifer induced by the operation of a vertical circulation well in the leaky confined aquifer are obtained 2 the global sensitivity analysis indicates that the coupled aquifer system is most sensitive to the hydraulic parameter c m of aquitard and most insensitive to the length of injection or pumping section of vcw with the same injection or pump rate compared to hydraulic conductivity in the radial direction variations of hydraulic heads are more sensitive to vertical hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of aquifers 3 cross formation flow has obvious influence on the variations of hydraulic head in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifer and higher value of c m leads to a smaller buildup near the injection section but a larger drawdown near the pumping section in the leaky confined aquifer and the rate of change of buildup or drawdown slows down with time and eventually appears to approach a constant 4 a larger layered heterogeneity k ld leads to smaller variations of hydraulic heads in both the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers with more rapid increasing rates and requiring less time for approaching their corresponding asymptotes 5 as for the specific storage ratio between the unconfined and leaky confined aquifer s sd a smaller value of s sd leads to a faster increasing rate at the beginning and requires less time for approaching the corresponding asymptote a larger value of s sd leads to a larger buildup near the injection section but a smaller drawdown near the pumping section eventually declaration of competing interest the authors declare

3518,vertical circulation well vcw is a new type of groundwater heat pump gwhp system that is widely used in low enthalpy geothermal energy utilization as much attention has been given to the negative environmental impacts of gwhp cross formation flow induced by pumping or injection of hot or cold water in storage aquifer should be studied in advance in this research a conceptual model of cross formation flow induced by a thermal vcw in a leaky confined aquifer is developed and the mathematical implementation of this model is described in an analytical manner a semi analytical solution of the spatiotemporal distribution of hydraulic head in the coupled leaky confined aquifer in which the vcw is located and the overlying unconfined aquifer which is separated from the leaky confined aquifer by a thin layer aquitard is derived using laplace hankel transforms and the solution is tested against a finite element numerical solution using comsol multiphysics and an existing solution the global sensitivity analysis is conducted to quantify and prioritize the hydraulic head response to the change in each of the aquifer parameters the alteration of hydraulic head distribution in the overlying unconfined aquifer induced by the operation of vcw in the underlying leaky confined aquifer can change the groundwater flow velocity and direction in the unconfined aquifer thus may cause unwanted environmental consequences the result indicated that hydraulic head is most sensitive to the hydraulic conductance c m of the aquitard and most insensitive to the length of injection or pumping section of vcw the proposed semi analytical solutions can be used to improve the design of vertical single well circulation system for groundwater treatment or a geothermal energy engineering

systems are a promising new energy technology that has shown rapid increase in usage over the past 10 years to achieve regional mitigation targets against climate change stocker 2014 unfccc 2015 in the field of low enthalpy geothermal energy utilization groundwater heat pumps system gwhp which is one of the gshp systems is widely used for space heating air conditioning industrial heat supply as well as other applications rafferty 2001 the gwhp is an open loop gshp system in which groundwater is directly involved in the heat exchange process park et al 2018 the pumped groundwater is usually injected into the same thermal storage aquifer where it was extracted from garcia gil et al 2015 to achieve regional mitigation targets against climate change by limiting anthropogenic global warming to 2 c garcía gil et al 2016 the number of installations of geothermal energy utilization of ground source energy will be expected to increase further in the future epting et al 2017 lund and boyd 2016 however an increasing number of researches also start to investigate the potential negative environmental impacts induced by the exploitation storage and utilization of geothermal energy possemiers et al 2014 many researches reveal that the quality and chemical composition of groundwater may be significantly affected by the gwhp systems abesser 2010 bonte 2015 thus threatening the public health and the native subsurface ecological environment garcia gil et al 2015 simpson et al 1989 zhu et al 2010 jesußek et al 2013 revealed that the portable groundwater can be impaired by reducing metal oxides and thus possibly releasing heavy metals from the sediment with a temperature increase higher than 25 c the rate of mineral dissolution sorption geochemistry and microbial activity can also be changed when the temperature in groundwater system increases to minimize the impact of gwhp on groundwater supply it is better to install the gwhp wells in a different aquifer separated from the aquifer with portable groundwater wells with a less permeable aquitard martin and frind 1998 wagner 2011 in most previous studies farabi asl et al 2018 garcia gil et al 2015 it is usually assumed that as long as the pumping and injection groundwater volumes are the same the gwhp system will not affect the adjacent aquifer hydraulically and environmentally but in our view this statement may be only acceptable on the presumption that there is no cross formation flow and it is questionable and must be carefully revisited if cross formation flow exist this is because abundant evidence has shown that although the aquitard may be much less permeable than its neighboring aquifers cross formation flow through the aquitard almost always occurs whenever there is even a minor hydraulic head difference between the aquifer of the gwhp system and the adjacent aquifers feng et al 2020 malama et al 2008 such cross formation flow is an important hydraulic connection between different aquifers and is capable of changing the magnitude and direction of groundwater flow as well as temperature distribution in the neighboring aquifers thus affecting their groundwater chemistry and quality aiken et al 2011 garcía gil et al 2016 the single well circulation system contains an injection section and a pumping section in the same wellbore and is a new type of gwhp system that is different from the conventional double or multiple well system in which pumping and injection are conducted in different wellbores ni et al 2011 wu et al 2015 the single well circulation system as discussed in this study requires a much smaller surface area than the double or multiple well system because it only requires a relatively limited surface area to accommodate the installnation of a single wellbore rather than a relatively extended surface water to accommodate the installnation of multiple wells therefore it is a preferred choice in urban areas in which land use may be substantially limited ladislaus and rybach 2015 tu et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 this single well circulation idea was firstly used in petroleum engineering to measure the vertical permeability in petroleum reservoirs burns 1969 later on it was applied extensively in geothermal utilization and environmental remediations knox et al 1997 zhu et al 2020 for the operation of the single well circulation system groundwater is taken as a heat carrier jin et al 2016 zhou and zhou 2009 and the heat transfer is closely dependent on groundwater hydraulics pannike et al 2006 previous researches show that heat transfer around pumping and injection well is mainly controlled by convection and the extent of convection heat transfer heavily depends on the groundwater velocity zhang 2003 in fact the direction and magnitude of groundwater flow velocity directly affect the underground temperature distribution and heat pump efficiency chiasson et al 2000 hecht méndez et al 2010 therefore insight into the groundwater flow and hydraulic head distribution in the neighboring aquifers induced by a vertical single well circulation system is essential and vital prior to the onset of design of gwhp systems to our knowledge cross formation flow induced by a vertical circulation well vcw has not been investigated in both the geothermal community and the hydrological community where vcw is sometimes also called the single circulation well or standing column well both abbreviated as scw insight into the leaky process between the leaky confined aquifer and its neighboring aquifer may help better design the gwhp systems and prevent unwanted environmental problems in this research we will establish conceptual and mathematical models to study the hydraulic response in the overlying unconfined aquifer induced by a thermal vcw in the leaky confined aquifer a semi analytical solution is derived using the double laplace hankel transform to investigate the system of concern and the solution is tested by comparing with the numerical solution obtained by comsol multiphysics and an existing solution tu et al 2020 which concerns the vcw operation in a confined aquifer rather than the leaky confined aquifer the solution of tu et al 2020 can be regarded as a special case of this study when the cross formation flow does not exist a global sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the key parameters of influence this is the phase i research mostly concerning the hydraulic response which serves as the basis for the phase ii research concerning the thermal transport and environmental impact in the future the structure of this study is organized as follows we first present the conceptual and mathematical models and the semi solutions in sections 2 and 3 then test the solution against a high resolution numerical solution built with comsol multiphysics in section 4 describe the results and discussion in sections 5 and 6 respectively the summary and conclusions are in section 7 2 conceptual model and governing equations 2 1 conceptual model a schematic diagram of groundwater flow induced by a vcw located in a leaky confined aquifer is represented in fig 1 the leaky confined aquifer rests on an impermeable bedrock or aquiclude while the upper adjacent aquifer is unconfined with an instantaneous drainage water table both aquifers are assumed to be slightly compressible spatially uniform vertically anisotropic and infinite laterally with constant thickness a leaky confining layer or aquitard exists between the leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer the aquitard thickness is assumed to be small enough so that the water storage effect of the aquitard is negligible the system is hydrostatic with a uniform hydraulic head before the operation of vcw hydraulic communication between the leaky confined aquifer and the overlying unconfined aquifer can be active through vertical water flux driven by a vertical hydraulic gradient across the aquitard a fully penetrating vcw is located in the leaky confined aquifer and is divided into two sections separated by an impermeable well packer the lower part of the vcw can be taken as a pumping section and the upper part is an injection section or vice versa a uniform radial flux along both the injection and pumping well screens is adopted as the lateral boundary is sufficiently far to affect the vcw operation mishra et al 2012 in reality the injection and pumping well screens are better described using a uniform head boundary condition when the wellbore is treated as an infinite hydraulic conductivity media thus there is no energy loss or head loss for vertical conduit flow inside the wellbore which is often true when the rate of flow is relatively small zhan and bian 2006 when the rate of injection and pumping is relatively large vertical conduit flow inside the wellbore may experience sizable energy loss due to friction with the wall of wellbore then the injection and pumping sections are better described using a mixed type boundary condition yeh and chang 2013 both uniform head and mixed type boundary conditions are much more difficult to handle compared with the uniform flux boundary and are not favorable in analytical modeling but they can be handled relatively straightforwardly in numerical simulations sun and zhan 2006 fortunately abundant evidence has shown that the use of uniform flux wellbore boundary condition only causes minor discrepancy from the uniform head and mixed type boundary conditions liang et al 2017a liang et al 2017b therefore the uniform flux approximation is favorable from a practical standpoint with acceptable accuracy sun and zhan 2006 and will be used in this investigation additional assumptions made for the conceptual model are 1 pumping and injection rates q l3t 1 of the vcw negative for pumping and positive for injection are constant and start simultaneously if q of the vcw is time dependent rather than constant it can always be discretized into a sequence of stepwise constant rates over many small time intervals and one can subsequently obtain the solution with time dependent q using the superposition principle on the basis of the constant q solution 2 the well radius is infinitesimally small thus wellbore storage effect is neglected if well radius is finite and wellbore storage is non negligible one can wait for a short moment to allow the wellbore storage effect to subdue then starts to analyze the results park and zhan 2002 3 the storage or release of groundwater due to rising or falling of water table in the unconfined aquifer is instantaneous if the drainage of water table is delayed rather than instantaneous one may need to invoke the delayed water table condition moench 1995 zhan and zlotnik 2002 or incorporate the unsaturated flow process above the water table liang et al 2018 qi et al 2020 4 the unconfined aquifer is thick enough so that infiltration or evaporation is not considered in this research and the water table variation due to pumping or injection of circulation well is assumed to be much smaller than the unconfined aquifer thickness thus the nonlinear governing equation of unconfined flow can be linearized without introducing considerable errors zhan and zlotnik 2002 2 2 governing equations a cylindrical coordinate system is setup as follows the bottom of the aquitard is set as the reference datum with the origin located at the center of the vertical well the r axis is along horizontal radial water flow direction while the z axis is positive upward a is the distance from bottom of the unconfined aquifer to the initial water table and kept as a constant b is the thickness of the leaky confined aquifer the thickness of the aquitard is assumed to be much smaller than a and b thus allowing cross formation flow to occur even though the permeability of the aquitard could be several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the leaky confined aquifer below and the unconfined aquifer above the vcw consists of pumping sealed and injection sections with the length of d s l l d and b l respectively as shown in fig 1 the r is defined as the ratio of the lengths of the pumping to injection sections b l d the hydraulic heads in the following discussion are substituted by water drawdowns or buildups where drawdowns are negative and buildups are positive i e the drop or rise of hydraulic head over the spatially uniform hydraulic head at the initial time the governing equations for above coupled aquifer system are presented as follows by considering cross formation flow through the aquitard between the two adjacent aquifers for the unconfined aquifer 0 z a one has 1 k r 1 r r 1 r u r k z 1 2 u z 2 s s 1 u t for the leaky confined aquifer b z 0 one has 2 k r 2 r r 1 r h r k z 2 2 h z 2 s s 2 h t where u and h are the variations of hydraulic head l in unconfined aquifer and leaky confined aquifer respectively s s is the specific storages l 1 k r and k z denote the hydraulic conductivities in the radial and vertical directions respectively l t the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers hereinafter respectively t is the injection or pumping time r and z are the radial and vertical coordinates l respectively the initial condition before the onset of vcw can be written as 3 u r z t 0 4 h r z t 0 0 the linearized free surface boundary condition of the unconfined aquifer with an instantaneous drainage water table is approximated as neuman 1974 zhan and park 2003 5 k z 1 u z z a s y u t z a where s y is the drainable porosity or specific yield of the unconfined aquifer no flow condition is applied at the base of the leaky confined aquifer and described as 6 h z z b 0 the buildup at the infinite radial boundaries for both the unconfined and leaky confined aquafers are equal to zero and described as follows 7 u r z t 0 8 h r z t 0 similar to a partially penetrating well pumped at a constant rate feng et al 2019 liang et al 2018 malama et al 2008 the well face boundary conditions for a vcw with an infinitesimally small radius can be written as 9 l i m r 0 r u r 0 10 l i m r 0 r h r q 2 π k r 2 d d z 0 0 l z d q 2 π k r 2 b l b z l where q represents pumping negative and injection positive rates l3t 1 which is assumed to be constant over time the cross formation flow enters the unconfined aquifer should be treated as a boundary condition at the base of the unconfined aquifer rather than a volumetric effect inside the unconfined aquifer continuity of vertical water flux is maintained at the interface of layered aquifers the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the aquifer thus flow in the aquitard is nearly vertical sun and zhan 2006 and continuities of vertical flux at z 0 can be written as follows 11 c m u h z 0 k z 1 u z z 0 k z 2 h z z 0 where cm is the hydraulic conductance of aquitard and it is defined as 12 c m k m d m where k m and d m are the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and thickness l of the aquitard respectively it should be noted that only continuity of vertical flux is considered at z 0 when the thickness of aquitard is much smaller than the thickness of both the leaky confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer as described in eq 11 3 methods 3 1 laplace hankel transforms in view of the convenience for analyzing the hydrodynamic system of concern here the parameters and variables in the mathematical model are converted to dimensionless forms this dimensionless conversion can reduce the number of dimensional parameters into a fewer number of mutually independent free dimensionless parameter thus resolve the parameter correlation problem cordey et al 1996 liang et al 2017b the definitions of dimensionless parameters and variables are listed in table 1 and the dimensionless forms of eqs 1 to 11 can be obtained as follows for the unconfined aquifer 0 z d a d it becomes 13 1 r d r d r d u d r d k d 1 2 u d z d 2 s sd k rd u d t d 14 u d r d z d t d 0 15 u d r d z d t d 0 0 16 k d β u d z z d a d u d t d z d a d 17 lim r d 0 r d

of δ λ f θ and σ can be found in supplementary materials the overbar denotes a variable in the laplace domain hereinafter and the sign above the symbol implies the hankel transformed domain the details of derivation of eqs 24 and 25 are also presented in supplementary materials the groundwater specific discharge q can be easily obtained by the semi analytical solution of hydraulic head

horizontal and vertical specific discharge lt 1 in the unconfined aquifer and the q r 2 q z 2 mean the horizontal and vertical darcy velocities in the leaky confined aquifer respectively 3 2 inverse transformation to be more specific the laplace domain solution of eqs 24 and 25 should be called semi analytical solutions and must be inverted using an accurate and robust inverse laplace transform and inverse hankel transformation method to yield the spatiotemporal solution however the inverse laplace transform can rarely be done in an analytical manner given the complexity of the solution in laplace domain thus a numerical inverse laplace transform program is needed for most cases there are several numerical inverse laplace transform methods and each of those methods are best fitted for a particular type of problems davies and martin 1979 hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2007 wang and zhan 2015 the de hoog method is an improved crump method to compute the full complex fourier series and accelerates the convergence of the series de hoog et al 1982 which is one of the best numerical inverse laplace transform algorithms for dealing with pumping induced flow problems liang et al 2017a mishra and neuman 2010 as for inverse hankel transformation a numerical integration formula based on the bessel function is adopted which is convenient to implement and has a high degree of accuracy hidenori 2005 kwan et al 2015 we develop a matlab program to facilitate the computation and this program is available from the authors upon request 3 3 global sensitivity analysis in this section the critical parameters affecting the cross formation flow rate and volume are determined using a global sensitivity analysis method according to the governing equations and associated initial and boundary conditions eqs 1 12 hydraulic heads in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifers may be affected by the following nine parameters k r 1 k z 1 k r 2 k z 2 s s 1 s s 2 c m q s l compared to local sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis has two main advantages the ability to incorporate the influence of input parameters over the whole range of variation and the independent of modeler prejudice makler pick et al 2011 song et al 2012 during various global sensitivity analysis techniques the morris 1991 method is chosen to evaluate the global sensitivity of the variation of hydraulic head due to its lower computational cost and convenience of calculation to use the morris method two main parameters should be determined using the following equations the absolute mean μ i and the standard deviation σ i representing the greater sensitivity of the i th parameter on the output results and the interaction effects of the i th parameter on other parameters respectively a larger value of μ i indicates that parameter i has a more important overall influence on the output and a large σ i implies that parameter i has a nonlinear effect on the output or there are interactions between parameter i and other parameters song et al 2015 36 μ i j 1 f ee i j f i 1 2 n j 1 2 f 37 σ i 1 f j 1 f ee i j μ i 2 i 1 2 n j 1 2 f 38 μ i j 1 f ee i j f i 1 2 n j 1 2 f where n represents the total number of parameter and n 9 in this study f is the total sampling number of the elementary effects and is chosen as 20 in this study which is similar to what has been used in previous investigations such as lin et al 2019 and 39 ee i j h p 1 p 2 p i j δ p n h p 1 p 2 p i p n j δ where p i is a random value of the i th parameter in the range of p i 0 p i l i m p i 0 and p i l i m refer to the smallest and largest values of p i respectively as shown in table 3 δ represents a small increment and δ 1 f 1 in this section two observation points a with r d 1 and z d 0 3 and b r d 1 and z d 0 2 were chosen to conduct global sensitivity analysis of the nine parameters k r 1 k z 1 k r 2 k z 2 s s 1 s s 2 c m q s l the variation of μ i and σ i with time are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively a matlab program was developed to do this calculation which is available from the authors upon request from figs 2 and 3 some notable observations can be made firstly fig 2 a and fig 3 a show that the hydraulic head is very sensitive to the parameter c m q and most insensitive to s l fig 2 b and fig 3 b demonstrate that the parameters c m q have a great nonlinear interaction effect which are consistent with those in fig 2 a and fig 3 a the most sensitive parameter to variation of hydraulic head in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifer is c m which represents hydraulic properties of the aquitard therefore the cross formation flow is one of the most important controlling factors of the overall coupled aquifer system above observations can be understood based on the following observations the hydraulic head in the leaky confined aquifer is directly proportional to the pumping rate q this can also be seen from the boundary condition eq 10 which indicates that when the pumping rate q is doubled the hydraulic head h will be doubled as well the cross formation flow is directly proportional to the term cm as can be seen in eq 11 and the hydraulic head in the above unconfined aquifer is directly related to the cross formation flow as well while a stronger cross formation flow will lead a greater buildup of hydraulic head above the vcw therefore it is understandable that the hydraulic head in the system is sensitive to q and cm in particular as cm directly controls the flow between the lower leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer it becomes the most sensitive parameter for instance if cm is zero meaning that there is essentially no cross formation flow then the hydraulic head in the upper unconfined aquifer will not be affected by the vcw operation no matter what value of q is used in vcw on the other hand if cm is infinity meaning that there is no aquitard separating the lower aquifer and the upper aquifer then the whole system becomes a single unconfined aquifer and the hydraulic head in the system will be proportional to q different from q and cm sl which is the length of the impermeable or sealed section between the injection portion and the pumping portion of the vcw mostly controls the flowlines between the injection and pumping portions of vcw and volume of influence of the vcw a greater sl means longer flowlines between the injection and pumping portions of the vcw and a greater volume of influence of vcw but sl will only impose minor influence on the overall hydraulic head value this is also easily seen when conducting the computation of hydraulic heads when employing different values of sl secondly besides c m and q hydraulic head is sensitive to hydraulic parameters of its own aquifer than the adjacent aquifer hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction is more sensitive than that in the radial direction and specific storage is more sensitive than the hydraulic conductivity thirdly with the same q hydraulic head distribution in both aquifers are most insensitive to the change of length of injection or pumping section in the following section 5 the effects of above mentioned sensitive parameters c m k r k z s s on the hydraulic head distribution will be discussed in details 4 validation of solutions it is necessary to test the accuracy of the semi analytical solutions obtained above in general there are three basic methods to verify the analytical or semi analytical solutions 1 comparing to the laboratory or field testing data lin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 xian et al 2019 which is the most persuasive method but it is also the most difficult one to conduct due to limited instrument accuracy uncertainty in geological conditions and the high cost of collecting field testing data 2 comparing to the results of numerical modeling liang et al 2018 qi et al 2020 which is the most common method but the precondition is that the numerical modeling must be conducted in a robust way that the numerical errors are so small to be negligible 3 comparing to an analytical or semi analytical solution for a specific case that has already been tested in previous studies chang et al 2018 hantush 1967 sedghi and zhan 2019 which is the most efficient method we need to point out that either of above three methods will completely warrant the correctness of the developed semi analytical solution because of their own limitations for instance when the first method is used the uncertainty in the laboratory and or field conditions and measurement errors in the experiments are often unknown in advance when the second method is used the numerical errors associated with a numerical simulation are also unknown in most cases and not always negligible when the third method is used even the solutions are comparable under the conditions for the specific case one cannot guarantee that the solutions are always comparable for other cases in summary the test of semi analytical solution is necessary but one must be aware that such test should be regarded as gaining more confidence on the correctness of the developed solution rather than completely validate the solution for all cases once for all to our knowledge no such laboratory or field experiment of vcw has been conducted before therefore the second method mentioned above is adopted to test the semi analytical solutions in this section while the third method is conducted in section 5 1 to test the semi analytical solutions of eqs 24 and 25 the following default values of parameters are used based on previous similar investigations xu et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 a 10 m b 10 m d 3 m l 7 m k r 1 1 10 4 m s k z 1 1 10 5 m s k r 2 2 10 4 m s k z 2 2 10 5 m s s s 1 2 10 5 m 1 s s 2 2 10 5 m 1 s y 0 3 c m 1 10 6 s 1 the injection pumping rate q is 60 m 3 h r which is also similar to what has been used before in relevant studies jin et al 2016 tu et al 2020 the lengths of the injection portion and the pumping portion of vcw are set to be the same for the sake of illustration furthermore we set four different observation points as shown in fig 1 point a with r d 1 and z d 0 3 is in the unconfined aquifer point b r d 1 and z d 0 2 and point d r d 1 and z d 0 8 are near the injection portion and the pumping portion of vcw in the leaky confined aquifer respectively point c r d 1 and z d 0 5 is set at the middle elevation of the leaky confined aquifer one can see that all those four points are close to the vcw thus they will response to the operation of vcw quickly for the applications in gwhp it is necessary to elaborate on the choices of parameter values listed above in particularly on 1 the distance between the injection and pumping portions of vcw and 2 the rate of pumping and injection first of all we would like to point out that this study is not limited only to gwhp applications such as ooka et al 2011 rode et al 2015 jeon et al 2016 tu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and dinkel et al 2020 it can also be used for contaminant remediation such as cirpka and kitanidis 2001 and tatti et al 2019 and aquifer characterization goltz et al 2008 nevertheless the following discuss will focus on gwhp applications as an example to illustrate the first point of concern is the distance between the injection and pumping portions of vcw for some gwhp applications to allow sufficient residence time to exchange the thermal energy with the groundwater sometimes very deep circulation wells around 200 500 m below ground surface with a long distance around hundreds of meters between the pumping and injection portions are preferred jeon et al 2016 the boring costs of such deep wells are high as demonstrated by ooka et al 2011 for applications in japan and this is one of the problems for the wide spread use of this system another problem with the use of deep circulation wells with significant distances between the pumping and injection portions is that the aquifer may not be sufficiently thick to accommodate such significant distances between the pumping and injection portions in the same aquifer in contrast to the deep wells shallow vcws with a few meters to tens of meters of distance between the injection and pumping portions have also been used broadly for instance for the two single circulation wells used in the nagoya site of japan ooka et al 2011 eported that the depth of both wells was 30 m below the ground surface and the the pumping and injection screens were installed at depths of 20 23 m and 25 28 m with a distance about only a few meters between the injection and pumping portions in another study reported by dinkel et al 2020 the upper filter screens for injection were located between the depths of 9 1 m and 14 9 m and the lower screens for pumping were located between the depths of 25 4 m and 28 3 m below the land surface at the berlin mitt site the filter screens at the strausberg site were deeper than those at the berlin mitt site with the upper screens at 59 63 m and the lower screens at 70 4 73 7 m the distances between the upper and lower screens at both sites are around 10 m more or less in terms of the injection and pumping rates this study has used a relatively high rate which was also used in a recent study of tu et al 2020 the relatively high rate implies that the residence time will be relatively short in some other studies smaller rates have been used as well for instance dinkel et al 2020 have investigated systems having 60 kw capacities for heating and 14 29 kw for cooling suitable for buildings with surface areas of 1200 1600 m2 with pumping rates around 5 12 m3 h which is about 8 3 20 of what is used in this study in another study by rode et al 2015 they have used a pumping rate of 2 litters sec equivalent to 7 2 m3 h for a distance of 8 m between the injection and pumping portion of vcw jin et al 2016 demonstrated that the range of pumping rate was from 10 to 30 m 3 h in some other applications involving vcw one thing to note is that if the pumping rate is reduced the residence time of injected water in the system will increase proportionally for instance if the pumping rate drops one ten times from 60 m3 h to 6 m3 h the residence time will increase ten times accordingly in summary the chose parameters of vcw are acceptable for their relevance to applications a numerical model is established using comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa a galerkin finite element software package comsol has been used in numerous previous studies chen et al 2018 liang et al 2018 to compare with semi analytical solutions in fluid flow and solute transport in porous media and is generally successful the two dimensionally axisymmetric model is discretized using triangular elements as shown in fig 4 the elements near the interface of two aquifers and vcw are refined to ensure sufficient accuracy the number of triangular elements is 9816 the uniform time step of 0 5 s is used for the sake of simplicity the total number of time steps is 200 to simulate a total simulation time of t 100 s the reason to choose a relative short time like 100 s here is because the observation points are very close to the vcw thus they will response to the operation of vcw very quickly after the start of pumping and injection fig 5 a shows the variations of dimensionless buildup of the observation points a b c d against the dimensionless time t d using the comsol numerical solution circle symbols and the proposed semi analytical solutions of eqs 24 and 25 solid curves furthermore dimensionless hydraulic head profile as a function of z d at three different radical direction r d 0 5 1 a n d 1 5 at t 60 s is shown in fig 5 b by using the comsol numerical solution circle symbols and the semi analytical solutions solid curves both figures indicate that the proposed semi analytical solutions agree with the numerical solution very well over the entire simulation period and the fitness is over 99 5 results the main purpose of this research is to study the effect of cross formation flow on the variations of hydraulic head induced by vcw in the leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer in this section positive value of u d or h d means water buildup and hydraulic head increasing while negative value is called water drawdown indicating hydraulic head decreasing the cross formation flow not only becomes the primary exchange of water between the leaky confined aquifer and the overlying unconfined aquifer thus it will affect the magnitude and direction of groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer which is the focus of this study it also serves as the primary channel for thermal energy exchange between the two aquifers thus will alter the groundwater temperature in the unconfined aquifer as well a topic that will be investigated and reported elsewhere based on the global sensitivity analysis method shown in figs 2 and 3 c m is the most sensitive parameter so it will be discussed first as for the hydraulic parameters of aquifers k r k z s s we firstly define the ratio of the vertical direction k z to radial directions k r of each individual aquifer as media anisotropy the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers are assumed to have the same value of media anisotropy for the sake of illustration in most previous studies bear 1972 fetter 2018 the value of media anisotropy is smaller than 1 due to the layered structure of aquifer which means that radial flow component is dominant then the value of media anisotropy is set to be 0 1 and kept as a constant in this section on the other hand we defined two dimensionless ratios k xd k x 2 k x 1 k zd k z 2 k z 1 s sd s s 2 s s 1 to reflect the layered heterogeneity k ld which is set to kld kxd or kld kzd depending on whether the issue of concern is horizontal flow or vertical flow in the following discussion each aquifer itself is homogenous but the hydraulic conductivities of the upper and lower aquifers could be different significantly detailed discussion about s l is also presented in this section 5 1 effect of cross formation flow on the hydraulic head distribution as mentioned above four different observation points a b c d are set to study the variations of hydraulic head three different values of aquitard conductance c m 1 10 5 s 1 1 10 7 s 1 0 are adopted to calculate the hydraulic head distribution in the leaky confined aquifer and the other related values of parameters are listed in scenario 1 in table 2 c m 0 means no cross formation flow and a larger positive value of c m means a stronger upward cross formation flow the variations of dimensionless buildup in the leaky confined aquifer are shown in fig 6 which indicates that the cross formation flow has obvious effect on the hydraulic head distribution in the leaky confined aquifer when there is no cross formation c m 0 the hydraulic head in the observation point c is unchanged and the buildup at point b which is closer to the injection section of vcw and the drawdown at point d which is closer to the pumping section of vcw have the same magnitude all the time when c m 0 the cross formation flow leads to obvious change to hydraulic head distribution to further demonstrate the influence of cross formation on the hydraulic head distribution we display the profile contour of buildup for different c m values mentioned above at a fixed time t 60 s as shown in fig 7 several observations can be seen from figs 6 and 7 a higher value of c m leads to a smaller buildup at point b but a larger drawdown at point d and the rate of variation of buildup or drawdown slows down with time and eventually approaches a constant this observation can be understood after the following considerations at the beginning of vcw operation injection in the upper portion of vcw will generate buildup near the upper portion of vcw such as point b and pumping in the lower portion of vcw will generate drawdown near the lower portion of vcw such as point d meanwhile cross formation flow will start to play a role because of the vertical hydraulic gradient between the leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer the existence of cross formation flow from the upper portion of the leaky confined aquifer to the overlying unconfined aquifer reduces the flow imposed on the leaky confined aquifer itself in anther word the presence of upward cross formation flow is in some sense equivalent to a reduced injection strength imposed on the leaky aquifer itself therefore a reduced buildup near the injection portion such as point b will be seen furthermore because of the deviation of flow to the upper unconfined aquifer through the cross formation flow less injected water will eventually reach the lower pumping portion of the vcw this implies that additional water has to be extracted from aquifer storage from the lower portion of the leaky confined aquifer such as point d to flow to the pumping portion of the vcw such additional water extracted from the aquifer storage in the lower portion of the leaky confined aquifer will inevitably increase the drawdown in the lower portion of the leaky confined aquifer such as point d a greater cm value means a stronger cross formation flow or a greater deviation of flow from the leaky confined aquifer to the upper unconfined aquifer thus leads to a greater reduction of buildup in point b and a greater enhancement of drawdown in point d when time becomes progressively longer the quasi steady state condition will be established around vcw meaning that most injected water through the injection portion of vcw will flow back to the pumping portion of vcw with a minor portion flowing upward to the unconfined aquifer through the cross formation flow during this late stage a minor portion of water will be extracted from aquifer storage to supply the pumping of vcw and the hydraulic heads stay nearly constant with time as shown in figs 6 and 7 it appears to take longer time for the hydraulic head at point d to achieve the steady state condition than point b this point can be understood as follows because of the existence of an upper cross formation flow a certain portion of the injected water is deviated upward to serve as the cross formation flow and the rest portion of the injected water is used to create the buildup near the injection portion of vcw such as point b this means that the overall injection strength of vcw imposed on the surrounding aquifer has been weakened as compared to the case without the cross formation flow and a weaker injection strength will require less time for points near the injection portion of vcw to achieve steady state condition because point b is closer to the injection portion and point d is closer to the pumping portion so it is not surprise to see that it will take shorter time for point b to achive steady state condition than point d the point c at the middle of the leaky confined aquifer will now experience minor drawdown as compared to point d when an upward cross formation flow exists which is different from the zero drawdown at point c when the cross formation flow does not exist this is also easily understandable when there is no cross formation flow point c will have zero drawdown because it is positioned in the plane of symmetry of the injection portion and pumping portion of vcw however if an upper cross formation flow exists which is the case here the overall injection strength imposing on the aquifer will be reduced because of the deviation of cross formation flow thus less buildup will be generated by the injection portion of vcw at point c as compared to the drawdown generated by the pumping portion of vcw at point c overall the point c will experience a certain drawdown apparently there are no variations of dimensionless hydraulic head in unconfined aquifer when the cross formation flow does not exist c m 0 but water head drawdown or buildup at point a in the unconfined aquifer depends on whether the upper portion of the vcw is a pumping or injection section fig 8 shows the variations of drawdown or buildup at point a in the unconfined aquifer when the upper portion of the vcw is a pumping or injection section respectively a larger value of c m leads to a higher buildup when the upper portion of vcw is the injection section and a higher drawdown when the upper portion is the pumping section therefore it can be concluded that swifting the pumping and injection portion of vcw periodically can lessen the variations of hydraulic head in the upper unconfined aquifer thus minimize the unwanted hydraulic and environmental impact caused by the operation of the vcw 5 2 effect of layered heterogeneity on the hydraulic head distribution layered heterogeneity k ld reflect the contrasts of horizontal radial conductivity vertical hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers because the media anisotropy is fixed to 0 1 k ld is defined as either k ld k xd or k ld k zd depending on whether the issue of concern is horizontal flow or vertical flow therefore k ld 1 means that the leaky confined aquifer is more permeable than the unconfined aquifer and the opposite is true for k ld 1 three different values of k ld 5 1 0 5 are adopted to calculate the variations of hydraulic heads of b and d to be noted that the hydraulic parameters of the unconfined aquifer remain the same while different values of k ld are obtained by changing the hydraulic parameters of the leaky confined aquifer as a result the increasing value of layered heterogeneity k ld means increasing the hydraulic conductivity of the leaky confined aquifer the other parameter values are listed in scenario 2 in table 2 the calculated variations of hydraulic head value of four observation points are shown in fig 9 fig 9 a and fig 9 b clearly show the variations of hydraulic head with different values of k ld in the leaky confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer respectively some notable observations can be made here overall a larger layered heterogeneity k ld leads to smaller variations of hydraulic head in both the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers besides the rate of hydraulic head variation is quite significant at the early time and then it decreases with time and eventually approaches a constant finally with a larger value of layered heterogeneity k ld the hydraulic head of the leaky confined aquifer starts to change after a shorter period and appears to approach a constant more quickly but in the unconfined aquifer as fig 9 b shows the hydraulic head require more time to approach its asymptotic limit with a greater value of layered heterogeneity k ld this is understandable as follows a larger layered heterogeneity means a relatively more permeable leaky confined aquifer as compared to the upper unconfined aquifer therefore it requires less time for the leaky confined aquifer to achive steady state condition as shown in fig 9 a meanwhile a larger layered heterogeneity means a greater cross formation flow towards the upper unconfined aquifer which will requires longer time to dissipate the received cross formation flow in the unconfined aquifer therefore the hydraulic head in the unconfined aquifer needs more time to achieve the steady state condition as demonstrated in fig 9 b 5 3 effect of specific storages on the hydraulic head distribution specific storage s s is an important hydraulic parameter depending on the compressibility of particle skeleton of the porous media and the compressibility of water according to the global sensitivity analysis we have investigated the effect of specific storage on the buildup in both the upper and lower aquifers three s sd values 0 25 1 2 5 are adopted by setting different s s 2 value and the related values of parameters are listed in scenario 3 in table 2 some notable observations can be made here from the calculated result shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 b first of all in the leaky confined aquifer a smaller value of s sd smaller s s 2 value generates a greater rate of variation of buildup or drawdown at point b or d respectively which eventually approaches an asymptote within a relatively short period in addition a smaller s sd value leads to a larger variation of drawdown at point d near the pumping portion of vcw but the variation of buildup at point b near the injection portion has some distinctively different features for instance similar to the drawdown variation at point d the buildup at point b also changes with time with a greater rate at the beginning and approaches the asymptote faster when the s sd value is smaller however we also notice some minor overlaps of three different curves associated with s sd values of 0 25 0 5 and 2 5 at point b while such overlaps are not observed for point d furthermore in the unconfined aquifer the variation of hydraulic head at point a is similar to what has been observed at point b in the leaky confined aquifer but it increases with time with a much slower rate and takes longer time to reach a constant rate or a constant slope of the u t curve in the figure a larger s sd value leads to a larger buildup at point a eventually that is because a larger value of specific storage s s means a greater volume of groundwater released from storage or added into the storage when the hydraulic head drops or increase by a unit value when the s s 2 value of the leaky confined aquifer is larger the aquifer needs more time to add more water into the storage near the injection portion of the vcw such as point b when the hydraulic head increases by a unit value and more time to release more water from storage near the pumping portion of the vcw such as point d when the hydraulic head decreases by a unit value on the other hand a larger value of s s 2 means more cross formation flow into the unconfined aquifer leading to a larger buildup there 5 4 effect of sealed section length on the hydraulic head distribution to investigate effect of length of the sealed section sl of vcw on the hydraulic head distribution three sealed section length values 2 m 4 m 6 m are adopted and the related values of parameters are listed in scenario 4 in table 2 from the calculation results shown in fig 11 a and fig 11 b some interesting findings are summarized as follows on the one hand the length of sealed section has non negligible effect on the variations of hydraulic head a longer sealed section results in greater variations hydraulic head on the other hand the magnitude of buildup at point b or drawdown at point d increases with the sealed section length for the purpose of illustration it is assumed that the length of pumping and injection sections are the same in the above analysis which means r 1 in this part we will choose three different values r 0 5 1 2 to study the effect of different lengths of pumping and injection sections on head distribution with the same pumping and injection rates q the result is shown in fig 12 in the leaky confined aquifer the value of r imposed the greatest impact on point c as for the unconfined aquifer a smaller length of the injection portion leads to a larger buildup this can be explained as follows a smaller length of the injection portion means that the injection portion is closer to the interface of the leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer with a stronger injection strength per unit injection length leading to a greater cross formation flow to the unconfined aquifer and subsequently a larger buildup there to sum up since a shorter length of the injection section near the aquitard results in a larger cross formation flow the extension of injection section length will have the opposite effect and contribute to the reduction of cross formation flow and thus less mass and thermal transport from the storage aquifer the leaky confined aquifer to the environment the upper unconfined aquifer this finding is advisable for the actual design of the gwhp systems 5 5 the total volumetric discharge rate of the cross formation flow a fractional amount of circulated water using a vcw will flow into the unconfied aquifer through the cross formation flow through the aquitard the total volumetric discharge rate of the such cross formation flow can be easily obtained as follows 40 w 0 2 π k z 1 r u r z 0 t z d r where w is the total volume of the such cross formation flow at a given time t the calculation result of w with different operating time of vcw is shown in fig 13 the adopted values of the related paramenters is listed in scenario 5 in table 2 fig 13 demonstates that the total volumetric discharge of the cross formation flow w varies with time like an asymmetric bell shape with a steeper rising limb and a flatter falling limb the w reaches the peak value at a very short time after the onset of vcw but slowly decreases to a stable value which means that the cross formation flow keeps ongoing during the entire operation of vcw above observations can be easily understood by condiering the hydraulic heads distribution in both the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers after the onset of the vcw the hydraulic head adjaced to the aquitard in the leaky confined aquifer starts to grow quite rapidly while the hydraulic head remains nearly unchanged in the unconfined aquifer since the cross formation flow requires time to reach the unconfined aquifer as time going the hydraulic gradient between the lower leaky confined aquifer and the upper unconfined aquifer increaes and the volumetric discharge of the cross formation flow increases as well the continuous arrival of the cross formation flow at the unconfined aquifer will build up the hydraulic head in the unconfined aquifer and eventually decreases the hydraulic gradient between the leaky confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer and eventually reduce the total volumetric discharge rate of the cross formation flow when time gets sufficiently long the hydraulic gradient between the leaky confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer is stabilized and the total discharge of the cross formation flow is approaching the steady state value as reflected in fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 comparison with the previous solution as mentioned above cross formation flow induced by vcw is overlooked in previous investigations for instance tu et al 2020 developed a general analytical model for the single well circulation system in a confined aquifer employing the laplace and fourier cosine transforms tu et al 2020 investigated a completely confined aquifer without any cross formation flow which can be regarded as a special case of this study when the cross formation flow becomes negligible in our research no leakage will happen if the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard k m is set to zero and the solution in the leaky confined aquifer h is the same as the solution in the confined aquifer s in eq 7 obtained by tu et al 2020 fig 14 a shows that dimensionless buildups of observation points b c d obtained by the proposed solution solid curves fit very well with those obtained by tu et al 2020 circle symbols by using the same hydraulic and geometrical parameters to better demonstrate the influence of cross formation flow on the groundwater flow we compared variation of hydraulic head obtained by the presented solution considering cross formation flow with the solution by tu et al 2020 without the cross formation flow in fig 14 b observation point a is located in the unconfined aquifer and ignored by tu et al 2020 therefore the distribution of hydraulic head of a is not drawn in fig 14 b from fig 14 b differences between considering proposed solution and not considering tu et al 2020 cross flow can be concluded as follows 1 the operation of vcw has a significant impact on hydraulic head distribution in the leaky confined aquifer due to the existence of cross formation flow into the adjacent aquifer 2 the differences between the proposed solution and the solution of tu et al 2020 increase with time until reaching steady state it can be inferred that cross formation flow is closely related to the efficiency of the heat pump system and possible contamination in the adjacent aquifer through the above comparisons with tu et al 2020 the proposed solutions of eqs 24 and 25 appear to be sufficiently accurate and robust to predict the variations of hydraulic head in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifers on the other hand cross formation flow should not be neglected in gwhp system when the low permeable and thin aquitard exists 6 2 further discussion about the hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be constant during the operation of vcw in this investigation this implies that the temperature variation associated with vcw should not be too great or the system is operated under the low temperature range fleuchaus et al 2018 pointed out that 99 of the 2800 aquifer thermal energy storage ates systems reported around the world were low temperature system lt ates with tyical storage temperature less than 25 celsius for such lt ates systems the hydraulic conductivity can be assumed to be constant however if the system is operated under high temperature status ht ates in which the temperature can be as high as 45 to 150 celsius for some deep aquifer systems fleuchaus et al 2018 the hydraulic conductivity will be a function of temperature this is because hydraulic conductivity is related to viscosity and density of fluid as follows 41 k t ρ t g μ t k where kt is the temperature dependent hydraulic conductivity t is temperature ρ t is the temperature dependent fluid density g is gravity constant μ t is the temperature dependent fluid viscosity k is the intrinsic permeability of the porous media and it is usually temperature independent in above equation although the temperature dependency of fluid density can be regarded as a secondary effect at the typical operational temperature ranage of gwhp the temperature dependency of fluid viscosity usually cannot be neglected for the high temperature system consideration of the temperature dependent hydraulic conductivity will substainablly increase the degree of difficulty of modelling the operation of vcw because of the coupling of flow and thermal transport and the nonlinear relationship of hydraulic conductivity and temperature it is extremely challenging if not impossible to model such a coupled flow and thermal transport system analytically as done in this study and one must reply on a numerical simulator to address the issue which is not the focus of this investigation but will be a subject of our future investigation the main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the influence of vcw on the hydraulic head distribution on both unconfined and leaky confined aquifers under the presumption of a constant hydraulic conductivity or for the low temperature gwhp system the outcome of this analytical work can be used as a baseline reference for subsequent studies of more complex geothermal systems including the high temperature gwhp systems 6 3 applicability and limitation of the model when developing new flow and transport theories such as the theis well flow theory in a confined aquifer theis 1935 hantush s well flow theory in a leaky confined aquifer hantush 1964 and neuman s well flow theory in an unconfined aquifer neuman 1974 simplified conceptual models are always used with assumptions such as homogeneous media constant transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity etc despite of its simplicity such theories are powerful and invaluable for advancing the subsurface hydrology in a number of different ways it offers great insights on the system dynamics and help us understand the hydrological characteristics it offers a way for characterizing the aquifer and flow behavior although such theories may not be able to provide a detailed description of flow and transport in a heterogeneous porous system with complex initial and boundary conditions they can still serve several purposes for understanding flow and transport in a heterogeneous porous system for instance the hydraulic conductivity spatial distribution in a heterogeneous aquifer may be characterized using a stochastic process with an autocorrelation function with a finite correlation length if the stochastic process is stationary the deterministic theory of flow and transport developed under homogeneous media assumption can be used to describe the macroscopic behavior of the system when the scale of concern is much greater than the correlation length of the autocorrelated hydraulic conductivity spatial distribution it is true that the real world scenarios are always complex and may be very different from the highly simplified conceptual models used to develop the analytical flow and transport theories for such complex real world problems one may need to develop a numerical simulation to understand the system behavior however to use the numerical model properly the insights gained from the analytical model will be very valuable in addition one has to rely on the analytical model to benchmark the numerical simulation which is faced with numerical errors non convergence issues and sometime uniqueness solutions etc another notable point is that because of the coexistence of pumping and injection at the same wellbore at different elevation in the same aquifer the operation of vcw usually generates a much smaller volume of influence as compared with the volume of influence generated by a standard pumping or injection well provided that the same rate of pumping or injection is used because of its limited volume of influence of vcw operation the variation of hydraulic conductivity near the vcw within the limited volume of influence may be quite small and can be approximated as a homogeneous one meanwhile because of the limited volume of influence of vcw operation it is much less sensitive to the lateral boundary conditions particularly when those lateral boundaries are outside the volume of influence of vcw therefore the laterally infinite aquifer assumption works reasonably well 6 4 improvement of the presented model in addition to the uniform hydraulic conductivity adopted we make several assumptions to make the problem amendable analytically there are a number of issues that deserve discussion for the better application of this study firstly thickness of the aquitard is neglected and this limits the application of this research to some extent in further study one can look for the solution of vcw system with a relatively thick aquitard and compared with this study to determine the applicability of this study secondly multiple vertical circulation wells may be needed to meet the increasing demand for underground energy storage and recover the optimum design and layout of multiple vertical circulation wells including the spacing between the wells the rate of injection pumping regional groundwater flow thermal dispersion etc should be considered to minimize the thermal interference among different wellbores finally the lack of field scale or laboratory experimental data limits the development and validation of theoretical models such as this study in the future great attention should be paid to design in situ tests in the field or controlled laboratory experiments for assessing the effectiveness of the semi analytical solution obtained in this study the cross formation flow into the unconfined aquifer not only leads to the loss of stored thermal energy in the leaky confined aquifer but can also causes undesirable entry of contaminants from the storage leaky confined aquifer into the unconfined aquifer according to the analysis of this investigation to improve the efficiency of the gwhp systems and prevent unwanted environmental problems here are some points that need attention in practical engineering applications based on the global sensitivity analysis the hydraulic conductance c m of aquitard plays a critical role to control the cross formation flow which should be investigated carefully during in situ test and geophysical surveys great attention also should be paid to hydraulic parameters of the adjacent aquifer as those of the leaky confined aquifer used for heat storage because the contrasts of hydraulic parameters between the leaky confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer directly control the rate and volume of the cross formatiion flow the length ratio r of the injection section to the pumping section also impact the cross formation flow and a less r value is preferred to reduce the cross formation flow in summary although the presented semi analytic model in this research is a greatly simplified representation of reality it can obtain important insights into leaky behavior of a vcw system when the hydraulic and geometric features of the system are represented to be noted that this research can serve as an important phase i study to investigate the performance of thermal vcw operation considering thermal transport which will be the phase ii study that will be reported elsewhere 7 summary and conclusions in this study a conceptual model is established to investigate groundwater flow induced by a vertical circulation well system located in a leaky confined aquifer an aquitard exists between the leaky confined aquifer and the overlying unconfined aquifer the aquitard has a substantially smaller low permeability than either the leaky confined aquifer or the unconfined aquifer and its thickness is much smaller as well as compared to the thicknesses of its neighboring aquifers hydraulic communications between unconfined and leaky confined aquifers are conducted by the cross formation flow through the aquitard the governing equations of flow in the leaky confined and unconfined aquifers are coupled by the continuity of vertical flux at the aquifer aquitard interface and a semi analytical solution is derived using laplace hankel transforms the solution is tested with two other solutions a finite element numerical solution using comsol multiphysics and an existed solution for a special case when the cross formation flow ceases to exist and satisfactory agreements are found in both cases a global sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the key factors from nine parameters of concern in the model and the characteristics of groundwater flow and the effects of different parameters on drawdown or buildup are investigated this is the phase i research concerning the hydraulic response which serves as the basis for the phase ii research concerning the thermal transport and environmental impact in the future the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 semi analytical solutions of spatiotemporal variations of hydraulic head in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifer induced by the operation of a vertical circulation well in the leaky confined aquifer are obtained 2 the global sensitivity analysis indicates that the coupled aquifer system is most sensitive to the hydraulic parameter c m of aquitard and most insensitive to the length of injection or pumping section of vcw with the same injection or pump rate compared to hydraulic conductivity in the radial direction variations of hydraulic heads are more sensitive to vertical hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of aquifers 3 cross formation flow has obvious influence on the variations of hydraulic head in both unconfined and leaky confined aquifer and higher value of c m leads to a smaller buildup near the injection section but a larger drawdown near the pumping section in the leaky confined aquifer and the rate of change of buildup or drawdown slows down with time and eventually appears to approach a constant 4 a larger layered heterogeneity k ld leads to smaller variations of hydraulic heads in both the unconfined and leaky confined aquifers with more rapid increasing rates and requiring less time for approaching their corresponding asymptotes 5 as for the specific storage ratio between the unconfined and leaky confined aquifer s sd a smaller value of s sd leads to a faster increasing rate at the beginning and requires less time for approaching the corresponding asymptote a larger value of s sd leads to a larger buildup near the injection section but a smaller drawdown near the pumping section eventually declaration of competing interest the authors declare

and central sections of indian sub continent experience a declining trend in both frequency and intensity of extremes while coastal regions of peninsular india and the region immediately west of bangladesh have increasing trends after analysing the rainfall data for 1951 2003 moreover the variability and long term trends of extreme rainfall events over central india have also been investigated by rajeevan et al 2008 using 104 years 1901 2004 of high resolution daily gridded rainfall data and reported significant variabilities in inter annual and inter decadal changes in addition to a statistically significant long term trend in the frequency of extreme rainfall events sørland and sorteberg 2016 reported that the synoptic scale monsoon low pressure systems lps are the causal factors to proliferate extreme rainfall over central india these monsoon lps are sensitive to an increase in the temperature and moisture which becomes more energetic to bring high moisture to new regions causing extreme rainfall during the monsoon season it is evident that extreme rainfall can arise from two different scales of rain bearing systems synoptic scale 100 1000 km and meso scale 1 100 km therefore research on the meso scale dependence of daily extreme rainfall is limited this may be due to insufficient observational daily rainfall datasets as compared with monthly mean data with finer grid resolution over longer periods moreover the orographic features over the western as well as eastern coast and northeast india along with the movement of synoptic scale systems from the bay of bengal region to the central parts of india also contribute to heavy rainfall events over different parts of india soman and krishna kumar 1990 gadgil 2000 pattanaik 2007 thus understanding the impacts of dynamics and thermodynamics in a changing climate on the ism extremes and vagaries in spatio temporal patterns poses a key research challenge with significant implications on water resources and management policies archer et al 2010 turner and annamalai 2012 ghosh et al 2016 despite the large internal variability in certain parts of the globe the increase in rainfall extremes over indian landmass is evident due to a warming climate to both observations and climate model simulations ghosh et al 2012 mishra et al 2014 singh et al 2021 currently general circulation models gcms are effective to study global monsoon systems and numerous studies of future projections of ism rainfall using the outputs of coupled model intercomparison project cmip phase 5 have been carried out turner and slingo 2009 scoccimarro et al 2013 rajendran et al 2013 menon et al 2013 sooraj et al 2015 sharmila et al 2015 nath et al 2017 cmip6 represented the latest advancements in gcm development in phase 6 o neill et al 2016 riahi et al 2017 gusain et al 2020 provided an assessment of the improvements in climate model cm simulations for indicative characteristics representing complex dynamics of ism rainfall for period 1951 2005 both in cmip5 and cmip6 the capabilities of climate models in simulating the extremes have improved over time such that more accurate projections can be expected from the latest update of the models in cmip6 in recent days mishra et al 2020 utilized the bias corrected cmip6 projections to estimate the frequency of rainfall and temperature extremes for an administrative region state of uttar pradesh india and a river basin godavari india during near mid and end 21st century and reported higher frequencies for the far period than the near term climate therefore understanding and quantifying the magnitudes and frequencies of ism extreme rainfall events may help to identify the zones of high and low values of extreme rainfall events as well as its present and future changes is of immense importance to the society in the present study the spatio temporal variability of the climatic extremes mainly focussed on monsoon extreme rainfall occurrences over the indian landmass 6 n 39 n 66 e 100 e have been investigated during last seven decades 1951 2020 the probable causes behind the changes in extreme rainfall events over the eastern and western ghats as well as central and north east india are represented in order to investigate any gradual but significant changes in the regional climate scenario since the last seven decades with the aim to contribute in the improvement of the understanding in the rise of future extreme rainfall in terms of the intensities over the indian region this work utilizes the 12 best bias corrected gcm outputs as obtained from taylor diagram analysis out of 20 gcms used from cmip6 model simulations these bias corrected gcms will determine the future changes in terms of count of intense extreme rainfall occurrences associated with convective features during near 2036 2060 and late 21st century 2075 2099 over this indian landmass 2 data and methods the study utilizes the daily gridded rainfall dataset at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 pai et al 2014 from the national climate centre ncc of india meteorological department imd for monsoon june september period during 1951 2020 over the indian region the gridded dataset is constructed from a network of 6955 rain gauge stations spread across the indian landmass this high resolution data demonstrates that spatial distribution of rainfall over the eastern and western coasts as well as central and north east regions are more realistic due to high density of rainfall stations over these areas fig 1 shows the study domain with topography in the background based on the amount of accumulated rainfall in a day for extreme event studies imd has classified rainfall into three broad categories viz i heavy rainfall 64 5 r 115 5 mm ii very heavy rainfall 115 6 r 204 4 mm and iii extremely heavy rainfall r 204 5 mm and can be found in the website http imdsikkim gov in fct pdf last accessed on 5 july 2021 we have calculated these different extreme categories of rainfall from the daily gridded data of imd rainfall observations for the monsoon period of 1951 2020 over the whole indian landmass as well as over central india 18 25 n 74 81 e eastern ghats 10 22 n 78 85 e western ghats 10 22 n 72 76 e and north east india 23 28 n 88 97 e we have utilized the reliable meteorological gridded reanalysis datasets as a proxy of gridded observations for the climatic assessment over indian region in the present study the datasets of air temperature t relative humidity rh specific humidity q geopotential height z zonal u and meridional components of wind v have been collected surface 1000 hpa to 300 hpa levels from the fifth generation reanalysis dataset produced by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf known as era5 at 0 25 lat 0 25 long grid interval era5 is a latest high resolution reanalysis data produced by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which provide several improvements compared to era interim hersbach et al 2019 hersbach et al 2020 moist static energy mse is conserved under moist adiabatic processes and under hydrostatic balance thus it is a useful quantity to understand moist convection under the standard approximation its specific value value per total air mass is defined by 1 mse c p t q v l g z where c p is the heat capacity of the dry air at constant pressure t the temperature q v the specific vapour value l latent heat of vaporization of liquid water g acceleration of the gravity z is the altitude the geopotential contribution gz is an approximation of g0z with g0 a reference value for the acceleration of gravity and z the geopotential height see neelin and held 1987 this variable is calculated using metpy1 0 tool in python 3 7 environment moist static stability has been calculated as indicated by krishnamurti and bhalme 1976 where the representative depth for its calculation is chosen to be 1000 hpa and 700 hpa since the minimum value of mse does occur near 700 hpa pressure level and is given by 2 γ m m s e 700 m s e 1000 where γ m is the moist static stability ms e 700 and ms e 1000 are the moist static energies at 700 hpa and 1000 hpa levels respectively the difference in the ambient and dew point temperature at any height of the atmosphere helps to quantify possible chances of instability to accelerate moisture parcel updraft for a convective process to mature temperature saturation deficit tsd as utilized in saha et al 2017 2020 is basically the difference between the environmental and dew point temperature 3 tsd t t d where t and t d are the ambient air temperature and dew point temperature at the surface respectively in order to decipher the variability of cyclonic low pressure systems lps the present study also comprises of the calculation of the monsoon lps over the indian sub continent according to the lps detection algorithm described by vishnu et al 2020 these monsoon lps typically form over the northern bay of bengal then propagate to the northwest over india during the subsequent several days godbole 1977 mooley 1973 sikka 1978 thomas et al 2021 the most recent reanalysis from ecmwf era5 is used for this study with horizontal grid 0 25 0 25 and hourly temporal resolution during june september from 1951 to 2020 to calculate the monsoon lps the variables used are mean sea level pressure mslp surface wind 10 m u and v wind surface geopotential orography land sea fraction and the 850 hpa horizontal and meridional wind and 850 hpa relative humidity an automated lagrangian pointwise feature tracker tempestextremes is used for extracting lps track information from the reanalyses ullrich and zarzycki 2017 the basic algorithm for the tempestextremes has been discussed elaborately in vishnu et al 2020 firstly we have calculated the streamfunction using global horizontal and meridional wind at 850 hpa pressure level using windspharm version 1 7 0 python package for 1951 2020 jjas period this package is widely used for performing computations on global wind fields in spherical geometry dawson 2016 it provides a high level interface for computations using spherical harmonics and is capable of computing streamfunction from the input vector wind in our case u 850 and v 850 wind secondly using detect nodes of tempestextremes 2 1 module the lps candidates are daily searched and identified and are dumped in an output file containing the candidates of lps for jjas of 1951 2020 according to the following criteria 1 search for lps candidates as minima in the streamfunction field 2 merge lps candidates within 5 3 output generated from streamfunction minima at the candidate point keeping sea level pressure minima within 3 degrees of the candidate point wind speed maxima within 3 degrees of candidate relative humidity averaged over the area within 3 degrees of candidate surface geopotential maximum within 2 degrees of candidate land sea ratio at candidate point and minimum sea level pressure location thirdly the lps candidates are stitched using stitch nodes of tempestextremes 2 1 module with the following criteria 1 with a maximum distance of 3 0 between in sequence candidates 2 with a minimum length of 30 time points ensures track lasts longer than 1 day in 24 hourly data 3 with a maximum gap size of 12 time points 24 h 4 with the surface geopotential maximum less than 8000 m2 s 2 for at least 24 time steps along the track 5 with the relative humidity higher than 85 for at least 24 time steps along the track 6 with the mean sea level pressure minimum less than 998 hpa for at least 24 time steps along the track finally the output generated from analysing the lps candidate files are then combined to a single netcdf data file for the generation of decadal spatial variability of the genesis of monsoon low pressure systems over the indian sub continent cmip6 o neill et al 2016 eyring et al 2016 riahi et al 2017 is the latest coordinated effort among international climate modeling groups to simulate past present and future climate to better understand the response of the climate system to human and natural perturbations to energy balance this cmip6 dataset is available at different horizontal resolutions climate projections are scenario dependent cmip6 has designed new scenarios called shared socioeconomic pathway ssp ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp4 6 0 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 reducing systematic bias in climate model simulations using statistical techniques is an indispensable tool in research applications one of the common tools used for correcting bias of climate model simulations is empirical quantile mapping eqm which maps between simulated and observed cumulative distribution functions cdfs which are empirically constructed based on data from a historical period hence prior to the analysis bias corrected model dataset for daily rainfall is developed using eqm mishra et al 2020 for historic 1951 2014 and projected climate near 2036 2060 and late 2075 2099 for the three scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 using output of 20 general circulation models gcms from cmip6 the detailed description for bias correction methodology can be obtained in mishra et al 2020 we used eqm for bias correction because of its simplicity however as pointed out in some recent studies wang and chen 2014 ganguli and coulibaly 2019 srivastava et al 2021 the eqm assumes that higher order statistics of a distribution such as variance and skewness remain stationary and only the mean changes this assumption may not hold in a non stationary climate all ssps in gcms are based on five narratives that describe alternative socioeconomic developments gidden et al 2019 the scenarios are almost similar to what used in cmip5 scenarios as representative concentration pathways for bias correction we used imd gridded daily rainfall observations and cmip6 model rainfall under r1i1p1f1 initial condition at daily time scale from the historical run 1951 2014 and future run as mentioned above initially all the cmip6 rainfall datasets were linearly interpolated to the observation grid resolution 0 25 0 25 before bias correction method applied we have applied the same technique as procured by mishra et al 2020 for bias correction utilizing eqm method now this bias corrected model data has been utilized thereafter for the future projection of the counts in monsoon extremes in near and late 21st century cmip6 historical simulation period adopted for bias correction of daily rainfall data for each and individual 20 models is of 63 years 1951 2014 this is due to the fact that data with high population will be more useful and relevant for correcting the bias in daily rainfall values than data of shorter time period but it should be kept in mind that 63 years of historical run is only utilized for the development of bias corrected model dataset and afterwards we will use the historical experiment run of 25 years 1990 2014 keeping the same time period length to that of near and late 21st century time range table 2 lists the indian region mean fractional changes in extreme rainfall for the cmip6 gcms in our ensemble the years 1990 2014 of the cmip6 historical experiment are used to represent the current climate while the years 2036 2060 and 2075 2099 of the future experiment ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios are used to represent the near and late 21st century climates respectively in considering simulated changes in the extreme rainfall occurrences over the 1990 2014 baseline period and future changes near 2036 2060 and late 2075 2099 the available subset of the gcms that contributed to the cmip6 website https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 archive was used for the present investigation the latest cmip6 gcms represents a substantial expansion over cmip5 in terms of the number of modelling groups participating the number of future scenarios examined and the number of different experiments conducted rainfall from each of 20 gcms over indian landmass is evaluated for the current climate 1990 2014 in order to select the best models by using the taylor diagram taylor 2001 the taylor diagram provides a concise statistical summary of the degree of correlation root mean square error and standard deviation ratio only best models selected through this analysis will be used to compute ensemble mean gcms we have selected 12 gcms out of a total of 20 models taken for study on the basis of whose correlation co efficient is greater than 0 52 as well as the normalized standard deviation for individual models closer to 1 0 i e observed reference these selected model outputs best capture the patterns of the observed extreme rainfall from the historical period 1990 2014 we have also calculated the different extreme rainfall categories heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall as mentioned above for these 12 gcm cmip6 outputs the projected future changes are calculated as the difference between the ensemble mean of the selected best gcm outputs during near 2036 2060 and late 21st century 2075 2099 of different ssp scenarios respectively to the ensemble mean of the historical experiment during 1990 2014 base period while climate model outputs from cmip6 and its predecessors have been widely used to project regional changes in hydrological cycles menon et al 2013 sharmila et al 2015 sanap et al 2015 jena et al 2016 akhter et al 2017 gupta et al 2020 gussain et al 2020 mishra et al 2020 this study is absolutely the first attempt to project near and late 21st century future projections in the counts of heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall over the indian sub continent 3 spatio temporal variability of the observed rainfall over indian sub continent this section will present the spatio temporal distribution and decadal variability of the daily gridded 0 25 0 25 observed rainfall from india meteorological department imd for the last seven decades 1951 2020 over the indian landmass the section also discuss the spatial variability of the rainfall intensity heavy very heavy and extremely heavy over the indian region 3 1 spatio temporal distribution of maximum rainfall occurrences in the last seven decades fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the seasonal maximum rainfall maps over a particular time period in this case each decade during monsoon june september over the indian sub continent the average monsoonal maximum rainfall for all the decades 1951 1960 1961 1970 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively are found to be concentrated over the north east india central india and western and eastern coasts with maximum amount to be greater than 400 mm day 1 fig 2a g it is to be noted that the distribution of rainfall is controlled by the relief features of the land and the direction of the rain bearing winds during monsoon season increase in extreme rain events spreaded over a large region across the subcontinent more particularly over western coasts of upper maharashtra meghalaya in the north eastern india and gujarat in the west for the first decade 1951 1960 maximum rainfall hotspots can be located over inlands of orissa orographic regions of the north east india sub himalayan west bengal and western coast of maharashtra goa and karnataka regions fig 2a likewise first decade similar spatial distribution of maximum rainfall continues to the second 1961 1970 decade while in the third decade 1971 1980 gangetic west bengal and upper gujarat as well as hotspots starts to be located over central india fig 2b c during fourth decade 1981 1990 there are numerous maximum rainfall hotspots over the central india western ghats parts of upper eastern ghats and spreaded over the foothills of the himalayan region fig 2d similar to the fourth decade the entire north east india and western coasts of india show similar type of rainfall hotspots in the fifth decade 1991 2000 while rainfall hotspots are slightly decreased over the central indian region fig 2e sixth decade 2001 2010 is particularly devastating over the central india western ghats and upper ranges of the eastern ghats fig 2f the variability in the synoptic disturbances which develop over the bay of bengal results in high moisture incursion causes a good amount of rainfall in the eastern ghats which extended up to the inland regions of india the central part of coastal orissa generally gets good rainfall due to basic westerly flow in association with the low pressure system over northwest bay of bengal mumbai and pune in maharashtra receives more rainfall than karnataka and kerala during the seventh decade 2011 2020 the intensity of the maximum rainfall gets decreased over central india while the entire gujarat and western ghats showed an increase in maximum rainfall hotspots fig 2g fig 2h demonstrates the trend distribution of maximum rainfall during the whole investigation period 1951 2020 during monsoon over the indian landmass figure exhibits a declining trend over the central indian region 2mm day 1 70 year 1 kerala 2 5 mm day 1 70 year 1 foothills of the himalayan region 2 3 mm day 1 70 year 1 and entire north east india particularly over the hilly regions of north east 3mm day 1 70 year 1 while an increasing trend over gujarat 2mm day 1 70 year 1 and western coasts of upper maharashtra 2 5 mm day 1 70 year 1 3 2 spatio temporal variability of the intense wet spell during last seven decades there is a robust spatio temporal inhomogeneity of monsoon extreme rainfall since heavy rainfall values have regional as well as seasonal variability generally it is recognized that for the consideration of a rainfall event to be extreme it should relate the following two contexts a when it exceeds a certain threshold that has a certain associated impact i e a fixed threshold or 2 due to its rarity i e a percentile based threshold the rarity of occurrence tends to takes the form of upper 90th 95th and 99th percentile of rainfall they are the measures of the contribution of extreme rainfall events in a year fig 3 a g shows the spatial distribution of the 95th percentile of the decadal monsoon rainfall during last seven decades 1951 2020 the distributions of extreme values are similar to the daily maximum rainfall in terms of spatial characteristics but show larger differences in magnitude another distinctive feature of extreme event is the shapes of right tails in the rainfall for june september in the observed datasets by imd this is illustrated by the differences between the 99th and the 90th percentile values fig 4 a g shows the spatial variability of the difference between the 99th and 90th percentiles of the decadal monsoon rainfall the 95th percentile of the monsoon rainfall spatial trend distribution and the difference between right tail distribution of 99th and 90th percentile of monsoon rainfall for the whole investigation period 1951 2020 can be obtained from fig 3h and 4 h respectively the heavy orographic rainfall zones over the west coast of india and hilly region of north east india can be clearly depicted from fig 3 a g and 4 a g respectively this may be due to the low pressure systems that form over the northern bay of bengal and transport moisture over these regions singh et al 2021 the expanding pattern of extreme rainfall events in the most recent seven decades may be directly linked with the rise in sea surface temperatures sst and the surface latent heat flux over the tropical indian ocean and bay of bengal chakraborty et al 2015 saha et al 2014 2017 fig 4 a g indicates that western parts of india through central india up to northeast india with differences in the 70 90 mm day 1 range the range of extreme value is narrow where the difference between 99th and the 90th percentile values is considerably less compared to other regions of indian landmass it is indicative from the figures that the spread of intense rainfall over the central indian region western madhya pradesh and eastern orissa chattisgarh is increasing while the mid regions central madhya pradesh shows decreasing intensity the trend distribution of 95th percentile of monsoon rainfall fig 3h shows similar patterns as that of maximum rainfall occurrences shown in fig 2h but show larger differences in trend magnitude fig 3h exhibits a declining trend over the central indian region 4mm day 1 70 year 1 kerala 6 mm day 1 70 year 1 foothills of the himalayan region 8mm day 1 70 year 1 and entire north east india particularly over the hilly regions of north east 8mm day 1 70 year 1 while an increasing trend over gujarat 7mm day 1 70 year 1 and western coasts of upper maharashtra 8 mm day 1 70 year 1 fig 4h exhibits increasing trend 8mm day 1 70 year 1 of the differences of shapes of right tail distribution over central indian region gujarat western coasts of upper maharashtra uttarakhand and gangetic west bengal while a declining trend over uttar pradesh region and entire north east india particularly over the hilly regions of north east 8mm day 1 70 year 1 despite several studies mukherjee et al 2018 paul et al 2018 nikumbh et al 2019 singh et al 2021 which indicates increased spatial variability of intense rainfall events over the sub continent figs 3h 4h suggest a homogeneous spatial extent of the increasing trend in extreme rainfall across a large area over central india from the west coast of gujarat maharashtra to the east coast of odisha 3 3 spatial trends for different categories of extreme rainfall in terms of amount and count fig 5 shows the spatial trend distribution of the amount and counts of heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall during june september of 1951 2020 over the indian landmass the heavy rainfall hr amount depicts a declining trend over the foothills of the himalayas 5 7 mm declination in the entire uttar pradesh chattisgarh eastern maharashtra and northern states of india northern coasts of kerala 14 21 mm decrease and hilly regions of the north east india adjoining itanagar of arunachal pradesh where hr amount has decreased with more than 21 mm in the entire study period fig 5a the hr amount has increased over orissa 7 14 mm increase parts of western madhya pradesh and gujarat 5 7 mm increase meghalaya including shillong 21 mm increase and western coasts of maharashtra and goa including mumbai and panaji 18 21 mm increase fig 5b indicates the trend of very heavy rainfall vhr amount which shows the declining trend over the hilly regions of north east india and northern coasts of kerala 21 mm decrease similar to the hr amount but overall the trend of vhr amount is increasing over central india 5 7 mm increase parts of bihar 5 mm increase gujarat 5 7 mm increase assam and meghalaya 21 mm increase and upper portions of the western ghats including mumbai and goa 14 21 mm increase jena et al 2014 reported that there were five severe floods over the mahanadi basin in the east of central india since 2001 till 2014 in the recent past the trends in ehr amount during the last 70 years showed an increasing trend over shillong in meghalaya hilly regions of north east parts of orissa gujarat and madhya pradesh 18 21 mm increase mumbai in maharashtra with an increase of 7 14 mm of ehr fig 5c previously roxy et al 2017 in a study have claimed a threefold rise in the widespread extreme rainfall events over central india during 1951 2015 they have reported that the frequency of extreme rainfall rainfall 150 mm day 1 have increased up to 10 30 over the central india of the sub continent over a 66 year period but no such investigations have been made so far regarding the spatial trends of different extreme rainfall categories i e hr vhr and ehr over the indian sub continent fig 5 d f decipher the spatial trends of the frequency or count of all these three extreme rainfall categories the trend of hr count is very similar to the trend picture of the spatial trend distribution of the 95th percentile of the monsoon rainfall over central indian region orissa chattisgarh and parts of madhya pradesh the hr counts increased by 42 63 in counts while over uttar pradesh kerala and hilly regions of the north east india it has been obtained a decrease in 42 63 hr counts fig 5d the trend of vhr count is in agreement with the findings of roxy et al 2017 where the count of very heavy rainfall events are widely increasing over central indian region fig 5e with an increase of 28 42 events during the entire study period this may be due to the low level monsoon westerlies over the northern arabian sea exhibit increasing variability driving surges of moisture supply and leads to extreme rainfall episodes across the entire central subcontinent roxy et al 2017 northern coats of kerala and hilly regions of the north east india however showed a declination of more than 42 vhr events in 70 years however the ehr counts have been increased over meghalaya sub himalayan west bengal parts of orissa and south west chattisgarh central madhya pradesh western gujarat and western coasts of maharashtra including mumbai region with 14 21 ehr events increase during 1951 2020 fig 5f table 1 depicts the statistical values of the mann kendall s trend test for different stations as indicated in fig 1 having different extreme categories of rainfall 4 inter annual and decadal variability of the extreme rainfall inter annual variability of extreme rainfall can directly or indirectly affect many hydrological ecological and biogeochemical processes that in turn influence climate many of the earth processes are affected or governed by the inter annual variability of extreme rainfall which leads disorder not only in agricultural aspects and establishment of biogeochemistry dynamics but also in the socio economic loss to the environment therefore a more detailed investigation addressing these issues is still warranted point scale rainfall on earth surface is extremely non homogeneous in nature and this basically avoids problems related to the interpolation of rainfall data on grids dai et al 1997 xie and arkin 1997 chen et al 2002 mitchell and jones 2005 ensor and robeson 2008 mondal and mujumdar 2015 ism rainfall exhibits considerable inter annual variability thus the extreme rainfall puts serious strain on the indian economy therefore a study of excessive and deficient rainfall becomes extremely important in view of this an attempt is made in this section of the study to identify the years as well as the decades of devastating extreme rainfall based on the rainfall classification as mentioned in section 3 3 above on the basis of daily maximum rainfall the western ghats central india north east india and eastern ghats are more susceptible to extreme rainfall zones over the indian landmass we have chosen these four zones based on the spatial variability of the observed maximum rainfall fig 2a g and trend distribution of heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall fig 5 during monsoon season over the last seven decades 1951 2020 singh et al 2015 also reported that strong anomalies of rainfall both positive and negative are located in the western ghats central india north east india and extreme north for both excess and deficit years fig s1 a d shows the daily summer monsoon rainfall time series highlighting heavy rainfall 64 5 mm day 1 very heavy rainfall 115 6 mm day 1 and extremely heavy rainfall 204 5 mm day 1 respectively during 1951 2020 area maximum over central india 18 25 n 74 81 e eastern ghats 10 22 n 78 85 e western ghats 10 22 n 72 76 e and north east india 23 28 n 88 97 e the figure is self explanatory and readers may obtain information regarding the number of excessive and deficient rainfall years over these extreme rainfall zones of the indian landmass it is hereby obtained that the extreme rainfall occurrences are increasing over the central india after 1991 till 2008 and decreasing thereafter fig s1a western ghats gradually after 1981 till 2006 and decreasing thereafter fig s1b eastern ghats after 1981 till 2005 and decreasing thereafter fig s1c and north east india until 1981 and decreasing thereafter fig s1d fig s2 depicts the decadal variability of the area maximum counts of hr vhr and ehr over central india eastern ghats western ghats and north east india respectively for the figure of hr count it can be obtained that western ghats experiences more than 200 times of heavy rainfall occurrences in the first 1951 1960 fourth 1981 1990 and fifth 1991 2000 decades while north east india receives more than 150 times of hr count in the fourth decade only central india and eastern ghats experiences almost same count 50 times in the fourth and fifth decades respectively fig s2a for vhr count it can be found that both western ghats and north east india are susceptible to the very heavy rainfall counts fig s2b western ghats touches 140 vhr count in the second 1961 1970 decade which is highest in all of the other decades while north east india crosses 120 counts of vhr in the fourth decade central india and eastern ghats experiences more than 20 times of vhr count in almost all the decades except the seventh 2011 2020 decade where it goes below 20 times the count of very heavy rainfall intensity for ehr count it can be obtained that north east india is more susceptible than any other regions during third to seventh decades although the ehr count gets decreased from 110 fourth decade to below 80 seventh decade while western ghats in the fifth decade merely crosses 40 and thereafter decreases in the subsequent decades fig s2c counts of ehr over central india and eastern ghats are far less than north east india and western ghats in all the decades the west coast of india and the north northeast are both regions that are characterized by steep orography with favourable monsoon pattern thus the extreme rainfall that occurs in these regions are often a result of forced ascent over the mountains however there may be a change in intensity or genesis of monsoon low pressure systems over the indian sub continent which is investigated and detailed in the subsequent section to find out the reason of changes in extreme rainfall occurrences in these sub regions 5 characteristics of monsoon low pressure system lps over india during 1951 2020 the main rain bearing systems during south west indian summer monsoon period june september are the synoptic scale tropical disturbances or the monsoon trough imd have classified these systems as lows depressions cyclonic storms severe cyclonic storms and hurricanes based on surface winds circulating around the systems saha et al 1981 raghavan and rajesh 2003 krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 in our study we will mainly focus on the monsoon low pressure systems lps which typically develop over the head bay of bengal that consequently move north westwards and is more likely to induce heavy rainfall over central indian region leading to flood events some of the lpss also form over land and follow the same track as lps generated over head bay the lpss forming over bay of bengal and central indian land region move against the low level mean westerly winds krishnamurti et al 1975 krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 fig 6 indicates the inter annual variability of the frequency of lpss formed over the indian sub continent as a whole and central indian land region during monsoon period of 1951 2020 it can be confirmed from the figure that the lps generated over indian region are maximum during first 1951 1960 fifth 1991 2000 and sixth 2001 2010 decade and have reached a maximum of 16 lpss in a monsoon season of the particular year same frequency pattern is followed for the central indian ci land region during 1951 2020 fig 6a fig 6b indicates the percentage contribution of ci land region in generating monsoon lpss over the total lpss formed over whole indian sub continent this figure shows that the percentage contribution of ci land region is on the rise till 1991 start of the fifth decade and contributes to almost 80 of the total lpss generated over the indian sub continent during monsoon from this fifth decade the percentage contribution of ci land region started declining and remained around 40 contribution to the total monsoon lpss over the sub continent this can also be reflected from the decadal maps of spatial distribution of monsoon lps genesis counts fig 7 it can be seen from the picture that on an average more than 10 lpss were formed in the monsoon season during 1951 2020 low pressure systems forming over the bay of bengal and central india follow a north westward direction with remarkable regularity which is in agreement with other studies viz krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 sørland and sorteberg 2015 vishnu et al 2020 and thomas et al 2021 monsoon lps are synoptic scale systems with organised deep convection around the centre of the low which are characterised by mesoscale features it can be qualitatively seen from fig 7 a g that the monsoon lps genesis density is gradually in a declining trend up to seventh decade 2011 2020 over the north west bay of bengal lat 21 n 25 n lon 85 e 88 e during the various stages of the low different processes can be dominating for the lps dynamics as a result central india became dominant for extreme rainfall events during monsoon goswami et al 2006 sikka 2006 pattanaik and rajeevan 2010 fig 7h shows the longitudinal variability of the genesis of total monsoon lps counts during the last 70 years 1951 2020 it depicts that the genesis of monsoon lps is concentrated most over the north west bay of bengal where the total count crosses more than 1200 at 87 88 e longitude while the count is 700 at 80 85 e this is due to the fact that at least 10 16 lpss are generated at each grid point every year during monsoon which is accumulated to 700 1200 in 70 years now in connection with the increase in extreme rainfall over orissa part of ci land region fig 5e it can be commented that the rainfall over this region depends significantly on the frequency of lps forming over sea in north west bay and moves west north westerly direction along the monsoon trough but the extreme rainfall over ci are not always caused by lpss since it is evident that monsoon lpss are in a declining trend and percentage contribution of lpss over ci land is also in a decreasing trend as obtained in fig 6b thus it can be said that the extreme rainfall over the central indian region are not only synoptic disturbances driven but there must be some other factors which is contributing to the increase in extreme rainfall over the central indian region though barotropic dynamics always plays a significant role in the development of a monsoon low pressure system however baroclinic and conditional instability of second kind cisk dynamics remained a major energy source for the sustenance of an lps over the ci land region krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 reported that the extreme rainfall associated with organized convection during this monsoon is caused by the cyclonic vorticity allied with the initial instability and the latent heat accompanying with it results in tropospheric heating thus in addition to the dynamics the rise in extreme rainfall over central india may also be driven by the local thermodynamics after its sustenance over the region 6 role of thermodynamics behind the rise of extreme rainfall despite the role of dynamics in controlling the varying characteristics of rainfall extremes under warming scenario changes due to thermodynamics have also received tremendous attention in the present day research although the mechanisms for the rise of extreme rainfall are yet to be explored broadly the link between temperature and moisture with extreme rainfall over indian region have already been established and explained through clausius and clapeyron equation in previous researches goswami et al 2006 roxy et al 2017 saha et al 2017 saha et al 2020 the release of substantial amount of latent heat in the middle atmosphere during any extreme rainfall event would lead to an increase in middle atmospheric temperature o gorman and schneider 2009 however the changes in moist static energy in controlling the occurrences of extreme rainfall over indian region may open a new domain to explore moist static energy mse budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle since it is approximately conserved between hypothetical static states with zero kinetic energy before and after a dynamic event raymond 2000 fig 8 a d shows the vertical distribution of moist static energy release in the atmosphere during 1951 2020 over central india western ghats eastern ghats and north east india respectively it can be found from the picture that during monsoon the values of mse remain within the range of 342 351 kj kg from the surface to boundary layer for central india eastern ghats and north east india fig 8 a c d while the value is within 342 345 kj kg for western ghats region fig 8b the value of mse within 500 700 hpa pressure level remain within the range of 330 336 kj kg from the surface to boundary layer for central india eastern ghats and western ghats fig 8 a c while it is within 336 339 kj kg for north east india region fig 8d in the upper troposphere 300 hpa the values of mse are similar to the lower atmosphere over all the four regions of indian sub continent thus mse initially decreases with height reaches a minimum and then increases with height which is evident from fig 8 a d it may be due to that z increases more rapidly than decrease in q as stated in equation 1 in the data and methods section thus maximum convective instability in the monsoon season over indian sub continent prevails within the monsoon trough region and its neighbourhood more the mse more will be the incursion of moisture which will lead to the increase in low level moisture convergence over the region for the occurrences of extreme rainfall fig s3 represents the time series of moist static stability between 1000 and 700 hpa pressure levels respectively the black bold line indicates the all india mean mse and the red bold line indicates the region mean mse respectively fig s3a it can be obtained from the figure that the difference between mean over all india and central india region is minimum 1 kj kg and the mean of mse over central india is further less than the all india mean mse which signifies that the forcing due to mse in producing extreme rainfalls over central india is much effective the moist static stability over central india even reaches up to 14 kj kg in 2010 i e end of sixth decade this is because this moist static stability destabilizes the atmosphere in increasing the low level moisture convergence and hence extreme rainfall to occur although dynamics driven monsoon lps counts are decreasing over the land of central india while local thermodynamics driven moist static energy as well as moist static stability play a significant role in increasing the amount and count in extreme rainfall occurrences over this region fig s3b c indicates the moist static stability over western and eastern ghats respectively from both the figures it can be seen that the difference between all india mean mse and region mean mse is 2 kj kg and the values of moist static stability reaches up to 12 kj kg in some of the years of seven decades more the difference between the means of moist static stabilities less is the destabilization of the atmosphere through moist convection and vice versa fig s3d indicates the moist static stability over north east india although the difference between moist static stabilities is less 1 kj kg but the value is positive which indicates the region mean mse is more than the all india mean mse this will lead to lesser moist convections in the hilly regions of north east where the thermodynamics is slightly different than the other regions due to its high altitude thus in a nutshell despite monsoon lows the extreme rainfall over central india depends on the efficiency of thermodynamically driven moist convection as well as the low level moisture convergence 7 bias corrected cmip6 projected changes in the frequency of extreme rainfall occurrences climate models are one of the primary means to understand how the climate has changed in the past and may change in the future in this present analysis we mainly focus on the heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall distribution to examine projected changes in extreme rainfall occurrences for the near 21st century 2036 2060 and late 21st century 2075 2099 it has been recognized that in an ensemble mean model approach poorly selected models can degrade the overall signal of the ensemble mean to distinguish good and poor models from the 20 gcms listed in table 2 the taylor diagram is used on the basis of the composites of climatological mean field for monthly rainfall over the indian landmass on the taylor diagram each color symbol represents a model legend in the right side of the figure indicates the name of the cmip6 models it can be seen that almost all the models having correlation coefficient values between 0 4 and 0 6 hence we have identified those models for further analysis on the basis of whose correlation co efficient is greater than 0 52 as well as standard deviation near to observation values based on the above criteria 12 highly performing models bias corrected are selected the bias corrected good models include cmcc cm2 sr5 nesm3 miroc6 kiost esm mpi esm1 2 lr cesm2 waccm mpi esm1 2 hr gfdl esm4 noresm2 mm ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and inm cm5 0 out of 20 cmip6 models fig 9 in the rest of the paper the ensemble mean of gcms will be done considering only the above good models fig s4 indicates the annual rainfall biases computed in percentage between cmip6 models and observation during monsoon of 1951 2014 before the bias correction method applied on the models the bias has been calculated by estimating the difference between averages of yearly maximum values of rainfall data for both observation and each of the cmip6 model outputs in the first 12 models the annual bias is found to have almost zero values or slightly negative biases and have positive bias in the north western parts in some of the cases which is in accordance with the study of mishra et al 2020 fig s5 deciphers the same figure as fig s4 but after the bias correction method applied on cmip6 models this is drawn in order to find out the efficiencies and uncertainties within the models selected for further future projections fig s5 the figure suggests that almost all the models have shown similar bias characteristics over the indian region having almost zero bias values which depicts that bias correction is successful now in order to investigate the reliability of bias correction in the multi model ensemble mme mean bias in the mean annual rainfall for the historical period 1990 2014 has been plotted over the study region before and after the bias correction method applied to the 12 best gcms of cmip6 fig 10 as deciphered from the modified taylor diagram fig 9 fig 10a shows a wet bias 40 60 in the entire north west and coastal parts of western ghats region while a dry bias 80 in the entire peninsular india region and rest of the indian sub continent is having zero or significantly less wet dry bias before the bias correction method applied for the mme mean rainfall of 12 best gcms the reduction in bias in the mme mean rainfall as can be seen in fig 10b shows the effectiveness of our bias correction approach based on eqm in this present study we have mainly focussed on the changes in the frequencies of hr vhr and ehr during near 21st century as well as late 21st century for three different ssp scenarios fig 11 a c represents the changes in the counts of hr events in the scenarios of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively as calculated from the bias corrected mme during june september for 2036 2060 near 21st century over the indian landmass there is similarity in the patterns of hr counts over all the places marked in the figure among all the three scenarios from the bias corrected multi model gcm ensemble mean w r t the bias corrected historical simulation only exception is the magnitudes projected in ssp5 8 5 scenario is of higher range the frequency of hr is increasing by almost 2 4 counts yr 1 over itanagar and shillong in the north east india bhubaneswar in the eastern coasts raipur in the east central india 4 6 counts yr 1 in mumbai pune and panaji in the western coasts of india in ssp1 2 6 scenario which is considered to be good scenario fig 11a however the magnitude in ssp5 8 5 scenario considered as worst scenario is much higher hyderabad in the east dehradun in the north and bhopal in the central joins the list of susceptible places for increasing hr count in this worst scenario apart from the places mentioned for ssp1 2 6 scenario fig 11c the hr count over gangtok was decreasing in ssp1 2 6 scenario drop by 4 6 counts yr 1 while it shows an increasing trend in the ssp5 8 5 scenario rise by 2 counts yr 1 ssp2 4 5 may be much more realistic since it is considered as the mean of both the good and worst scenarios hence the most susceptible places for increasing hr count in the near 21st century may be listed as mumbai pune panaji in the western coasts of india western ghats itanagar and shillong in the north east india where the counts are increased by 4 6 events yr 1 while bhubaneswar and hyderabad in the east and bhopal in central india will be experiencing an increase of 2 heavy rainfall events yr 1 in ssp2 4 5 scenario fig 11b fig 11 d f represents the changes in the counts of vhr events in the scenarios of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively during june september for 2036 2060 near 21st century over the indian landmass in the ssp1 2 6 scenario it has been seen that bhopal in the central mumbai pune and panaji in the western coasts are the hotspots for the rise of 3 vhr events yr 1 in near 21st century fig 11d while in ssp5 8 5 scenario vhr events are increasing by more than 4 events yr 1 in maharashtra in the west and meghalaya in the north east india fig 11f but in ssp2 4 5 scenario fig 11e vhr events are increasing over mumbai pune panaji in the western coasts shillong meghalaya mizoram and tripura in the north east india 3 4 events yr 1 increasing from fig 11e it is also obtained that vhr events are decreasing by 1 event yr 1 over jharkhand bihar and bhubaneswar in orissa fig 11 g i represents the changes in the counts of ehr events in the scenarios of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively during june september for 2036 2060 near 21st century over the indian landmass fig 11g shows increasing patterns of ehr events by more than 2 counts yr 1 over mumbai and pune in ssp1 2 6 scenario whereas fig 11i shows increasing patterns of ehr events even far 2 counts yr 1 over the same place in ssp5 8 5 scenario mumbai pune and panaji in the western coasts are the primary hotspots of extremely heavy rainfall events where more than 2 events yr 1 will be increasing as projected by ssp2 4 5 scenario for the near 21st century fig 11h similar figure is obtained for the late 21st century 2075 2099 projections by ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios but with much higher counts w r t near 21st century counts fig 12 the figure is now self explanatory and here we will point out the hotspots for hr vhr and ehr counts projected by ssp2 4 5 scenario as it is considered as the mean of good and worst scenarios for hr counts bhubaneswar in the east mumbai and pune in the west hyderabad chattisgarh and raipur in the east are the places where 8 hr events yr 1 will be increasing in the late 21st century while for vhr and ehr counts special concentration will remain over mumbai pune and panaji in the west where the count will be increasing by 7 8 events yr 1 for vhr and more than 4 events yr 1 for ehr respectively fig 12 our results from the cmip6 gcm simulations confirm that the frequency of extreme rainfall events are on the rise under the warming scenario the projected increase in heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall counts over the indian landmass may have implications on mitigation strategies for proper infrastructure development and agriculture 8 summary and conclusions in order to investigate the cause of increased trend in extreme rainfall occurrences over the indian landmass during monsoon period in the past seven decades 1951 2020 the entanglement of dynamic as well as thermodynamic resources are analyzed on a large spatial and temporal scale the detection of possible changes in extreme climate events in terms of the frequency as well as intensity assumes profound importance on the local regional and national scales due to the associated critical socio economic consequences our analysis shows that the increased extreme events referred as extreme hotspots spreaded over a large region across the subcontinent more particularly over western coasts of upper maharashtra meghalaya in the north eastern india and gujarat in the west the central part of coastal orissa gets maximum rainfall due to basic westerly flow in association with the low pressure system over northwest bay of bengal there is an increasing trend of daily maximum rainfall over gujarat and western coasts of upper maharashtra while a declining trend over the central indian region kerala foothills of the himalayan region and entire north east india particularly over the hilly regions of north east similar patterns of distribution in extreme values of rainfall 95th percentile and right tail distribution or the rainfall pockets are obtained in terms of spatial characteristics but show larger differences in magnitude temporal distribution for the last 70 years suggests a homogeneous spatial extent of the increasing trend in extreme rainfall across a large area over central india from the west coast of gujarat maharashtra to the east coast of orissa one of the main theme of this study lies in the trend distribution of different categories of monsoon extreme rainfall events heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall during 1951 2020 over the sub continent and is being presented in open literature for the first time although previously roxy et al 2017 have shown the trend map of widespread extreme events keeping a threshold of rainfall greater than 150 mm day 1 but in this study each of the categories of extreme rainfall are calculated and is presented for temporal distribution over central indian region orissa chattisgarh and parts of madhya pradesh the hr counts increased by 42 63 in counts while over uttar pradesh kerala and hilly regions of the north east india it has been obtained a decrease in 42 63 hr counts the trend of vhr count region showed an increase of 28 42 events over central indian region during the entire study period northern coats of kerala and hilly regions of the north east india however showed a declination of more than 42 vhr events in the last 70 years however the ehr counts have been increased over meghalaya sub himalayan west bengal parts of orissa and south west chattisgarh central madhya pradesh western gujarat and western coasts of maharashtra including mumbai region with 14 21 ehr events increase during 1951 2020 decadal variability of the frequency of monsoon extremes suggests that both western ghats and north east india are susceptible to the hr and vhr counts while for ehr count north east india is found to be detrimental the west coast of india and the north northeast are both regions that are characterized by steep orography thus the extreme rainfall that occurs in these regions are often a result of forced ascent over the mountains to find out the reason for the rise of extreme rainfall events over the indian region particularly over central india we have investigated both dynamical as well as thermodynamical approach in terms of the genesis of monsoon lps and its movement towards the central indian land region and variations of moist static stability during the last 70 years respectively these monsoon lpss typically develop over the head bay of bengal move north westwards and is more likely to induce heavy rainfall event that can lead to severe flooding events over central indian region but the monsoon lps genesis density is found to be gradually declining starting from the first decade 1951 1960 to the seventh decade 2011 2020 over the north west bay of bengal thus it can be said that the extreme rainfall over the central indian region are not only synoptic disturbances driven the maximum convective instability in the monsoon season over indian sub continent prevails within the monsoon trough region and its neighbourhood hence more the thermodynamically driven mse more will be the incursion of moisture which will lead to the increase in low level moisture convergence over the region for the occurrences of extreme rainfall over central indian region from the moist static stability it is hereby confirmed that the forcing due to mse in producing extreme rainfalls over central india is much effective although dynamics driven monsoon lps counts are decreasing over the land of central india while local thermodynamics driven moist static energy as well as moist static stability play a significant role in increasing the amount and count in extreme rainfall occurrences over this region although climate projections are generally more reliable at the global scale than at smaller regional scales an effort has been made in this analysis to illustrate the uncertainty by using cmip6 based 12 best model outputs out of 20 gcms in generating climate projections for indian region this article provides the frequencies of monsoonal extreme rainfall episode heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall projections over indian landmass based on cmcc cm2 sr5 nesm3 miroc6 kiost esm mpi esm1 2 lr cesm2

2075 2099 late 21st century the most susceptible places for increasing hr count in the near 21st century may be listed as mumbai pune panaji in the western coasts of india western ghats itanagar and shillong in the north east india where the counts are increased by 4 6 events yr 1 while bhubaneswar and hyderabad in the east and bhopal in central india will be experiencing an increase of 2 4 heavy

event yr 1 over jharkhand bihar and bhubaneswar in orissa mumbai pune and panaji in the western coasts are the primary hotspots of extremely heavy rainfall events where more than 4 events will be increasing as projected by ssp2 4 5 scenario for the near 21st century and late 21st century relative to the 1990 2014 baselines the outcomes of this work provide a template for other climate service

3519,in this study we provide a comprehensive analysis to identify and quantify spatial patterns of heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall and their trends that have emerged during the last seven decades 1951 to 2020 of monsoon months june to september under warming scenario as well as to project these extreme rainfall counts during the near 2036 2060 and late 21st century 2075 2099 w r t historical period 1990 2014 using bias corrected coupled model intercomparison project 6 cmip6 multi model ensemble method on the basis of daily maximum rainfall occurrences the central india north east india western ghats and eastern ghats are found to be susceptible to extreme rainfall zones over the indian landmass the trend distribution during 1951 2020 suggests an increase of 42 63 heavy rainfall events over orissa chattisgarh and parts of madhya pradesh and a declination over uttar pradesh kerala and hilly regions of north east india our study suggests the causal theory for the rise of monsoon rainfall extremes in terms of both dynamics and local scale thermodynamics over the sub continent moreover the bias corrected dataset is developed using empirical quantile mapping eqm for historic and projected climate for the three scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 using output from 20 general circulation models gcms from cmip6 hence the bias corrected projections suggest that most susceptible places for increasing heavy rainfall extremes likely to be mumbai pune panaji in the western coasts of india western ghats itanagar and shillong in the north east india raipur and bhopal in the central india in near and late 21st century under all scenarios in a warming climate thus the bias corrected projections from cmip6 gcms can be used for hydroclimate impact assessment in indian region under the changing atmospheric circulation dynamics and warming induced by greenhouse gases keywords monsoon rainfall extremes long term trend low pressure systems moist static stability bias correction cmip6 projections 1 introduction hydroclimatic extremes can be typically defined as floods due to very intense rainfall and droughts resulting from the warming scenario of the global environment over recent decades these extremes have augmented in both frequencies and intensities followed by the natural climate disasters indian summer monsoon ism rainfall is one of the main ingredient for hydroclimate over india which contributes approximately 80 of the total annual rainfall during monsoon season june september only in the recent decades variability in ism rainfall has increased by a gradual weakening in the monsoon circulation and mean rainfall with a remarkable increase in extreme rainfall events goswami et al 2006 pattanaik and rajeevan 2010 ghosh et al 2012 2016 kulkarni 2012 singh et al 2014 roxy et al 2015 2017 krishnan et al 2016 mohan and rajeevan 2017 goswami et al 2006 illustrated significant increasing trends in the frequency and the magnitude of extreme rain events with significant decreasing trends in the frequency of moderate events over central india during the monsoon from 1951 to 2000 however krishnamurthy et al 2009 indicated that north and central sections of indian sub continent experience a declining trend in both frequency and intensity of extremes while coastal regions of peninsular india and the region immediately west of bangladesh have increasing trends after analysing the rainfall data for 1951 2003 moreover the variability and long term trends of extreme rainfall events over central india have also been investigated by rajeevan et al 2008 using 104 years 1901 2004 of high resolution daily gridded rainfall data and reported significant variabilities in inter annual and inter decadal changes in addition to a statistically significant long term trend in the frequency of extreme rainfall events sørland and sorteberg 2016 reported that the synoptic scale monsoon low pressure systems lps are the causal factors to proliferate extreme rainfall over central india these monsoon lps are sensitive to an increase in the temperature and moisture which becomes more energetic to bring high moisture to new regions causing extreme rainfall during the monsoon season it is evident that extreme rainfall can arise from two different scales of rain bearing systems synoptic scale 100 1000 km and meso scale 1 100 km therefore research on the meso scale dependence of daily extreme rainfall is limited this may be due to insufficient observational daily rainfall datasets as compared with monthly mean data with finer grid resolution over longer periods moreover the orographic features over the western as well as eastern coast and northeast india along with the movement of synoptic scale systems from the bay of bengal region to the central parts of india also contribute to heavy rainfall events over different parts of india soman and krishna kumar 1990 gadgil 2000 pattanaik 2007 thus understanding the impacts of dynamics and thermodynamics in a changing climate on the ism extremes and vagaries in spatio temporal patterns poses a key research challenge with significant implications on water resources and management policies archer et al 2010 turner and annamalai 2012 ghosh et al 2016 despite the large internal variability in certain parts of the globe the increase in rainfall extremes over indian landmass is evident due to a warming climate to both observations and climate model simulations ghosh et al 2012 mishra et al 2014 singh et al 2021 currently general circulation models gcms are effective to study global monsoon systems and numerous studies of future projections of ism rainfall using the outputs of coupled model intercomparison project cmip phase 5 have been carried out turner and slingo 2009 scoccimarro et al 2013 rajendran et al 2013 menon et al 2013 sooraj et al 2015 sharmila et al 2015 nath et al 2017 cmip6 represented the latest advancements in gcm development in phase 6 o neill et al 2016 riahi et al 2017 gusain et al 2020 provided an assessment of the improvements in climate model cm simulations for indicative characteristics representing complex dynamics of ism rainfall for period 1951 2005 both in cmip5 and cmip6 the capabilities of climate models in simulating the extremes have improved over time such that more accurate projections can be expected from the latest update of the models in cmip6 in recent days mishra et al 2020 utilized the bias corrected cmip6 projections to estimate the frequency of rainfall and temperature extremes for an administrative region state of uttar pradesh india and a river basin godavari india during near mid and end 21st century and reported higher frequencies for the far period than the near term climate therefore understanding and quantifying the magnitudes and frequencies of ism extreme rainfall events may help to identify the zones of high and low values of extreme rainfall events as well as its present and future changes is of immense importance to the society in the present study the spatio temporal variability of the climatic extremes mainly focussed on monsoon extreme rainfall occurrences over the indian landmass 6 n 39 n 66 e 100 e have been investigated during last seven decades 1951 2020 the probable causes behind the changes in extreme rainfall events over the eastern and western ghats as well as central and north east india are represented in order to investigate any gradual but significant changes in the regional climate scenario since the last seven decades with the aim to contribute in the improvement of the understanding in the rise of future extreme rainfall in terms of the intensities over the indian region this work utilizes the 12 best bias corrected gcm outputs as obtained from taylor diagram analysis out of 20 gcms used from cmip6 model simulations these bias corrected gcms will determine the future changes in terms of count of intense extreme rainfall occurrences associated with convective features during near 2036 2060 and late 21st century 2075 2099 over this indian landmass 2 data and methods the study utilizes the daily gridded rainfall dataset at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 pai et al 2014 from the national climate centre ncc of india meteorological department imd for monsoon june september period during 1951 2020 over the indian region the gridded dataset is constructed from a network of 6955 rain gauge stations spread across the indian landmass this high resolution data demonstrates that spatial distribution of rainfall over the eastern and western coasts as well as central and north east regions are more realistic due to high density of rainfall stations over these areas fig 1 shows the study domain with topography in the background based on the amount of accumulated rainfall in a day for extreme event studies imd has classified rainfall into three broad categories viz i heavy rainfall 64 5 r 115 5 mm ii very heavy rainfall 115 6 r 204 4 mm and iii extremely heavy rainfall r 204 5 mm and can be found in the website http imdsikkim gov in fct pdf last accessed on 5 july 2021 we have calculated these different extreme categories of rainfall from the daily gridded data of imd rainfall observations for the monsoon period of 1951 2020 over the whole indian landmass as well as over central india 18 25 n 74 81 e eastern ghats 10 22 n 78 85 e western ghats 10 22 n 72 76 e and north east india 23 28 n 88 97 e we have utilized the reliable meteorological gridded reanalysis datasets as a proxy of gridded observations for the climatic assessment over indian region in the present study the datasets of air temperature t relative humidity rh specific humidity q geopotential height z zonal u and meridional components of wind v have been collected surface 1000 hpa to 300 hpa levels from the fifth generation reanalysis dataset produced by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf known as era5 at 0 25 lat 0 25 long grid interval era5 is a latest high resolution reanalysis data produced by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which provide several improvements compared to era interim hersbach et al 2019 hersbach et al 2020 moist static energy mse is conserved under moist adiabatic processes and under hydrostatic balance thus it is a useful quantity to understand moist convection under the standard approximation its specific value value per total air mass is defined by 1 mse c p t q v l g z where c p is the heat capacity of the dry air at constant pressure t the temperature q v the specific vapour value l latent heat of vaporization of liquid water g acceleration of the gravity z is the altitude the geopotential contribution gz is an approximation of g0z with g0 a reference value for the acceleration of gravity and z the geopotential height see neelin and held 1987 this variable is calculated using metpy1 0 tool in python 3 7 environment moist static stability has been calculated as indicated by krishnamurti and bhalme 1976 where the representative depth for its calculation is chosen to be 1000 hpa and 700 hpa since the minimum value of mse does occur near 700 hpa pressure level and is given by 2 γ m m s e 700 m s e 1000 where γ m is the moist static stability ms e 700 and ms e 1000 are the moist static energies at 700 hpa and 1000 hpa levels respectively the difference in the ambient and dew point temperature at any height of the atmosphere helps to quantify possible chances of instability to accelerate moisture parcel updraft for a convective process to mature temperature saturation deficit tsd as utilized in saha et al 2017 2020 is basically the difference between the environmental and dew point temperature 3 tsd t t d where t and t d are the ambient air temperature and dew point temperature at the surface respectively in order to decipher the variability of cyclonic low pressure systems lps the present study also comprises of the calculation of the monsoon lps over the indian sub continent according to the lps detection algorithm described by vishnu et al 2020 these monsoon lps typically form over the northern bay of bengal then propagate to the northwest over india during the subsequent several days godbole 1977 mooley 1973 sikka 1978 thomas et al 2021 the most recent reanalysis from ecmwf era5 is used for this study with horizontal grid 0 25 0 25 and hourly temporal resolution during june september from 1951 to 2020 to calculate the monsoon lps the variables used are mean sea level pressure mslp surface wind 10 m u and v wind surface geopotential orography land sea fraction and the 850 hpa horizontal and meridional wind and 850 hpa relative humidity an automated lagrangian pointwise feature tracker tempestextremes is used for extracting lps track information from the reanalyses ullrich and zarzycki 2017 the basic algorithm for the tempestextremes has been discussed elaborately in vishnu et al 2020 firstly we have calculated the streamfunction using global horizontal and meridional wind at 850 hpa pressure level using windspharm version 1 7 0 python package for 1951 2020 jjas period this package is widely used for performing computations on global wind fields in spherical geometry dawson 2016 it provides a high level interface for computations using spherical harmonics and is capable of computing streamfunction from the input vector wind in our case u 850 and v 850 wind secondly using detect nodes of tempestextremes 2 1 module the lps candidates are daily searched and identified and are dumped in an output file containing the candidates of lps for jjas of 1951 2020 according to the following criteria 1 search for lps candidates as minima in the streamfunction field 2 merge lps candidates within 5 3 output generated from streamfunction minima at the candidate point keeping sea level pressure minima within 3 degrees of the candidate point wind speed maxima within 3 degrees of candidate relative humidity averaged over the area within 3 degrees of candidate surface geopotential maximum within 2 degrees of candidate land sea ratio at candidate point and minimum sea level pressure location thirdly the lps candidates are stitched using stitch nodes of tempestextremes 2 1 module with the following criteria 1 with a maximum distance of 3 0 between in sequence candidates 2 with a minimum length of 30 time points ensures track lasts longer than 1 day in 24 hourly data 3 with a maximum gap size of 12 time points 24 h 4 with the surface geopotential maximum less than 8000 m2 s 2 for at least 24 time steps along the track 5 with the relative humidity higher than 85 for at least 24 time steps along the track 6 with the mean sea level pressure minimum less than 998 hpa for at least 24 time steps along the track finally the output generated from analysing the lps candidate files are then combined to a single netcdf data file for the generation of decadal spatial variability of the genesis of monsoon low pressure systems over the indian sub continent cmip6 o neill et al 2016 eyring et al 2016 riahi et al 2017 is the latest coordinated effort among international climate modeling groups to simulate past present and future climate to better understand the response of the climate system to human and natural perturbations to energy balance this cmip6 dataset is available at different horizontal resolutions climate projections are scenario dependent cmip6 has designed new scenarios called shared socioeconomic pathway ssp ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp4 6 0 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 reducing systematic bias in climate model simulations using statistical techniques is an indispensable tool in research applications one of the common tools used for correcting bias of climate model simulations is empirical quantile mapping eqm which maps between simulated and observed cumulative distribution functions cdfs which are empirically constructed based on data from a historical period hence prior to the analysis bias corrected model dataset for daily rainfall is developed using eqm mishra et al 2020 for historic 1951 2014 and projected climate near 2036 2060 and late 2075 2099 for the three scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 using output of 20 general circulation models gcms from cmip6 the detailed description for bias correction methodology can be obtained in mishra et al 2020 we used eqm for bias correction because of its simplicity however as pointed out in some recent studies wang and chen 2014 ganguli and coulibaly 2019 srivastava et al 2021 the eqm assumes that higher order statistics of a distribution such as variance and skewness remain stationary and only the mean changes this assumption may not hold in a non stationary climate all ssps in gcms are based on five narratives that describe alternative socioeconomic developments gidden et al 2019 the scenarios are almost similar to what used in cmip5 scenarios as representative concentration pathways for bias correction we used imd gridded daily rainfall observations and cmip6 model rainfall under r1i1p1f1 initial condition at daily time scale from the historical run 1951 2014 and future run as mentioned above initially all the cmip6 rainfall datasets were linearly interpolated to the observation grid resolution 0 25 0 25 before bias correction method applied we have applied the same technique as procured by mishra et al 2020 for bias correction utilizing eqm method now this bias corrected model data has been utilized thereafter for the future projection of the counts in monsoon extremes in near and late 21st century cmip6 historical simulation period adopted for bias correction of daily rainfall data for each and individual 20 models is of 63 years 1951 2014 this is due to the fact that data with high population will be more useful and relevant for correcting the bias in daily rainfall values than data of shorter time period but it should be kept in mind that 63 years of historical run is only utilized for the development of bias corrected model dataset and afterwards we will use the historical experiment run of 25 years 1990 2014 keeping the same time period length to that of near and late 21st century time range table 2 lists the indian region mean fractional changes in extreme rainfall for the cmip6 gcms in our ensemble the years 1990 2014 of the cmip6 historical experiment are used to represent the current climate while the years 2036 2060 and 2075 2099 of the future experiment ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios are used to represent the near and late 21st century climates respectively in considering simulated changes in the extreme rainfall occurrences over the 1990 2014 baseline period and future changes near 2036 2060 and late 2075 2099 the available subset of the gcms that contributed to the cmip6 website https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 archive was used for the present investigation the latest cmip6 gcms represents a substantial expansion over cmip5 in terms of the number of modelling groups participating the number of future scenarios examined and the number of different experiments conducted rainfall from each of 20 gcms over indian landmass is evaluated for the current climate 1990 2014 in order to select the best models by using the taylor diagram taylor 2001 the taylor diagram provides a concise statistical summary of the degree of correlation root mean square error and standard deviation ratio only best models selected through this analysis will be used to compute ensemble mean gcms we have selected 12 gcms out of a total of 20 models taken for study on the basis of whose correlation co efficient is greater than 0 52 as well as the normalized standard deviation for individual models closer to 1 0 i e observed reference these selected model outputs best capture the patterns of the observed extreme rainfall from the historical period 1990 2014 we have also calculated the different extreme rainfall categories heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall as mentioned above for these 12 gcm cmip6 outputs the projected future changes are calculated as the difference between the ensemble mean of the selected best gcm outputs during near 2036 2060 and late 21st century 2075 2099 of different ssp scenarios respectively to the ensemble mean of the historical experiment during 1990 2014 base period while climate model outputs from cmip6 and its predecessors have been widely used to project regional changes in hydrological cycles menon et al 2013 sharmila et al 2015 sanap et al 2015 jena et al 2016 akhter et al 2017 gupta et al 2020 gussain et al 2020 mishra et al 2020 this study is absolutely the first attempt to project near and late 21st century future projections in the counts of heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall over the indian sub continent 3 spatio temporal variability of the observed rainfall over indian sub continent this section will present the spatio temporal distribution and decadal variability of the daily gridded 0 25 0 25 observed rainfall from india meteorological department imd for the last seven decades 1951 2020 over the indian landmass the section also discuss the spatial variability of the rainfall intensity heavy very heavy and extremely heavy over the indian region 3 1 spatio temporal distribution of maximum rainfall occurrences in the last seven decades fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the seasonal maximum rainfall maps over a particular time period in this case each decade during monsoon june september over the indian sub continent the average monsoonal maximum rainfall for all the decades 1951 1960 1961 1970 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively are found to be concentrated over the north east india central india and western and eastern coasts with maximum amount to be greater than 400 mm day 1 fig 2a g it is to be noted that the distribution of rainfall is controlled by the relief features of the land and the direction of the rain bearing winds during monsoon season increase in extreme rain events spreaded over a large region across the subcontinent more particularly over western coasts of upper maharashtra meghalaya in the north eastern india and gujarat in the west for the first decade 1951 1960 maximum rainfall hotspots can be located over inlands of orissa orographic regions of the north east india sub himalayan west bengal and western coast of maharashtra goa and karnataka regions fig 2a likewise first decade similar spatial distribution of maximum rainfall continues to the second 1961 1970 decade while in the third decade 1971 1980 gangetic west bengal and upper gujarat as well as hotspots starts to be located over central india fig 2b c during fourth decade 1981 1990 there are numerous maximum rainfall hotspots over the central india western ghats parts of upper eastern ghats and spreaded over the foothills of the himalayan region fig 2d similar to the fourth decade the entire north east india and western coasts of india show similar type of rainfall hotspots in the fifth decade 1991 2000 while rainfall hotspots are slightly decreased over the central indian region fig 2e sixth decade 2001 2010 is particularly devastating over the central india western ghats and upper ranges of the eastern ghats fig 2f the variability in the synoptic disturbances which develop over the bay of bengal results in high moisture incursion causes a good amount of rainfall in the eastern ghats which extended up to the inland regions of india the central part of coastal orissa generally gets good rainfall due to basic westerly flow in association with the low pressure system over northwest bay of bengal mumbai and pune in maharashtra receives more rainfall than karnataka and kerala during the seventh decade 2011 2020 the intensity of the maximum rainfall gets decreased over central india while the entire gujarat and western ghats showed an increase in maximum rainfall hotspots fig 2g fig 2h demonstrates the trend distribution of maximum rainfall during the whole investigation period 1951 2020 during monsoon over the indian landmass figure exhibits a declining trend over the central indian region 2mm day 1 70 year 1 kerala 2 5 mm day 1 70 year 1 foothills of the himalayan region 2 3 mm day 1 70 year 1 and entire north east india particularly over the hilly regions of north east 3mm day 1 70 year 1 while an increasing trend over gujarat 2mm day 1 70 year 1 and western coasts of upper maharashtra 2 5 mm day 1 70 year 1 3 2 spatio temporal variability of the intense wet spell during last seven decades there is a robust spatio temporal inhomogeneity of monsoon extreme rainfall since heavy rainfall values have regional as well as seasonal variability generally it is recognized that for the consideration of a rainfall event to be extreme it should relate the following two contexts a when it exceeds a certain threshold that has a certain associated impact i e a fixed threshold or 2 due to its rarity i e a percentile based threshold the rarity of occurrence tends to takes the form of upper 90th 95th and 99th percentile of rainfall they are the measures of the contribution of extreme rainfall events in a year fig 3 a g shows the spatial distribution of the 95th percentile of the decadal monsoon rainfall during last seven decades 1951 2020 the distributions of extreme values are similar to the daily maximum rainfall in terms of spatial characteristics but show larger differences in magnitude another distinctive feature of extreme event is the shapes of right tails in the rainfall for june september in the observed datasets by imd this is illustrated by the differences between the 99th and the 90th percentile values fig 4 a g shows the spatial variability of the difference between the 99th and 90th percentiles of the decadal monsoon rainfall the 95th percentile of the monsoon rainfall spatial trend distribution and the difference between right tail distribution of 99th and 90th percentile of monsoon rainfall for the whole investigation period 1951 2020 can be obtained from fig 3h and 4 h respectively the heavy orographic rainfall zones over the west coast of india and hilly region of north east india can be clearly depicted from fig 3 a g and 4 a g respectively this may be due to the low pressure systems that form over the northern bay of bengal and transport moisture over these regions singh et al 2021 the expanding pattern of extreme rainfall events in the most recent seven decades may be directly linked with the rise in sea surface temperatures sst and the surface latent heat flux over the tropical indian ocean and bay of bengal chakraborty et al 2015 saha et al 2014 2017 fig 4 a g indicates that western parts of india through central india up to northeast india with differences in the 70 90 mm day 1 range the range of extreme value is narrow where the difference between 99th and the 90th percentile values is considerably less compared to other regions of indian landmass it is indicative from the figures that the spread of intense rainfall over the central indian region western madhya pradesh and eastern orissa chattisgarh is increasing while the mid regions central madhya pradesh shows decreasing intensity the trend distribution of 95th percentile of monsoon rainfall fig 3h shows similar patterns as that of maximum rainfall occurrences shown in fig 2h but show larger differences in trend magnitude fig 3h exhibits a declining trend over the central indian region 4mm day 1 70 year 1 kerala 6 mm day 1 70 year 1 foothills of the himalayan region 8mm day 1 70 year 1 and entire north east india particularly over the hilly regions of north east 8mm day 1 70 year 1 while an increasing trend over gujarat 7mm day 1 70 year 1 and western coasts of upper maharashtra 8 mm day 1 70 year 1 fig 4h exhibits increasing trend 8mm day 1 70 year 1 of the differences of shapes of right tail distribution over central indian region gujarat western coasts of upper maharashtra uttarakhand and gangetic west bengal while a declining trend over uttar pradesh region and entire north east india particularly over the hilly regions of north east 8mm day 1 70 year 1 despite several studies mukherjee et al 2018 paul et al 2018 nikumbh et al 2019 singh et al 2021 which indicates increased spatial variability of intense rainfall events over the sub continent figs 3h 4h suggest a homogeneous spatial extent of the increasing trend in extreme rainfall across a large area over central india from the west coast of gujarat maharashtra to the east coast of odisha 3 3 spatial trends for different categories of extreme rainfall in terms of amount and count fig 5 shows the spatial trend distribution of the amount and counts of heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall during june september of 1951 2020 over the indian landmass the heavy rainfall hr amount depicts a declining trend over the foothills of the himalayas 5 7 mm declination in the entire uttar pradesh chattisgarh eastern maharashtra and northern states of india northern coasts of kerala 14 21 mm decrease and hilly regions of the north east india adjoining itanagar of arunachal pradesh where hr amount has decreased with more than 21 mm in the entire study period fig 5a the hr amount has increased over orissa 7 14 mm increase parts of western madhya pradesh and gujarat 5 7 mm increase meghalaya including shillong 21 mm increase and western coasts of maharashtra and goa including mumbai and panaji 18 21 mm increase fig 5b indicates the trend of very heavy rainfall vhr amount which shows the declining trend over the hilly regions of north east india and northern coasts of kerala 21 mm decrease similar to the hr amount but overall the trend of vhr amount is increasing over central india 5 7 mm increase parts of bihar 5 mm increase gujarat 5 7 mm increase assam and meghalaya 21 mm increase and upper portions of the western ghats including mumbai and goa 14 21 mm increase jena et al 2014 reported that there were five severe floods over the mahanadi basin in the east of central india since 2001 till 2014 in the recent past the trends in ehr amount during the last 70 years showed an increasing trend over shillong in meghalaya hilly regions of north east parts of orissa gujarat and madhya pradesh 18 21 mm increase mumbai in maharashtra with an increase of 7 14 mm of ehr fig 5c previously roxy et al 2017 in a study have claimed a threefold rise in the widespread extreme rainfall events over central india during 1951 2015 they have reported that the frequency of extreme rainfall rainfall 150 mm day 1 have increased up to 10 30 over the central india of the sub continent over a 66 year period but no such investigations have been made so far regarding the spatial trends of different extreme rainfall categories i e hr vhr and ehr over the indian sub continent fig 5 d f decipher the spatial trends of the frequency or count of all these three extreme rainfall categories the trend of hr count is very similar to the trend picture of the spatial trend distribution of the 95th percentile of the monsoon rainfall over central indian region orissa chattisgarh and parts of madhya pradesh the hr counts increased by 42 63 in counts while over uttar pradesh kerala and hilly regions of the north east india it has been obtained a decrease in 42 63 hr counts fig 5d the trend of vhr count is in agreement with the findings of roxy et al 2017 where the count of very heavy rainfall events are widely increasing over central indian region fig 5e with an increase of 28 42 events during the entire study period this may be due to the low level monsoon westerlies over the northern arabian sea exhibit increasing variability driving surges of moisture supply and leads to extreme rainfall episodes across the entire central subcontinent roxy et al 2017 northern coats of kerala and hilly regions of the north east india however showed a declination of more than 42 vhr events in 70 years however the ehr counts have been increased over meghalaya sub himalayan west bengal parts of orissa and south west chattisgarh central madhya pradesh western gujarat and western coasts of maharashtra including mumbai region with 14 21 ehr events increase during 1951 2020 fig 5f table 1 depicts the statistical values of the mann kendall s trend test for different stations as indicated in fig 1 having different extreme categories of rainfall 4 inter annual and decadal variability of the extreme rainfall inter annual variability of extreme rainfall can directly or indirectly affect many hydrological ecological and biogeochemical processes that in turn influence climate many of the earth processes are affected or governed by the inter annual variability of extreme rainfall which leads disorder not only in agricultural aspects and establishment of biogeochemistry dynamics but also in the socio economic loss to the environment therefore a more detailed investigation addressing these issues is still warranted point scale rainfall on earth surface is extremely non homogeneous in nature and this basically avoids problems related to the interpolation of rainfall data on grids dai et al 1997 xie and arkin 1997 chen et al 2002 mitchell and jones 2005 ensor and robeson 2008 mondal and mujumdar 2015 ism rainfall exhibits considerable inter annual variability thus the extreme rainfall puts serious strain on the indian economy therefore a study of excessive and deficient rainfall becomes extremely important in view of this an attempt is made in this section of the study to identify the years as well as the decades of devastating extreme rainfall based on the rainfall classification as mentioned in section 3 3 above on the basis of daily maximum rainfall the western ghats central india north east india and eastern ghats are more susceptible to extreme rainfall zones over the indian landmass we have chosen these four zones based on the spatial variability of the observed maximum rainfall fig 2a g and trend distribution of heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall fig 5 during monsoon season over the last seven decades 1951 2020 singh et al 2015 also reported that strong anomalies of rainfall both positive and negative are located in the western ghats central india north east india and extreme north for both excess and deficit years fig s1 a d shows the daily summer monsoon rainfall time series highlighting heavy rainfall 64 5 mm day 1 very heavy rainfall 115 6 mm day 1 and extremely heavy rainfall 204 5 mm day 1 respectively during 1951 2020 area maximum over central india 18 25 n 74 81 e eastern ghats 10 22 n 78 85 e western ghats 10 22 n 72 76 e and north east india 23 28 n 88 97 e the figure is self explanatory and readers may obtain information regarding the number of excessive and deficient rainfall years over these extreme rainfall zones of the indian landmass it is hereby obtained that the extreme rainfall occurrences are increasing over the central india after 1991 till 2008 and decreasing thereafter fig s1a western ghats gradually after 1981 till 2006 and decreasing thereafter fig s1b eastern ghats after 1981 till 2005 and decreasing thereafter fig s1c and north east india until 1981 and decreasing thereafter fig s1d fig s2 depicts the decadal variability of the area maximum counts of hr vhr and ehr over central india eastern ghats western ghats and north east india respectively for the figure of hr count it can be obtained that western ghats experiences more than 200 times of heavy rainfall occurrences in the first 1951 1960 fourth 1981 1990 and fifth 1991 2000 decades while north east india receives more than 150 times of hr count in the fourth decade only central india and eastern ghats experiences almost same count 50 times in the fourth and fifth decades respectively fig s2a for vhr count it can be found that both western ghats and north east india are susceptible to the very heavy rainfall counts fig s2b western ghats touches 140 vhr count in the second 1961 1970 decade which is highest in all of the other decades while north east india crosses 120 counts of vhr in the fourth decade central india and eastern ghats experiences more than 20 times of vhr count in almost all the decades except the seventh 2011 2020 decade where it goes below 20 times the count of very heavy rainfall intensity for ehr count it can be obtained that north east india is more susceptible than any other regions during third to seventh decades although the ehr count gets decreased from 110 fourth decade to below 80 seventh decade while western ghats in the fifth decade merely crosses 40 and thereafter decreases in the subsequent decades fig s2c counts of ehr over central india and eastern ghats are far less than north east india and western ghats in all the decades the west coast of india and the north northeast are both regions that are characterized by steep orography with favourable monsoon pattern thus the extreme rainfall that occurs in these regions are often a result of forced ascent over the mountains however there may be a change in intensity or genesis of monsoon low pressure systems over the indian sub continent which is investigated and detailed in the subsequent section to find out the reason of changes in extreme rainfall occurrences in these sub regions 5 characteristics of monsoon low pressure system lps over india during 1951 2020 the main rain bearing systems during south west indian summer monsoon period june september are the synoptic scale tropical disturbances or the monsoon trough imd have classified these systems as lows depressions cyclonic storms severe cyclonic storms and hurricanes based on surface winds circulating around the systems saha et al 1981 raghavan and rajesh 2003 krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 in our study we will mainly focus on the monsoon low pressure systems lps which typically develop over the head bay of bengal that consequently move north westwards and is more likely to induce heavy rainfall over central indian region leading to flood events some of the lpss also form over land and follow the same track as lps generated over head bay the lpss forming over bay of bengal and central indian land region move against the low level mean westerly winds krishnamurti et al 1975 krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 fig 6 indicates the inter annual variability of the frequency of lpss formed over the indian sub continent as a whole and central indian land region during monsoon period of 1951 2020 it can be confirmed from the figure that the lps generated over indian region are maximum during first 1951 1960 fifth 1991 2000 and sixth 2001 2010 decade and have reached a maximum of 16 lpss in a monsoon season of the particular year same frequency pattern is followed for the central indian ci land region during 1951 2020 fig 6a fig 6b indicates the percentage contribution of ci land region in generating monsoon lpss over the total lpss formed over whole indian sub continent this figure shows that the percentage contribution of ci land region is on the rise till 1991 start of the fifth decade and contributes to almost 80 of the total lpss generated over the indian sub continent during monsoon from this fifth decade the percentage contribution of ci land region started declining and remained around 40 contribution to the total monsoon lpss over the sub continent this can also be reflected from the decadal maps of spatial distribution of monsoon lps genesis counts fig 7 it can be seen from the picture that on an average more than 10 lpss were formed in the monsoon season during 1951 2020 low pressure systems forming over the bay of bengal and central india follow a north westward direction with remarkable regularity which is in agreement with other studies viz krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 sørland and sorteberg 2015 vishnu et al 2020 and thomas et al 2021 monsoon lps are synoptic scale systems with organised deep convection around the centre of the low which are characterised by mesoscale features it can be qualitatively seen from fig 7 a g that the monsoon lps genesis density is gradually in a declining trend up to seventh decade 2011 2020 over the north west bay of bengal lat 21 n 25 n lon 85 e 88 e during the various stages of the low different processes can be dominating for the lps dynamics as a result central india became dominant for extreme rainfall events during monsoon goswami et al 2006 sikka 2006 pattanaik and rajeevan 2010 fig 7h shows the longitudinal variability of the genesis of total monsoon lps counts during the last 70 years 1951 2020 it depicts that the genesis of monsoon lps is concentrated most over the north west bay of bengal where the total count crosses more than 1200 at 87 88 e longitude while the count is 700 at 80 85 e this is due to the fact that at least 10 16 lpss are generated at each grid point every year during monsoon which is accumulated to 700 1200 in 70 years now in connection with the increase in extreme rainfall over orissa part of ci land region fig 5e it can be commented that the rainfall over this region depends significantly on the frequency of lps forming over sea in north west bay and moves west north westerly direction along the monsoon trough but the extreme rainfall over ci are not always caused by lpss since it is evident that monsoon lpss are in a declining trend and percentage contribution of lpss over ci land is also in a decreasing trend as obtained in fig 6b thus it can be said that the extreme rainfall over the central indian region are not only synoptic disturbances driven but there must be some other factors which is contributing to the increase in extreme rainfall over the central indian region though barotropic dynamics always plays a significant role in the development of a monsoon low pressure system however baroclinic and conditional instability of second kind cisk dynamics remained a major energy source for the sustenance of an lps over the ci land region krishnamurthy and ajayamohan 2010 reported that the extreme rainfall associated with organized convection during this monsoon is caused by the cyclonic vorticity allied with the initial instability and the latent heat accompanying with it results in tropospheric heating thus in addition to the dynamics the rise in extreme rainfall over central india may also be driven by the local thermodynamics after its sustenance over the region 6 role of thermodynamics behind the rise of extreme rainfall despite the role of dynamics in controlling the varying characteristics of rainfall extremes under warming scenario changes due to thermodynamics have also received tremendous attention in the present day research although the mechanisms for the rise of extreme rainfall are yet to be explored broadly the link between temperature and moisture with extreme rainfall over indian region have already been established and explained through clausius and clapeyron equation in previous researches goswami et al 2006 roxy et al 2017 saha et al 2017 saha et al 2020 the release of substantial amount of latent heat in the middle atmosphere during any extreme rainfall event would lead to an increase in middle atmospheric temperature o gorman and schneider 2009 however the changes in moist static energy in controlling the occurrences of extreme rainfall over indian region may open a new domain to explore moist static energy mse budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle since it is approximately conserved between hypothetical static states with zero kinetic energy before and after a dynamic event raymond 2000 fig 8 a d shows the vertical distribution of moist static energy release in the atmosphere during 1951 2020 over central india western ghats eastern ghats and north east india respectively it can be found from the picture that during monsoon the values of mse remain within the range of 342 351 kj kg from the surface to boundary layer for central india eastern ghats and north east india fig 8 a c d while the value is within 342 345 kj kg for western ghats region fig 8b the value of mse within 500 700 hpa pressure level remain within the range of 330 336 kj kg from the surface to boundary layer for central india eastern ghats and western ghats fig 8 a c while it is within 336 339 kj kg for north east india region fig 8d in the upper troposphere 300 hpa the values of mse are similar to the lower atmosphere over all the four regions of indian sub continent thus mse initially decreases with height reaches a minimum and then increases with height which is evident from fig 8 a d it may be due to that z increases more rapidly than decrease in q as stated in equation 1 in the data and methods section thus maximum convective instability in the monsoon season over indian sub continent prevails within the monsoon trough region and its neighbourhood more the mse more will be the incursion of moisture which will lead to the increase in low level moisture convergence over the region for the occurrences of extreme rainfall fig s3 represents the time series of moist static stability between 1000 and 700 hpa pressure levels respectively the black bold line indicates the all india mean mse and the red bold line indicates the region mean mse respectively fig s3a it can be obtained from the figure that the difference between mean over all india and central india region is minimum 1 kj kg and the mean of mse over central india is further less than the all india mean mse which signifies that the forcing due to mse in producing extreme rainfalls over central india is much effective the moist static stability over central india even reaches up to 14 kj kg in 2010 i e end of sixth decade this is because this moist static stability destabilizes the atmosphere in increasing the low level moisture convergence and hence extreme rainfall to occur although dynamics driven monsoon lps counts are decreasing over the land of central india while local thermodynamics driven moist static energy as well as moist static stability play a significant role in increasing the amount and count in extreme rainfall occurrences over this region fig s3b c indicates the moist static stability over western and eastern ghats respectively from both the figures it can be seen that the difference between all india mean mse and region mean mse is 2 kj kg and the values of moist static stability reaches up to 12 kj kg in some of the years of seven decades more the difference between the means of moist static stabilities less is the destabilization of the atmosphere through moist convection and vice versa fig s3d indicates the moist static stability over north east india although the difference between moist static stabilities is less 1 kj kg but the value is positive which indicates the region mean mse is more than the all india mean mse this will lead to lesser moist convections in the hilly regions of north east where the thermodynamics is slightly different than the other regions due to its high altitude thus in a nutshell despite monsoon lows the extreme rainfall over central india depends on the efficiency of thermodynamically driven moist convection as well as the low level moisture convergence 7 bias corrected cmip6 projected changes in the frequency of extreme rainfall occurrences climate models are one of the primary means to understand how the climate has changed in the past and may change in the future in this present analysis we mainly focus on the heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall distribution to examine projected changes in extreme rainfall occurrences for the near 21st century 2036 2060 and late 21st century 2075 2099 it has been recognized that in an ensemble mean model approach poorly selected models can degrade the overall signal of the ensemble mean to distinguish good and poor models from the 20 gcms listed in table 2 the taylor diagram is used on the basis of the composites of climatological mean field for monthly rainfall over the indian landmass on the taylor diagram each color symbol represents a model legend in the right side of the figure indicates the name of the cmip6 models it can be seen that almost all the models having correlation coefficient values between 0 4 and 0 6 hence we have identified those models for further analysis on the basis of whose correlation co efficient is greater than 0 52 as well as standard deviation near to observation values based on the above criteria 12 highly performing models bias corrected are selected the bias corrected good models include cmcc cm2 sr5 nesm3 miroc6 kiost esm mpi esm1 2 lr cesm2 waccm mpi esm1 2 hr gfdl esm4 noresm2 mm ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and inm cm5 0 out of 20 cmip6 models fig 9 in the rest of the paper the ensemble mean of gcms will be done considering only the above good models fig s4 indicates the annual rainfall biases computed in percentage between cmip6 models and observation during monsoon of 1951 2014 before the bias correction method applied on the models the bias has been calculated by estimating the difference between averages of yearly maximum values of rainfall data for both observation and each of the cmip6 model outputs in the first 12 models the annual bias is found to have almost zero values or slightly negative biases and have positive bias in the north western parts in some of the cases which is in accordance with the study of mishra et al 2020 fig s5 deciphers the same figure as fig s4 but after the bias correction method applied on cmip6 models this is drawn in order to find out the efficiencies and uncertainties within the models selected for further future projections fig s5 the figure suggests that almost all the models have shown similar bias characteristics over the indian region having almost zero bias values which depicts that bias correction is successful now in order to investigate the reliability of bias correction in the multi model ensemble mme mean bias in the mean annual rainfall for the historical period 1990 2014 has been plotted over the study region before and after the bias correction method applied to the 12 best gcms of cmip6 fig 10 as deciphered from the modified taylor diagram fig 9 fig 10a shows a wet bias 40 60 in the entire north west and coastal parts of western ghats region while a dry bias 80 in the entire peninsular india region and rest of the indian sub continent is having zero or significantly less wet dry bias before the bias correction method applied for the mme mean rainfall of 12 best gcms the reduction in bias in the mme mean rainfall as can be seen in fig 10b shows the effectiveness of our bias correction approach based on eqm in this present study we have mainly focussed on the changes in the frequencies of hr vhr and ehr during near 21st century as well as late 21st century for three different ssp scenarios fig 11 a c represents the changes in the counts of hr events in the scenarios of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively as calculated from the bias corrected mme during june september for 2036 2060 near 21st century over the indian landmass there is similarity in the patterns of hr counts over all the places marked in the figure among all the three scenarios from the bias corrected multi model gcm ensemble mean w r t the bias corrected historical simulation only exception is the magnitudes projected in ssp5 8 5 scenario is of higher range the frequency of hr is increasing by almost 2 4 counts yr 1 over itanagar and shillong in the north east india bhubaneswar in the eastern coasts raipur in the east central india 4 6 counts yr 1 in mumbai pune and panaji in the western coasts of india in ssp1 2 6 scenario which is considered to be good scenario fig 11a however the magnitude in ssp5 8 5 scenario considered as worst scenario is much higher hyderabad in the east dehradun in the north and bhopal in the central joins the list of susceptible places for increasing hr count in this worst scenario apart from the places mentioned for ssp1 2 6 scenario fig 11c the hr count over gangtok was decreasing in ssp1 2 6 scenario drop by 4 6 counts yr 1 while it shows an increasing trend in the ssp5 8 5 scenario rise by 2 counts yr 1 ssp2 4 5 may be much more realistic since it is considered as the mean of both the good and worst scenarios hence the most susceptible places for increasing hr count in the near 21st century may be listed as mumbai pune panaji in the western coasts of india western ghats itanagar and shillong in the north east india where the counts are increased by 4 6 events yr 1 while bhubaneswar and hyderabad in the east and bhopal in central india will be experiencing an increase of 2 heavy rainfall events yr 1 in ssp2 4 5 scenario fig 11b fig 11 d f represents the changes in the counts of vhr events in the scenarios of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively during june september for 2036 2060 near 21st century over the indian landmass in the ssp1 2 6 scenario it has been seen that bhopal in the central mumbai pune and panaji in the western coasts are the hotspots for the rise of 3 vhr events yr 1 in near 21st century fig 11d while in ssp5 8 5 scenario vhr events are increasing by more than 4 events yr 1 in maharashtra in the west and meghalaya in the north east india fig 11f but in ssp2 4 5 scenario fig 11e vhr events are increasing over mumbai pune panaji in the western coasts shillong meghalaya mizoram and tripura in the north east india 3 4 events yr 1 increasing from fig 11e it is also obtained that vhr events are decreasing by 1 event yr 1 over jharkhand bihar and bhubaneswar in orissa fig 11 g i represents the changes in the counts of ehr events in the scenarios of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively during june september for 2036 2060 near 21st century over the indian landmass fig 11g shows increasing patterns of ehr events by more than 2 counts yr 1 over mumbai and pune in ssp1 2 6 scenario whereas fig 11i shows increasing patterns of ehr events even far 2 counts yr 1 over the same place in ssp5 8 5 scenario mumbai pune and panaji in the western coasts are the primary hotspots of extremely heavy rainfall events where more than 2 events yr 1 will be increasing as projected by ssp2 4 5 scenario for the near 21st century fig 11h similar figure is obtained for the late 21st century 2075 2099 projections by ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios but with much higher counts w r t near 21st century counts fig 12 the figure is now self explanatory and here we will point out the hotspots for hr vhr and ehr counts projected by ssp2 4 5 scenario as it is considered as the mean of good and worst scenarios for hr counts bhubaneswar in the east mumbai and pune in the west hyderabad chattisgarh and raipur in the east are the places where 8 hr events yr 1 will be increasing in the late 21st century while for vhr and ehr counts special concentration will remain over mumbai pune and panaji in the west where the count will be increasing by 7 8 events yr 1 for vhr and more than 4 events yr 1 for ehr respectively fig 12 our results from the cmip6 gcm simulations confirm that the frequency of extreme rainfall events are on the rise under the warming scenario the projected increase in heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall counts over the indian landmass may have implications on mitigation strategies for proper infrastructure development and agriculture 8 summary and conclusions in order to investigate the cause of increased trend in extreme rainfall occurrences over the indian landmass during monsoon period in the past seven decades 1951 2020 the entanglement of dynamic as well as thermodynamic resources are analyzed on a large spatial and temporal scale the detection of possible changes in extreme climate events in terms of the frequency as well as intensity assumes profound importance on the local regional and national scales due to the associated critical socio economic consequences our analysis shows that the increased extreme events referred as extreme hotspots spreaded over a large region across the subcontinent more particularly over western coasts of upper maharashtra meghalaya in the north eastern india and gujarat in the west the central part of coastal orissa gets maximum rainfall due to basic westerly flow in association with the low pressure system over northwest bay of bengal there is an increasing trend of daily maximum rainfall over gujarat and western coasts of upper maharashtra while a declining trend over the central indian region kerala foothills of the himalayan region and entire north east india particularly over the hilly regions of north east similar patterns of distribution in extreme values of rainfall 95th percentile and right tail distribution or the rainfall pockets are obtained in terms of spatial characteristics but show larger differences in magnitude temporal distribution for the last 70 years suggests a homogeneous spatial extent of the increasing trend in extreme rainfall across a large area over central india from the west coast of gujarat maharashtra to the east coast of orissa one of the main theme of this study lies in the trend distribution of different categories of monsoon extreme rainfall events heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall during 1951 2020 over the sub continent and is being presented in open literature for the first time although previously roxy et al 2017 have shown the trend map of widespread extreme events keeping a threshold of rainfall greater than 150 mm day 1 but in this study each of the categories of extreme rainfall are calculated and is presented for temporal distribution over central indian region orissa chattisgarh and parts of madhya pradesh the hr counts increased by 42 63 in counts while over uttar pradesh kerala and hilly regions of the north east india it has been obtained a decrease in 42 63 hr counts the trend of vhr count region showed an increase of 28 42 events over central indian region during the entire study period northern coats of kerala and hilly regions of the north east india however showed a declination of more than 42 vhr events in the last 70 years however the ehr counts have been increased over meghalaya sub himalayan west bengal parts of orissa and south west chattisgarh central madhya pradesh western gujarat and western coasts of maharashtra including mumbai region with 14 21 ehr events increase during 1951 2020 decadal variability of the frequency of monsoon extremes suggests that both western ghats and north east india are susceptible to the hr and vhr counts while for ehr count north east india is found to be detrimental the west coast of india and the north northeast are both regions that are characterized by steep orography thus the extreme rainfall that occurs in these regions are often a result of forced ascent over the mountains to find out the reason for the rise of extreme rainfall events over the indian region particularly over central india we have investigated both dynamical as well as thermodynamical approach in terms of the genesis of monsoon lps and its movement towards the central indian land region and variations of moist static stability during the last 70 years respectively these monsoon lpss typically develop over the head bay of bengal move north westwards and is more likely to induce heavy rainfall event that can lead to severe flooding events over central indian region but the monsoon lps genesis density is found to be gradually declining starting from the first decade 1951 1960 to the seventh decade 2011 2020 over the north west bay of bengal thus it can be said that the extreme rainfall over the central indian region are not only synoptic disturbances driven the maximum convective instability in the monsoon season over indian sub continent prevails within the monsoon trough region and its neighbourhood hence more the thermodynamically driven mse more will be the incursion of moisture which will lead to the increase in low level moisture convergence over the region for the occurrences of extreme rainfall over central indian region from the moist static stability it is hereby confirmed that the forcing due to mse in producing extreme rainfalls over central india is much effective although dynamics driven monsoon lps counts are decreasing over the land of central india while local thermodynamics driven moist static energy as well as moist static stability play a significant role in increasing the amount and count in extreme rainfall occurrences over this region although climate projections are generally more reliable at the global scale than at smaller regional scales an effort has been made in this analysis to illustrate the uncertainty by using cmip6 based 12 best model outputs out of 20 gcms in generating climate projections for indian region this article provides the frequencies of monsoonal extreme rainfall episode heavy very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall projections over indian landmass based on cmcc cm2 sr5 nesm3 miroc6 kiost esm mpi esm1 2 lr cesm2 waccm mpi esm1 2 hr gfdl esm4 noresm2 mm ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and inm cm5 0 model outputs for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively for the period 2036 2060 near 21st century and 2075 2099 late 21st century the most susceptible places for increasing hr count in the near 21st century may be listed as mumbai pune panaji in the western coasts of india western ghats itanagar and shillong in the north east india where the counts are increased by 4 6 events yr 1 while bhubaneswar and hyderabad in the east and bhopal in central india will be experiencing an increase of 2 4 heavy rainfall events yr 1 in ssp2 4 5 scenario vhr events are increasing over mumbai pune panaji in the western coasts shillong meghalaya mizoram and tripura in the north east india while decreasing by 1 event yr 1 over jharkhand bihar and bhubaneswar in orissa mumbai pune and panaji in the western coasts are the primary hotspots of extremely heavy rainfall events where more than 4 events will be increasing as projected by ssp2 4 5 scenario for the near 21st century and late 21st century relative to the 1990 2014 baselines the outcomes of this work provide a template for other climate service
