3335,the assessment of water travel time through the vadose zone is known to be critical for a proper estimation of the hydrologic response time of water bodies to evolutions in land use management and global changes in this study the hydraulic properties of fifteen samples displaying contrasted lithologies soil powdery limestone calcareous sand limestone rock and extracted from three cored boreholes drilled throughout the vadose zone of a vulnerable limestone aquifer were first determined in the laboratory three 23 m deep vadose zone profiles were then reconstituted with the hydrus 1d software for the numerical simulation of water flow and the estimation of the water travel time using unimodal and bimodal approaches the measured hydraulic properties meteorological and water table level data were used as input for a virtual bromide tracing experiment undertaken over a period of 55 years 1966 2020 the results showed that the experimental hydraulic properties of the samples were more accurately described with a dual porosity approach since the latter allowed a precise representation of the bimodal characteristic of most of the samples the water flow and travel time simulated using unimodal or bimodal models for describing the vadose zone hydraulic properties were largely different the impact of the vadose zone lateral heterogeneities on the simulated water flow and the estimated travel time was relatively limited compared to the influence of the vadose zone vertical heterogeneities and meteorological conditions the mean travel time of the first concentration peak concentration and last concentration of bromide simulated with the bimodal model at the maximum water table level of the aquifer was 13 8 20 9 and 31 5 years respectively increase in travel time was clearly identified since the late 1970s and could be a consequence of global warming these results also pointed out the need for conducting extensive studies at larger scales to take into account

years gaillardet et al 2018 guo and lin 2016 zacharias et al 2011 stimulated by societal challenges like the prediction of natural hazards carbon storage or water resources management these observatories are dedicated to deciphering the complex hydrological and biogeochemical processes which occur at various temporal and spatial scales in the cz bogena et al 2018 brantley et al 2018 galle et al 2018 jensen and refsgaard 2018 li et al 2018 molénat et al 2018 o geen et al 2018 pisinaras et al 2018 seyfried et al 2018 the vadose zone vz which extends from the soil surface down to the aquifer is considered as a key component of the cz and is of major importance in the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles consequently an increasing body of work aims at improving the knowledge of the vz functioning which includes numerous complex and coupled physical geochemical and microbial processes aldana et al 2021 arora et al 2019 vereecken et al 2016 this constitutes a fundamental milestone for a proper assessment of groundwater recharge and in managing contamination issues for the preservation of aquifers this is especially true since the increasing use of groundwater resources worldwide and the degradation of the quality of the water resources caused by intensive agriculture have led to the enforcement of several stringent regulatory measures in several countries geared towards achieving a good chemical status for all water bodies in years ahead vero et al 2017 in this context the estimation of the water travel time through the vz is crucial as it constitutes an important component of the total time lag defining the inherent hydrologic response delay of water bodies to a change in land management practices this response time is often conceptualized as consisting in both a vertical within the vz and a lateral within the saturated zone component sousa et al 2013 the knowledge of the water travel time through the vz is considered as a prerequisite for quantifying the recharge rate and the time of migration of contaminants from the soil surface down to the aquifer mattern and vanclooster 2010 however the water travel time in the vz is known to be highly variable in space and time its quantification is recognized as highly complex and influenced by several factors including the size and geometry of the vz the properties of the vz materials the physical chemical and biological processes governing water flow and solute transport within the vz and the pattern of the meteorological inputs jeong et al 2017 leij and van genuchten 2002 sousa et al 2013 sprenger et al 2016 vero et al 2014 numerous experimental methods are currently used to estimate the water travel time through the vz such as lysimeters mainly focused on the soil or field experiments using radioactive or stable isotopes chloride nitrate bromide or fluorobenzoate as tracers asadollahi et al 2020 chen et al 2019 ju et al 2020 sprenger et al 2016 turkeltaub et al 2018 however these experimental approaches are known to be fairly expensive labor intensive time consuming and may also have limited predictive capacity as a consequence numerical models are being increasingly used for the study of water flow solute transport and travel time assessments within the vz bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 konikow 2011 schoups et al 2008 szymkiewicz et al 2019 vero et al 2014 these models need an estimation of the vz hydrodynamic parameters and may partly rely on pedotransfer functions patil and singh 2016 schaap et al 2001 szymkiewicz et al 2018 vereecken et al 2010 vero et al 2017 zhang and schaap 2019 some authors used inverse modeling approaches based on transient measurements of water content matric head and tracer content in the vz haws et al 2005 jacques et al 2002 sprenger et al 2016 2015 varvaris et al 2021a b however hydraulic data acquisition is mostly focused on the soil compartment and the numerical simulations run for the estimation of the travel time are often limited to the use of a unimodal approach relying notably on the mualem van genuchten model to describe the vz hydraulic properties van genuchten 1980 the main objective of this work was to provide a new methodological approach for the study of the water flow and the estimation of the water travel time at the scale of a highly heterogeneous vz to this end the hydraulic properties water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves of fifteen samples taken from three cored boreholes and representative of the lithologies soil powdery limestone calcareous sand limestone rock encountered within the vz of a vulnerable limestone aquifer beauce france were first determined in the laboratory these experimental data were then used for the parameterization of analytical models describing the measured hydraulic properties using single unimodal and dual porosity bimodal approaches the travel time within the vz has been estimated by means of a virtual bromide tracing experiment performed over a period of 55 years using the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2016 the appearance of the initial breakthrough the peak concentration and the total exit of the tracer at the maximum water table level of the aquifer were considered as indicators of the water travel time the impact of the choice of the analytical model used to describe the experimental hydraulic properties the vertical and lateral heterogeneity of the vz and the meteorological conditions on the simulation of the water flow and travel time through the vz has been explored 2 materials methods 2 1 the beauce limestone aquifer the multi layered beauce limestone aquifer is located in the center of france and extends over 9700 km2 de frutos cachorro et al 2017 it is mainly composed of limestones from upper oligocene to lower miocene but also consists in clay marl powdery limestone calcareous sand or chalk facies depending on the location this mostly unconfined aquifer is spread between the seine northeast and the loire southwest rivers and constitutes one of the largest groundwater reservoirs in france with an average water stock of 20 billion m3 and high inter annual variations le coz 2000 the beauce represents the main cereal producing region in europe graveline 2020 its land use consists essentially in agriculture 74 50 of which is irrigated indeed the region is one of the driest in france with an annual average precipitation of 600 mm lejars et al 2012 this results in an intense irrigated farming of between 120000 and 240000 ha that withdraws from the groundwater resource between 150 and 450 million m3 of water per year graveline 2020 the sensitivity of the water resource to natural recharge and the observation of an overall lowering of the water table level since the early 1990s have led to the implementation of several local water policy measures to control water withdrawals in connection with the french water law légifrance 1992 which is now the translation of the european water framework directive european commission 2000 over the past decades the beauce intensive agriculture has also impacted the groundwater quality with nitrates and pesticides notably atrazine and bentazon whose concentrations still exceed regulatory limits ddt 2016 despite government policies and regulatory measures that have been put into effect since the early 1990s european commission 2009 1991 2 2 location sampling and description of the vz materials the experimental site is located at villamblain 30 km northwest of orléans france dms coordinates x 48 1 5 131 y 1 34 55 333 three cored boreholes b1 b2 and b3 separated by a maximum distance of 10 8 m from each other fig 1 have been drilled in march 2017 from 0 to 20 m deep the soil formation 0 0 1 5 m deep was drilled by hydraulic percussion while the other vz materials 1 5 20 0 m deep were taken by rotary drilling with a three annular compartments corer to avoid sample contamination by the drilling fluid water as stated by aldana et al 2021 compaction caused by hydraulic percussion led to unreliable hydraulic properties data for the soil samples consequently additional soil samples were collected manually from the ground surface after digging a pit at a few meters from the three boreholes fig 1 and down to a depth of 1 m the vz lithologies were described based on visual examination of the undisturbed core samples it revealed a high vertical within a single borehole and lateral between the three boreholes lithological heterogeneity aldana et al 2021 isch et al 2020 a soil with a thickness between 0 9 and 1 8 m was observed at the top of the vz this soil is typical of the beauce region and is referred to as a loamy clay calcisol duval and isambert 1992 michot et al 2003 according to the french soil reference system baize and girard 2009 or a hypereutric cambisol with a silt loam texture according to the world reference base for soils iuss working group wrb 2015 three main soil layers were observed during the visual description of the core samples and the soil pit 0 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m 0 6 m aldana et al 2021 isch et al 2020 the thickness of the soil layers was in good agreement with that described in other studies carried out near the experimental site michot et al 2003 ould mohamed et al 1997 the soil is developed on a highly heterogeneous miocene lacustrine fragmented powdery limestone facies referred to as powdery limestone in this work that has been cryoturbated in its upper part during the quaternary michot et al 2003 ould mohamed and bruand 1994 and which also contains calcareous sand interbeds aldana et al 2021 the thickness of this layer is from 5 2 to 6 8 m finally the last main stratigraphic facies is a 12 2 to 13 4 m thick massive fractured or weathered hard rock pithiviers limestone aldana et al 2021 schnebelen et al 1999 2 3 climate and water table level data meteorological data were collected from the bricy weather station located about 20 km east of the study site from 1966 to 2020 the mean annual rainfall r and reference penman monteith potential evapotranspiration etp monteith 1965 were of 639 6 mm 113 7 mm and 813 7 mm 83 7 mm respectively maximum annual rainfall of 929 8 mm and etp of 1044 1 mm were observed in 2001 and 2020 respectively fig 2 minimum annual rainfall of 413 3 mm and etp of 658 2 mm were observed in 1990 and 1981 respectively the climate of the study site is continental temperate with a mean annual temperature of 11 1 c 0 7 c observed between 1966 and 2020 minimum of 9 7 c in 1980 and maximum of 12 8 c in 2020 the water table level wtl data were collected daily at poiseaux from a monitoring piezometer situated about 4 km south of the study site the groundwater recharge displayed an annual dynamics overlaid by multiannual trends fig 2 from 1966 to 2020 the mean wtl was 18 40 m the rise of wtl observed from 1999 to the 15 05 2001 which led to a wtlmax of 14 60 m at that date was linked to high annual r and r etp balance close to or above 0 mm over the period the same trend was observed during other periods corresponding to a rising wtl 1977 1984 and 2012 2014 the lowering of the wtl observed from 1989 to the 19 08 1992 which led to a wtlmin of 22 21 m at that date was linked to low annual r and r etp balance below 300 mm over the period the same trend was observed during other periods corresponding to a lowering wtl 1970 1974 2003 2011 and 2017 2020 2 4 measurements of the hydraulic properties of the vadose zone samples following the drilling phase twelve undisturbed samples representative of the vz materials were selected from the three cored boreholes based on the observations made during the lithological description three types of lithology were sampled throughout the vz profile 1 20 m deep including soft sediments with four powdery limestone samples pa pb pc and pd and two calcareous sand samples ia and ib and hard materials with six limestone rock samples ra rb rc rd re and rf additionally three undisturbed soil samples sa sb and sc were collected from the soil pit their hydraulic properties were determined according to the same procedure as for the other vz samples the undisturbed samples were re cored in the laboratory for adaptation to the experimental device except sample ib calcareous sand deposit which was repacked to the observed field bulk density the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the samples i e the water retention curve θ h and the hydraulic conductivity curve k h were measured within the pf log h h in cm value range 0 5 3 0 by means of a triaxial system used by applying the multistep outflow method aldana et al 2021 calculation of the hydraulic conductivity k from outflow data was based on the method given by gardner 1956 assuming that the matric head in the samples varies linearly with depth the measurement of the water retention curve was extended to the pf range 4 0 6 0 using the wp4c dewpoint potentiometer meter group a comprehensive description of the measurement system experimental protocol and calculation methods can be found in aldana et al 2021 the experimental water retention and hydraulic conductivity data were then fitted to the θ h and k h curves with three analytical models using the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 the fitting procedure is described in 2 5 4 2 5 simulation of water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone 2 5 1 theoretical background and general assumptions the simulation of water flow and solute transport in the vz was made using the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al

analytical models for the description of the hydraulic properties i e the water retention characteristic θ h and the hydraulic conductivity characteristic k h of the vz samples the first one is the mualem van genuchten mvg model which uses the van genuchten s expression van genuchten 1980 to describe the water retention curve 2 and the statistical pore connection model established by mualem 1976

and l subscript i 1 and i 2 the root water uptake model was that of feddes et al 1978 with no solute uptake hydrus 1d implements the same linear interpolation scheme for the water stress response function as the one used in the swatre code wesseling and brandyk 1985 the water stress response function parameters of grass were used taylor and ashcroft 1972 wesseling et al 1991 the root depth of grass was fixed to 30 cm schenk and jackson 2002 the one dimensional vertical solute transport in the vz was described by the convection dispersion equation cde 8 8 θ c t z θ d c z q c z with c the

given by millington and quirk 1961 2 5 2 representation of the vadose zone profiles the vz profiles were reconstituted in hydrus 1d for each of the three boreholes b1 b2 and b3 fig 1 the lithological heterogeneities along each vz profile were reproduced based on the visual descriptions of the undisturbed cored samples aldana et al 2021 a 23 m deep profile composed of fourteen b1 and fifteen b2 and b3 different materials was created for each borehole table 1 each material corresponds to a sample whose hydraulic properties have been determined in the laboratory the last material rf has been extended from the maximum drilling depth 20 m to the maximum profile depth 23 m in order to allow the wtl to move below 20 m deep the three vz profiles were vertically discretized using i a 1 cm mesh size from 0 to 1 m deep and from 10 to 0 cm above and from 0 to 10 cm below the limit between two successive materials ii a 2 cm mesh size from 50 to 10 cm above and from 10 to 50 cm below the limit between two successive materials iii a 5 cm mesh size everywhere else ten observations nodes were implemented in the b2 profile each observation node was placed at the bottom of a given material table 1 and was associated with a specific color for the comparisons made between the three boreholes ten observations nodes were implemented within the three vz profiles table 1 with a specific color assigned to a given borehole 2 5 3 initial and boundary conditions as the water table level at the time of the start of the simulation was 19 57 m the initial matric head profile was defined with hi 100 cm for 18 57 z 0 00 m and hi varying linearly from 100 to 343 cm from z 18 57 to z 23 00 m at the soil surface a water flux was imposed as upper boundary condition using daily etp and rainfall data atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer 2 cm the daily variations of the wtl were used as lower boundary condition variable pressure head for the solute transport modelling a time dependent concentration of bromide was applied at the soil surface boundary more details about the concentration of the bromide in the incoming water are given in 2 5 5 a cauchy type condition was imposed at the soil surface with dispersive flux considered negligible and a neumann type condition was imposed at the lower limit of the vz profile 2 5 4 description of the fitting procedure the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 was used to fit the θ h and k h curves eq 2 to 7 to the measured water retention and hydraulic conductivity data for the three boreholes the hydrodynamic parameters for the three analytical models mvg bbc and dbm were obtained according to the following steps for the soil samples sa sb and sc initial values of parameters θ r θ s α n and ks were taken from ould mohamed et al 1997 experimental ks values have already been obtained in the laboratory constant head method by ould mohamed et al 1997 for soil samples taken between a few tens and hundreds of meters from our experimental site since the authors have shown little spatial variability in the hydraulic properties of soils taken within the same pedological layer the values of ks of the soil samples sa sb and sc were fixed to the experimental values given by ould mohamed et al 1997 for three of their soil samples taken within the same layers and at the same depths for the powdery limestone pa pb pc and pd and the calcareous sand samples ia and ib initial values of parameters θ r θ s α n and ks were obtained by using the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 based on the particle size distribution and bulk density measured for each sample aldana et al 2021 for the limestone rock samples ra rb rc rd re and rf initial values of θ r α n were obtained using the results of a study performed near the study site amraoui et al 2017 initial values of θ s were obtained from experimental data and initial values of ks were obtained from the first experimental values of the k h curves concerning the dbm model the initial values of parameters α1 n1 and α2 n2 were chosen according to the shape of the experimental water retention curve measured for each sample these sets of initial values were then used as input to the retc software and all the parameters were fitted except l which was fixed at 0 5 as recommended by sisson and van genuchten 1991 and yates et al 1992 the relative weights of hydraulic conductivity data against retention data ranged between 0 1 and 1 0 as also recommended by isch et al 2019 when a correlation higher than 90 was noted between two fitted parameters the value of one of them was set to that obtained during the first fitting round and a second round was implemented the quality of the retc fitting procedure was evaluated for each sample by the calculation of the coefficient of determination r2 and the akaike s information criterion aicc according to eq 10 d emilio et al 2018 when the number of experimental observations is small for n k 40 the computation of the aicc is more appropriate than the standard aic given the increased relative penalty for small data sets and models with a high number of fitted parameters laio et al 2009 pham 2019 it is worth noting that the lowest value of aicc indicates the best fitting efficiency 10 aicc n ln rss n 2 k 2 k k 1 n k 1 with n the number of experimental observations k the number of fitted parameters and rss the weighted residual sum of square the dispersivity λ values of the soil and powdery limestone samples were obtained from elution experiments conducted on undisturbed columns by viel 2016 the dispersivity value of the calcareous sand samples was fixed to the mean of the values reported by vanderborght and vereecken 2007 for this type of texture the dispersivity value of the limestone rock samples was taken from kurotori et al 2019 the values obtained for all the parameters were then used to simulate water flow and bromide transport with hydrus 1d from 01 01 1966 to 31 12 2020 55 years 2 5 5 procedure implemented for the estimation of the water travel time within the vadose zone the water travel time tt through the vz was estimated by a virtual tracing experiment using bromide as an inert and conservative tracer isch et al 2019 in hydrus 1d simulations the bromide input concentration applied at the soil surface 9 7 g l was fixed in accordance with the maximum annual limit of nitrogen from livestock manure that can be applied per hectare in nitrate vulnerable zones in the centre val de loire region 170 kg n ha and calculated following 11 11 c 0 b r c 0 n mw b r mw n with

nitrogen 14 0067 g mol as recommended by szymkiewicz et al 2019 the solute transport simulation started with a warm up period of 2 years in our case during which no solute was added to the soil a single input of bromide was then applied on the 01 01 1968 with the solute concentration added in rainfall water with r 10 mm and etp 0 mm on the day of input with the aim of studying tt variability according to the year of bromide input simulations were repeated with a single input applied on the first day of each year e g 01 01 1969 01 01 1970 etc as already recommended by some authors fenton et al 2015 2011 szymkiewicz et al 2019 vero et al 2017 2014 wang et al 2012 the water travel time within the vz was estimated using three indicators including i the arrival time of a bromide concentration of 1 mg l at the wtlmax tti which was viewed as the initial solute breakthrough which approximately represents 1 of the bromide peak concentration and 0 01 of the bromide input concentration applied at the soil surface and consequently reflects initial effects of regulation measures ii the arrival time of bromide peak concentration at the wtlmax ttp which approximately represents 1 of the input bromide concentration applied at the soil surface which indicates the temporal trend of the arrival of the maximum concentration of a conservative solute down to the water table iii the time after which a bromide concentration of 1 mg l is no longer observed at wtlmax tte as it represents the maximum residence time of the tracer total exit within the vz and reflects the full effects of regulation measures 3 results discussion 3 1 hydraulic properties and hydrodynamic parameters of the vz samples 3 1 1 experimental hydraulic properties the hydraulic properties of a majority of the samples concerned by this work have already been discussed in aldana et al 2021 however considering that the results obtained for all the samples have been further investigated and given that six new samples sa sb sc pa rc and rd have been considered in this work their experimental hydraulic properties are briefly discussed below the experimental hydraulic properties water retention and hydraulic conductivity of the sa and sb soil samples were relatively similar fig 3 a the sc sample displayed lower θ s and k values between pf 0 0 and 2 0 and a higher water retention between pf 1 5 and 3 0 probably due to the slight increase in clay content observed with depth aldana et al 2021 ould mohamed et al 1997 the shapes of the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves of the three fragmented powdery limestone samples pb pc and pd were close despite a δθ observed from pf 0 0 to 3 0 for sample pc fig 3 b the cryoturbated unit pa which was described by ould mohamed and bruand 1994 displayed higher k for pf 1 5 and lower k between pf 2 0 and 3 0 than the three other powdery limestone samples fig 3 b its θ values were also in good agreement with those reported by michot et al 2003 over the range of pf 1 0 4 2 water retention of calcareous sand interbeds ia and ib samples was the lowest among the soft vz materials for pf 1 0 except ia vs pc fig 3 c ib sample displayed a lower water retention capacity than ia except at saturation because of its higher sand content aldana et al 2021 as already pointed out by aldana et al 2021 the hydraulic properties of the hard limestone rock samples were highly heterogeneous fig 3 d their θ s values were the lowest of all the vz materials except for the upstream weathered rock sample ra which showed a coarse secondary porosity resulting in a strong decrease of θ between saturation and pf 1 0 their θ s values were also in good agreement with those obtained by other authors in a study conducted nearby legchenko et al 2020 the massive rock samples rb and rc displayed a nearly constant θ between saturation and pf 3 0 in contrast to the downstream weathered rock samples re and rf whose water retention decreased gradually over the same pf range compared to the weathered rock ra re and rf the k values of the massive rock samples rb rc and rd were at first much lower near saturation pf 1 5 then quite close between pf 2 0 and 3 0 3 1 2 hydrodynamic parameters fitted by the models the hydrodynamic parameters fitted with the dbm model using the retc software provided the most satisfactory description of the experimental water retention and hydraulic conductivity data for all the vz samples fig 3 compared to those obtained with the mvg fig b 1 and bbc fig b 2 models indeed r2 0 938 and aicc 104 1 values calculated with the dbm model for each sample were always higher and lower than those obtained with the mvg except r2 for rc and re and bbc except r2 for re models respectively table 2 table a 1 and table a 2 θ r values were frequently set to 0 by the retc software during the fitting procedure table 2 table a 1 and table a 2 some high values of correlations 90 have occasionally been noted between ks et α during the fitting made with the mvg and bbc models and between ks α1 and n1 and α 2 and n2 for the dbm model table 2 table a 1 and table a 2 as a reminder when a correlation higher than 90 was noted between two fitted parameters the value of one of them was set to that obtained during the first fitting round and a second round was implemented the quality of the description of the water retention curves was more impacted by the choice of the analytical model than the hydraulic conductivity curves the experimental water retention properties of the soft vz materials that mostly displayed a clear bimodal behavior notably sa sb pa pd ia and ib were poorly depicted by the mvg and bbc models especially for 0 5 pf 1 5 where retention was overestimated by the models and for 2 5 pf 4 0 where it was underestimated fig b 1 a c and fig b 2 a c higher values of parameter θ s were obtained with the mvg table a 1 and bbc table a 2 models for a majority of the soft vz samples expect sa and sb for mvg and ib for mvg and bbc compared to those fitted with the dbm model table 2 the experimental hydraulic conductivity curves of all the vz samples were generally well described by the three models which gave good fits for 1 5 pf 3 0 fig 3 fig b 1 and fig b 2 the main differences in the fitted k h curves among the three models were found in the description of the hydraulic conductivity near saturation pf 1 indeed the k values obtained by the dbm model near saturation were frequently higher or equal than those given by the mvg and bbc models except sc for mvg and bbc and ia for bbc this resulted in ks values always higher or equal for the dbm model compared to the mvg except pa ia and rb and bbc except ia models table 2 table a 1 and table a 2 the mvg and bbc models still allow a decent representation of the hydraulic properties of the vz materials with r2 0 866 except for sc and ra and aicc 85 6 for mvg and r2 0 849 except for sc and rc and aicc 75 9 for bbc table a 1 and table a 2 however the quality of the fit was better for the mvg model as the aicc values computed for each sample were generally lower than those obtained for the bbc model except for ib and ra consequently the simulations made using the hydrus 1d software concerning the influence of the choice of the analytical model on the simulation of water flow and the estimation of tt within the vz were focused on a comparison between the unimodal mvg and bimodal dbm expressions 3 2 simulation of water flow and estimation of travel time within the b2 profile since a majority of the samples were taken from the b2 profile table 2 the influence of the choice of the analytical model mvg or dbm on the simulation of water flow and the estimation of tt within the vz was studied on this profile the b2 water content profiles simulated at the date of the drilling 14 march 2017 using the mvg and dbm models were in relatively good agreement with the experimental measurements made on the undisturbed core samples on that same date r2 0 892 fig 4 b the differences in θ between the two models were rather small and the main disparities 0 05 cm3 cm3 were observed within the soil 0 1 m deep the powdery limestone facies from 2 0 to 3 5 m deep and from 5 5 to 6 6 m deep and the saturated zone below 18 m deep overestimations of experimental θ by the models were noted in the powdery limestone material pb 2 m deep and in limestone rock materials rc rd and re from 10 to 15 m deep underestimations of experimental θ by the models were observed in massive rb 8 5 m deep and downstream weathered limestone rock materials rf 16 m deep since the beauce limestone aquifer is known for its highly permeable soils and its vertical soil water flow regime bruand et al 1997 flipo et al 2012 no run off was observed during the whole simulation period 55 years and a total rainfall of 35180 mm the matric head values simulated by the dbm model in each soil layer displayed more fluctuations than those of the mvg model fig 5 and fig b 3 the soil water status simulated by the dbm model was drier lower mean values of h and characterized by more pronounced drying and wetting cycles than for the mvg model fig b 3 and table a 3 the mean downward water flux simulated within the soil was higher for the dbm model than for the mvg model table a 3 this could be attributed to the higher cumulative etr actual evapotranspiration simulated with the mvg model 30210 mm compared to the dbm model 28009 mm which resulted in a lower quantity of water infiltrating in the vz profile for the mvg model over the simulation period this was also induced by the higher soil k values observed near saturation pf 1 5 for the dbm model compared to the mvg model except sc fig 3 a fig b 1 a and fig b 2 a as a result the bromide transport simulated within the soil by the dbm model was noticeably faster than that simulated with the mvg model fig 6 a the mean water content and matric head values simulated by the models within the deep vz materials below the soil table a 3 indicated that the dbm model resulted in a globally wetter vz profile higher mean values of h compared to the mvg model although the variations of matric head values observed within the deep vz materials could seem relatively close at first sight between the two models they were in fact much more dynamic for the dbm model as highlighted by more pronounced drying and wetting cycles fig 5 and fig b 4 perched water tables were identified in the vz profiles and were caused by the low saturated hydraulic conductivity of the powdery limestone pb pc and pd for mvg and pb and pc for dbm and massive limestone rock rc fig 3 b d fig b 1 b d fig 5 and fig b 4 although these perched water tables seemed slightly more pronounced for the mvg model these were actually less frequent than for the dbm model due to the higher k near saturation pf 1 of the powdery limestone and rock materials and the more dynamic water regime of the latter in accordance with the lower mean downward water flux simulated along the vz profile table a 3 the bromide transport simulated with the mvg model from the base of the soil down to wtlmax 14 6 m deep was always slower than that simulated with the dbm model fig 6 b d finally the mean tti ttp and tte calculated from all the tt values simulated for each input year over the same period of time were always higher for the mvg model than for the dbm model whatever the period of time considered table 3 the differences in mean tt values between the dbm and mvg models were significant and higher than 5 years for tti 9 years for ttp and 14 years for tte table 3 the year of input corresponding to the minimum and maximum tti ttp and tte were relatively close between the two models fig b 5 and table 3 the most significant variations in tt simulated between the two models were noted for the years of input corresponding to a sudden increase in tt for the mvg model and which was not reproduced by the dbm model e g 1978 and 1988 for tti 1981 and 1982 for ttp fig b 5 the simulation of the water flow and the estimation of the tt made using unimodal mvg and bimodal dbm models fitted to the same experimental hydraulic properties can show large disparities 9 8 tti 23 1 years 14 6 ttp 34 9 years 27 3 tte 46 5 years the dbm model allows to better account for the impact of the macroporosity in the soft vz materials and the presence of micro fissures 1 mm thick in the hard limestone rock materials compared to the mvg model in view of all these findings and since the hydrodynamic parameters fitted with the dbm model provided the most satisfactory description of the experimental hydraulic properties the latter has been adopted for the comparative simulation of water flow and tt performed between three vz profiles reconstituted with hydrus 1d from the three boreholes b1 b2 and b3 3 3 simulation of the water flow and estimation of travel time within the vadose zone b1 b2 and b3 profiles 3 3 1 impact of the heterogeneity of the vadose zone profiles simulated θ profiles with the dbm model at the date of the drilling 14 03 2017 for the three boreholes were in good agreement with the experimental measurements made on the undisturbed core samples on that same date 0 882 r2 0 925 fig 4 experimental θ obtained for the three boreholes were generally slightly overestimated by the model notably in pb and pc materials from 1 5 to 4 0 m deep depending on the borehole and in limestone rock materials from 9 0 to 16 0 m deep the main differences between experimental and simulated θ from 0 05 to 0 10 cm3 cm3 within the three boreholes were found i in sb pa and pb materials above 2 0 m deep ii in rb materials around 8 0 m deep at the transition between the powdery limestone pd and the massive rock rb materials aldana et al 2021 which displayed high and low θ s values respectively table 2 iii in re and rf materials between 15 5 and 18 0 m deep which corresponds to the weathered limestone rock that presented a highly heterogeneous structure with an increasing evolution toward karstification fracturation and even silicification with depth mallet et al 2022 the water regime within the soil seemed to be all the more dynamic as its thickness was small as highlighted by the variations of the matric head which suggested more pronounced drying and wetting cycles in the b2 profile than in b1 and b3 profiles fig 7 a the mean values of water content matric head and water flux simulated for the three boreholes table a 4 indicated that the soil of the b3 profile was slightly wetter it also displayed a lower vertical downward water flux than b1 and b2 profiles although the three soil profiles were strictly identical down to 0 9 m deep table 1 this was attributed to the higher cumulative etr simulated within the b3 profile 28296 mm due to the larger thickness of its soil layer sc 1 2 m cf table 1 compared to b1 0 4 m and b2 0 3 m indeed the soil showed the highest water retention capacity among the vz materials fig 3 this resulted in a visible differentiation of the bromide transport between the b3 and the b2 and b1 profiles with a slightly slower leaching of bromide down to 1 2 m deep in the b3 soil profile fig 8 a the differences in soil profiles and the influence of the meteorological conditions led to an arrival time for the peak of bromide ranging from 1 3 to 5 1 years at 1 2 m deep fig 8 a which represented a travel speed ranging from 0 23 to 0 94 m yr the mean h values simulated by the dbm model in the vz materials below 2 0 m deep for the three boreholes were higher than 100 cm pf 2 0 table a 4 this revealed a global wet water status over the simulation period fig 7 b d and the occurrence of relatively high vertical downward water flux due to k values close to saturation within the vz profiles table a 4 the strong lithological similarities between the b1 and b2 profiles down to 3 5 m deep table 1 led to a comparable bromide transport within the soil and the upper powdery limestone materials pa pb and pc of the two profiles fig 8 a b the differentiation in bromide transport simulated between the b1 the slowest and b2 the fastest profiles from 3 5 m to 8 0 m deep fig 8 b d was mainly caused by the differences in thickness of the powdery limestone materials pc and pd 3 8 m for b1 and 1 6 m for b2 cf table 1 the arrival time for the peak of bromide at 3 5 m and 8 0 m deep ranged from 5 0 to 11 0 years fig 8 b and from 11 1 to 18 8 years fig 8 c respectively the peak concentration of bromide took between 3 8 and 5 9 years to migrate from 1 2 to 3 5 m deep travel speed ranging from 0 39 to 0 63 m yr and between 5 0 and 7 8 years to migrate from 3 5 to 8 0 m deep travel speed ranging from 0 58 to 0 89 m yr the mean bromide peak concentration observed at wtlmax for each vz profile was between 94 4 b3 and 104 8 mg l b2 table 4 which approximately represents 1 of the bromide input concentration 9 7 g l the lowest peak concentrations observed for b3 were caused by the higher global dispersivity of the profile thicker soil and thinner powdery limestone cf table 1 and table 2 the highest peak concentrations found for b2 profile were induced by its lower global dispersivity thinner soil and thicker rock materials cf table 1 and table 2 it is worth noting that the higher global dispersivity of the b3 profile resulted in the observation of bromide first concentrations at wtlmax tti at times close to b2 and the total exit of the bromide tte at times close to b1 fig b 6 and table 4 the mean indicators of tt for bromide to reach wtlmax 14 6 m deep were of 13 8 years for tti 9 8 tti 17 5 years 20 9 years for ttp 14 6 ttp 25 3 years and 31 5 years for tte 26 6 ttp 39 0 years table 4 the peak concentration of bromide was transported from the soil surface down to wtlmax at a mean travel speed of 0 70 m yr min 0 58 m yr and max 1 00 m yr and took between 5 8 and 8 3 years to migrate through the limestone rock facies from 8 0 m deep down to wtlmax travel speed ranging from 0 79 to 1 15 m yr fig 8 d for a given year of input tti and ttp were always the largest for the b1 profile and the smallest for the b2 profile and tte was always the largest for the b3 profile and the smallest for the b2 profile fig b 6 differences of up to 3 6 b1 b2 1979 3 5 b1 b2 1975 and 4 7 years b3 b2 1977 were observed regarding tti ttp and tte respectively fig b 6 the impact of the lateral variations in the vz profiles lithological differences at small scale 15 m cf fig 1 on the variations of the tt was relatively small this is a consequence of the overall wet status observed over the simulation period within the vz materials located below the soil fig 7 b d and table a 4 which induced a leaching of bromide mainly impacted by k values close to saturation 3 3 2 impact of the meteorological conditions as previously underlined by some authors sprenger et al 2016 vero et al 2014 meteorological conditions have a strong influence on the variation of tt through the vz maximum differences in the tt indicators according to input years for each vz profile varied from 7 0 b1 to 7 2 b3 years for tti from 8 2 b1 to 9 5 b3 years for ttp and from 7 4 b2 to 9 7 b3 years for tte table 4 the variations of the tt observed within a single vz profile over the simulation period were higher than those observed between the three vz profiles for a given year of input fig b 6 and table 4 it appeared that in the case of a globally wet vz the meteorological conditions had more influence on the variations of the tt within the vz than the small scale lateral variations of its profile lithological composition positive values of matric head were noted in several vz materials located above the least permeable materials pb pc and rc fig 3 b d and fig 7 b c and appeared in years showing annual r etp balance close or above 0 mm such as 1978 1984 1988 or 2001 2002 cf fig 2 this indicates that perched water tables may have occurred in the vz profiles caused by accumulation of water above these weakly permeable materials the building up of perched water tables were highlighted in the soft vz materials up to a depth of 0 7 m and in the limestone rock from about 11 m deep up to a depth of 7 m fig 7 c d and fig b 4 b given the high lithological heterogeneity of the vz materials these perched water tables will however probably be less significant at the 3d field scale because of the lateral movement of water into open fractures or karst networks situated within the vz aldana et al 2021 mallet et al 2022 the tt variations were tightly correlated with meteorological conditions and water table level data that were used as boundary conditions over the simulation period the relatively slow leaching of bromide observed in the vz mean travel speed 0 70 m yr could be partly explained by the low mean annual rainfall 639 6 mm and the high mean annual etp 813 7 mm observed over the simulation period fig 2 and also by the low hydraulic conductivity even near saturation of the powdery limestone pb pc and pd and the massive rock rb and rc materials fig 3 b d the relatively faster leaching of bromide corresponding to low tt observed for inputs made between 1968 and 1975 fig b 6 could be explained by the meteorological conditions observed between 1977 and 1984 when annual r etp balances were close or above 0 mm and when wtl was rising fig 2 the global slowdown of the leaching of bromide corresponding to a general increase in tt observed for inputs made from the late 1970s fig b 6 was strongly influenced by the small annual rainfall and the lowering of the wtl observed from 1989 to 1998 2003 to 2011 and 2015 to 2020 fig 2 and may be a consequence of global warming indeed it is worth noting that from 1989 to 2020 only two years of input showed a positive annual r etp balance 1999 and 2001 while an increase in mean annual temperature of 1 0 c and etp of 98 mm was noted compared to the 1968 1988 period fig 2 as highlighted by the trends observed for tti since the end of the 1990s fig b 6 a further increase in tt for inputs made after 2000 is expected as a response to the global increase in mean annual temperature and etp observed since 2015 maximum of 12 8 c and 1044 mm observed in 2020 associated with a strongly negative annual r etp balance fig 2 3 4 limitation of the work the results obtained and discussed in this study focused on the simulation of the movement of water and bromide in the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer at the core scale it has been well established that interconnected fractures or karst networks may act as preferential flow paths leading to faster water and solute transport chen et al 2019 mcling et al 2017 wood et al 2004 notably after heavy rainfall events and thus only under or close to fully saturated conditions wellings and bell 1980 some authors suggested that several tens of percent of the total flow in the vz could be transported through fractures smith et al 1970 as shown on fig 9 natural fractures with karstification were observed at the field scale and were found to have been episodically subjected to intense water flow under or close to fully saturated conditions aldana et al 2021 mallet et al 2022 the simulations carried out in this work showed the possible occurrence of perched water tables within the vz which might generate preferential water flow through these open fractures networks especially in the case of very rainy years this would result in a faster solute transport within the fracture porosity which could be simulated by the use of a dual permeability model šimůnek et al 2003 this modeling approach has proven to be useful for taking into account the contribution of preferential flow and representing the water flow and solute transport between fractures and matrix aguilar lópez et al 2020 köhne et al 2002 recent work also showed that even if a dual porosity model was capable of adequately describing the arrival of the measured initial concentrations and the shape of the breakthrough curves of bromide at the base of a loamy soil only the dual permeability model used with the inclusion of a mobile immobile water component mim provided a good ability to identify the arrival of peak concentrations varvaris et al 2021b the identification and characterization of these open fractures networks and the understanding of their functioning will consequently be crucial for complementing our knowledge of water flow travel time and contaminant transport through the vulnerable beauce limestone aquifer 4 summary and conclusion in this study the numerical simulation of water flow and the estimation of water travel time through the highly heterogeneous vz of a limestone aquifer was undertaken over a period of 55 years the parameterization of the model hydrus 1d was based on hydraulic properties laboratory measurements performed on fifteen samples representative of the lithologies encountered within the vz using unimodal mvg and bimodal dbm approaches three heterogeneous vz profiles were reconstituted in hydrus 1d based on three boreholes drilled in march 2017 daily rainfall etp and water table level data were used as inputs for the implementation of a virtual bromide tracing experiment made over the 55 years the arrival time of the initial breakthrough tti the peak ttp and the total exit of the bromide concentration tte at the maximum water table level were considered as suitable indicators of water travel time within the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer the results obtained in this work highlighted that the experimental hydraulic properties of the samples were more accurately described by the dbm model the latter allowed a precise description of the bimodal characteristic of the vz materials i e macro and micro porosity for the soil powdery limestone and calcareous sand samples and matrix and micro fissures porosity for the limestone rock the choice of the analytical model used to describe the vz hydraulic properties mvg or dbm showed a significant influence on the simulation of the water flow and tt within the vz the results of the simulations carried out with the two models displayed strong discrepancies regarding the water flow dynamics matric head and water content variations through the vz and showed large differences in tt occasionally higher than 10 years for tti and ttp and 15 years for tte these disparities were mainly attributed to the differences observed in the water flow dynamics simulated in the soil and the higher hydraulic conductivity values obtained with the dbm model for the vz materials located below the soil over the range of matric head h 250 cm observed during the simulation period a mean tti of 13 8 years min 9 8 max 17 5 ttp of 20 9 years min 14 6 max 25 3 and tte of 31 5 years min 26 6 max 39 0 were found for the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer with simulations carried out using the dbm model the vertical heterogeneity of the properties of the vz materials showed a strong influence on the simulation of the water flow and the estimation of tt significant differences were found in the travel speed of the peak concentrations of bromide through the vz materials which was the fastest in the limestone rock facies max of 1 15 m yr and the slowest in the powdery limestone facies max of 0 63 m yr despite the lithological differences observed between the three vz profiles only slight variations were found regarding the water flow dynamics and the tt max 4 7 years whatever the indicator between the three boreholes this small impact of the lateral heterogeneities was mainly attributed to the global wet status found in the vz materials located below the soil which led to hydraulic conductivities always close to saturation and consequently hardly noticeable differences between the three vz profiles the meteorological conditions have shown a large influence on the variations of the tt through the vz max 9 7 years whatever the indicator together with the rise of the mean annual temperature and etp over the simulation period an increase in tt was noted since the late 1970s becoming even more apparent after the late 1990s and may be a consequence of global warming in the case of this mostly unconfined aquifer this could mean that the impact of the regulatory measures that have been put into effect since the beginning of the 1990s e g the nitrates directive european commission 1991 for the preservation of groundwater resources may not yet be clearly identifiable today and that it could take progressively longer to identify such impacts in the future the results presented in this work were obtained with fifteen samples selected along the whole vz profile and represent a first step towards capturing and deciphering in depth the high heterogeneity of the vz materials and characterizing the complexity of the transfer through the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer aldana et al 2021 mallet et al 2022 it will indeed be necessary to improve our knowledge about the vertical and lateral flow of water and solute through the whole porosity of this highly heterogeneous vz by conducting extensive studies at larger scales combining 3d experimental observations and numerical simulations with dual permeability approaches to this end noninvasive hydrogeophysical monitoring tools seem to represent a worthwhile solution for mapping geological facies properties and linking measured geophysical parameters to the hydraulic properties of the vz materials binley et al 2015 parsekian et al 2015 romero ruiz et al 2018 when combined with the use of well established or advanced in situ methods in the vz i e tracer tests and fracture networks characterization mcling et al 2017 sprenger et al 2016 or in the saturated zone pumping slug or tracer tests binet et al 2017 mosthaf et al 2018 such tools should lead to a refined hydraulic characterization of the materials and a more accurate assessment of the travel time of water and the fate of contaminants through this highly vulnerable limestone aquifer of major importance credit

3335,the assessment of water travel time through the vadose zone is known to be critical for a proper estimation of the hydrologic response time of water bodies to evolutions in land use management and global changes in this study the hydraulic properties of fifteen samples displaying contrasted lithologies soil powdery limestone calcareous sand limestone rock and extracted from three cored boreholes drilled throughout the vadose zone of a vulnerable limestone aquifer were first determined in the laboratory three 23 m deep vadose zone profiles were then reconstituted with the hydrus 1d software for the numerical simulation of water flow and the estimation of the water travel time using unimodal and bimodal approaches the measured hydraulic properties meteorological and water table level data were used as input for a virtual bromide tracing experiment undertaken over a period of 55 years 1966 2020 the results showed that the experimental hydraulic properties of the samples were more accurately described with a dual porosity approach since the latter allowed a precise representation of the bimodal characteristic of most of the samples the water flow and travel time simulated using unimodal or bimodal models for describing the vadose zone hydraulic properties were largely different the impact of the vadose zone lateral heterogeneities on the simulated water flow and the estimated travel time was relatively limited compared to the influence of the vadose zone vertical heterogeneities and meteorological conditions the mean travel time of the first concentration peak concentration and last concentration of bromide simulated with the bimodal model at the maximum water table level of the aquifer was 13 8 20 9 and 31 5 years respectively increase in travel time was clearly identified since the late 1970s and could be a consequence of global warming these results also pointed out the need for conducting extensive studies at larger scales to take into account

the aquifer is considered as a key component of the cz and is of major importance in the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles consequently an increasing body of work aims at improving the knowledge of the vz functioning which includes numerous complex and coupled physical geochemical and microbial processes aldana et al 2021 arora et al 2019 vereecken et al 2016 this constitutes a fundamental milestone for a proper assessment of groundwater recharge and in managing contamination issues for the preservation of aquifers this is especially true since the increasing use of groundwater resources worldwide and the degradation of the quality of the water resources caused by intensive agriculture have led to the enforcement of several stringent regulatory measures in several countries geared towards achieving a good chemical status for all water bodies in years ahead vero et al 2017 in this context the estimation of the water travel time through the vz is crucial as it constitutes an important component of the total time lag defining the inherent hydrologic response delay of water bodies to a change in land management practices this response time is often conceptualized as consisting in both a vertical within the vz and a lateral within the saturated zone component sousa et al 2013 the knowledge of the water travel time through the vz is considered as a prerequisite for quantifying the recharge rate and the time of migration of contaminants from the soil surface down to the aquifer mattern and vanclooster 2010 however the water travel time in the vz is known to be highly variable in space and time its quantification is recognized as highly complex and influenced by several factors including the size and geometry of the vz the properties of the vz materials the physical chemical and biological processes governing water flow and solute transport within the vz and the pattern of the meteorological inputs jeong et al 2017 leij and van genuchten 2002 sousa et al 2013 sprenger et al 2016 vero et al 2014 numerous experimental methods are currently used to estimate the water travel time through the vz such as lysimeters mainly focused on the soil or field experiments using radioactive or stable isotopes chloride nitrate bromide or fluorobenzoate as tracers asadollahi et al 2020 chen et al 2019 ju et al 2020 sprenger et al 2016 turkeltaub et al 2018 however these experimental approaches are known to be fairly expensive labor intensive time consuming and may also have limited predictive capacity as a consequence numerical models are being increasingly used for the study of water flow solute transport and travel time assessments within the vz bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 konikow 2011 schoups et al 2008 szymkiewicz et al 2019 vero et al 2014 these models need an estimation of the vz hydrodynamic parameters and may partly rely on pedotransfer functions patil and singh 2016 schaap et al 2001 szymkiewicz et al 2018 vereecken et al 2010 vero et al 2017 zhang and schaap 2019 some authors used inverse modeling approaches based on transient measurements of water content matric head and tracer content in the vz haws et al 2005 jacques et al 2002 sprenger et al 2016 2015 varvaris et al 2021a b however hydraulic data acquisition is mostly focused on the soil compartment and the numerical simulations run for the estimation of the travel time are often limited to the use of a unimodal approach relying notably on the mualem van genuchten model to describe the vz hydraulic properties van genuchten 1980 the main objective of this work was to provide a new methodological approach for the study of the water flow and the estimation of the water travel time at the scale of a highly heterogeneous vz to this end the hydraulic properties water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves of fifteen samples taken from three cored boreholes and representative of the lithologies soil powdery limestone calcareous sand limestone rock encountered within the vz of a vulnerable limestone aquifer beauce france were first determined in the laboratory these experimental data were then used for the parameterization of analytical models describing the measured hydraulic properties using single unimodal and dual porosity bimodal approaches the travel time within the vz has been estimated by means of a virtual bromide tracing experiment performed over a period of 55 years using the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2016 the appearance of the initial breakthrough the peak concentration and the total exit of the tracer at the maximum water table level of the aquifer were considered as indicators of the water travel time the impact of the choice of the analytical model used to describe the experimental hydraulic properties the vertical and lateral heterogeneity of the vz and the meteorological conditions on the simulation of the water flow and travel time through the vz has been explored 2 materials methods 2 1 the beauce limestone aquifer the multi layered beauce limestone aquifer is located in the center of france and extends over 9700 km2 de frutos cachorro et al 2017 it is mainly composed of limestones from upper oligocene to lower miocene but also consists in clay marl powdery limestone calcareous sand or chalk facies depending on the location this mostly unconfined aquifer is spread between the seine northeast and the loire southwest rivers and constitutes one of the largest groundwater reservoirs in france with an average water stock of 20 billion m3 and high inter annual variations le coz 2000 the beauce represents the main cereal producing region in europe graveline 2020 its land use consists essentially in agriculture 74 50 of which is irrigated indeed the region is one of the driest in france with an annual average precipitation of 600 mm lejars et al 2012 this results in an intense irrigated farming of between 120000 and 240000 ha that withdraws from the groundwater resource between 150 and 450 million m3 of water per year graveline 2020 the sensitivity of the water resource to natural recharge and the observation of an overall lowering of the water table level since the early 1990s have led to the implementation of several local water policy measures to control water withdrawals in connection with the french water law légifrance 1992 which is now the translation of the european water framework directive european commission 2000 over the past decades the beauce intensive agriculture has also impacted the groundwater quality with nitrates and pesticides notably atrazine and bentazon whose concentrations still exceed regulatory limits ddt 2016 despite government policies and regulatory measures that have been put into effect since the early 1990s european commission 2009 1991 2 2 location sampling and description of the vz materials the experimental site is located at villamblain 30 km northwest of orléans france dms coordinates x 48 1 5 131 y 1 34 55 333 three cored boreholes b1 b2 and b3 separated by a maximum distance of 10 8 m from each other fig 1 have been drilled in march 2017 from 0 to 20 m deep the soil formation 0 0 1 5 m deep was drilled by hydraulic percussion while the other vz materials 1 5 20 0 m deep were taken by rotary drilling with a three annular compartments corer to avoid sample contamination by the drilling fluid water as stated by aldana et al 2021 compaction caused by hydraulic percussion led to unreliable hydraulic properties data for the soil samples consequently additional soil samples were collected manually from the ground surface after digging a pit at a few meters from the three boreholes fig 1 and down to a depth of 1 m the vz lithologies were described based on visual examination of the undisturbed core samples it revealed a high vertical within a single borehole and lateral between the three boreholes lithological heterogeneity aldana et al 2021 isch et al 2020 a soil with a thickness between 0 9 and 1 8 m was observed at the top of the vz this soil is typical of the beauce region and is referred to as a loamy clay calcisol duval and isambert 1992 michot et al 2003 according to the french soil reference system baize and girard 2009 or a hypereutric cambisol with a silt loam texture according to the world reference base for soils iuss working group wrb 2015 three main soil layers were observed during the visual description of the core samples and the soil pit 0 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m 0 6 m aldana et al 2021 isch et al 2020 the thickness of the soil layers was in good agreement with that described in other studies carried out near the experimental site michot et al 2003 ould mohamed et al 1997 the soil is developed on a highly heterogeneous miocene lacustrine fragmented powdery limestone facies referred to as powdery limestone in this work that has been cryoturbated in its upper part during the quaternary michot et al 2003 ould mohamed and bruand 1994 and which also contains calcareous sand interbeds aldana et al 2021 the thickness of this layer is from 5 2 to 6 8 m finally the last main stratigraphic facies is a 12 2 to 13 4 m thick massive fractured or weathered hard rock pithiviers limestone aldana et al 2021 schnebelen et al 1999 2 3 climate and water table level data meteorological data were collected from the bricy weather station located about 20 km east of the study site from 1966 to 2020 the mean annual rainfall r and reference penman monteith potential evapotranspiration etp monteith 1965 were of 639 6 mm 113 7 mm and 813 7 mm 83 7 mm respectively maximum annual rainfall of 929 8 mm and etp of 1044 1 mm were observed in 2001 and 2020 respectively fig 2 minimum annual rainfall of 413 3 mm and etp of 658 2 mm were observed in 1990 and 1981 respectively the climate of the study site is continental temperate with a mean annual temperature of 11 1 c 0 7 c observed between 1966 and 2020 minimum of 9 7 c in 1980 and maximum of 12 8 c in 2020 the water table level wtl data were collected daily at poiseaux from a monitoring piezometer situated about 4 km south of the study site the groundwater recharge displayed an annual dynamics overlaid by multiannual trends fig 2 from 1966 to 2020 the mean wtl was 18 40 m the rise of wtl observed from 1999 to the 15 05 2001 which led to a wtlmax of 14 60 m at that date was linked to high annual r and r etp balance close to or above 0 mm over the period the same trend was observed during other periods corresponding to a rising wtl 1977 1984 and 2012 2014 the lowering of the wtl observed from 1989 to the 19 08 1992 which led to a wtlmin of 22 21 m at that date was linked to low annual r and r etp balance below 300 mm over the period the same trend was observed during other periods corresponding to a lowering wtl 1970 1974 2003 2011 and 2017 2020 2 4 measurements of the hydraulic properties of the vadose zone samples following the drilling phase twelve undisturbed samples representative of the vz materials were selected from the three cored boreholes based on the observations made during the lithological description three types of lithology were sampled throughout the vz profile 1 20 m deep including soft sediments with four powdery limestone samples pa pb pc and pd and two calcareous sand samples ia and ib and hard materials with six limestone rock samples ra rb rc rd re and rf additionally three undisturbed soil samples sa sb and sc were collected from the soil pit their hydraulic properties were determined according to the same procedure as for the other vz samples the undisturbed samples were re cored in the laboratory for adaptation to the experimental device except sample ib calcareous sand deposit which was repacked to the observed field bulk density the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the samples i e the water retention curve θ h and the hydraulic conductivity curve k h were measured within the pf log h h in cm value range 0 5 3 0 by means of a triaxial system used by applying the multistep outflow method aldana et al 2021 calculation of the hydraulic conductivity k from outflow data was based on the method given by gardner 1956 assuming that the matric head in the samples varies linearly with depth the measurement of the water retention curve was extended to the pf range 4 0 6 0 using the wp4c dewpoint potentiometer meter group a comprehensive description of the measurement system experimental protocol and calculation methods can be found in aldana et al 2021 the experimental water retention and hydraulic conductivity data were then fitted to the θ h and k h curves with three analytical models using the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 the fitting procedure is described in 2 5 4 2 5 simulation of water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone 2 5 1 theoretical background and general assumptions the simulation of water flow and solute transport in the vz was made using the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al

analytical models for the description of the hydraulic properties i e the water retention characteristic θ h and the hydraulic conductivity characteristic k h of the vz samples the first one is the mualem van genuchten mvg model which uses the van genuchten s expression van genuchten 1980 to describe the water retention curve 2 and the statistical pore connection model established by mualem 1976

function as the one used in the swatre code wesseling and brandyk 1985 the water stress response function parameters of grass were used taylor and ashcroft 1972 wesseling et al 1991 the root depth of

given by millington and quirk 1961 2 5 2 representation of the vadose zone profiles the vz profiles were reconstituted in hydrus 1d for each of the three boreholes b1 b2 and b3 fig 1 the lithological heterogeneities along each vz profile were reproduced based on the visual descriptions of the undisturbed cored samples aldana et al 2021 a 23 m deep profile composed of fourteen b1 and fifteen b2 and b3 different materials was created for each borehole table 1 each material corresponds to a sample whose hydraulic properties have been determined in the laboratory the last material rf has been extended from the maximum drilling depth 20 m to the maximum profile depth 23 m in order to allow the wtl to move below 20 m deep the three vz profiles were vertically discretized using i a 1 cm mesh size from 0 to 1 m deep and from 10 to 0 cm above and from 0 to 10 cm below the limit between two successive materials ii a 2 cm mesh size from 50 to 10 cm above and from 10 to 50 cm below the limit between two successive materials iii a 5 cm mesh size everywhere else ten observations nodes were implemented in the b2 profile each observation node was placed at the bottom of a given material table 1 and was associated with a specific color for the comparisons made between the three boreholes ten observations nodes were implemented within the three vz profiles table 1 with a specific color assigned to a given borehole 2 5 3 initial and boundary conditions as the water table level at the time of the start of the simulation was 19 57 m the initial matric head profile was defined with hi 100 cm for 18 57 z 0 00 m and hi varying linearly from 100 to 343 cm from z 18 57 to z 23 00 m at the soil surface a water flux was imposed as upper boundary condition using daily etp and rainfall data atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer 2 cm the daily variations of the wtl were used as lower boundary condition variable pressure head for the solute transport modelling a time dependent concentration of bromide was applied at the soil surface boundary more details about the concentration of the bromide in the incoming water are given in 2 5 5 a cauchy type condition was imposed at the soil surface with dispersive flux considered negligible and a neumann type condition was imposed at the lower limit of the vz profile 2 5 4 description of the fitting procedure the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 was used to fit the θ h and k h curves eq 2 to 7 to the measured water retention and hydraulic conductivity data for the three boreholes the hydrodynamic parameters for the three analytical models mvg bbc and dbm were obtained according to the following steps for the soil samples sa sb and sc initial values of parameters θ r θ s α n and ks were taken from ould mohamed et al 1997 experimental ks values have already been obtained in the laboratory constant head method by ould mohamed et al 1997 for soil samples taken between a few tens and hundreds of meters from our experimental site since the authors have shown little spatial variability in the hydraulic properties of soils taken within the same pedological layer the values of ks of the soil samples sa sb and sc were fixed to the experimental values given by ould mohamed et al 1997 for three of their soil samples taken within the same layers and at the same depths for the powdery limestone pa pb pc and pd and the calcareous sand samples ia and ib initial values of parameters θ r θ s α n and ks were obtained by using the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 based on the particle size distribution and bulk density measured for each sample aldana et al 2021 for the limestone rock samples ra rb rc rd re and rf initial values of θ r α n were obtained using the results of a study performed near the study site amraoui et al 2017 initial values of θ s were obtained from experimental data and initial values of ks were obtained from the first experimental values of the k h curves concerning the dbm model the initial values of parameters α1 n1 and α2 n2 were chosen according to the shape of the experimental water retention curve measured for each sample these sets of initial values were then used as input to the retc software and all the parameters were fitted except l which was fixed at 0 5 as recommended by sisson and van genuchten 1991 and yates et al 1992 the relative weights of hydraulic conductivity data against retention data ranged between 0 1 and 1 0 as also recommended by isch et al 2019 when a correlation higher than 90 was noted between two fitted parameters the value of one of them was set to that obtained during the first fitting round and a second round was implemented the quality of the retc fitting procedure was evaluated for each sample by the calculation of the coefficient of determination r2 and the akaike s information criterion aicc according to eq 10 d emilio et al 2018 when the number of experimental observations is small for n k 40 the computation of the aicc is more appropriate than the standard aic given the increased relative penalty for small data sets and models with a high number of fitted parameters laio et al 2009 pham 2019 it is worth noting that the lowest value of aicc indicates the best fitting efficiency 10 aicc n ln rss n 2 k 2 k k 1 n k 1 with n the number of experimental observations k the number of fitted parameters and rss the weighted residual sum of square the dispersivity λ values of the soil and powdery limestone samples were obtained from elution experiments conducted on undisturbed columns by viel 2016 the dispersivity value of the calcareous sand samples was fixed to the mean of the values reported by vanderborght and vereecken 2007 for this type of texture the dispersivity value of the limestone rock samples was taken from kurotori et al 2019 the values obtained for all the parameters were then used to simulate water flow and bromide transport with hydrus 1d from 01 01 1966 to 31 12 2020 55 years 2 5 5 procedure implemented for the estimation of the water travel time within the vadose zone the water travel time tt through the vz was estimated by a virtual tracing experiment using bromide as an inert and conservative tracer isch et al 2019 in hydrus 1d simulations the bromide input concentration applied at the soil surface 9 7 g l was fixed in accordance with the maximum annual limit of nitrogen from livestock manure that can be applied per hectare in nitrate vulnerable zones in the centre val de loire region 170 kg n ha and calculated following 11 11 c 0 b r c 0 n mw b r mw n with c0 br the bromide concentration in liquid phase g cm3 c0 n the nitrogen concentration in liquid phase 0 0017 g cm3 mw br the molecular weight of bromide 79 904 g mol and mw n the molecular weight of nitrogen 14 0067 g mol as recommended by szymkiewicz et al 2019 the solute transport simulation started with a warm up period of 2 years in our case during which no solute was added to the soil a single input of bromide was then applied on the 01 01 1968 with the solute concentration added in rainfall water with r 10 mm and etp 0 mm on the day of input with the aim of studying tt variability according to the year of bromide input simulations were repeated with a single input applied on the first day of each year e g 01 01 1969 01 01 1970 etc as already recommended by some authors fenton et al 2015 2011 szymkiewicz et al 2019 vero et al 2017 2014 wang et al 2012 the water travel time within the vz was estimated using three indicators including i the arrival time of a bromide concentration of 1 mg l at the wtlmax tti which was viewed as the initial solute breakthrough which approximately represents 1 of the bromide peak concentration and 0 01 of the bromide input concentration applied at the soil surface and consequently reflects initial effects of regulation measures ii the arrival time of bromide peak concentration at the wtlmax ttp which approximately represents 1 of the input bromide concentration applied at the soil surface which indicates the temporal trend of the arrival of the maximum concentration of a conservative solute down to the water table iii the time after which a bromide concentration of 1 mg l is no longer observed at wtlmax tte as it represents the maximum residence time of the tracer total exit within the vz and reflects the full effects of regulation measures 3 results discussion 3 1 hydraulic properties and hydrodynamic parameters of the vz samples 3 1 1 experimental hydraulic properties the hydraulic properties of a majority of the samples concerned by this work have already been discussed in aldana et al 2021 however considering that the results obtained for all the samples have been further investigated and given that six new samples sa sb sc pa rc and rd have been considered in this work their experimental hydraulic properties are briefly discussed below the experimental hydraulic properties water retention and hydraulic conductivity of the sa and sb soil samples were relatively similar fig 3 a the sc sample displayed lower θ s and k values between pf 0 0 and 2 0 and a higher water retention between pf 1 5 and 3 0 probably due to the slight increase in clay content observed with depth aldana et al 2021 ould mohamed et al 1997 the shapes of the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves of the three fragmented powdery limestone samples pb pc and pd were close despite a δθ observed from pf 0 0 to 3 0 for sample pc fig 3 b the cryoturbated unit pa which was described by ould mohamed and bruand 1994 displayed higher k for pf 1 5 and lower k between pf 2 0 and 3 0 than the three other powdery limestone samples fig 3 b its θ values were also in good agreement with those reported by michot et al 2003 over the range of pf 1 0 4 2 water retention of calcareous sand interbeds ia and ib samples was the lowest among the soft vz materials for pf 1 0 except ia vs pc fig 3 c ib sample displayed a lower water retention capacity than ia except at saturation because of its higher sand content aldana et al 2021 as already pointed out by aldana et al 2021 the hydraulic properties of the hard limestone rock samples were highly heterogeneous fig 3 d their θ s values were the lowest of all the vz materials except for the upstream weathered rock sample ra which showed a coarse secondary porosity resulting in a strong decrease of θ between saturation and pf 1 0 their θ s values were also in good agreement with those obtained by other authors in a study conducted nearby legchenko et al 2020 the massive rock samples rb and rc displayed a nearly constant θ between saturation and pf 3 0 in contrast to the downstream weathered rock samples re and rf whose water retention decreased gradually over the same pf range compared to the weathered rock ra re and rf the k values of the massive rock samples rb rc and rd were at first much lower near saturation pf 1 5 then quite close between pf 2 0 and 3 0 3 1 2 hydrodynamic parameters fitted by the models the hydrodynamic parameters fitted with the dbm model using the retc software provided the most satisfactory description of the experimental water retention and hydraulic conductivity data for all the vz samples fig 3 compared to those obtained with the mvg fig b 1 and bbc fig b 2 models indeed r2 0 938 and aicc 104 1 values calculated with the dbm model for each sample were always higher and lower than those obtained with the mvg except r2 for rc and re and bbc except r2 for re models respectively table 2 table a 1 and table a 2 θ r values were frequently set to 0 by the retc software during the fitting procedure table 2 table a 1 and table a 2 some high values of correlations 90 have occasionally been noted between ks et α during the fitting made with the mvg and bbc models and between ks α1 and n1 and α 2 and n2 for the dbm model table 2 table a 1 and table a 2 as a reminder when a correlation higher than 90 was noted between two fitted parameters the value of one of them was set to that obtained during the first fitting round and a second round was implemented the quality of the description of the water retention curves was more impacted by the choice of the analytical model than the hydraulic conductivity curves the experimental water retention properties of the soft vz materials that mostly displayed a clear bimodal behavior notably sa sb pa pd ia and ib were poorly depicted by the mvg and bbc models especially for 0 5 pf 1 5 where retention was overestimated by the models and for 2 5 pf 4 0 where it was underestimated fig b 1 a c and fig b 2 a c higher values of parameter θ s were obtained with the mvg table a 1 and bbc table a 2 models for a majority of the soft vz samples expect sa and sb for mvg and ib for mvg and bbc compared to those fitted with the dbm model table 2 the experimental hydraulic conductivity curves of all the vz samples were generally well described by the three models which gave good fits for 1 5 pf 3 0 fig 3 fig b 1 and fig b 2 the main differences in the fitted k h curves among the three models were found in the description of the hydraulic conductivity near saturation pf 1 indeed the k values obtained by the dbm model near saturation were frequently higher or equal than those given by the mvg and bbc models except sc for mvg and bbc and ia for bbc this resulted in ks values always higher or equal for the dbm model compared to the mvg except pa ia and rb and bbc except ia models table 2 table a 1 and table a 2 the mvg and bbc models still allow a decent representation of the hydraulic properties of the vz materials with r2 0 866 except for sc and ra and aicc 85 6 for mvg and r2 0 849 except for sc and rc and aicc 75 9 for bbc table a 1 and table a 2 however the quality of the fit was better for the mvg model as the aicc values computed for each sample were generally lower than those obtained for the bbc model except for ib and ra consequently the simulations made using the hydrus 1d software concerning the influence of the choice of the analytical model on the simulation of water flow and the estimation of tt within the vz were focused on a comparison between the unimodal mvg and bimodal dbm expressions 3 2 simulation of water flow and estimation of travel time within the b2 profile since a majority of the samples were taken from the b2 profile table 2 the influence of the choice of the analytical model mvg or dbm on the simulation of water flow and the estimation of tt within the vz was studied on this profile the b2 water content profiles simulated at the date of the drilling 14 march 2017 using the mvg and dbm models were in relatively good agreement with the experimental measurements made on the undisturbed core samples on that same date r2 0 892 fig 4 b the differences in θ between the two models were rather small and the main disparities 0 05 cm3 cm3 were observed within the soil 0 1 m deep the powdery limestone facies from 2 0 to 3 5 m deep and from 5 5 to 6 6 m deep and the saturated zone below 18 m deep overestimations of experimental θ by the models were noted in the powdery limestone material pb 2 m deep and in limestone rock materials rc rd and re from 10 to 15 m deep underestimations of experimental θ by the models were observed in massive rb 8 5 m deep and downstream weathered limestone rock materials rf 16 m deep since the beauce limestone aquifer is known for its highly permeable soils and its vertical soil water flow regime bruand et al 1997 flipo et al 2012 no run off was observed during the whole simulation period 55 years and a total rainfall of 35180 mm the matric head values simulated by the dbm model in each soil layer displayed more fluctuations than those of the mvg model fig 5 and fig b 3 the soil water status simulated by the dbm model was drier lower mean values of h and characterized by more pronounced drying and wetting cycles than for the mvg model fig b 3 and table a 3 the mean downward water flux simulated within the soil was higher for the dbm model than for the mvg model table a 3 this could be attributed to the higher cumulative etr actual evapotranspiration simulated with the mvg model 30210 mm compared to the dbm model 28009 mm which resulted in a lower quantity of water infiltrating in the vz profile for the mvg model over the simulation period this was also induced by the higher soil k values observed near saturation pf 1 5 for the dbm model compared to the mvg model except sc fig 3 a fig b 1 a and fig b 2 a as a result the bromide transport simulated within the soil by the dbm model was noticeably faster than that simulated with the mvg model fig 6 a the mean water content and matric head values simulated by the models within the deep vz materials below the soil table a 3 indicated that the dbm model resulted in a globally wetter vz profile higher mean values of h compared to the mvg model although the variations of matric head values observed within the deep vz materials could seem relatively close at first sight between the two models they were in fact much more dynamic for the dbm model as highlighted by more pronounced drying and wetting cycles fig 5 and fig b 4 perched water tables were identified in the vz profiles and were caused by the low saturated hydraulic conductivity of the powdery limestone pb pc and pd for mvg and pb and pc for dbm and massive limestone rock rc fig 3 b d fig b 1 b d fig 5 and fig b 4 although these perched water tables seemed slightly more pronounced for the mvg model these were actually less frequent than for the dbm model due to the higher k near saturation pf 1 of the powdery limestone and rock materials and the more dynamic water regime of the latter in accordance with the lower mean downward water flux simulated along the vz profile table a 3 the bromide transport simulated with the mvg model from the base of the soil down to wtlmax 14 6 m deep was always slower than that simulated with the dbm model fig 6 b d finally the mean tti ttp and tte calculated from all the tt values simulated for each input year over the same period of time were always higher for the mvg model than for the dbm model whatever the period of time considered table 3 the differences in mean tt values between the dbm and mvg models were significant and higher than 5 years for tti 9 years for ttp and 14 years for tte table 3 the year of input corresponding to the minimum and maximum tti ttp and tte were relatively close between the two models fig b 5 and table 3 the most significant variations in tt simulated between the two models were noted for the years of input corresponding to a sudden increase in tt for the mvg model and which was not reproduced by the dbm model e g 1978 and 1988 for tti 1981 and 1982 for ttp fig b 5 the simulation of the water flow and the estimation of the tt made using unimodal mvg and bimodal dbm models fitted to the same experimental hydraulic properties can show large disparities 9 8 tti 23 1 years 14 6 ttp 34 9 years 27 3 tte 46 5 years the dbm model allows to better account for the impact of the macroporosity in the soft vz materials and the presence of micro fissures 1 mm thick in the hard limestone rock materials compared to the mvg model in view of all these findings and since the hydrodynamic parameters fitted with the dbm model provided the most satisfactory description of the experimental hydraulic properties the latter has been adopted for the comparative simulation of water flow and tt performed between three vz profiles reconstituted with hydrus 1d from the three boreholes b1 b2 and b3 3 3 simulation of the water flow and estimation of travel time within the vadose zone b1 b2 and b3 profiles 3 3 1 impact of the heterogeneity of the vadose zone profiles simulated θ profiles with the dbm model at the date of the drilling 14 03 2017 for the three boreholes were in good agreement with the experimental measurements made on the undisturbed core samples on that same date 0 882 r2 0 925 fig 4 experimental θ obtained for the three boreholes were generally slightly overestimated by the model notably in pb and pc materials from 1 5 to 4 0 m deep depending on the borehole and in limestone rock materials from 9 0 to 16 0 m deep the main differences between experimental and simulated θ from 0 05 to 0 10 cm3 cm3 within the three boreholes were found i in sb pa and pb materials above 2 0 m deep ii in rb materials around 8 0 m deep at the transition between the powdery limestone pd and the massive rock rb materials aldana et al 2021 which displayed high and low θ s values respectively table 2 iii in re and rf materials between 15 5 and 18 0 m deep which corresponds to the weathered limestone rock that presented a highly heterogeneous structure with an increasing evolution toward karstification fracturation and even silicification with depth mallet et al 2022 the water regime within the soil seemed to be all the more dynamic as its thickness was small as highlighted by the variations of the matric head which suggested more pronounced drying and wetting cycles in the b2 profile than in b1 and b3 profiles fig 7 a the mean values of water content matric head and water flux simulated for the three boreholes table a 4 indicated that the soil of the b3 profile was slightly wetter it also displayed a lower vertical downward water flux than b1 and b2 profiles although the three soil profiles were strictly identical down to 0 9 m deep table 1 this was attributed to the higher cumulative etr simulated within the b3 profile 28296 mm due to the larger thickness of its soil layer sc 1 2 m cf table 1 compared to b1 0 4 m and b2 0 3 m indeed the soil showed the highest water retention capacity among the vz materials fig 3 this resulted in a visible differentiation of the bromide transport between the b3 and the b2 and b1 profiles with a slightly slower leaching of bromide down to 1 2 m deep in the b3 soil profile fig 8 a the differences in soil profiles and the influence of the meteorological conditions led to an arrival time for the peak of bromide ranging from 1 3 to 5 1 years at 1 2 m deep fig 8 a which represented a travel speed ranging from 0 23 to 0 94 m yr the mean h values simulated by the dbm model in the vz materials below 2 0 m deep for the three boreholes were higher than 100 cm pf 2 0 table a 4 this revealed a global wet water status over the simulation period fig 7 b d and the occurrence of relatively high vertical downward water flux due to k values close to saturation within the vz profiles table a 4 the strong lithological similarities between the b1 and b2 profiles down to 3 5 m deep table 1 led to a comparable bromide transport within the soil and the upper powdery limestone materials pa pb and pc of the two profiles fig 8 a b the differentiation in bromide transport simulated between the b1 the slowest and b2 the fastest profiles from 3 5 m to 8 0 m deep fig 8 b d was mainly caused by the differences in thickness of the powdery limestone materials pc and pd 3 8 m for b1 and 1 6 m for b2 cf table 1 the arrival time for the peak of bromide at 3 5 m and 8 0 m deep ranged from 5 0 to 11 0 years fig 8 b and from 11 1 to 18 8 years fig 8 c respectively the peak concentration of bromide took between 3 8 and 5 9 years to migrate from 1 2 to 3 5 m deep travel speed ranging from 0 39 to 0 63 m yr and between 5 0 and 7 8 years to migrate from 3 5 to 8 0 m deep travel speed ranging from 0 58 to 0 89 m yr the mean bromide peak concentration observed at wtlmax for each vz profile was between 94 4 b3 and 104 8 mg l b2 table 4 which approximately represents 1 of the bromide input concentration 9 7 g l the lowest peak concentrations observed for b3 were caused by the higher global dispersivity of the profile thicker soil and thinner powdery limestone cf table 1 and table 2 the highest peak concentrations found for b2 profile were induced by its lower global dispersivity thinner soil and thicker rock materials cf table 1 and table 2 it is worth noting that the higher global dispersivity of the b3 profile resulted in the observation of bromide first concentrations at wtlmax tti at times close to b2 and the total exit of the bromide tte at times close to b1 fig b 6 and table 4 the mean indicators of tt for bromide to reach wtlmax 14 6 m deep were of 13 8 years for tti 9 8 tti 17 5 years 20 9 years for ttp 14 6 ttp 25 3 years and 31 5 years for tte 26 6 ttp 39 0 years table 4 the peak concentration of bromide was transported from the soil surface down to wtlmax at a mean travel speed of 0 70 m yr min 0 58 m yr and max 1 00 m yr and took between 5 8 and 8 3 years to migrate through the limestone rock facies from 8 0 m deep down to wtlmax travel speed ranging from 0 79 to 1 15 m yr fig 8 d for a given year of input tti and ttp were always the largest for the b1 profile and the smallest for the b2 profile and tte was always the largest for the b3 profile and the smallest for the b2 profile fig b 6 differences of up to 3 6 b1 b2 1979 3 5 b1 b2 1975 and 4 7 years b3 b2 1977 were observed regarding tti ttp and tte respectively fig b 6 the impact of the lateral variations in the vz profiles lithological differences at small scale 15 m cf fig 1 on the variations of the tt was relatively small this is a consequence of the overall wet status observed over the simulation period within the vz materials located below the soil fig 7 b d and table a 4 which induced a leaching of bromide mainly impacted by k values close to saturation 3 3 2 impact of the meteorological conditions as previously underlined by some authors sprenger et al 2016 vero et al 2014 meteorological conditions have a strong influence on the variation of tt through the vz maximum differences in the tt indicators according to input years for each vz profile varied from 7 0 b1 to 7 2 b3 years for tti from 8 2 b1 to 9 5 b3 years for ttp and from 7 4 b2 to 9 7 b3 years for tte table 4 the variations of the tt observed within a single vz profile over the simulation period were higher than those observed between the three vz profiles for a given year of input fig b 6 and table 4 it appeared that in the case of a globally wet vz the meteorological conditions had more influence on the variations of the tt within the vz than the small scale lateral variations of its profile lithological composition positive values of matric head were noted in several vz materials located above the least permeable materials pb pc and rc fig 3 b d and fig 7 b c and appeared in years showing annual r etp balance close or above 0 mm such as 1978 1984 1988 or 2001 2002 cf fig 2 this indicates that perched water tables may have occurred in the vz profiles caused by accumulation of water above these weakly permeable materials the building up of perched water tables were highlighted in the soft vz materials up to a depth of 0 7 m and in the limestone rock from about 11 m deep up to a depth of 7 m fig 7 c d and fig b 4 b given the high lithological heterogeneity of the vz materials these perched water tables will however probably be less significant at the 3d field scale because of the lateral movement of water into open fractures or karst networks situated within the vz aldana et al 2021 mallet et al 2022 the tt variations were tightly correlated with meteorological conditions and water table level data that were used as boundary conditions over the simulation period the relatively slow leaching of bromide observed in the vz mean travel speed 0 70 m yr could be partly explained by the low mean annual rainfall 639 6 mm and the high mean annual etp 813 7 mm observed over the simulation period fig 2 and also by the low hydraulic conductivity even near saturation of the powdery limestone pb pc and pd and the massive rock rb and rc materials fig 3 b d the relatively faster leaching of bromide corresponding to low tt observed for inputs made between 1968 and 1975 fig b 6 could be explained by the meteorological conditions observed between 1977 and 1984 when annual r etp balances were close or above 0 mm and when wtl was rising fig 2 the global slowdown of the leaching of bromide corresponding to a general increase in tt observed for inputs made from the late 1970s fig b 6 was strongly influenced by the small annual rainfall and the lowering of the wtl observed from 1989 to 1998 2003 to 2011 and 2015 to 2020 fig 2 and may be a consequence of global warming indeed it is worth noting that from 1989 to 2020 only two years of input showed a positive annual r etp balance 1999 and 2001 while an increase in mean annual temperature of 1 0 c and etp of 98 mm was noted compared to the 1968 1988 period fig 2 as highlighted by the trends observed for tti since the end of the 1990s fig b 6 a further increase in tt for inputs made after 2000 is expected as a response to the global increase in mean annual temperature and etp observed since 2015 maximum of 12 8 c and 1044 mm observed in 2020 associated with a strongly negative annual r etp balance fig 2 3 4 limitation of the work the results obtained and discussed in this study focused on the simulation of the movement of water and bromide in the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer at the core scale it has been well established that interconnected fractures or karst networks may act as preferential flow paths leading to faster water and solute transport chen et al 2019 mcling et al 2017 wood et al 2004 notably after heavy rainfall events and thus only under or close to fully saturated conditions wellings and bell 1980 some authors suggested that several tens of percent of the total flow in the vz could be transported through fractures smith et al 1970 as shown on fig 9 natural fractures with karstification were observed at the field scale and were found to have been episodically subjected to intense water flow under or close to fully saturated conditions aldana et al 2021 mallet et al 2022 the simulations carried out in this work showed the possible occurrence of perched water tables within the vz which might generate preferential water flow through these open fractures networks especially in the case of very rainy years this would result in a faster solute transport within the fracture porosity which could be simulated by the use of a dual permeability model šimůnek et al 2003 this modeling approach has proven to be useful for taking into account the contribution of preferential flow and representing the water flow and solute transport between fractures and matrix aguilar lópez et al 2020 köhne et al 2002 recent work also showed that even if a dual porosity model was capable of adequately describing the arrival of the measured initial concentrations and the shape of the breakthrough curves of bromide at the base of a loamy soil only the dual permeability model used with the inclusion of a mobile immobile water component mim provided a good ability to identify the arrival of peak concentrations varvaris et al 2021b the identification and characterization of these open fractures networks and the understanding of their functioning will consequently be crucial for complementing our knowledge of water flow travel time and contaminant transport through the vulnerable beauce limestone aquifer 4 summary and conclusion in this study the numerical simulation of water flow and the estimation of water travel time through the highly heterogeneous vz of a limestone aquifer was undertaken over a period of 55 years the parameterization of the model hydrus 1d was based on hydraulic properties laboratory measurements performed on fifteen samples representative of the lithologies encountered within the vz using unimodal mvg and bimodal dbm approaches three heterogeneous vz profiles were reconstituted in hydrus 1d based on three boreholes drilled in march 2017 daily rainfall etp and water table level data were used as inputs for the implementation of a virtual bromide tracing experiment made over the 55 years the arrival time of the initial breakthrough tti the peak ttp and the total exit of the bromide concentration tte at the maximum water table level were considered as suitable indicators of water travel time within the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer the results obtained in this work highlighted that the experimental hydraulic properties of the samples were more accurately described by the dbm model the latter allowed a precise description of the bimodal characteristic of the vz materials i e macro and micro porosity for the soil powdery limestone and calcareous sand samples and matrix and micro fissures porosity for the limestone rock the choice of the analytical model used to describe the vz hydraulic properties mvg or dbm showed a significant influence on the simulation of the water flow and tt within the vz the results of the simulations carried out with the two models displayed strong discrepancies regarding the water flow dynamics matric head and water content variations through the vz and showed large differences in tt occasionally higher than 10 years for tti and ttp and 15 years for tte these disparities were mainly attributed to the differences observed in the water flow dynamics simulated in the soil and the higher hydraulic conductivity values obtained with the dbm model for the vz materials located below the soil over the range of matric head h 250 cm observed during the simulation period a mean tti of 13 8 years min 9 8 max 17 5 ttp of 20 9 years min 14 6 max 25 3 and tte of 31 5 years min 26 6 max 39 0 were found for the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer with simulations carried out using the dbm model the vertical heterogeneity of the properties of the vz materials showed a strong influence on the simulation of the water flow and the estimation of tt significant differences were found in the travel speed of the peak concentrations of bromide through the vz materials which was the fastest in the limestone rock facies max of 1 15 m yr and the slowest in the powdery limestone facies max of 0 63 m yr despite the lithological differences observed between the three vz profiles only slight variations were found regarding the water flow dynamics and the tt max 4 7 years whatever the indicator between the three boreholes this small impact of the lateral heterogeneities was mainly attributed to the global wet status found in the vz materials located below the soil which led to hydraulic conductivities always close to saturation and consequently hardly noticeable differences between the three vz profiles the meteorological conditions have shown a large influence on the variations of the tt through the vz max 9 7 years whatever the indicator together with the rise of the mean annual temperature and etp over the simulation period an increase in tt was noted since the late 1970s becoming even more apparent after the late 1990s and may be a consequence of global warming in the case of this mostly unconfined aquifer this could mean that the impact of the regulatory measures that have been put into effect since the beginning of the 1990s e g the nitrates directive european commission 1991 for the preservation of groundwater resources may not yet be clearly identifiable today and that it could take progressively longer to identify such impacts in the future the results presented in this work were obtained with fifteen samples selected along the whole vz profile and represent a first step towards capturing and deciphering in depth the high heterogeneity of the vz materials and characterizing the complexity of the transfer through the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer aldana et al 2021 mallet et al 2022 it will indeed be necessary to improve our knowledge about the vertical and lateral flow of water and solute through the whole porosity of this highly heterogeneous vz by conducting extensive studies at larger scales combining 3d experimental observations and numerical simulations with dual permeability approaches to this end noninvasive hydrogeophysical monitoring tools seem to represent a worthwhile solution for mapping geological facies properties and linking measured geophysical parameters to the hydraulic properties of the vz materials binley et al 2015 parsekian et al 2015 romero ruiz et al 2018 when combined with the use of well established or advanced in situ methods in the vz i e tracer tests and fracture networks characterization mcling et al 2017 sprenger et al 2016 or in the saturated zone pumping slug or tracer tests binet et al 2017 mosthaf et al 2018 such tools should lead to a refined hydraulic characterization of the materials and a more accurate assessment of the travel time of water and the fate of contaminants through this highly vulnerable limestone aquifer of major importance credit

3336,the increasing global vegetation aggravated the consumption of soil water and caused soil desiccation which may result in a threat to the survival and sustainability of vegetation especially in semi arid and arid areas how to solve soil water deficit caused by afforestation is an important practical problem here a field experiment of soil water infiltration and replenishment was conducted before and after forestland to farmland conversion results showed that the cumulative infiltration of each stage the initial stage the transitional stage and the stable stage was the highest in farmland followed by forest interspace and the lowest in forest understory the non capillary porosity at 0 20 cm soil layer in farmland was higher than that in forest understory and interspace which positively improved the infiltration accumulation in the initial stage thus the cumulative infiltration in initial stage of farmland 28 93 mm was significantly higher than that of forest understory 19 45 mm moreover soil water at the depth of 0 160 cm soil layer was replenished with short term after forestland to farmland conversion it is concluded that forestland to farmland conversion could improve soil water infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration by changing porosity and effectively replenished soil water storage in the short term these findings have potential implications for effective mitigation of soil water deficit caused by afforestation and provide a new idea or method for the solution to dry soil layers caused by artificial forestland in semi arid areas keywords forestland to farmland conversion soil porosity soil water infiltration soil water replenishment semi arid area 1 introduction global climate change is expected to cause drought events to become more frequent and severe meehl and tebaldi 2004 carnicer et al 2011 peng et al 2011 anthropogenic also alter surface hydrological processes including evapotranspiration infiltration runoff and soil water storage and thus influence the trend of drought van loon et al 2016 afforestation is one of the most important human activities that change land cover the response of vegetation is more sensitive to drought in arid and semiarid regions where the growing evaporative is hard to be satisfied by rainfall carnicer et al 2011 sherwood and fu 2014 global vegetation greening is an important reason for the increase of evapotranspiration afforestation is an important practice for ecological restoration during the design phases tree species with the high ability to tolerate lean soils and to rapidly recover the degraded environments were selected unfortunately the constant pursuit of rapid growth and greater coverage often causes serious water shortage liu et al 2018 water deficit is the key issue that impacts the sustainability of afforestation drought induced tree mortality and vegetation browning across the world is generally reported peng et al 2011 carnicer et al 2011 pan et al 2018 thus it is important to estimate the soil water deficit that induced by afforestation and to seek the moderate practice to remit the negative effects of soil water deficit at present intermediate thinning is widely used to solve the problems of drought induced mortality manrique alba et al 2020 niccoli et al 2020 however huang et al 2020 reported that forest can induce the significant decrease of soil water storage in the afforestation cropland interface the influence of the afforestation on farmland was as far as 1 3 m and 160 170 cm depth in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively huang et al 2020 the water supplement efficiency of thinning is slow although thinning can alleviate soil moisture desiccation to a certain extent meanwhile afforestation usually takes up arable land and threats agricultural production especially in agriculture regions thus intermediate cutting may not be a reasonable practice to release soil water shortage in afforestation cropland system nevertheless forests restoration can cause the increase of soil infiltrability from another perspective lozano baez et al 2019 infiltration is a key factor in hydrological processes playing an important role in influencing soil moisture content and groundwater recharge the decay of tree roots can affect soil infiltration and soil water recharge and the effects is more obvious with the increasing decay years wu et al 2021 nowadays to guarantee the cultivated area many areas of forestland in afforestation cropland were convert to farmland the large tree roots are eliminated while the fine roots remain in the soil which influence soil structure and infiltration cui et al 2019a meanwhile forestland to farmland conversion on flat land cannot cause soil erosion of farmland and deterioration of ecological problems consequently forestland to farmland conversion on flat land may be a new way to reduce the negative effects and promote agricultural production in arid and semi arid agroforestry system however to our knowledge there are few studies on the effects of forestland to cropland conversion on soil structure and infiltrability in agroforestry systems it is also worth noting that infiltration has significance on effect soil water recharge especially in arid and semi arid regions in the present study therefore we firstly evaluated the shortage of soil water content in an approximately 15 year old forestland we put forward the hypothesis that soil water deficit will be restored in a short term within 5 years in forestland to farmland system conversion the current study therefore aimed to 1 evaluate whether there is the deficit of soil water storage in a approximately 15 year old artificial forestland and 2 examine the changes in soil structure soil water infiltration and soil water supplement in a forestland to farmland conversion and 3 further determine if soil water deficit can be restored in a short term in the forestland to farmland system conversion this study has realistic implications for understanding the contribution of the forestland to farmland system conversion to soil water replenishment caused by afforestation in semi arid and arid areas especially for soil desiccation areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted on xiaqu township wenshui county lvliang city in shanxi provincen 37 21 n 112 08 e this area is characterized by a semi arid region and temperate continental monsoon climate with an average altitude of 745 m and an annual average temperature of 10 1 the average annual precipitation is 457 mm and most of the rainfall events mainly occur from july to september the soil in this area is alfisols according to thesoil classification wrb 2014 since the implementation of the policy of the grain for green program sophora japonica s japonica have been widely planted in this region 2 2 experimental design to determine the effect of forestland to farmland conversion on soil water storage two experimental sites were selected and each site contained three different land use stages interspace of forestland understory of forestland and farmland converted from forestland as the experimental treatments fig 1 in this study the forestland interspace was used as a control to compare the changes of soil water content after the forestland converted into farmland the interspace of forestlandrefers to the treatment that the soil sample collection and infiltration experiment were completed in the center plot of four trees the understory of forestland refers to the treatment that soil sample collection and infiltration experiment were completed in the plot near the tree stumps three plots 10 m 10 m were randomly established for each treatment all sampling sites of the three land use stages treatments are adjacent fig 1 and the distances are less than 100 m hence all plots have similar soil texture and all field plots we selected are on flat ground with almost zero slope the forestlands selected in this study were artificially planted with s japonica forest for a long term over 15 years the plant spacing and row spacing of s japonica was about 120 cm and 160 cm respectively by investigating the characteristics of trees in each plot the tree density and diameter at breast height dbh were 5316 699 trees per hectare and 15 733 5 64 cm respectively a part of forestland was converted into farmland in 2019 and the converted farmland was planted with corn every year before planting corn stumps and shallow coarse roots were removed from the converted farmland while fine roots remained in the soil the plant spacing and row spacing of corn was about 30 cm and 50 cm respectively moreover a part of forestland was cut down in 2020 leaving a large number of tree stumps which provided conditions for infiltration experiment of forestland understory in the infiltration experiment and soil sample collection we set one replicate for each plot so there were 6 replicates for each treatment 2 3 measurement of infiltration rates although the double ring infiltrometer consumes a lot of water and takes a long time it is still the most common and classic method for measuring soil permeability in the field and it is also the basis for judging the results of other methods angulo jaramillo et al 2000 walsh and mcdonnell 2012 zhang et al 2016 the soil infiltration capacity of the three treatments was measured with a double ring infiltrometer consisting of an outer ring with a diameter of 35 cm and an inner ring with a diameter of 20 cm the specific operation steps of the entire infiltration process in this experiment referred to zhang et al 2017 and wu et al 2021 the specific measuring position of forestland interspace was randomly selected in a flat ground at the center of four trees the double ring infiltrometer was inserted into the soil containing the tree stump to measure the soil infiltration rate of forestland understory fig 1 a flat ground was randomly selected in each plot of the farmland converted from forestland to measure soil infiltration rate each treatment stage contains a total of 6 replicates in order to minimize the impact on the soil structure the infiltration meter was gently inserted into the soil about 8 cm in the vertical direction and litter and leaves on the topsoil were gently removed to reduce errors in water level changes a piece of 8 8 cm plastic was placed on the soil surface in the double ring to prevent damage to the original soil structure by adding water liu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 water was quickly injected into the inner ring and outer ring until the water level was 4 cm high and then the time for the water level of the inner ring to drop by 5 mm was recorded when the water level in the ring dropped to 1 cm depth the water was refilled into the ring until the water level was 4 cm depth the measurement of this infiltration experiment was stopped if the infiltration time of three consecutive measurements remains unchanged the soil water infiltration rate was determined by the recorded time wu et al 2021 all infiltration experiments were performed in late june 2021 2 4 soil sampling and analysis in each plot 10 m 10 m we randomly selected a point and used a cylindrical steel ring with a volume of 100 cm3 to collect 5 soil cores the soil samples were collected from 0 50 cm soil layers at 10 cm intervals therefore there were 6 repetitions of soil samples in the same soil layer for each treatment a total of 90 soil samples the height and diameter of cylindrical steel ring are 50 46 mm and 50 24 mm respectively all soil sample collections were also completed in late june 2021 all 90 soil cores were brought back to the laboratory for measurement and analysis of soil bulk density soil saturation water capacity soil capillary water capacity field capacity soil total porosity soil capillary porosity and soil non capillary porosity the steel cylindrical rings were placed in a flat container after removing the upper covers and then water was poured into the flat container until the water surface was the same height as the top of the steel cylindrical ring the soil of the cylindrical steel ring was weighed as m1 g after fully absorbing water for more than 48 h m1 was the weight after removing the bottom cover the steel cylindrical rings with the upper and bottom covers removed were placed in a flat container filled with dry sand at the bottom and weighed as m2 g and m3 g after 2 h and 48 h respectively then all the soil in steel cylindrical ringswere oven dried at 105 c for more than 72 h and its weight was named m4 soil bulk density soil saturation water capacity soil capillary water capacity and field capacity were calculated using equation 1 2 3 and 4 according to zhang et al 1999 and cui et al 2019a 1 smc m 1 m 4 m 4 m 2 cmc m 2 m 4 m 4 m 3 fmc m 3 m 4 m 4 m 4 bd m 4 m v where smc cmc fmc and bd represent soil saturation water capacity soil capillary water capacity field capacity and soil bulk density g cm 3 respectively v is the volume of the steel cylindrical rings cm3 m is the weight of the steel cylindrical ring after removing the upper and bottom covers g soil total porosity soil capillary porosity and soil non capillary porosity were calculated using eqs 5 6 and 7 according to wu et al 2016 5 tp 1 bd ds 100 6 cp c m c b d

where sws is the soil water storage mm d is the soil depth cm bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 swc is the soil water content fc is the field capacity mm 2 5 statistical analysis we used a power function to fit the relationship between the soil water infiltration rate and the infiltration time the change rate of the infiltration rate was obtained by calculating the slope of the fitting equation according to the change rate of soil infiltration rate we divided the process of soil infiltration into three stages the initial infiltration stage for the first 8 min the transitional infiltration stage for 8 75 min and the stable infiltration stage for 75 120 min one way analysis of variance anova was used to compare the difference in cumulative infiltration of each stage initial stage transitional stage and stable stage between different treatments then we used correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between cumulative infiltration and various soil physical properties soil capillary porosity and soil non capillary porosity and one way analysis of variance anova was also used to compare the differences in soil water content between different treatments significant differences were tested at the 0 05 confidence level all statistical analyses and figures were performed with cor r 4 1 2 r core group 2021 and spss 22 0 ibm usa software 3 results 3 1 forestland to farmland conversion changed soil porosity properties and soil water holding capacity there were significant differences in soil water holding capacity capillary moisture capacity field moisture capacity and saturation moisture capacity among different treatments fig 2 a the soil capillary water capacity field capacity and soil saturation water capacity in forest understory were higher than those in forest interspace and in farmland while the difference in soil water holding capacity between forest interspace and farmland was weaker in general the soil capillary porosity in forest understory was higher than that in forest interspace and in farmland the total porosity at farmland in 0 20 cm soil layer was higher than that in forest interspace the non capillary porosity in 0 20 cm soil layer in farmland was higher than that in forest understory and interspace while the difference of non capillary porosity in 20 50 cm soil layer among different treatments was weaker fig 2b 3 2 forestland to farmland conversion increased soil water infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration the relationship between soil water infiltration rate and infiltration time showed the same trend in the process of forestland to farmland conversion fig 3 specifically the soil water infiltration rate showed a power function decreasing trend with the infiltration time and its decreasing rate gradually reduced with the infiltration time fig 3a b the cumulative infiltration of each stage the initial stage the transitional stage and the stable stage was the highest in farmland followed by forest interspace and the lowest in forest understory moreover the cumulative infiltration of farmland was higher than that of understory and interspace of forestland especially in the initial infiltration stage fig 3 fig 4 although there was no significant difference in the cumulative infiltration amount among the three treatments farmland forest understory and forest interspace in the transitional stage and the stable stage there was a significant difference in the total cumulative infiltration the cumulative infiltration in initial stage of farmland 28 93 mm was significantly higher than that of forest understory 19 45 mm the cumulative infiltration at each stage initial stage transition stage and stable stage was negatively correlated with soil capillary porosity while positively correlated with soil non capillary porosity of 0 30 cm fig 5 the infiltration accumulation in the initial stage was mainly positively affected by the non capillary porosity of 0 20 cm and the cumulative infiltration in the transition and stable stage was mainly positively affected by the non capillary porosity of 20 30 cm 3 3 forestland to farmland conversion effectively replenished soil water storage in general the soil water content decreased with soil depth but there are differences among different treatments fig 6 a the mean soil water content of farmland 23 22 at the soil depth of 0 160 cm was significantly higher than that of forest interspace 16 12 and forest understory 14 86 while the mean soil water content of three treatments at the soil depth of 160 400 cm showed non significant difference fig 6b therefore the trees in forestland mainly consumed soil water at the soil depth of 0 160 cm but consumed less soil water from the soil depth of 160 400 cm the long term planting of s japonica has caused a serious water deficitin the 0 160 cm soil layer of the forestland fig 7 a the soil water content of farmland in the 0 160 cm soil layer was about 44 04 and 56 26 higher than that of forest interspace and forest understory respectively fig 7b thus the soil water at the depth of 0 160 cm soil layer was replenished in the short term after forestland to farmland conversion 4 discussions as a vegetation measure to control soil erosion and prevent environmental degradation afforestation has been implemented on a large scale in the loess plateau since the early 1950s cao et al 2009 jia and shao 2014 chen et al 2015 jia et al 2017 however large scale vegetation restoration e g pinus tabulaeformis carr robinia pseudoacacia linn populus cathayanarehd caragana korshinskii kom can affect soil moisture dynamics by changing rainfall infiltration evapotranspiration and surface runoff jia et al 2017 liu et al 2018 studies have shown that extensive afforestation in the loess plateau exacerbated the consumption of soil reservoirs and led to the formation of dry soil layers jia and shao 2014 liu et al 2018 for example the soil water content of the caragana korshinskii plot has a much higher decline rate than that of the agricultural plot which indicates that planting caragana korshinskii could aggravate the consumption of soil water jia and shao 2014 jia et al 2017 this is consistent with our results that is the mean soil water content of forestland interspace 16 12 in the soil layer of 0 160 cm was significantly lower than that offarmland 23 22 meanwhile by analyzing the influence of different tree species on soil moisture in the loess plateau liu et al 2018 found that salix matsudana and populus cathayana mainly consumed shallow soil moisture 0 100 cm and deep soil moisture 100 150 cm respectively soil water content also decreases with the increase of vegetation planting years which may lead to or aggregate soil desiccation jia et al 2017 liu et al 2018 huang et al 2018 our research also showed that the long term planting of s japonica has caused a serious water deficitin the 0 160 cm soil layer of the forestland therefore the long term planting of trees may limit the growth of trees and even lead to their death due to lack of water rainfall is the only source of replenishment of soil moisture in this area so it is particularly important to improve the efficiency of soil moisture replenishment during rainfall the soil infiltration rate is an important indicator for evaluating the speed of water movement in the soil during rainfall wu et al 2016 cui et al 2019a döbert et al 2021 soil pores are one of the main ways for water to flow in the soil so it significantly affects the infiltration rate of soil water bormann and klaassen 2008 alaoui 2015 leung et al 2015 wu et al 2016 huang et al 2017 cui et al 2019a studies have shown that soil with proper soil structure and high porosity could greatly improve soil infiltration capacity six et al 2004 neris et al 2012 fischer et al 2014 wu et al 2016 cui et al 2019b wu et al 2021 the growth and decay of roots during vegetation restoration may promote soil water infiltration of grassland by increasing soil macropores in the topsoil gould et al 2016 cui et al 2019b döbert et al 2021 by measuring the soil physical properties and infiltration rates of five different artificial grasslands in semi arid areas cui et al 2019b found that plant roots could increase soil porosity and soil aggregates thereby significantly improving soil infiltration capacity however our results showed that the soil infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration rate of forestland interspace were obviously higher than those of forestland understory the logic behind this is that because root diameter is one of the main factors that determine root decomposition there is a significant difference in the decomposition rate of coarse roots and fine roots eissenstat et al 2000 wells and eissenstat 2001 zhang and wang 2015 grass root systems have smaller root diameter and faster decomposition rate thereby promo the formation of large pores and rapid water infiltration in the forestland understory however the main roots of trees which are difficult to decompose could squeeze the soil resulting in decreases in soil porosity and thus soil infiltration rate importantly the cumulative infiltration of each stage initial stage transitional stage and stable stage was the highest in farmland followed by forest interspace and the lowest in forest understory this is because main roots of trees in the soil were removed during forestland to farmland conversion which increased the soil non capillary porosity thereby promoting the rapid infiltration of water into the soil meanwhile removal of forest roots opens the root channel and forms preferential water pathways which may further increase the water infiltration in general the soil in forest understory has better water holding capacity while the soil in farmland has a pore structure that is more conducive to water transport hence farmland mainly increases the soil total porosity by increasing the non capillary porosity thereby promoting the infiltration of water during rainfall the serious shortage of soil moisture in forestland affects and restrictsthe growth of vegetation in semi arid areas jia and shao 2014 jia et al 2017 liu et al 2018 huang et al 2020 therefore the rapid replenishment of soil moisture in forestland is particularly important for vegetation restoration in semi arid areas by thinning the trees forestland with water and soil conservation as well as wind proof and sand fixing functions can reduce water consumption by tree growth meanwhile the decayed roots produced by forest thinning can form large pores thereby promoting soil water infiltration and water replenishment wu et al 2021 wu et al 2021 found that the soil water supplement of plots with decayed rootsless than 5 years was only 37 12 higher than that of bare land our results showed that soil water content of farmland at the soil depth of 0 160 cm was about 44 04 and 56 26 higher than that of forest interspace and forest understory which indicates that the soil water at 0 160 cm soil layer was replenished in the short term after forestland to farmland conversion after forestland to farmland conversion removing tree roots in the forestland can contribute to the formation of non capillary porosity soil non capillary pores are usually also called macropores which dominate the transport of water and solute in the soil vogeler et al 2006 besson et al 2011 water and solute can bypass the solution in the soil matrix and transport rapidly through non capillary pores besson et al 2011 therefore the soil after forestland to farmland conversion has a pore structure that is more conducive to water transport which promotes the water infiltration and effective supplement during rainfall as the country with the largest population china s food security is very important to people s life and social stability the food security is essentially the issue of cultivated land security in china in the past few decades there has been a phenomenon of planting fast growing forests on a large area of cultivated land in northern china sun and qi 2010 xin and wang 2014 it was reported that the fast growing forest in northern china was about 8 28 million hectaresin 2015 sun 2012 a large part of the land occupied by the expansion of fast growing forests comes from cultivated land which leaded to less cultivated land resources and threatens the supply of food xin and wang 2014 to ensure food security and protect basic farmland artificial forestland on low slopes may be a good measure forestland to farmland conversion can increase the area of cultivated land and ensure food security in the short term forestland to farmland conversion can also improve soil pore structure and increase non capillary porosity which can quickly replenish soil moisture and alleviate soil deficit meanwhile forestland to farmland conversion on flat land cannot cause soil erosion of farmland and deterioration of ecological problems therefore forestland to farmland conversion not only can alleviate the pressure of cultivated land reduction but also can be used as an effective measure to alleviate soil desiccation caused by artificial forestland in semi arid areas 5 conclusions this study found that forestland to farmland conversion could change soil porosity properties and soil water holding capacity further increasing infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration of soil water and effectively replenishing soil water storage in the short term the infiltration accumulation in the all stage was mainly positively affected by the non capillary porosity of 0 20 cm soil depths forestland to farmland conversion significantly improved the cumulative infiltration for each stage we also found that the cumulative infiltration in initial stage of farmland 28 93 mm was significantly higher than that of forest understory 19 45 mm the soil water at the

3336,the increasing global vegetation aggravated the consumption of soil water and caused soil desiccation which may result in a threat to the survival and sustainability of vegetation especially in semi arid and arid areas how to solve soil water deficit caused by afforestation is an important practical problem here a field experiment of soil water infiltration and replenishment was conducted before and after forestland to farmland conversion results showed that the cumulative infiltration of each stage the initial stage the transitional stage and the stable stage was the highest in farmland followed by forest interspace and the lowest in forest understory the non capillary porosity at 0 20 cm soil layer in farmland was higher than that in forest understory and interspace which positively improved the infiltration accumulation in the initial stage thus the cumulative infiltration in initial stage of farmland 28 93 mm was significantly higher than that of forest understory 19 45 mm moreover soil water at the depth of 0 160 cm soil layer was replenished with short term after forestland to farmland conversion it is concluded that forestland to farmland conversion could improve soil water infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration by changing porosity and effectively replenished soil water storage in the short term these findings have potential implications for effective mitigation of soil water deficit caused by afforestation and provide a new idea or method for the solution to dry soil layers caused by artificial forestland in semi arid areas keywords forestland to farmland conversion soil porosity soil water infiltration soil water replenishment semi arid area 1 introduction global climate change is expected to cause drought events to become more frequent and severe meehl and tebaldi 2004 carnicer et al 2011 peng et al 2011 anthropogenic also alter surface hydrological processes including evapotranspiration infiltration runoff and soil water storage and thus influence the trend of drought van loon et al 2016 afforestation is one of the most important human activities that change land cover the response of vegetation is more sensitive to drought in arid and semiarid regions where the growing evaporative is hard to be satisfied by rainfall carnicer et al 2011 sherwood and fu 2014 global vegetation greening is an important reason for the increase of evapotranspiration afforestation is an important practice for ecological restoration during the design phases tree species with the high ability to tolerate lean soils and to rapidly recover the degraded environments were selected unfortunately the constant pursuit of rapid growth and greater coverage often causes serious water shortage liu et al 2018 water deficit is the key issue that impacts the sustainability of afforestation drought induced tree mortality and vegetation browning across the world is generally reported peng et al 2011 carnicer et al 2011 pan et al 2018 thus it is important to estimate the soil water deficit that induced by afforestation and to seek the moderate practice to remit the negative effects of soil water deficit at present intermediate thinning is widely used to solve the problems of drought induced mortality manrique alba et al 2020 niccoli et al 2020 however huang et al 2020 reported that forest can induce the significant decrease of soil water storage in the afforestation cropland interface the influence of the afforestation on farmland was as far as 1 3 m and 160 170 cm depth in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively huang et al 2020 the water supplement efficiency of thinning is slow although thinning can alleviate soil moisture desiccation to a certain extent meanwhile afforestation usually takes up arable land and threats agricultural production especially in agriculture regions thus intermediate cutting may not be a reasonable practice to release soil water shortage in afforestation cropland system nevertheless forests restoration can cause the increase of soil infiltrability from another perspective lozano baez et al 2019 infiltration is a key factor in hydrological processes playing an important role in influencing soil moisture content and groundwater recharge the decay of tree roots can affect soil infiltration and soil water recharge and the effects is more obvious with the increasing decay years wu et al 2021 nowadays to guarantee the cultivated area many areas of forestland in afforestation cropland were convert to farmland the large tree roots are eliminated while the fine roots remain in the soil which influence soil structure and infiltration cui et al 2019a meanwhile forestland to farmland conversion on flat land cannot cause soil erosion of farmland and deterioration of ecological problems consequently forestland to farmland conversion on flat land may be a new way to reduce the negative effects and promote agricultural production in arid and semi arid agroforestry system however to our knowledge there are few studies on the effects of forestland to cropland conversion on soil structure and infiltrability in agroforestry systems it is also worth noting that infiltration has significance on effect soil water recharge especially in arid and semi arid regions in the present study therefore we firstly evaluated the shortage of soil water content in an approximately 15 year old forestland we put forward the hypothesis that soil water deficit will be restored in a short term within 5 years in forestland to farmland system conversion the current study therefore aimed to 1 evaluate whether there is the deficit of soil water storage in a approximately 15 year old artificial forestland and 2 examine the changes in soil structure soil water infiltration and soil water supplement in a forestland to farmland conversion and 3 further determine if soil water deficit can be restored in a short term in the forestland to farmland system conversion this study has realistic implications for understanding the contribution of the forestland to farmland system conversion to soil water replenishment caused by afforestation in semi arid and arid areas especially for soil desiccation areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted on xiaqu township wenshui county lvliang city in shanxi provincen 37 21 n 112 08 e this area is characterized by a semi arid region and temperate continental monsoon climate with an average altitude of 745 m and an annual average temperature of 10 1 the average annual precipitation is 457 mm and most of the rainfall events mainly occur from july to september the soil in this area is alfisols according to thesoil classification wrb 2014 since the implementation of the policy of the grain for green program sophora japonica s japonica have been widely planted in this region 2 2 experimental design to determine the effect of forestland to farmland conversion on soil water storage two experimental sites were selected and each site contained three different land use stages interspace of forestland understory of forestland and farmland converted from forestland as the experimental treatments fig 1 in this study the forestland interspace was used as a control to compare the changes of soil water content after the forestland converted into farmland the interspace of forestlandrefers to the treatment that the soil sample collection and infiltration experiment were completed in the center plot of four trees the understory of forestland refers to the treatment that soil sample collection and infiltration experiment were completed in the plot near the tree stumps three plots 10 m 10 m were randomly established for each treatment all sampling sites of the three land use stages treatments are adjacent fig 1 and the distances are less than 100 m hence all plots have similar soil texture and all field plots we selected are on flat ground with almost zero slope the forestlands selected in this study were artificially planted with s japonica forest for a long term over 15 years the plant spacing and row spacing of s japonica was about 120 cm and 160 cm respectively by investigating the characteristics of trees in each plot the tree density and diameter at breast height dbh were 5316 699 trees per hectare and 15 733 5 64 cm respectively a part of forestland was converted into farmland in 2019 and the converted farmland was planted with corn every year before planting corn stumps and shallow coarse roots were removed from the converted farmland while fine roots remained in the soil the plant spacing and row spacing of corn was about 30 cm and 50 cm respectively moreover a part of forestland was cut down in 2020 leaving a large number of tree stumps which provided conditions for infiltration experiment of forestland understory in the infiltration experiment and soil sample collection we set one replicate for each plot so there were 6 replicates for each treatment 2 3 measurement of infiltration rates although the double ring infiltrometer consumes a lot of water and takes a long time it is still the most common and classic method for measuring soil permeability in the field and it is also the basis for judging the results of other methods angulo jaramillo et al 2000 walsh and mcdonnell 2012 zhang et al 2016 the soil infiltration capacity of the three treatments was measured with a double ring infiltrometer consisting of an outer ring with a diameter of 35 cm and an inner ring with a diameter of 20 cm the specific operation steps of the entire infiltration process in this experiment referred to zhang et al 2017 and wu et al 2021 the specific measuring position of forestland interspace was randomly selected in a flat ground at the center of four trees the double ring infiltrometer was inserted into the soil containing the tree stump to measure the soil infiltration rate of forestland understory fig 1 a flat ground was randomly selected in each plot of the farmland converted from forestland to measure soil infiltration rate each treatment stage contains a total of 6 replicates in order to minimize the impact on the soil structure the infiltration meter was gently inserted into the soil about 8 cm in the vertical direction and litter and leaves on the topsoil were gently removed to reduce errors in water level changes a piece of 8 8 cm plastic was placed on the soil surface in the double ring to prevent damage to the original soil structure by adding water liu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 water was quickly injected into the inner ring and outer ring until the water level was 4 cm high and then the time for the water level of the inner ring to drop by 5 mm was recorded when the water level in the ring dropped to 1 cm depth the water was refilled into the ring until the water level was 4 cm depth the measurement of this infiltration experiment was stopped if the infiltration time of three consecutive measurements remains unchanged the soil water infiltration rate was determined by the recorded time wu et al 2021 all infiltration experiments were performed in late june 2021 2 4 soil sampling and analysis in each plot 10 m 10 m we randomly selected a point and used a cylindrical steel ring with a volume of 100 cm3 to collect 5 soil cores the soil samples were collected from 0 50 cm soil layers at 10 cm intervals therefore there were 6 repetitions of soil samples in the same soil layer for each treatment a total of 90 soil samples the height and diameter of cylindrical steel ring are 50 46 mm and 50 24 mm respectively all soil sample collections were also completed in late june 2021 all 90 soil cores were brought back to the laboratory for measurement and analysis of soil bulk density soil saturation water capacity soil capillary water capacity field capacity soil total porosity soil capillary porosity and soil non capillary porosity the steel cylindrical rings were placed in a flat container after removing the upper covers and then water was poured into the flat container until the water surface was the same height as the top of the steel cylindrical ring the soil of the cylindrical steel ring was weighed as m1 g after fully absorbing water for more than 48 h m1 was the weight after removing the bottom cover the steel cylindrical rings with the upper and bottom covers removed were placed in a flat container filled with dry sand at the bottom and weighed as m2 g and m3 g after 2 h and 48 h respectively then all the soil in steel cylindrical ringswere oven dried at 105 c for more than 72 h and its weight was named m4 soil bulk density soil saturation water capacity soil capillary water capacity and field capacity were calculated using equation 1 2 3 and 4 according to zhang et al 1999 and cui et al 2019a 1 smc m 1 m 4 m 4 m 2 cmc m 2 m 4 m 4 m 3 fmc m 3 m 4 m 4 m 4 bd m 4 m v where smc cmc fmc and bd represent soil saturation water capacity soil capillary water capacity field capacity and soil bulk density g cm 3 respectively v is the volume of the steel cylindrical rings cm3 m is the weight of the steel cylindrical ring after removing the upper and bottom covers g soil total porosity soil capillary porosity and soil non capillary porosity were calculated using eqs 5 6 and 7 according to wu et al 2016 5 tp 1 bd ds 100 6 cp c m c b d

3 schjønning et al 2017 soil water storage deficit degree swsd was calculated using equation 8 and 9 according to huang et al 2018 and liu et al 2018 8 sws d b d s w c 10 1 9 swsd fc s w s fc 100 where sws is the soil water storage mm d is the soil depth cm bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 swc is the soil water content fc is the field capacity mm 2 5 statistical analysis we used a power function to fit the relationship between the soil water infiltration rate and the infiltration time the change rate of the infiltration rate was obtained by calculating the slope of the fitting equation according to the change rate of soil infiltration rate we divided the process of soil infiltration into three stages the initial infiltration stage for the first 8 min the transitional infiltration stage for 8 75 min and the stable infiltration stage for 75 120 min one way analysis of variance anova was used to compare the difference in cumulative infiltration of each stage initial stage transitional stage and stable stage between different treatments then we used correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between cumulative infiltration and various soil physical properties soil capillary porosity and soil non capillary porosity and one way analysis of variance anova was also used to compare the differences in soil water content between different treatments significant differences were tested at the 0 05 confidence level all statistical analyses and figures were performed with cor r 4 1 2 r core group 2021 and spss 22 0 ibm usa software 3 results 3 1 forestland to farmland conversion changed soil porosity properties and soil water holding capacity there were significant differences in soil water holding capacity capillary moisture capacity field moisture capacity and saturation moisture capacity among different treatments fig 2 a the soil capillary water capacity field capacity and soil saturation water capacity in forest understory were higher than those in forest interspace and in farmland while the difference in soil water holding capacity between forest interspace and farmland was weaker in general the soil capillary porosity in forest understory was higher than that in forest interspace and in farmland the total porosity at farmland in 0 20 cm soil layer was higher than that in forest interspace the non capillary porosity in 0 20 cm soil layer in farmland was higher than that in forest understory and interspace while the difference of non capillary porosity in 20 50 cm soil layer among different treatments was weaker fig 2b 3 2 forestland to farmland conversion increased soil water infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration the relationship between soil water infiltration rate and infiltration time showed the same trend in the process of forestland to farmland conversion fig 3 specifically the soil water infiltration rate showed a power function decreasing trend with the infiltration time and its decreasing rate gradually reduced with the infiltration time fig 3a b the cumulative infiltration of each stage the initial stage the transitional stage and the stable stage was the highest in farmland followed by forest interspace and the lowest in forest understory moreover the cumulative infiltration of farmland was higher than that of understory and interspace of forestland especially in the initial infiltration stage fig 3 fig 4 although there was no significant difference in the cumulative infiltration amount among the three treatments farmland forest understory and forest interspace in the transitional stage and the stable stage there was a significant difference in the total cumulative infiltration the cumulative infiltration in initial stage of farmland 28 93 mm was significantly higher than that of forest understory 19 45 mm the cumulative infiltration at each stage initial stage transition stage and stable stage was negatively correlated with soil capillary porosity while positively correlated with soil non capillary porosity of 0 30 cm fig 5 the infiltration accumulation in the initial stage was mainly positively affected by the non capillary porosity of 0 20 cm and the cumulative infiltration in the transition and stable stage was mainly positively affected by the non capillary porosity of 20 30 cm 3 3 forestland to farmland conversion effectively replenished soil water storage in general the soil water content decreased with soil depth but there are differences among different treatments fig 6 a the mean soil water content of farmland 23 22 at the soil depth of 0 160 cm was significantly higher than that of forest interspace 16 12 and forest understory 14 86 while the mean soil water content of three treatments at the soil depth of 160 400 cm showed non significant difference fig 6b therefore the trees in forestland mainly consumed soil water at the soil depth of 0 160 cm but consumed less soil water from the soil depth of 160 400 cm the long term planting of s japonica has caused a serious water deficitin the 0 160 cm soil layer of the forestland fig 7 a the soil water content of farmland in the 0 160 cm soil layer was about 44 04 and 56 26 higher than that of forest interspace and forest understory respectively fig 7b thus the soil water at the depth of 0 160 cm soil layer was replenished in the short term after forestland to farmland conversion 4 discussions as a vegetation measure to control soil erosion and prevent environmental degradation afforestation has been implemented on a large scale in the loess plateau since the early 1950s cao et al 2009 jia and shao 2014 chen et al 2015 jia et al 2017 however large scale vegetation restoration e g pinus tabulaeformis carr robinia pseudoacacia linn populus cathayanarehd caragana korshinskii kom can affect soil moisture dynamics by changing rainfall infiltration evapotranspiration and surface runoff jia et al 2017 liu et al 2018 studies have shown that extensive afforestation in the loess plateau exacerbated the consumption of soil reservoirs and led to the formation of dry soil layers jia and shao 2014 liu et al 2018 for example the soil water content of the caragana korshinskii plot has a much higher decline rate than that of the agricultural plot which indicates that planting caragana korshinskii could aggravate the consumption of soil water jia and shao 2014 jia et al 2017 this is consistent with our results that is the mean soil water content of forestland interspace 16 12 in the soil layer of 0 160 cm was significantly lower than that offarmland 23 22 meanwhile by analyzing the influence of different tree species on soil moisture in the loess plateau liu et al 2018 found that salix matsudana and populus cathayana mainly consumed shallow soil moisture 0 100 cm and deep soil moisture 100 150 cm respectively soil water content also decreases with the increase of vegetation planting years which may lead to or aggregate soil desiccation jia et al 2017 liu et al 2018 huang et al 2018 our research also showed that the long term planting of s japonica has caused a serious water deficitin the 0 160 cm soil layer of the forestland therefore the long term planting of trees may limit the growth of trees and even lead to their death due to lack of water rainfall is the only source of replenishment of soil moisture in this area so it is particularly important to improve the efficiency of soil moisture replenishment during rainfall the soil infiltration rate is an important indicator for evaluating the speed of water movement in the soil during rainfall wu et al 2016 cui et al 2019a döbert et al 2021 soil pores are one of the main ways for water to flow in the soil so it significantly affects the

3337,sparse distribution of rain gauge networks challenges the estimation of rainfall variability over space and time the sm2rain algorithm was developed to estimate rainfall from the knowledge of soil moisture sm by inverting the soil water balance equation the algorithm was simplified by neglecting the contribution of evapotranspiration and surface runoff rate during the rainfall event a recent study developed an analytical model to estimate the net water flux nwf from sm data via inversion of analytical warrick s equation in this study the sm2rain nwf algorithm was developed by integrating the sm2rain algorithm and the nwf model to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation the applicability of the sm2rain nwf algorithm was evaluated based on observed rainfall data in the lake urmia basin iran satellite sm data was obtained from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 the algorithm calibrated based on the data from july 3 2012 to december 31 2017 was then used to estimate rainfall for two years extending from january 2018 to december 2019 estimated rainfall through sm2rain nwf algorithm improved compared to sm2rain by 14 and 37 4 increase in the average values of correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe ns and 11 5 decrease in the percentage root mean square error prmse over the calibration period validating the estimated rainfall showed a considerable improvement in the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm compared to the sm2rain algorithm by 8 6 and 30 4 increase in the average values of r and ns and 13 4 decrease in the prmse it was also found that the sm2rain nwf algorithm contributes to the improvement of error indices in rainfall estimation and simulates the rainfall variation trend in a better fashion than the sm2rain algorithm keywords rainfall soil moisture sm2rain nwf sm2rain net water flux amsr2 1 introduction rainfall is the crucial variable for various applications in the water cycle more accurate knowledge of rainfall is essential for studies focusing on flood drought and landslide breinl et al 2021 michaelides et al 2009 segoni et al 2018 the exact estimation of rainfall in a region has always been a great challenge for researchers rain gauges are the most common devices for measuring rainfall on a surface and are considered a suitable method for rainfall measurement new et al 2001 villarini et al 2008 the total number of global rain gauges on the land is estimated to be 250 000 which is quite a few compared to the extent of the lands on the earth groisman and legates 1995 new et al 2001 besides these stations are heterogeneously distributed around the earth kidd et al 2016 and represent the rainfall in a limited area around each station kidd and huffman 2011 therefore rainfall monitoring through alternatives including rainfall radars and satellite sensors has been well established anagnostou et al 2010 weather radars can address some issues associated with rain gauge coverage by providing rainfall measurements at high spatial 1 km and temporal 1 h resolutions at least where radar exists sokol et al 2021 however large uncertainties might influence rain radars due to beam blockage and frozen hydrometeor villarini and krajewski 2010 in contrast satellite rainfall products have been available since the 1970 s and their accuracy and resolution both temporal and spatial have improved over time anagnostou et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 satellite products can measure various precipitation types such as snow rainfall and hail however the performance of satellite rainfall varies with products tan et al 2020 and may fail to reproduce rainfall due to the indirect nature of satellite observations kucera et al 2013 the global climate observing system gcos has listed rainfall and soil moisture sm among the essential climate variables with a relationship that can lead to a better understanding of the climate system seneviratne et al 2010 because of the strong relationship between rainfall and sm previous studies used satellite sm data to correct satellite rainfall estimates crow et al 2009 pellarin et al 2008 that are affected by different issues brocca et al 2013 developed a bottom up approach called sm2rain to directly estimate rainfall by the knowledge of sm the proposed sm2rain algorithm was first evaluated locally in italy spain and france using in situ sm data the algorithm was applied on various scales chen et al 2021 paredes trejo et al 2018 prakash 2019 sm from various satellites was used as an input to the sm2rain algorithm to produce rainfall data including advanced scatterometer sm2rain ascat lai et al 2022 european space agency climate change initiative sm2rain cci prakash 2019 and advanced microwave scanning radiometer sm2rain amsr fereidoon and koch 2018 although numerous studies confirmed the acceptable performance of the sm2rain algorithm some studies have reported a weak performance of the model under certain conditions for instance gupta et al 2020 compared various satellite rainfall products and the rainfall estimated from the sm2rain algorithm sm2rain ascat against observed daily gridded precipitation in india they found low agreement between the sm2rain ascat and observed data compared to satellite precipitation data especially for extreme precipitation cases furthermore evaluation of sm2rain cci rainfall data against observed precipitation has revealed a large underestimation in precipitation across india prakash 2019 the low agreement between sm2rain and observed data may be explained by the simplified assumptions in the initial algorithm when developing the sm2rain algorithm the runoff rate was considered zero assuming that all rainfall infiltrates into the soil brocca et al 2013 evapotranspiration was considered zero assuming the evaporation rate is very low when raining kirchner 2009 and there is a nonlinear relationship between drainage rate and soil saturation famiglietti and wood 1994 adding the knowledge of any missing variables would increase the algorithm s accuracy in estimating rainfall although the surface runoff was neglected when developing the sm2rain algorithm song et al 2020 ran an experimental study and showed that surface runoff 12 contribution is the second important variable after sm variations 85 contribution when estimating rainfall it means that drainage can provide an important contribution to rainfall estimation the relationship between drainage rate and sm was simply explained by the power law equation famiglietti and wood 1994 infiltration and evapotranspiration are critical hydrological fluxes that can explain net water flux nwf infiltration minus evapotranspiration determining the terrestrial water balance however accurate calculation of nwf is still a challenge at different spatiotemporal scales a novel analytical model was recently developed to calculate the nwf from near surface sm data sadeghi et al 2019 the new nwf model is based on the inversion of the analytical warrick s equations 1975 one unique characteristic of this analytical model is that it requires only sm as the input the main goal of this study is to combine the sm2rain algorithm and nwf model to obtain a more robust model to estimate rainfall using sm replacing the drainage rate in the sm2rain with the nwf model is expected to increase the model s accuracy sm2rain nwf rainfall will be estimated using satellite amsr2 sm data estimated cumulative rainfall from the sm2rain nwf was evaluated against observed rainfall besides estimated rainfall from the sm2rain nwf and sm2rain was compared the paper is organized into five sections following the introduction section 2 provides information about the study area and data used

ascending am and descending pm orbits kim et al 2018 wu et al 2016 yee et al 2017 passive microwave sm products in the amsr2 c1 band 6 9 ghz c2 band 7 3 ghz and x band 10 7 ghz were used in this study amsr2 sm products are generated by the land parameter retrieval model lprm and japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa du et al 2017 kim et al 2018 because of the higher agreement between the lprm products and observed sm measurements in the lake urmia basin saeedi et al 2021 the lprm sm products were used in this study daily amsr2 sm data with 10 km spatial resolution was obtained from 2012 to 2020 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover type mcd12q1 data provides land cover data at yearly intervals https earthexplorer usgs gov here the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp mcd12q1 was used to identify the land use for the stations all datasets used in this study are summarized in table 1 3 method 3 1 description of the sm2rain algorithm the sm2rain algorithm estimates the amount of rainfall by using sm as the only input based on the inversion of the water balance computed over a certain depth of soil brocca et al 2013 1 z n d θ t dt p t r t e t t g t where z m m is the soil depth n is the soil porosity s t θ t m 3 m 3 represents relative saturation of the soil t d a y is time e t t m m d a y is the evapotranspiration rate r t m m d a y is the runoff rate p t m m d a y is the rainfall rate and g t m m d a y is the drainage rate drainage is the amount of water that exits from the considered soil layer horizontally in the subsurface and vertically at the bottom layer the runoff rate evapotranspiration and drainage were then calculated as brocca et al 2015 2 r t p t θ t c 3 e t t et pot t θ t 4 g t a θ t b where e t p o t is the potential evapotranspiration three parameters of a b and c are three parameters that are estimated through calibration based on eqs 2 3 and 4 the rainfall rate can be estimated through the following equation 5 p t z d θ t dt e t pot t θ t a θ t b 1 θ t c in which z m m is the soil water capacity by considering the important role of the drainage term as shown in previous studies e g brocca et al 2015 it can be concluded that the exact estimation of this term in the balanced equation can significantly affect the algorithm performance despite the capability of the sm2rain algorithm in estimating rainfall evapotranspiration and surface runoff were considered negligible during rainfall brocca et al 2015 here a new algorithm is developed by merging the nwf equation into the sm2rain algorithm and evaluating the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm in estimating rainfall 3 2 description of the analytical net water flux model recently sadeghi et al 2019 have introduced an analytical model for estimating nwf based on sm data a new analytical model has been recently introduced to estimate nwf using sm as the only input variable with no need for calibration the model is mainly an inversion of the linearized richards equation warrick 1975 it relies on two parameters the proportionality coefficient and thesoil waterdiffusivity between volumetric moisture content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity sadeghi et al 2019 the performance of the developed model was then validated in four different regions of the united states results indicated that the model is appropriate for estimating land surface nwf in various climatic conditions temporal variations of sm at a specific depth of soil e g surface sm contain sufficient information for estimating the surface water flux sadeghi et al 2019 using the richards equation the nwf model can be written as 6 θ t z d θ z k where θ d k ɀ and t represent volumetric sm content effective soil water diffusivity unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity soil depth and time respectively d is the assumed constant and k is a linear function of θ the linearized form of richards equation is given as 7 θ t d 2 θ z 2 k θ z where k is an unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity parameter in the solution method proposed by sadeghi et al 2019 some functions are defined as follows 8 f f k θ k θ 9 z kz d 10 t k 2 t d 11 θ θ θ θ e 0 5 z 0 25 t in which f z t and θ are normalized variables related to nwf soil depth time and sm respectively f can be any arbitrary functions of time and θ is the long term average of sm in the soil profile using the boundary and initial conditions given by warrick s 1975 and according to warrick s 1975 solution 12 θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u z t n 1 t δ t e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u z t i 2 n f

the number of time steps since the amounts of evapotranspiration during rainfall are considered zero in this study nwf is equal to infiltration during the rainfall event the developed nwf model generates unbiased cumulative nwf for long aggregation intervals sadeghi et al 2020 3 3 development of sm2rain nwf algorithm the main goal of this study is to modify the sm2rain algorithm by including the analytical nwf model according to eq 5 and by neglecting evapotranspiration the water balance equation in the sm2rain algorithm is converted to the following equation 15 p t z d θ t d t g t 1 θ t c assuming that nwf can be considered as a proxy of the drainage rate g t i e proportional to nwf eq 15 can be written as 16 p t z d θ t d t a f n t 1 θ t c in which z a and c are the three coefficients of calibration in the modified sm2rain algorithm here defined as the sm2rain nwf algorithm the assumption of considering nwf as a proxy of drainage might be questionable but we considered it suitable to develop a new analytical formulation for the sm2rain algorithm the assumption is made to exploit the nwf approach into sm2rain considering the shallow soil layer in our study we can assume that lateral and bottom fluxes i e drainage are proportional to upper fluxes i e nwf therefore particularly for well draining soils the assumption can be considered reasonable however the implication of this assumption on the results is not easy to generalize from the results it may be concluded that the assumption is reasonable for arid and semi arid sites but its generalization requires the application to a wider range of climates and regions worldwide 3 4 selection of stations according to previous studies land cover is one of the most influential parameters for determining the quality of satellite sm data crow et al 2012 wang et al 2012 13 stations table 2 with different land covers barren croplands grasslands and urban were selected for evaluating the impact of land cover on the accuracy of estimated rainfall the sm2rain eq 15 with g t a θ t b and the sm2rain nwf eq 16 3 5 algorithm evaluation approach a preliminary analysis using data from july 3 2012 to december 31 2017 calibration period was conducted to calibrate the sm2rain nwf algorithm and obtain a robust set of parameters then through the same approach the estimated rainfall for the period from january 1 2018 to december 31 2019 validation period was evaluated against observed rainfall data performance indices are commonly used in different engineering fields to assess the adequacy of approaches methods models and algorithms different statistical indices have vastly used in different fields of engineering amouamouha and gholikandi 2018 badalians gholikandi et al 2021 malik et al 2017 including correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe ns bias and percentage root mean square error prmse were used to assess the accuracy of the algorithm in estimating rainfall see table a1 in appendix the r values range from 1 to 1 and express how two variables are linearly related bayissa et al 2017 dash et al 2017 meng et al 2014 the maximum possible value of ns is equal to 1 and the higher the value of ns closer to 1 the better the algorithm fit madsen 2000 xie et al 2016 prmse represents the percentage of rmse and the closer to zero values are desired bias shows the tendency of the algorithm to overestimate positive bias values or underestimate negative bias values rainfall bias values closer to zero are desired once the algorithm parameters were calibrated the algorithm s reliability was examined for different rainfall aggregation intervals aggr the algorithm s accuracy in estimating accumulated rainfall for various aggr was investigated estimated rainfall from the sm2rain nwf algorithm was then compared against the estimated rainfall through the sm2rain algorithm fig 2 explains the flowchart methodology of the study 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimating rainfall using the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm sm products from different bands of amsr2 c1 c2 and x were employed to estimate rainfall using the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm 13 stations table 2 located in diverse land covers were used to validate the estimated rainfall sadeghi et al 2019 specified the values of d 152 7 cm2d 1 and k 1 cm d 1 based on the best fit of the model the parameters of the sm2rain nwf algorithm z a and c were first calibrated to reproduce rainfall data from july 3 2012 to december 31 2017 table 3 it must be noted that the value of parameter c in the various investigated stations was equal to 15 9 for all amsr2 bands indicating that according to the equation r t p t θ t c estimation of surface runoff in this basin can be obtained by using the equation r t p t θ t 15 9 fig 3 demonstrates the spatial performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm for simulating daily aggr 1 and cumulative aggr 5 and 29 rainfall in the calibration period also see fig a1 for the validation period considering the average values for all indicators for all different aggregation intervals amsr2 x and amsr2 c2 showed the best and worst performance respectively the average recorded r value was higher for aggr 29 and lower for aggr 1 considering all stations and bands included in amsr2 ns values progressed up to 102 from aggr 1 to 5 and 67 from aggr 5 to 29 similarly these improvement rates for r were about 35 and 26 respectively lai et al 2022 also showed that the precision of estimated rainfall can be significantly enhanced by increasing the order of aggrs hence aggr 29 showed the least bias between estimated and observed rainfall fig 3 1 5 and 29 day cumulative rainfall estimations in most areas showed negative bias values similar to the calibration period the algorithm underestimated the calculated rainfall in the validation period see fig a1 evaluation of sm2rain in a recent study reported a similar underestimation of rainfall in northwest iran eini et al 2021 the highest and lowest ns values were recorded for aggr 29 and aggr 1 respectively the spatial distribution of ns values showed that the mean value of ns for aggr 1 considering three sm products is about 0 15 in the north and south of the basin this value differs at aggr 29 in the north and south of the basin for instance ns values were 0 51 in the north and 0 45 in the south of the basin furthermore the average value of r considering three sm products on a daily scale estimation in the north and south of the basin was about 0 41 whereas for aggr 29 in the northern and southern parts of the basin reached 0 73 and 0 68 respectively in general the accuracy of monthly rainfall estimation in the northern part of the basin outweighed the southern half of the basin 4 2 comparing the sm2rain nwf and sm2rain algorithms in the estimation of rainfall one of the primary questions in this study is whether the newly developed sm2rain nwf algorithm can significantly improve the quality of rainfall estimation based on a bottom up approach the performance of sm2rain nwf in simulating daily aggr 1 and cumulative aggr 5 aggr 29 rainfall was compared against the sm2rain simulated rainfall fig 4 represents the significant improvement of daily sm2rain nwf estimated rainfall against the estimated rainfall from the sm2rain algorithm in the calibration period in daily rainfall estimation aggr 1 also see fig a2 for the validation period using asmr2 c1 and amsr2 c2 sm products the major difference between estimated daily rainfall through different algorithms sm2rain nwf and sm2rain was discovered in tekab station with an increase in 0 17 and 0 14 in ns and r values respectively for amsr2 x however the major difference was discovered in the oshnavyeh station with an increase in ns and r values about 0 19 and 0 22 fig 4c and f it is noteworthy that sm2rain nwf produced the predominant metrics in daily estimation in the majority of the stations fig 4 ns values showed 64 60 and 58 average improvement in the accuracy of the estimated daily rainfall using the sm2rain nwf for amsr2 c1 c2 and x compared to sm2rain in calibration on average r value increased by 22 for simulated daily rainfall in all stations fig 4 the accuracy and reliability of a developed algorithm depend on the ability of the algorithm to estimate rainfall at different stations with diverse conditions in this section 13 stations across the lake urmia basin fig 1 were used to evaluate the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm against the sm2rain algorithm cumulative rainfall was estimated for two aggregation intervals aggr 5 and aggr 29 at all 13 stations in the calibration figs 5 and 6 and validation figs a3 and a4 periods fig 5 shows the results for aggr 5 in the calibration period check fig a3 in the appendix for the validation period results both r and ns values revealed better performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm in simulating rainfall than the sm2rain algorithm using all three bands of the amsr2 sm products c1 c2 and x although the selection of amsr2 bands did not influence the performance of the algorithm at shahindezh shabestar and heris stations however it significantly affected the performance of the algorithm in estimating rainfall at other stations e g oshnavyeh surface coverage and topography of the region are among the most critical factors that affect rainfall estimation with the sm2rain algorithm areas with higher elevations increase the algorithm error due to snow and frozen soil lai et al 2022 due to this issue heris and takab which have the highest elevation compared to other stations the sm2rain nwf algorithm was able to perform better in terms of ns and r indices than sm2rain using amsr2 x products led to a better rainfall estimation in most stations comparing the estimated cumulative rainfall for aggr 29 from different algorithms fig 6 indicated better performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm with higher r and ns values for most stations check fig a4 in the appendix for the validation period results for aggr 29 using amsr2 x sm products led to better performance in estimating rainfall fig 6 c f considering the influence of land cover soil texture and climate on the quality of satellite sm data bojie et al 2003 tietje and hennings 1996 these parameters may also explain the different performance of algorithms in estimating rainfall at different stations the sm2rain algorithm could not acceptably estimate cumulative rainfall at shahindezh station with r and ns values very close to zero however the sm2rain nwf algorithm estimated rainfall at shahindezh station with an r value of 0 6 and an ns value of 0 4 this example can explain the importance of the drainage rate added to the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm to better understand the improvement of the sm2rain nwf algorithm over the previous sm2rain algorithm various statistical indicators r ns and prmse were calculated for both 5 days aggr 5 fig 7 a b and c and 29 days aggr 29 fig 7 d e and f cumulative periods at all representative stations in the calibration period check table a2 in the appendix fig 7 a b and c shows comparing the statistical indicators the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm was improved compared to the sm2rain algorithm with an average improvement of 14 37 4 and 7 8 for r ns and prmse values respectively hence the results obtained for the thirteen stations investigated in this study demonstrate that the sm2rain nwf algorithm has successfully enhanced the performance of the sm2rain algorithm at some stations e g shahindezh p11 where the sm2rain algorithm could not estimate rainfall the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm successfully estimated the cumulative rainfall with acceptable r ns and prmse values besides the 29 days estimation of rainfall with both the sm2rain nwf and the sm2rain algorithms fig 7 d e and f demonstrated an improvement in cumulative rainfall with an improvement in calculated statistical indicators r values and ns values improved by 13 3 15 and 36 4 39 for all bands of the amsr2 sm product besides the estimation error prmse was reduced by 13 18 6 check table a2 one of the reasons for the low r and ns in some stations due to noise in satellite images is soil moisture in some places fereidoon and koch 2018 zhan et al 2015 however according to fig 7 the sm2rain nwf algorithm in most stations can significantly improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation compared to sm2rain overall the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm increased with the increase in the number of days in the aggregation interval in both calibration and validation see table a2 periods 4 2 1 performance evaluation of rainfall estimation algorithms in various land covers to investigate the impact of land cover on the performance of the algorithm the type of land cover was specified for the thirteen studied stations then stations were classified into four barren cropland grassland and urban classes however only one station had the barren land cover so this land cover class was excluded from the investigation fig 8 indicates the percentage of sm2rain nwf improvement compared to the sm2rain based on calculated ns r and prmse for each land cover at 5 days and 29 days cumulative periods the r and ns indices improved more in the stations located in grassland and cropland land covers compared to those located in the urban area it can be explained by the more significant role of infiltration in the hydrologic system of natural land covers grassland and cropland compared to urban areas therefore using amsr2 c1 sm products in urban and grassland regions would lead to a better algorithm performance than other bands however in croplands using the amsr2 x and amsr2 c2 would lead to a better performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm when estimating rainfall fig 9 shows the results of the same approach but in 29 days cumulative days the highest improvement in indices was observed for the stations located in grassland combining the influence of sm products different bands and land cover using amsr2 x in urban areas and croplands would improve algorithm performance considering all statistical indicators the common approach to assess the reliability of spatial remotely sensed and model based data is to validate the spatial data against sparse in situ measurements as ground truth e g al yaari et al 2017 2014 al bitar et al 2012 albergel et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 this is particularly the case when validating continental or regional scale information however the most challenging issue is the representativeness of in situ point based measurements in a satellite grid cell viable validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products at the satellite footprint scale is limited to only a few core validation sites 13 sites for smap l4 entekhabi et al 2014 with a small coverage past studies indicated that using denser in situ measurements and applying their spatial averages in a grid cell decreases the uncertainty resulting from scale related issues chan et al 2016 jackson et al 2010 zeng et al 2015 on the other hand upscaling the in situ measurements will add uncertainty to soil moisture validation because of diverse spatial and temporal heterogeneity in topography vegetation meteorological conditions and soil texture woodley 2017 zhang et al 2018 besides irregularity in station distribution and the resolution mismatch between simulated and observed rainfall are potential limitations for validating the simulated rainfall to reduce the regional bias some studies offered interpolation methods e g kriging thiessen polygon and gandin s optimal method to estimate areal precipitation using point based data bastin et al 1984 creutin and obled 1982 lebel et al 1987 lebel et al 1987 adopted a single climatological variogram to generate an areal estimate of precipitation with 80 km resolution vinnikov et al 1990 used the thiessen approach to estimate areal precipitation and temperature however other studies suggested the uncertainty in upscaling precipitation data muthusamy et al 2017 that depends on the rain gauge network density wang et al 2015 the current study assesses the spatial representativeness of daily gauge precipitation to quantify this concern fig 10 shows the spatial coverage of synoptic stations that change with aggrs the x axis of fig 10a represents the time aggregation aggrs similar to fig 2 from lebel et al 1987 while the y axis denotes the values of the ranges obtained from the theoretical semi variogram these ranges represent the distance at which the semi variogram reaches the sill and below which measurements are assumed to be correlated the semi variograms for aggr equal to 1 5 and 29 were derived from the spherical fig 10b spherical fig 10c and exponential fig 10d models respectively isaaks and srivastava 1989 while the resolution of the gridded soil moisture product used in this study equals 10 km the range values for aggr of 1 daily 5 and 29 are 153 km fig 10b 160 km fig 10c and 205 km fig 10d respectively hence the resolution of the remotely sensed sm product is fine enough to be considered for further analysis and matching with the representativeness of the rain gauge network in the current study area 5 conclusion the uneven distribution of rain gauges challenges the accurate estimate of rainfall and its variability over space and time brocca et al 2013 developed the sm2rain algorithm to estimate rainfall from the knowledge of sm however the sm2rain algorithm has been simplified by neglecting evapotranspiration and surface runoff contribution during the rainfall event recently sadeghi et al 2019 proposed a model to estimate the nwf using sm data the main objective of this study is to develop the sm2rain nwf algorithm to improve the rainfall estimation compared to the sm2rain algorithm and evaluate the performance of the algorithm in the lake urmia basin iran according to the initial results the application of the proposed algorithm allows rainfall estimation with different land covers since sm satellite data are still the only inputs of the developed algorithm and acceptable results have been achieved in all stations with different land covers this algorithm can be considered a suitable choice for rainfall estimation in regions with low numbers or without any stations applying ascending amsr2 sm products in different bands c1 c2 and x from july 3 2012 to december 31 2019 the analytical nwf model efficiently calculated the drainage term in the water balance equation this may lead to higher accuracy in estimating rainfall high values of r and considerable ns values for estimated rainfall from the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm compared to the sm2rain algorithm revealed the improvement of the algorithm the highest accuracy of sm data will improve the cumulative rainfall estimation using different algorithms in general the results have confirmed the validity of the proposed method in improving rainfall estimation at the basin scale by reducing the error prmse and increasing the values of r and ns leading to better identification of rainfall events observed rainfall data from 13 stations with different land covers in the lake urmia basin was used to validate the estimated rainfall by calculating r and ns according to the data given in table a2 the average percentage of improvement for ns r and prmse for various sm products during the calibration validation periods was found to be 37 4 30 4 14 8 6 and 11 5 13 4 respectively results indicated the better performance of the sm2rain nwf compared to sm2rain as this study presents the initial results of the newly developed algorithm in the lake urmia basin it is suggested to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on a global scale according to the fact that in addition to rainfall other parameters such as irrigation can also affect the variations of sm in a region another proposal for future study would be to investigate the effect of watering level on the performance of the algorithm credit authorship

3337,sparse distribution of rain gauge networks challenges the estimation of rainfall variability over space and time the sm2rain algorithm was developed to estimate rainfall from the knowledge of soil moisture sm by inverting the soil water balance equation the algorithm was simplified by neglecting the contribution of evapotranspiration and surface runoff rate during the rainfall event a recent study developed an analytical model to estimate the net water flux nwf from sm data via inversion of analytical warrick s equation in this study the sm2rain nwf algorithm was developed by integrating the sm2rain algorithm and the nwf model to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation the applicability of the sm2rain nwf algorithm was evaluated based on observed rainfall data in the lake urmia basin iran satellite sm data was obtained from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 the algorithm calibrated based on the data from july 3 2012 to december 31 2017 was then used to estimate rainfall for two years extending from january 2018 to december 2019 estimated rainfall through sm2rain nwf algorithm improved compared to sm2rain by 14 and 37 4 increase in the average values of correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe ns and 11 5 decrease in the percentage root mean square error prmse over the calibration period validating the estimated rainfall showed a considerable improvement in the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm compared to the sm2rain algorithm by 8 6 and 30 4 increase in the average values of r and ns and 13 4 decrease in the prmse it was also found that the sm2rain nwf algorithm contributes to the improvement of error indices in rainfall estimation and simulates the rainfall variation trend in a better fashion than the sm2rain algorithm keywords rainfall soil moisture sm2rain nwf sm2rain net water flux amsr2 1 introduction rainfall is the crucial variable for various applications in the water cycle more accurate knowledge of rainfall is essential for studies focusing on flood drought and landslide breinl et al 2021 michaelides et al 2009 segoni et al 2018 the exact estimation of rainfall in a region has always been a great challenge for researchers rain gauges are the most common devices for measuring rainfall on a surface and are considered a suitable method for rainfall measurement new et al 2001 villarini et al 2008 the total number of global rain gauges on the land is estimated to be 250 000 which is quite a few compared to the extent of the lands on the earth groisman and legates 1995 new et al 2001 besides these stations are heterogeneously distributed around the earth kidd et al 2016 and represent the rainfall in a limited area around each station kidd and huffman 2011 therefore rainfall monitoring through alternatives including rainfall radars and satellite sensors has been well established anagnostou et al 2010 weather radars can address some issues associated with rain gauge coverage by providing rainfall measurements at high spatial 1 km and temporal 1 h resolutions at least where radar exists sokol et al 2021 however large uncertainties might influence rain radars due to beam blockage and frozen hydrometeor villarini and krajewski 2010 in contrast satellite rainfall products have been available since the 1970 s and their accuracy and resolution both temporal and spatial have improved over time anagnostou et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 satellite products can measure various precipitation types such as snow rainfall and hail however the performance of satellite rainfall varies with products tan et al 2020 and may fail to reproduce rainfall due to the indirect nature of satellite observations kucera et al 2013 the global climate observing system gcos has listed rainfall and soil moisture sm among the essential climate variables with a relationship that can lead to a better understanding of the climate system seneviratne et al 2010 because of the strong relationship between rainfall and sm previous studies used satellite sm data to correct satellite rainfall estimates crow et al 2009 pellarin et al 2008 that are affected by different issues brocca et al 2013 developed a bottom up approach called sm2rain to directly estimate rainfall by the knowledge of sm the proposed sm2rain algorithm was first evaluated locally in italy spain and france using in situ sm data the algorithm was applied on various scales chen et al 2021 paredes trejo et al 2018 prakash 2019 sm from various satellites was used as an input to the sm2rain algorithm to produce rainfall data including advanced scatterometer sm2rain ascat lai et al 2022 european space agency climate change initiative sm2rain cci prakash 2019 and advanced microwave scanning radiometer sm2rain amsr fereidoon and koch 2018 although numerous studies confirmed the acceptable performance of the sm2rain algorithm some studies have reported a weak performance of the model under certain conditions for instance gupta et al 2020 compared various satellite rainfall products and the rainfall estimated from the sm2rain algorithm sm2rain ascat against observed daily gridded precipitation in india they found low agreement between the sm2rain ascat and observed data compared to satellite precipitation data especially for extreme precipitation cases furthermore evaluation of sm2rain cci rainfall data against observed precipitation has revealed a large underestimation in precipitation across india prakash 2019 the low agreement between sm2rain and observed data may be explained by the simplified assumptions in the initial algorithm when developing the sm2rain algorithm the runoff rate was considered zero assuming that all rainfall infiltrates into the soil brocca et al 2013 evapotranspiration was considered zero assuming the evaporation rate is very low when raining kirchner 2009 and there is a nonlinear relationship between drainage rate and soil saturation famiglietti and wood 1994 adding the knowledge of any missing variables would increase the algorithm s accuracy in estimating rainfall although the surface runoff was neglected when developing the sm2rain algorithm song et al 2020 ran an experimental study and showed that surface runoff 12 contribution is the second important variable after sm variations 85 contribution when estimating rainfall it means that drainage can provide an important contribution to rainfall estimation the relationship between drainage rate and sm was simply explained by the power law equation famiglietti and wood 1994 infiltration and evapotranspiration are critical hydrological fluxes that can explain net water flux nwf infiltration minus evapotranspiration determining the terrestrial water balance however accurate calculation of nwf is still a challenge at different spatiotemporal scales a novel analytical model was recently developed to calculate the nwf from near surface sm data sadeghi et al 2019 the new nwf model is based on the inversion of the analytical warrick s equations 1975 one unique characteristic of this analytical model is that it requires only sm as the input the main goal of this study is to combine the sm2rain algorithm and nwf model to obtain a more robust model to estimate rainfall using sm replacing the drainage rate in the sm2rain with the nwf model is expected to increase the model s accuracy sm2rain nwf rainfall will be estimated using satellite amsr2 sm data estimated cumulative rainfall from the sm2rain nwf was evaluated against observed rainfall besides estimated rainfall from the sm2rain nwf and sm2rain was compared the paper is organized into five sections following the introduction section 2 provides information about the study area and data used

ascending am and descending pm orbits kim et al 2018 wu et al 2016 yee et al 2017 passive microwave sm products in the amsr2 c1 band 6 9 ghz c2 band 7 3 ghz and x band 10 7 ghz were used in this study amsr2 sm products are generated by the land parameter retrieval model lprm and japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa du et al 2017 kim et al 2018 because of the higher agreement between the lprm products and observed sm measurements in the lake urmia basin saeedi et al 2021 the lprm sm products were used in this study daily amsr2 sm data with 10 km spatial resolution was obtained from 2012 to 2020 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover type mcd12q1 data provides land cover data at yearly intervals https earthexplorer usgs gov here the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp mcd12q1 was used to identify the land use for the stations all datasets used in this study are summarized in table 1 3 method 3 1 description of the sm2rain algorithm the sm2rain algorithm estimates the amount of rainfall by using sm as the only input based on the inversion of the water balance computed over a certain depth of soil brocca et al 2013 1 z n d θ t dt p t r t e t t g t where z m m is the soil depth n is the soil porosity s t θ t m 3 m 3 represents relative saturation of the soil t d a y is time e t t m m d a y is the evapotranspiration rate r t m m d a y is the runoff rate p t m m d a y is the rainfall rate and g t m m d a y is the drainage rate drainage is the amount of water that exits from the considered soil layer horizontally in the subsurface and vertically at the bottom layer the runoff rate evapotranspiration and drainage were then calculated as brocca et al 2015 2 r t p t θ t c 3 e t t et pot t θ t 4 g t a θ t b where e t p o t is the potential evapotranspiration three parameters of a b and c are three parameters that are estimated through calibration based on eqs 2 3 and 4 the rainfall rate can be estimated through the following equation 5 p t z d θ t dt e t pot t θ t a θ t b 1 θ t c in which z m m is the soil water capacity by considering the important role of the drainage term as shown in previous studies e g brocca et al 2015 it can be concluded that the exact estimation of this term in the balanced equation can significantly affect the algorithm performance despite the capability of the sm2rain algorithm in estimating rainfall evapotranspiration and surface runoff were considered negligible during rainfall brocca et al 2015 here a new algorithm is developed by merging the nwf equation into the sm2rain algorithm and evaluating the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm in estimating rainfall 3 2 description of the analytical net water flux model recently sadeghi et al 2019 have introduced an analytical model for estimating nwf based on sm data a new analytical model has been recently introduced to estimate nwf using sm as the only input variable with no need for calibration the model is mainly an inversion of the linearized richards equation warrick 1975 it relies on two parameters the proportionality coefficient and thesoil waterdiffusivity between volumetric moisture content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity sadeghi et al 2019 the performance of the developed model was then validated in four different regions of the united states results indicated that the model is appropriate for estimating land surface nwf in various climatic conditions temporal variations of sm at a specific depth of soil e g surface sm contain sufficient information for estimating the surface water flux sadeghi et al 2019 using the richards equation the nwf model can be written as 6 θ t z d θ z k where θ d k ɀ and t represent volumetric sm content effective soil water diffusivity unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity soil depth and time respectively d is the assumed constant and k is a linear function of θ the linearized form of richards equation is given as 7 θ t d 2 θ z 2 k θ z where k is an unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity parameter in the solution method proposed by sadeghi et al 2019 some functions are defined as follows 8 f f k θ k θ 9 z kz d 10 t k 2 t d 11 θ θ θ θ e 0 5 z 0 25 t in which f z t and θ are normalized variables related to nwf soil depth time and sm respectively f can be any arbitrary functions of time and θ is the long term average of sm in the soil profile using the boundary and initial conditions given by warrick s 1975 and according to warrick s 1975 solution 12 θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u z t n 1 t δ t e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u z t i 2 n f

the number of time steps since the amounts of evapotranspiration during rainfall are considered zero in this study nwf is equal to infiltration during the rainfall event the developed nwf model generates unbiased cumulative nwf for long aggregation intervals sadeghi et al 2020 3 3 development of sm2rain nwf algorithm the main goal of this study is to modify the sm2rain algorithm by including the analytical nwf model according to eq 5 and by neglecting evapotranspiration the water balance equation in the sm2rain algorithm is converted to the following equation 15 p t z d θ t d t g t 1 θ t c assuming that nwf can be considered as a proxy of the drainage rate g t i e proportional to nwf eq 15 can be written as 16 p t z d θ t d t a f n t 1 θ t c in which z a and c are the three coefficients of calibration in the modified sm2rain algorithm here defined as the sm2rain nwf algorithm the assumption of considering nwf as a proxy of drainage might be questionable but we considered it suitable to develop a new analytical formulation for the sm2rain algorithm the assumption is made to exploit the nwf approach into sm2rain considering the shallow soil layer in our study we can assume that lateral and bottom fluxes i e drainage are proportional to upper fluxes i e nwf therefore particularly for well draining soils the assumption can be considered reasonable however the implication of this assumption on the results is not easy to generalize from the results it may be concluded that the assumption is reasonable for arid and semi arid sites but its generalization requires the application to a wider range of climates and regions worldwide 3 4 selection of stations according to previous studies land cover is one of the most influential parameters for determining the quality of satellite sm data crow et al 2012 wang et al 2012 13 stations table 2 with different land covers barren croplands grasslands and urban were selected for evaluating the impact of land cover on the accuracy of estimated rainfall the sm2rain eq 15 with g t a θ t b and the sm2rain nwf eq 16 3 5 algorithm evaluation approach a preliminary analysis using data from july 3 2012 to december 31 2017 calibration period was conducted to calibrate the sm2rain nwf algorithm and obtain a robust set of parameters then through the same approach the estimated rainfall for the period from january 1 2018 to december 31 2019 validation period was evaluated against observed rainfall data performance indices are commonly used in different engineering fields to assess the adequacy of approaches methods models and algorithms different statistical indices have vastly used in different fields of engineering amouamouha and gholikandi 2018 badalians gholikandi et al 2021 malik et al 2017 including correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe ns bias and percentage root mean square error prmse were used to assess the accuracy of the algorithm in estimating rainfall see table a1 in appendix the r values range from 1 to 1 and express how two variables are linearly related bayissa et al 2017 dash et al 2017 meng et al 2014 the maximum possible value of ns is equal to 1 and the higher the value of ns closer to 1 the better the algorithm fit madsen 2000 xie et al 2016 prmse represents the percentage of rmse and the closer to zero values are desired bias shows the tendency of the algorithm to overestimate positive bias values or underestimate negative bias values rainfall bias values closer to zero are desired once the algorithm parameters were calibrated the algorithm s reliability was examined for different rainfall aggregation intervals aggr the algorithm s accuracy in estimating accumulated rainfall for various aggr was investigated estimated rainfall from the sm2rain nwf algorithm was then compared against the estimated rainfall through the sm2rain algorithm fig 2 explains the flowchart methodology of the study 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimating rainfall using the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm sm products from different bands of amsr2 c1 c2 and x were employed to estimate rainfall using the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm 13 stations table 2 located in diverse land covers were used to validate the estimated rainfall sadeghi et al 2019 specified the values of d 152 7 cm2d 1 and k 1 cm d 1 based on the best fit of the model the parameters of the sm2rain nwf algorithm z a and c were first calibrated to reproduce rainfall data from july 3 2012 to december 31 2017 table 3 it must be noted that the value of parameter c in the various investigated stations was equal to 15 9 for all amsr2 bands indicating that according to the equation r t p t θ t c estimation of surface runoff in this basin can be obtained by using the equation r t p t θ t 15 9 fig 3 demonstrates the spatial performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm for simulating daily aggr 1 and cumulative aggr 5 and 29 rainfall in the calibration period also see fig a1 for the validation period considering the average values for all indicators for all different aggregation intervals amsr2 x and amsr2 c2 showed the best and worst performance respectively the average recorded r value was higher for aggr 29 and lower for aggr 1 considering all stations and bands included in amsr2 ns values progressed up to 102 from aggr 1 to 5 and 67 from aggr 5 to 29 similarly these improvement rates for r were about 35 and 26 respectively lai et al 2022 also showed that the precision of estimated rainfall can be significantly enhanced by increasing the order of aggrs hence aggr 29 showed the least bias between estimated and observed rainfall fig 3 1 5 and 29 day cumulative rainfall estimations in most areas showed negative bias values similar to the calibration period the algorithm underestimated the calculated rainfall in the validation period see fig a1 evaluation of sm2rain in a recent study reported a similar underestimation of rainfall in northwest iran eini et al 2021 the highest and lowest ns values were recorded for aggr 29 and aggr 1 respectively the spatial distribution of ns values showed that the mean value of ns for aggr 1 considering three sm products is about 0 15 in the north and south of the basin this value differs at aggr 29 in the north and south of the basin for instance ns values were 0 51 in the north and 0 45 in the south of the basin furthermore the average value of r considering three sm products on a daily scale estimation in the north and south of the basin was about 0 41 whereas for aggr 29 in the northern and southern parts of the basin reached 0 73 and 0 68 respectively in general the accuracy of monthly rainfall estimation in the northern part of the basin outweighed the southern half of the basin 4 2 comparing the sm2rain nwf and sm2rain algorithms in the estimation of rainfall one of the primary questions in this study is whether the newly developed sm2rain nwf algorithm can significantly improve the quality of rainfall estimation based on a bottom up approach the performance of sm2rain nwf in simulating daily aggr 1 and cumulative aggr 5 aggr 29 rainfall was compared against the sm2rain simulated rainfall fig 4 represents the significant improvement of daily sm2rain nwf estimated rainfall against the estimated rainfall from the sm2rain algorithm in the calibration period in daily rainfall estimation aggr 1 also see fig a2 for the validation period using asmr2 c1 and amsr2 c2 sm products the major difference between estimated daily rainfall through different algorithms sm2rain nwf and sm2rain was discovered in tekab station with an increase in 0 17 and 0 14 in ns and r values respectively for amsr2 x however the major difference was discovered in the oshnavyeh station with an increase in ns and r values about 0 19 and 0 22 fig 4c and f it is noteworthy that sm2rain nwf produced the predominant metrics in daily estimation in the majority of the stations fig 4 ns values showed 64 60 and 58 average improvement in the accuracy of the estimated daily rainfall using the sm2rain nwf for amsr2 c1 c2 and x compared to sm2rain in calibration on average r value increased by 22 for simulated daily rainfall in all stations fig 4 the accuracy and reliability of a developed algorithm depend on the ability of the algorithm to estimate rainfall at different stations with diverse conditions in this section 13 stations across the lake urmia basin fig 1 were used to evaluate the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm against the sm2rain algorithm cumulative rainfall was estimated for two aggregation intervals aggr 5 and aggr 29 at all 13 stations in the calibration figs 5 and 6 and validation figs a3 and a4 periods fig 5 shows the results for aggr 5 in the calibration period check fig a3 in the appendix for the validation period results both r and ns values revealed better performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm in simulating rainfall than the sm2rain algorithm using all three bands of the amsr2 sm products c1 c2 and x although the selection of amsr2 bands did not influence the performance of the algorithm at shahindezh shabestar and heris stations however it significantly affected the performance of the algorithm in estimating rainfall at other stations e g oshnavyeh surface coverage and topography of the region are among the most critical factors that affect rainfall estimation with the sm2rain algorithm areas with higher elevations increase the algorithm error due to snow and frozen soil lai et al 2022 due to this issue heris and takab which have the highest elevation compared to other stations the sm2rain nwf algorithm was able to perform better in terms of ns and r indices than sm2rain using amsr2 x products led to a better rainfall estimation in most stations comparing the estimated cumulative rainfall for aggr 29 from different algorithms fig 6 indicated better performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm with higher r and ns values for most stations check fig a4 in the appendix for the validation period results for aggr 29 using amsr2 x sm products led to better performance in estimating rainfall fig 6 c f considering the influence of land cover soil texture and climate on the quality of satellite sm data bojie et al 2003 tietje and hennings 1996 these parameters may also explain the different performance of algorithms in estimating rainfall at different stations the sm2rain algorithm could not acceptably estimate cumulative rainfall at shahindezh station with r and ns values very close to zero however the sm2rain nwf algorithm estimated rainfall at shahindezh station with an r value of 0 6 and an ns value of 0 4 this example can explain the importance of the drainage rate added to the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm to better understand the improvement of the sm2rain nwf algorithm over the previous sm2rain algorithm various statistical indicators r ns and prmse were calculated for both 5 days aggr 5 fig 7 a b and c and 29 days aggr 29 fig 7 d e and f cumulative periods at all representative stations in the calibration period check table a2 in the appendix fig 7 a b and c shows comparing the statistical indicators the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm was improved compared to the sm2rain algorithm with an average improvement of 14 37 4 and 7 8 for r ns and prmse values respectively hence the results obtained for the thirteen stations investigated in this study demonstrate that the sm2rain nwf algorithm has successfully enhanced the performance of the sm2rain algorithm at some stations e g shahindezh p11 where the sm2rain algorithm could not estimate rainfall the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm successfully estimated the cumulative rainfall with acceptable r ns and prmse values besides the 29 days estimation of rainfall with both the sm2rain nwf and the sm2rain algorithms fig 7 d e and f demonstrated an improvement in cumulative rainfall with an improvement in calculated statistical indicators r values and ns values improved by 13 3 15 and 36 4 39 for all bands of the amsr2 sm product besides the estimation error prmse was reduced by 13 18 6 check table a2 one of the reasons for the low r and ns in some stations due to noise in satellite images is soil moisture in some places fereidoon and koch 2018 zhan et al 2015 however according to fig 7 the sm2rain nwf algorithm in most stations can significantly improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation compared to sm2rain overall the performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm increased with the increase in the number of days in the aggregation interval in both calibration and validation see table a2 periods 4 2 1 performance evaluation of rainfall estimation algorithms in various land covers to investigate the impact of land cover on the performance of the algorithm the type of land cover was specified for the thirteen studied stations then stations were classified into four barren cropland grassland and urban classes however only one station had the barren land cover so this land cover class was excluded from the investigation fig 8 indicates the percentage of sm2rain nwf improvement compared to the sm2rain based on calculated ns r and prmse for each land cover at 5 days and 29 days cumulative periods the r and ns indices improved more in the stations located in grassland and cropland land covers compared to those located in the urban area it can be explained by the more significant role of infiltration in the hydrologic system of natural land covers grassland and cropland compared to urban areas therefore using amsr2 c1 sm products in urban and grassland regions would lead to a better algorithm performance than other bands however in croplands using the amsr2 x and amsr2 c2 would lead to a better performance of the sm2rain nwf algorithm when estimating rainfall fig 9 shows the results of the same approach but in 29 days cumulative days the highest improvement in indices was observed for the stations located in grassland combining the influence of sm products different bands and land cover using amsr2 x in urban areas and croplands would improve algorithm performance considering all statistical indicators the common approach to assess the reliability of spatial remotely sensed and model based data is to validate the spatial data against sparse in situ measurements as ground truth e g al yaari et al 2017 2014 al bitar et al 2012 albergel et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 this is particularly the case when validating continental or regional scale information however the most challenging issue is the representativeness of in situ point based measurements in a satellite grid cell viable validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products at the satellite footprint scale is limited to only a few core validation sites 13 sites for smap l4 entekhabi et al 2014 with a small coverage past studies indicated that using denser in situ measurements and applying their spatial averages in a grid cell decreases the uncertainty resulting from scale related issues chan et al 2016 jackson et al 2010 zeng et al 2015 on the other hand upscaling the in situ measurements will add uncertainty to soil moisture validation because of diverse spatial and temporal heterogeneity in topography vegetation meteorological conditions and soil texture woodley 2017 zhang et al 2018 besides irregularity in station distribution and the resolution mismatch between simulated and observed rainfall are potential limitations for validating the simulated rainfall to reduce the regional bias some studies offered interpolation methods e g kriging thiessen polygon and gandin s optimal method to estimate areal precipitation using point based data bastin et al 1984 creutin and obled 1982 lebel et al 1987 lebel et al 1987 adopted a single climatological variogram to generate an areal estimate of precipitation with 80 km resolution vinnikov et al 1990 used the thiessen approach to estimate areal precipitation and temperature however other studies suggested the uncertainty in upscaling precipitation data muthusamy et al 2017 that depends on the rain gauge network density wang et al 2015 the current study assesses the spatial representativeness of daily gauge precipitation to quantify this concern fig 10 shows the spatial coverage of synoptic stations that change with aggrs the x axis of fig 10a represents the time aggregation aggrs similar to fig 2 from lebel et al 1987 while the y axis denotes the values of the ranges obtained from the theoretical semi variogram these ranges represent the distance at which the semi variogram reaches the sill and below which measurements are assumed to be correlated the semi variograms for aggr equal to 1 5 and 29 were derived from the spherical fig 10b spherical fig 10c and exponential fig 10d models respectively isaaks and srivastava 1989 while the resolution of the gridded soil moisture product used in this study equals 10 km the range values for aggr of 1 daily 5 and 29 are 153 km fig 10b 160 km fig 10c and 205 km fig 10d respectively hence the resolution of the remotely sensed sm product is fine enough to be considered for further analysis and matching with the representativeness of the rain gauge network in the current study area 5 conclusion the uneven distribution of rain gauges challenges the accurate estimate of rainfall and its variability over space and time brocca et al 2013 developed the sm2rain algorithm to estimate rainfall from the knowledge of sm however the sm2rain algorithm has been simplified by neglecting evapotranspiration and surface runoff contribution during the rainfall event recently sadeghi et al 2019 proposed a model to estimate the nwf using sm data the main objective of this study is to develop the sm2rain nwf algorithm to improve the rainfall estimation compared to the sm2rain algorithm and evaluate the performance of the algorithm in the lake urmia basin iran according to the initial results the application of the proposed algorithm allows rainfall estimation with different land covers since sm satellite data are still the only inputs of the developed algorithm and acceptable results have been achieved in all stations with different land covers this algorithm can be considered a suitable choice for rainfall estimation in regions with low numbers or without any stations applying ascending amsr2 sm products in different bands c1 c2 and x from july 3 2012 to december 31 2019 the analytical nwf model efficiently calculated the drainage term in the water balance equation this may lead to higher accuracy in estimating rainfall high values of r and considerable ns values for estimated rainfall from the developed sm2rain nwf algorithm compared to the sm2rain algorithm revealed the improvement of the algorithm the highest accuracy of sm data will improve the cumulative rainfall estimation using different algorithms in general the results have confirmed the validity of the proposed method in improving rainfall estimation at the basin scale by reducing the error prmse and increasing the values of r and ns leading to better identification of rainfall events observed rainfall data from 13 stations with different land covers in the lake urmia basin was used to validate the estimated rainfall by calculating r and ns according to the data given in table a2 the average percentage of improvement for ns r and prmse for various sm products during the calibration validation periods was found to be 37 4 30 4 14 8 6 and 11 5 13 4 respectively results indicated the better performance of the sm2rain nwf compared to sm2rain as this study presents the initial results of the newly developed algorithm in the lake urmia basin it is suggested to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on a global scale according to the fact that in addition to rainfall other parameters such as irrigation can also affect the variations of sm in a region another proposal for future study would be to investigate the effect of watering level on the performance of the algorithm credit authorship

fault fault length divided by aquifer transmissivity and the recharge regime to examine these conceptual models field measurements of hydraulic head 14c chloride and electrical conductivity in groundwater are presented along transects across three contrasting fault systems large cross fault head and age gradients are apparent at two of the three sites at one of these sites where regional flow is mostly parallel to the fault 14c age and chloride data are used to estimate the rate of cross fault flow at the third site there may not be a barrier to cross fault flow as there is no clear increase in either head or age gradient the studies illustrate the importance of high data density to characterise fault zones particularly for groundwater age which will vary both with depth and horizontal location along a transect although our data does not indicate conduit behaviour such behaviour has been suggested based on groundwater chemistry at other locations along the fault strike at two of the sites keywords groundwater age hydraulic head carbon 14 fault 1 introduction within the past few decades there has been increasing attention on the role of geological faults on groundwater flow it is now recognised that faults can act as either barriers or conduits to flow or they can act as conduit barrier systems caine et al 1996 bense 2013 scibek et al 2016 in consolidated sediments and rocks conduit barrier systems occur when the fault core has low permeability but a damage zone with higher permeability is present either side of the core in unconsolidated sediments conduit barrier behaviour can result from anisotropy of clay and sand smearing in the fault core these situations typically produce a barrier to cross fault flow but a conduit for along fault flow faults can also affect groundwater flow where vertical movement along a fault plane causes changes in aquifer thickness offset of aquifers and or juxtaposition of aquifers and aquitards bense and person 2006 while the location of faults can often be inferred from geological mapping and surface geophysics saribudak and hawkins 2019 characterising groundwater flow in and around faults is more challenging where a fault acts as a conduit vertical flow along the fault may cause changes in groundwater temperature or chemistry thus for example along fault flow may be detected from the upward flow of warmer bense et al 2008 or older e g castro and goblet 2005 raiber et al 2015 gumm et al 2016 batlle aguilar et al 2017 water into shallow aquifers or the presence of radioisotopes produced within the fault itself e g radon pereira et al 2010 several papers have described hydraulic head changes across faults which are generally taken to indicate the role of these faults as barriers to cross fault flow e g haneberg 1995 cilona et al 2015 delinom 2009 bense et al 2003 bense et al 2008 recently marshall et al 2020 showed that the diversion of groundwater flow around faults that are barriers to flow may result in increases in groundwater age downstream of such structures however while theoretical studies have suggested that faults that act as barriers to flow may affect the distribution of groundwater ages both upstream and downstream we are not aware of any field studies that have investigated or observed such phenomena this paper examines hydraulic head and water chemistry changes across three fault systems in south australia para fault in the adelaide plains kanawinka fault in the otway basin and willunga fault in the willunga basin in each case 14c data are used as an indicator of groundwater age and hydraulic heads 14c activities and apparent 14c ages are presented from bore transects across each fault the paper discusses the extent to which head and groundwater age data are able to constrain the hydrological role of the fault and in particular whether or not groundwater ages can identify whether faults act as barriers to cross fault flow 2 theory in seeking to understand the effect of faults on hydraulic head and groundwater age data it is useful to first consider some highly idealised systems here we consider faults that are barriers to flow across them and also consider both aquifers that receive constant recharge and aquifers that are confined and or receive negligible recharge in the vicinity of the fault in the absence of a fault for a homogeneous aquifer receiving constant recharge it has previously been shown that the vertical groundwater age profile will be 1 t h ε r l n h h z where t is groundwater age r is the recharge rate z is depth below the water table h is saturated aquifer thickness and ε is porosity vogel 1967 cook and bohlke 2000 and the groundwater age refers to the time since water recharged the aquifer the groundwater age thus increases with depth in the aqufer however age does not increase with distance downgradient if a specific depth in the aquifer is considered while the age of any water parcel must become older as it flows downgradient water moves deeper into the aquifer as it moves downgradient pushed down by new recharge this is encapsulated in eq 1 by the increase in age with depth and so a separate term reflecting horizontal position in the aquifer is not required samples collected from the same depth should therefore be the same age while age increases exponentially with depth near the top of the aquifer the increase in age with depth is close to linear thus in the top half of the aquifer z h 2 in eq 1 a 10 increase in depth will result in an increase in age of between 10 and 15 for an aquifer that is confined and or receives all its recharge in upgradient areas the age will increase both with depth and distance and can be expressed 2 t h ε r l n h h z x h ε r x r where xr is the length of the upgradient recharge area and x is the distance downgradient from the recharge area cook and bohlke 2000 there are two terms on the rhs of this equation the first represents the increase in age with depth which is generated in the upgradient recharge area eq 1 the second represents the increase in age with distance due to horizontal flow in the part of the aquifer no longer receiving recharge overall the relative increase in age with depth in the part of the aquifer receiving no recharge will be less than for an aquifer with constant recharge for faulted aquifers we first consider the simplest case of one dimensional steady state flow towards and across a fault that has a hydraulic conductivity less than that of the aquifer for the moment we neglect any aquifer offset associated with the faulting the 1d flow assumption means that all the groundwater must flow through the fault there will be a head drop across the fault and the ratio of the head gradient across the fault to the head gradient within the aquifer immediately upgradient and downgradient of the fault will be equal to the ratio between the aquifer and fault hydraulic conductivities haneberg 1995 fig 1 a the groundwater flux will be constant along this flowline and so if the porosity is constant then the velocity and hence the horizontal groundwater age gradient will also be constant fig 1b thus the groundwater age measured at a specific depth will increase linearly with distance equation 2 furthermore the age profile will not be perturbed from that which would occur without the fault even though the head profile shows a marked decrease across the fault which might resemble a step change if no data was available from within the fault itself in a three dimensional aquifer system this might be equivalent to the situation where i the regional groundwater flow is directed towards a fault ii flow is predominantly driven by recharge in upgradient areas and recharge in the vicinity of the fault is negligible and iii the fault hydraulic conductivity is less than that of the aquifer but not sufficiently low for the water table to rise above the land surface leading to spring discharge it also represents a system where the fault is very long so that the resistance to flow around it is much greater than the resistance to flow through it we henceforth refer to this as an infinite fault the resistance to flow through a fault is equal to the fault thickness divided by its transmissivity perpendicular to the fault plane and the resistance to flow around it can be considered as the length of the fault divided by the aquifer transmissivity in contrast if the resistance to flow around the fault is similar to or less than the resistance to flow through it we henceforth refer to this as a finite fault then some of the groundwater flowing towards the fault will be diverted around it marshall et al 2020 the head drop across this type of fault will be less than in the infinite fault case and the head gradient close to and perpendicular to the fault will be reduced as the flow direction changes and the component of flow directed towards the fault is reduced fig 1c the age gradient will also be high immediately downstream of the fault as the flow component directed away from the fault is similarly reduced if measured on a transect perpendicular to the fault the horizontal groundwater age gradient will increase sharply both before and after the fault fig 1d this increase in age gradient reflects the reduction in flow towards the fault and through it as flow is diverted around the fault the increase in age gradient will occur at all depths at the same rate as there is no vertical component of flow in this part of the aquifer and the increase in age can occur over distances of several kilometres marshall et al 2020 in contrast the increase in head gradient only occurs within the fault zone itself a situation similar to that of a finite fault can arise for an infinite fault if the fault permeability varies with fault length so that there are discrete windows where groundwater can flow through the fault the situation is somewhat different in unconfined aquifers with uniform recharge in these situations the fault will still present a barrier to groundwater flow and there will be a head decrease across the fault for an infinite fault the ratio of the head gradient across the fault to the head gradient in the aquifer immediately upstream of the fault will still be equal to the ratio between the aquifer and fault hydraulic conductivities fig 1e this neglects the perturbation to the age profile caused by the decrease in saturated aquifer thickness across the fault and hence assumes that the head drop is small relative to the saturated thickness as discussed above the vertical age profile in an aquifer receiving constant recharge reflects only the recharge rate porosity and aquifer thickness and does not change with distance along the flowline eq 1 the presence of the fault will not change the age distribution in the aquifer and so groundwater age measurements will not reveal the fault s presence for a finite fault the hydraulic gradient decreases across the fault although less than in the case of an infinite fault but the horizontal age gradient will still be close to zero fig 1h if it is not accompanied by a change in aquifer thickness then any fault offset will not greatly affect the age distributions discussed above groundwater flow is likely to be reduced in the parts of the aquifer that become juxtaposed against lower permeability layers see points marked with x in fig 2 the head profile will display increased vertical gradients near the fault but these should diminish with distance downstream if the offset is large then the older water in areas with less groundwater flow near the fault may impact the age profile further downstream and this might be seen as increased vertical stratification if the aquifer thickness changes downstream of the fault then the groundwater velocity will change which will cause a change in both head and age gradients downstream of the fault if a fault is parallel to the predominant direction of groundwater flow then for an aquifer of uniform thickness hydraulic conductivity and recharge there will be no cross fault flow and so the presence of the barrier will not affect either the head or groundwater age gradient however if aquifer conditions particularly hydraulic conductivity or recharge are not the same on either side of the fault then this may induce cross fault flow this will impact both hydraulic head and groundwater chemistry rajabpour and vaezihir 2017 since a transect of bores perpendicular to the fault should represent the component of groundwater flow in this direction i e across the fault a hydraulic head drop should be observed with the change in gradient across the fault proportional to the reduction in hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone as per fig 1a a change in groundwater age gradient across the fault may also occur due to differing groundwater velocities that may occur parallel to the fault on either side of the fault as per fig 1d if a fault is a conduit for vertical flow as well as a barrier then the head and age distributions will not be greatly changed from the barrier only case provided that the vertical flow rate is small relative to the horizontal flow rate across or around the fault if upward vertical along fault flow results in inflow of old water to shallow aquifers then groundwater age may display a step like increase at the fault with older water downgradient of the fault this is likely to be most apparent with tracers that are very sensitive to the presence of old water e g helium the horizontal age gradient further downgradient in the shallow aquifer should be similar to the upgradient age gradient assuming that the total inflow of groundwater at the fault is small relative to the overall flow rate several previous studies have observed tracer concentrations indicating old water at wells close to faults raiber et al 2015 batlle aguilar et al 2017 but we are not aware of any studies that have sampled in sufficient detail to detect changes in the age gradient across faults of course in complex multi aquifer systems the existence of conduit barrier faults can have more complex effects on hydraulic heads and groundwater ages this is particularly the case when vertical movement along a fault causes offsets to aquifer layers and juxtaposition of high and low permeability units some of these complexities were recently illustrated by bense and person 2006 and janos et al 2018 but are not discussed further here other geochemical data are unlikely to be affected by flow through a fault unless vertical or horizontal movement along the fault plane causes a change in geology from one side of the fault to the other or if geochemical changes are associated with the fault or fault filling materials ishikawa et al 2014 pereira et al 2010 changes in major and minor ions including electrical conductivity may occur if vertical flow along a fault causes inflow of water from other aquifers that have a different chemical composition however the absence of geochemical changes cannot rule out conduit behaviour particularly if the overlying and underlying aquifers have a similar geochemical composition groundwater age tracers are likely to be better indicators of vertical flow along faults than other geochemical tracers as groundwater ages will usually be different in overlying and underlying aquifers 3 site description 3 1 para fault adelaide plains the adelaide plains covers approximately 1100 km2 and is bounded by the gulf st vincent in the west the mount lofty ranges in the east the eden burnside fault in the south and the gawler river in the north and includes the metropolitan area of adelaide fig 3 it is part of the st vincent basin and consists of sub horizontal tertiary and quaternary sediments overlying fractured proterozoic rocks the geology defines a multilayered aquifer system the quaternary q sediments comprise a sequence of thin aquifers separated and semi confined by low permeability aquitards in the tertiary sediments sandstone and limestone four different aquifers t1 t2 t3 and t4 are distinguished the shallowest of these the t1 aquifer is underlain by the munno para clay aquitard and is the major productive aquifer the lowest of the tertiary aquifers t4 is underlain by the fractured bedrock aquifer the para fault pf is a major geological boundary and there is a greater thickness of sediments west of it up to 600 m than east of it less than 150 m batlle aguilar et al 2017 a gravity survey indicates that the para fault zone comprises one major fault with a maximum throw of 625 690 m with smaller nearly parallel faults on either side finlayson 1978 preiss 2019 the fault extends to and displaces the bedrock and has been active throughout most of the tertiary period but with the rate of movement decreasing through time the current conceptual model of the adelaide plains groundwater system is that groundwater is mainly recharged in the fractured rock aquifers of the mount lofty ranges and flows west across the eden burnside fault into the tertiary aquifers before finally discharging into gulf st vincent georgiou et al 2011 gerges 1999 rainfall is also believed to recharge the quaternary aquifer although vertical leakage into the tertiary aquifers is considered to be relatively small batlle aguilar et al 2017 groundwater extraction of approximately 7000 ml y 1 occurs for industrial use and managed aquifer recharge has occurred since the late 1990s an average of approximately 4500 ml y 1 has been injected into aquifers over the past 10 years of which approximately 3000 ml y 1 is extracted most of this extraction and injection is associated with the t1 aquifer which is the focus of this study the potentiometric surface indicates flow from the east and southeast towards the west and northwest fig 3 a large depression in the potentiometric surface near grange is due to groundwater extraction for industry in this area managed aquifer recharge injection contributes to the irregular shape of the 0 m ahd hydraulic head contour the adelaide plains has a mediterranean dry climate with mean annual rainfall of about 500 mm mean annual rainfall in parts of the mount lofty ranges exceeds 1000 mm the focus of this paper is an approximately flow parallel southeast northwest transect from the mt lofty ranges to gulf st vincent fig 3 the transect cuts through para fault and para fault west which are both part of the para fault system along the transect the thickness of the t1 aquifer increases from 70 to 80 m southeast of the para fault and between para fault and para fault west to 100 150 m northwest of para fault west 3 2 kanawinka fault otway basin the otway basin covers an area of approximately 100 000 km2 and contains in excess of 6000 m of marine and terrestrial sediments deposited during the cretaceous and tertiary periods love et al 1993 productive groundwater resources occur within the upper few hundred metres of this sedimentary sequence the unconfined aquifer system incorporates sediments of the padthaway bridgewater and coomandook formations and the gambier limestone oligocene to miocene with the latter being by far the largest unit fig 4 while the limestone is karstic in places groundwater flow is generally considered to occur as inter granular pore water flow love et al 1993 the gambier limestone is underlain by a 20 40 m thick aquitard this aquitard is composed of glauconitic and fossiliferous marls and clays of the narrawaturk marl and clay of the mepunga formation as well as laterally intermittent marls at the base of the gambier limestone and brown to black clay and lignite horizons at the top of the dilwyn formation the lower confined aquifer system occurs within underlying interlayered sand and clay layers of the dilwyn formation love et al 1993 amongst the most significant geomorphic features of the region are the stranded beach ridges of the bridgewater formation and the kanawinka escarpment the stranded beach and dune ridges parallel the current coastline and are believed to have formed during quaternary interglacial and insterstadial periods mclaren et al 2011 kanawinka escarpment also roughly parallels the current coastline it extends for over 600 km and may also represent a former coastline or sea cliff mclaren et al 2011 one of the more significant geological features is the kanawinka fault which trends northwest and extends for over 170 km the fault extends to crystalline basement west of bordertown 70 km north of naracoorte fig 4 and at naracoorte the top of the tertiary gambier limestone has been offset by about 40 m cook et al 1977 drik drik fault a segment of the kanawinka fault system in western victoria has an offset of about 70 m singleton et al 1976 movement on the kanawinka fault has occurred at least as recently as 2 2 1 7 million years ago cook et al 1977 regional groundwater flow is predominantly from east to west the hydraulic head gradient in the unconfined aquifer is approximately 2 10 3 in the eastern part of the basin and 7 10 4 further west fig 4 between these two areas regional maps show a head drop of around 20 m over a horizontal distance of around 5 km gradient 4 10 3 in an area roughly coincident with the mapped locations of both the kanawinka escarpment and the kanawinka fault both the escarpment and the head drop have often been attributed to the presence of the fault love et al 1993 mean annual rainfall ranges from 750 mm at millicent to 580 mm at naracoorte land use is dryland and irrigated agriculture and grazing the surface elevation and detailed stratigraphy along a 36 km long transect approximately perpendicular to kanawinka escarpment and kanawinka fault is depicted in fig 4 while the kanawinka fault is often considered to be coincident with the escarpment the available bore logs show an offset of the top of mepunga formation occurring between bores 7023 6909 and 7023 2925 which are between 4 and 11 km west of the escarpment respectively other offsets in the top of the mepunga formation both with coincident offsets of similar magnitude in the top of the underlying dilwyn formation occur further west between 7023 2925 and 7023 2905 and between 7023 0819 and 7023 3675 the total offset of the top of the mepunga formation observed along the transect is approximately 150 m 3 3 willunga fault willunga basin the willunga basin is located approximately 45 km south of adelaide and is a gently dipping wedge shaped basin of cainozoic sediments formed by reactivated palaeozoic faults during the eocene the geological development of the basin is similar to that of the adelaide plains to the north also being bounded by proterozoic rocks to the south and east and gulf st vincent to the west preiss 2019 willunga basin covers an area of approximately 250 km2 and the willunga fault forms the eastern and southern boundary of the basin fig 5 the basin contains three main aquifer systems the port willunga formation aquifer pwf the maslin sands aquifer ms and a fractured basement rock aquifer fra fig 5 the port willunga formation is a calcareous sandy and silty limestone and calcareous sandstone while the maslin sands is a fluvial to marginal marine siliceous sand groundwater in both sedimentary aquifers flows from the northeast to the southwest roughly parallel to fault the mean hydraulic conductivity of the pwf is approximately 1 m d 1 for the ms the mean hydraulic conductivity is approximately 0 5 m d 1 although all pumping tests were conducted on bores in the northern part of the aquifer and may not be representative of the entire aquifer system aldam 1990 the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured rock aquifer has been estimated at 0 1 m d 1 martin et al 2006 although it is likely to be highly variable as flow would be controlled by fractures land use is mostly irrigated agriculture mostly vineyards with some grazing of sheep and cattle mean annual rainfall is approximately 600 mm three transects of bores were drilled across willunga fault with bore screens completed in the fra east of the fault and in the sedimentary aquifers west of the fault all transects are oriented approximately southeast to northwest the central transect is located approximately 7 km south of the northern transect and 3 km north of the southern transect on the southern transect bores west of the fault were only installed in the pwf on the northern transect the pwf is dry fig 6 4 methods groundwater investigations at all three sites have been ongoing for many years and these have included monitoring of groundwater levels and water chemistry as well as some geochemical sampling of groundwater age indicators more recently interest in the roles of the faults has led to targeted drilling and sampling along both kanawinka and willunga faults along the para fault transect geochemical sampling relies only on existing government and private bores and was carried out in january 1992 wells ade025 ade040 ade062 ade130 ade149 as part of regional investigations of the adelaide aquifer gerges 1999 with more targeted investigations in november december 2013 ade005 ade187 ade207 25759 batlle aguilar et al 2017 and december 2020 27008 along kanawinka fault groundwater samples were collected during november 2012 7023 5280 7135 7133 7259 7134 turnadge et al 2013 and july 2020 7023 6798 6794 7075 groundwater samples across the willunga fault were collected in april may 2013 with regional samples from the willunga basin mostly collected between september 2012 and april 2013 as rainfall is low 500 650 mm y 1 rates of groundwater recharge are also low and so groundwater at the three sites presented in this paper is mostly several thousand years old 14c is therefore the preferred approach for determination of groundwater age previous regional scale studies at these sites have also measured cfc 12 3h and or helium on some bores gerges 1999 turnadge et al 2013 battle aguilar et al 2017 but as 14c is the only age indicator available at all three sites and the other tracers are only available and above background on a small number of bores only 14c data are presented in this paper at least three bore volumes were purged prior to sampling except for private bores that had recently been pumped for irrigation water supply samples were collected for 14c and 13c 12c analyses on total dissolved inorganic carbon tdic with most bores also sampled for major ion analysis and electrical conductivity measurement in some cases bores were not sampled for major ions at the time of isotope sample collection and chloride concentration data are obtained from the government database https www waterconnect sa gov au systems gd pages default aspx samples obtained between 2008 and 2010 for all samples 14c analysis was by ams and 13c 12c analysis was by irms laboratory details are not available for 1992 samples gerges 1999 but more recent analyses were carried out by rafter radiocarbon new zealand except the samples collected along kanawinka fault in 2012 which were analysed for 13c 12c at csiro and for 14c at anu errors are not available for 1992 samples but for all others are between 0 15 and 0 2 for δ13c and between 0 1 and 0 3 pmc for 14c apparent 14c ages have been calculated after first correcting 14c activities based on the measured δ13c ratio and assumed 13c values and 14c activities of soil co2 and carbonate minerals 3 a corr a tdic δ r δ m δ tdic δ m where atdic and δtdic are the measured 14c activity and δ13c value on tdic and δr and δm are the assumed initial δ13c ratios in groundwater recharge and carbonate in the aquifer matrix respectively clark and fritz 1997 this equation assumes that the aquifer matrix contains negligible 14c while groundwater extraction causes significant small scale variability in hydraulic head for all aquifers the volumes of water extracted are small relative to the storage volume and so it is reasonable to assume that this has not significantly impacted groundwater ages rather groundwater ages should reflect the flow pattern that existed prior to european settlement when the sites were covered with native vegetation managed aquifer recharge injection in the adelaide plains would impact groundwater ages if injected water was sampled and so these areas have been deliberately avoided to minimise the impacts of groundwater extraction on measured head gradients hydraulic head data are only presented for bores where temporal changes in head are small relative to spatial differences or where data are available for periods before groundwater extraction for the adelaide plains transect hydraulic head data are presented for september which is after the end of winter and usually coincides with the maximum annual water level where possible the most recent data are used although where significant decreases in water level over time are observed data are presented for the time before water levels began to decline for this reason and because water level measurements are not regularly carried out on private bores measurements span a period from the mid 1980s for the otway basin transect hydraulic head measurements are shown for 2008 2009 when data was available for most bores exceptions are bores 7023 485 and 7023 487 1975 and 7023 5280 1996 however bores that have been monitored regularly for more than 12 years show less than 4 m variation over that period which is much less than the variation along the transect and so variation in time of measurement is not considered significant all hydraulic head data presented for the willunga basin was measured in april to may 2013 5 results 5 1 para fault adelaide plains while groundwater flow in the adelaide plains t1 aquifer is generally from southeast to northwest parallel with the transect there is significant small scale spatial variability in hydraulic head due to proximity to sites of groundwater extraction seasonal fluctuations in water levels can also be more than 5 m with highest water levels typically observed in september each year an approximate potentiometric surface is therefore determined using only the highest hydraulic heads measured along the transect fig 7 a the slope of this potentiometric surface decreases from southeast to northwest the predominant direction of regional flow the head gradient east of para fault is approximately 0 003 and west of para fault west it is less than 0 0005 this decrease in gradient is likely to be in part due to the increase in thickness of the t1 aquifer there is no indication of sharp changes in hydraulic head across either fault but wells are not closely spaced and several may be impacted by groundwater extraction carbon 14 activity generally decreases from southeast to northwest along the transect fig 7b δ13c also becomes less depleted to the northwest and 14c and δ13c are correlated fig 8 δ13c values range between 11 5 and 6 6 with 14c values between 1 3 and 36 8 pmc samples with low 14c activities are generally more enriched in δ13c suggesting that the decrease of 14c activity by radioactive decay is enhanced by dissolution of marine carbonate minerals pearson and hanshaw 1970 batlle aguilar et al 2017 reported δ13c values in groundwater samples from across the adelaide plains ranging between 15 2 and 2 8 with uncorrected 14c activities between 0 4 and 91 pmc these authors corrected 14c activities for dissolution of marine carbonate based on the δ13c value of each sample they assumed an initial δ13c value in recharge of 11 3 which was the mean value measured in groundwater in the quaternary aquifer and the fractured rock aquifers in the mount lofty ranges which are the potential recharge sources for the t1 aquifer marine carbonate was assumed to contain negligible 14c eq 3 and have a δ13c value of 0 applying this same correction corrected 14c activities for bores shown in table 1 range between 2 3 and 41 pmc with apparent groundwater ages between 7300 and 31 500 years fig 7c the age gradient along the transect is relatively constant east of para fault west albeit with significant scatter with a mean gradient of approximately 1 y m 1 fig 7c some of the scatter in the age data may be due to differences in screen depths of sampled bores along the transect based on a recharge rate of r 1 mm y 1 aquifer thickness of h 100 m porosity ε 0 2 and sampling depth of z 20 m the vertical age gradient obtained through differentiating eq 2 is estimated to be dt dz 250 y m 1 thus a 10 m variation in sampling depth would result in an age variation of approximately 2500 years this is of the same order as the variation apparent along the transect based on a hydraulic conductivity of 0 2 m d 1 and porosity of 0 2 the mean gradient of 1 y m 1 is consistent with the observed hydraulic gradient the apparent increase in age gradient west of para fault west is only defined by a single 14c value but is consistent with the reduction in hydraulic gradient in this area however it is greater than can be explained by the increase in aquifer thickness and may reflect a reduction in flow rate due to upward leakage to overlying aquifers in this part of the basin the lack of a step change in hydraulic head at the location of either the pf or pfw together with the lack of a clear age discontinuity suggests that the fault is not a significant barrier to flow however the relatively large bore spacing along the transect and the effects of groundwater pumping complicate interpretation chloride and electrical conductivity data also do not show any trend across the fault or chemical anomalies in the vicinity of the fault table 1 batlle aguilar et al 2017 observed anomalously high chloride and helium concentrations in the fractured rock aquifer close to the para fault but north of the transect shown in figs 3 and 7 while this might be due to upward flow along the fault as speculated by batlle aguilar et al 2017 no such anomalies were observed either in the t1 or the underlying t2 aquifer our data and that of batlle aguilar et al 2017 therefore present little evidence of either barrier or conduit behaviour of this fault for the t1 aquifer 5 2 kanawinka fault otway basin the change in surface elevation across the kanawinka escarpment at the transect location is approximately 70 m with most of this change occurring over a horizontal distance of about 5 km fig 9 a the change in hydraulic head is approximately 60 m and this occurs over 5 10 km the maximum observed head gradient is about 10 2 and approximately coincides with the location of greatest topographic gradient while the bore spacing in this area is almost 1 km data appear to describe a smooth head change that contrasts strongly with the step like change shown in fig 1a infinite barrier conceptual model the observed data are therefore not consistent with the presence of a thin low permeability fault core and more consistent with a very wide 5 km zone of reduced hydraulic conductivity the head gradient is approximately one order of magnitude greater than the regional gradient suggesting that the hydraulic conductivity might only be one order of magnitude less however if the reduction in hydraulic conductivity induces some water to flow around the barrier then the head drop across the barrier will be less than the reduction in permeability and so the hydraulic conductivity of the barrier could be more than one order of magnitude less than that of the aquifer there is no trend in either electrical conductivity or chloride with distance along the transect table 2 carbon 14 activity decreases from the northeast to the southwest fig 9b excluding 7023 5280 the most westerly bore 14c and δ13c are correlated table 2 samples with low 14c activities are more enriched in δ13c suggesting dissolution of marine carbonate minerals following love et al 1993 14c ages have been determined after first correcting for dissolution of marine carbonate based on measured δ13c values of tdic and assuming an initial δ13c value in recharge of 14 eq 3 apparent 14c ages increase with distance along the transect fig 9c where the head gradient is steepest and immediately downgradient of this point the horizontal age gradient is approximately 0 8 y m 1 bore 7023 7075 at 20 km distance falls below this trend line but the top of its screen is shallower than that of the other bores in this part of the aquifer fig 4 between 18 and 13 km the age gradient increases to approximately 1 7 y m 1 although this is only based on one bore this bore 7023 5280 which is the most downgradient samples the lower part of the aquifer which may explain the apparently increased horizontal gradient however studies in other parts of the basin estimated the groundwater velocity in the gambier unconfined aquifer from darcy s law to be typically between 5 and 50 m y 1 love et al 1993 the apparent groundwater velocity at the transect location is therefore unlikely to reflect the regional groundwater velocity numerical modelling has found that diversion of flow around barriers of finite length can cause increased groundwater age gradients across barriers and that the zone of increased age gradient can be several kilometres in width even though the barriers may be very narrow marshall et al 2020 fig 1d the large increase in groundwater age observed across kanawinka fault is therefore consistent with water being diverted around a low permeability zone coincident with the escarpment however whether the reduction in permeability reflects the presence of a fault or a reduction in permeability associated with erosion and reworking of marine and terrestrial sediments by wave action is unclear the head gradient is less abrupt than would be expected for a single fault contrast fig 6 with fig 1c while a series of closely spaced faults cannot be ruled out stratigraphic mapping does not show significant displacement of layers in this part of the aquifer it is therefore possible that the observed hydraulic head and age gradients both reflect the decrease in hydraulic conductivity of the embankment sediments and are not directly associated with the fault further north love et al 1993 identified an increase in 14c activity and hence groundwater age in the confined aquifer downgradient of kanawinka fault that may be due to downward leakage from the unconfined aquifer associated with the fault however there are no data from the confined aquifer along the transect examined in the current study 5 3 willunga fault willunga basin three transects of bores were drilled across willunga fault with bore screens completed in the fra east of the fault and in the pwf and ms west of the fault except on the southern transect where bores were only completed in the pwf the spacing of bores along these transects is much closer than at either the para fault or kanawinka fault sites at the northern transect bore 16b screened at 90 m ahd in the pwf west of the fault is dry whereas the water table on the east of the fault in the fractured rock aquifer is approximately 173 m ahd bores 11a 11d indicating a head drop in excess of 80 m over a distance of approximately 60 m fig 6a and 10a the head drop between the fra and the ms bore 16a is 62 m over the same distance in the central transect the head drop across the fault and between the fra and the pwf is 88 m over approximately 37 m and the head drop between the fra and the ms is 63 m over 33 m fig 6b at the southern transect the head drop across the fault between the fra and the pwf is 60 m over 90 m fig 6c at these three transects the head gradient across the fault between the fra and pwf thus ranges between 0 7 and 2 4 and between the fra and ms it ranges between 1 0 and 1 9 the gradient across the fault itself may be even higher than these values because bores may not be located immediately either side of the fault along the northern transect chloride concentration decreases from 283 454 mg l 1 in the fra to the east of the fault to 159 165 mg l 1 in the ms to the west carbon 14 activity decrease from 56 to 69 pmc in the fra to 24 3 pmc in well 13a in the ms fig 10 only a single data point is available for the fra on the central transect 45 pmc and this overlaps with the pwf 40 64 pmc but is distinct from the ms 2 pmc there is significant overlap in activities across the fault on the southern transect 45 75 pmc in fra and 38 59 pmc in pwf across all three transects observed 14c activities are between 38 and 64 pmc in the pwf 2 24 pmc in the ms and 45 76 pmc in the fra apart from one outlier 14c is linearly correlated with δ13c r2 0 78 with δ13c becoming less negative at lower 14c activities table 3 this indicates that lower 14c activities are due to geochemical interactions with aquifer materials as well as radioactive decay since along fault flow in the sedimentary aquifers is likely to greatly exceed cross fault flow it is instructive to examine changes in 14c and chloride parallel to the fault in the ms and pwf relative to values observed in the fra east of the fault fig 11 there is no noticeable trend in 14c activities with distance along the fault in the fra fig 11b d which is consistent with this aquifer being dominated by local recharge rather than regional flow 14c activities in the fra are higher than those in the ms fig 11b 14c activities in the ms aquifer decrease from the north to the south the predominant direction of flow until 10 000 m distance samples from bores located close to the fault fig 6 follow the same trend as those further from the fault locations shown in fig 5 compare red open and closed circles in fig 11 which is contrary to what would be expected if there were high rates of flow across the fault into the ms the increase in 14c activity in the ms more than 200 m from the fault after 12000 m along fault distance fig 11b is believed to be due to leakage from the overlying pwf in this part of the system herczeg and leaney 2002 no data from the ms is available for within 200 m of the fault after 12000 m chloride concentrations in the fra east of the fault increase in the direction of inferred groundwater flow concentrations upgradient of 3400 m are less than 500 mg l 1 whereas at 13300 m concentrations range between 520 and 3100 mg l 1 the chloride concentration in the ms aquifer increases with distance between 3400 and 10200 m and this could be due to leakage across the fault from the fra which has higher chloride concentrations in the pwf 14c activities in the fractured rock and sedimentary aquifer are not sufficiently distinct to use 14c as a tracer of cross fault leakage however chloride concentrations in the pwf decrease between 10 200 and 13 300 m even though activities in the fra are generally greater than those in the sedimentary aquifer this suggests that there cannot be significant cross fault leakage at this location to constrain possible flow rates across the fault we used a simple analytical model of 1d fault parallel flow in the sedimentary aquifers with vertical input from groundwater recharge in the unconfined pwf and lateral groundwater input from cross fault flow from the fra for both ms and pwf the change in concentration with distance in the sedimentary aquifers adjacent to the fault can be expressed 4 q c x r h c r c q f w c f c λ θ c where c is concentration q is the flow rate parallel to the fault m y qf is the flow across the fault into the sedimentary aquifer m y 1 and cf is the concentration of cross fault flow r is the recharge rate m y 1 zero in the case of the confined maslins sand aquifer cr is the concentration of recharge h is the aquifer thickness m λ is the decay coefficient 1 21 10 4 y 1 for 14c and zero for chloride θ is porosity x is distance in the direction of flow i e parallel to the fault m and w m is the assumed width of the flowline where flow from the fault mixes with flow in the sedimentary aquifer if we assume values for q h r cr and cf then we can estimate qf w from changes in concentration c with distance x to apply equation 4 to 14c activities however we need to consider possible differences in tdic concentrations between the fra and sedimentary aquifers mean alkalinity concentrations for bores presented in this paper are 6 1 7 0 and 8 2 meq l 1 for the pwf fra and ms respectively these differences are not considered significant and so correction is not considered necessary for the ms the decrease in 14c activity that is observed in all bores within 4 km of the fault puts an upper limit on the groundwater velocity in this aquifer parallel to the fault of approximately 0 3 m y 1 and hence an upper limit on q of approximately 0 1 m y 1 fig 12 a based on the potentiometric gradient parallel to the fault of approximately 0 005 dfw 2012 this suggests a hydraulic conductivity for the ms aquifer of less than 0 05 m d 1 significantly lower than measured in the upper parts of the basin between 3300 and 10200 m the 14c activity of groundwater in the fra east of the fault is much greater than in the sedimentary aquifer and averages approximately 60 pmc based on the flow rate of q 0 1 m y 1 θ 0 3 and cf 60 pmc a flow across the fault of only qf w 5 10 6 y 1 would result in a 14c activity of 8 4 pmc at 10200 m more than 3 5 times greater than the observed value giving an upper limit on cross fault flow at this location the mean chloride concentration in the ms increases from 159 to 165 mg l 1 at 3300 m to 973 mg l 1 at 10200 m the mean chloride concentration in the fractured rock aquifer increases from 364 mg l 1 to 437 mg l 1 over the same distance but then subsequently increases to 1720 mg l 1 at 13300 m the increase in chloride concentration in the ms between 3300 m and 10200 m can therefore only be explained by flow across the fault if the chloride concentration east of the fault is higher than measured in this part of the system if we use cf 1500 mg l 1 then the observed concentration of 973 mg l 1 at 10200 m is reproduced with qf w 1 4 10 5 y 1 however the chloride concentration in the ms at this location is defined by only a single measurement and the concentration in the fra is extremely variable so the estimated flow rate across the fault is highly uncertain in the pwf chloride concentrations decrease with distance despite the higher concentration in the fra the mean chloride concentration in the pwf is 745 mg l 1 at 10200 m and 560 mg l 1 at 13300 m whereas the mean concentration in the fra between 10 200 and 13 000 m is approximately 1370 mg l 1 this allows estimation of a maximum flow rate across the fault as any flow should have resulted in an increase in concentration rather than a decrease assuming a groundwater flow rate parallel to the fault of q 2 m y 1 based on a mean hydraulic conductivity of 1 m d 1 and hydraulic gradient of approximately 0 005 cf 1370 mg l 1 and r 0 a flux of qf w 1 8 10 4 y 1 results in a chloride concentration in the pwf at 13300 m that is 25 more than the maximum observed value fig 12c since recharge would decrease the chloride concentration including r 0 05 m y 1 herczeg and leaney 2002 h 100 m and cr 100 mg l 1 results in a higher flow rate of qf w 9 10 4 y 1 this value is relatively insensitive to the assumed flow rate in the pwf q and the chloride concentration of groundwater recharge cr but is sensitive to the assumed recharge rate nevertheless doubling the recharge rate to r 0 10 m y 1 would only require an increase in the cross fault flow rate to approximately qf w 1 7 10 3 y 1 to estimate qf we need to first estimate w since the flow rates across the fault are low dispersion rather than advective flow will dominate the mixing process the transverse dispersivity at scales of 1 10 km is estimated from gelhar et al 1992 to be approximately αt 5 m the mixing width w can then be estimated as the scale length for dispersive mixing perpendicular to the fault using 5 w 4 d t t 4 α t v x v 4 α t x where dt is the transverse dispersion coefficient t is travel time and v is the groundwater velocity and x is travel distance both in the direction of flow thus for the ms the distance along the fault parallel transect of x 7 km gives w 375 m for the pwf x 3 km and therefore w 250 m thus the maximum flow rate across the fault into the ms is 0 002 m y 1 5 10 6 y 1 375 m and for the pwf it is 0 45 m y 1 1 8 10 3 y 1 250 m of course there are uncertainties with many of the model parameters and so these results are probably only accurate to within an order of magnitude since analysis of geochemical data allows estimation of maximum rates of flow across the fault and head data provides minimum values for the head gradient across the fault we can calculate maximum values for the hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone we use the head gradients for the central transect as the proximity of the bores to the fault at this site provide the best estimates of the head gradient across the fault the flow rate across the fault into the ms is estimated to be less than 0 002 m y 1 giving a maximum hydraulic conductivity for the fault of 10 3 m y 1 3 10 6 m d 1 for the pwf the flow rate is estimated to be less than 0 45 m y 1 giving a maximum hydraulic conductivity of 0 18 m y 1 5 10 4 m d 1 these values are approximately 4 5 orders of magnitude lower than the estimated hydraulic conductivities of the sedimentary aquifers and 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the fractured rock aquifer 6 discussion a recent review of fault hydrology found that faults were assessed as conduits for groundwater flow at 70 of sites that were investigated and as barriers at 50 of sites scibek et al 2016 at 20 of sites faults exhibited both barrier and conduit behaviour however determining the hydrogeological role of faults is complicated by the biases of different investigation techniques for example hydraulic head data are best suited for identifying the barrier behaviour of faults while studies of inflow to tunnels are best suited for determining conduit behaviour scibek et al 2016 while previous studies using temperature and water chemistry including chemical indicators of groundwater age have mostly been used to infer conduit behaviour e g bense et al 2008 gumm et al 2016 marshall et al 2020 recently illustrated the potential for groundwater age to be used to determine barrier behaviour thus groundwater age can potentially illustrate both barrier and conduit behaviour this paper presents simple conceptual models of hydraulic head and groundwater age perpendicular to and across faults in terms of the resistance to flow across a fault the resistance to flow around the fault and the recharge regime contrasting hydraulic head and groundwater age profiles occur for infinite and finite faults because the latter permit groundwater to flow around the fault rather than through it although the models refer to flow around a finite fault zones of higher fault core permeability within a longer fault could generate the same effect as groundwater may travel laterally along the fault possibly assisted by high along fault permeability within a damage zone caine et al 1996 until a zone of higher fault core permeability is encountered the spatial variability of fault core properties has been widely reported e g de rosa et al 2018 step changes in hydraulic heads occur across both finite and infinite faults and in both upgradient and constant recharge regimes in contrast for upgradient recharge the groundwater age will increase linearly with horizontal distance and this trend will not be perturbed by the presence of an infinite fault that is perpendicular to the flow direction for finite faults with upgradient recharge the horizontal age gradient will increase in the vicinity of the fault this should be able to be detected in transects of bores for constant recharge groundwater age will be less diagnostic layer offsets cause only small perturbation to head and age profiles although changes in aquifer thickness may cause differences between upgradient and downgradient head and age gradients hydraulic head groundwater age chloride concentration and electrical conductivity data are presented across three fault systems to explore the different conceptual models and to examine the utility of these types of measurements for determining fault barrier conduit behaviour while other data can be used to provide information on the hydrological role of faults the purpose of the paper is to illustrate how groundwater age can supplement hydraulic head data in assessing the role of faults rather than to provide a comprehensive analysis of fault behaviour at each site the latter would require a much more comprehensive study potentially involving geophysical surveys saribudak and hawkins 2019 pumping tests adjacent to the fault zone gannon et al 2012 and coring through the fault system itself carpenter et al 2014 to our knowledge groundwater age data collected from multiple wells arranged in short transects across fault systems has not previously been reported at para fault adelaide plains horizontal spacing of bores sampled for 14c averages approximately 1 km variation in bore depth and the difficulty in obtaining bores along a groundwater flow line contributes to relatively wide scatter in the 14c activities and apparent 14c ages nevertheless there is no evidence of an increased horizontal age gradient in the fault zones and no obvious perturbations to the head profile this may suggest that the fault does not present a barrier to cross fault flow in the t1 aquifer there is also no evidence for the presence of old water from deeper layers in the t1 aquifer either in 14c or chloride data suggesting that the fault may not be a significant conduit for vertical flow an earlier study did observe anomalously high chloride and helium concentrations close to the para fault in the deeper fractured rock aquifer approximately 7 km further north batlle aguilar et al 2017 however such anomalies were not observed in the t1 or in the underlying t2 aquifer at the kanawinka fault otway basin horizontal spacing of bores sampled for 14c averages approximately 2 km a steepening of the head gradient is apparent at the location of the kanawinka escarpment but stratigraphic data suggests that the major faulting is located further west however despite a steepening of the gradient there is no sharp head drop such as might be expected across a low permeability fault the horizontal groundwater age gradient in the vicinity of the fault is relatively smooth but much greater than the regional gradient observed elsewhere this might be consistent with a local barrier to flow that is not laterally continuous however the precise location of the fault is uncertain and so it is also uncertain whether the flow barrier represents the fault or a reduction in hydraulic conductivity due to depositional and erosional processes related to development of the kanawinka escarpment chemistry data collected at the site does not show evidence of upward flow from deeper layers although an earlier study 40 km further north identified an increase in 14c activity and hence decrease in groundwater age in the confined aquifer downgradient of the fault that may be due to downward leakage from the unconfined aquifer associated with the fault willunga fault in the willunga basin represents a different geological setting to both para fault and kanawinka fault willunga fault forms the boundary between the sedimentary sequence and fractured rock basement a very large head gradient is observed over a short horizontal distance confirming that the fault represents a low permeability zone changes in groundwater age chloride and electrical conductivity are also observed across the fault since flow in the sedimentary aquifers mostly occurs parallel to the fault changes in water chemistry parallel to the fault in the sedimentary aquifers were used to quantify the rate of cross fault flow thus while the fault is a barrier to flow groundwater can move across it the hydraulic conductivity of the fault core was estimated to be 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than the hydraulic conductivity of the adjacent aquifers based on the rate of cross fault flow and hydraulic gradient this is consistent with estimates of the reduction in fault core permeability at other sites e g evans et al 1997 interpretation of the hydrogeological role of faults from groundwater age data may require a greater data density than is generally available from existing groundwater monitoring networks in the current study specific transects of bores perpendicular to faults were installed at two of the three sites kanawinka fault and willunga fault at para fault existing bores were used and it is possible that the lack of more detailed information at this site has partly contributed to the conclusion that the fault does not act as a hydrogeological barrier data density is important across many areas of hydrogeology and the requirement for high data density increases as aquifer heterogeneity increases miller et al 2016 variation in bore depth along a transect is also likely to be an issue for the use of groundwater age data ideally bores at different depths would allow both vertical and horizontal age gradients to be determined since variations with depth are likely to be more pronounced for groundwater age than for hydraulic head high data density is likely to be more important for groundwater age data however identifying conduit behaviour of faults from groundwater chemistry data may be possible but perhaps not definitive with a much lower data density thus a single measurement in a shallow aquifer of a definitive chemical signature from a deeper aquifer may indicate vertical conduit flow associated with a fault e g gardner et al 2012 gumm et al 2016 but the lack of such an observation does not indicate the lack of conduit flow thus conduit behaviour cannot be ruled out at any of the faults investigated in the present study 7 conclusions measurement of groundwater age along transects of bores perpendicular to and across faults can provide information on both conduit and barrier behaviour of fault zones this paper presents hydraulic head 14c chloride and electrical conductivity in groundwater across three contrasting faults large head and age gradients are apparent at two of the three sites but at one of these sites the gradients may not be coincident with the fault location and may be due to other processes at one site where regional flow is mostly parallel to the fault 14c age and chloride data are used to estimate the rate of cross fault flow the third fault may not be a barrier to cross fault flow as there is no clear increase in either head or age gradient although our data does not indicate conduit behaviour such behaviour has been suggested based on groundwater chemistry at other locations on two of these

3338,faults can act as barriers to cross fault flow conduits to along fault flow or both groundwater age inferred from hydrochemical data is one of the few tools that can estimate both barrier and conduit behaviour of the fault and associated fault damage zone conduit behaviour has been previously inferred from the existence of young water in deep aquifers or old water in shallow aquifers while the ability of groundwater age to estimate the barrier behaviour of faults has been illustrated theoretically it has not yet been observed in the field here conceptual models of hydraulic head and groundwater age perpendicular to and across faults are discussed in terms of the resistance to flow across the fault fault width divided by cross fault transmissivity the resistance to flow around the fault fault length divided by aquifer transmissivity and the recharge regime to examine these conceptual models field measurements of hydraulic head 14c chloride and electrical conductivity in groundwater are presented along transects across three contrasting fault systems large cross fault head and age gradients are apparent at two of the three sites at one of these sites where regional flow is mostly parallel to the fault 14c age and chloride data are used to estimate the rate of cross fault flow at the third site there may not be a barrier to cross fault flow as there is no clear increase in either head or age gradient the studies illustrate the importance of high data density to characterise fault zones particularly for groundwater age which will vary both with depth and horizontal location along a transect although our data does not indicate conduit behaviour such behaviour has been suggested based on groundwater chemistry at other locations along the fault strike at two of the sites keywords groundwater age hydraulic head carbon 14 fault 1 introduction within the past few decades there has been increasing attention on the role of geological faults on groundwater flow it is now recognised that faults can act as either barriers or conduits to flow or they can act as conduit barrier systems caine et al 1996 bense 2013 scibek et al 2016 in consolidated sediments and rocks conduit barrier systems occur when the fault core has low permeability but a damage zone with higher permeability is present either side of the core in unconsolidated sediments conduit barrier behaviour can result from anisotropy of clay and sand smearing in the fault core these situations typically produce a barrier to cross fault flow but a conduit for along fault flow faults can also affect groundwater flow where vertical movement along a fault plane causes changes in aquifer thickness offset of aquifers and or juxtaposition of aquifers and aquitards bense and person 2006 while the location of faults can often be inferred from geological mapping and surface geophysics saribudak and hawkins 2019 characterising groundwater flow in and around faults is more challenging where a fault acts as a conduit vertical flow along the fault may cause changes in groundwater temperature or chemistry thus for example along fault flow may be detected from the upward flow of warmer bense et al 2008 or older e g castro and goblet 2005 raiber et al 2015 gumm et al 2016 batlle aguilar et al 2017 water into shallow aquifers or the presence of radioisotopes produced within the fault itself e g radon pereira et al 2010 several papers have described hydraulic head changes across faults which are generally taken to indicate the role of these faults as barriers to cross fault flow e g haneberg 1995 cilona et al 2015 delinom 2009 bense et al 2003 bense et al 2008 recently marshall et al 2020 showed that the diversion of groundwater flow around faults that are barriers to flow may result in increases in groundwater age downstream of such structures however while theoretical studies have suggested that faults that act as barriers to flow may affect the distribution of groundwater ages both upstream and downstream we are not aware of any field studies that have investigated or observed such phenomena this paper examines hydraulic head and water chemistry changes across three fault systems in south australia para fault in the adelaide plains kanawinka fault in the otway basin and willunga fault in the willunga basin in each case 14c data are used as an indicator of groundwater age and hydraulic heads 14c activities and apparent 14c ages are presented from bore transects across each fault the paper discusses the extent to which head and groundwater age data are able to constrain the hydrological role of the fault and in particular whether or not groundwater ages can identify whether faults act as barriers to cross fault flow 2 theory in seeking to understand the effect of faults on hydraulic head and groundwater age data it is useful to first consider some highly idealised systems here we consider faults that are barriers to flow across them and also consider both aquifers that receive constant recharge and aquifers that are confined and or receive negligible recharge in the vicinity of the fault in the absence of a fault for a homogeneous aquifer receiving constant recharge it has previously been shown that the vertical groundwater age profile will be 1 t h ε r l n h h z where t is groundwater age r is the recharge rate z is depth below the water table h is saturated aquifer thickness and ε is porosity vogel 1967 cook and bohlke 2000 and the groundwater age refers to the time since water recharged the aquifer the groundwater age thus increases with depth in the aqufer however age does not increase with distance downgradient if a specific depth in the aquifer is considered while the age of any water parcel must become older as it flows downgradient water moves deeper into the aquifer as it moves downgradient pushed down by new recharge this is encapsulated in eq 1 by the increase in age with depth and so a separate term reflecting horizontal position in the aquifer is not required samples collected from the same depth should therefore be the same age while age increases exponentially with depth near the top of the aquifer the increase in age with depth is close to linear thus in the top half of the aquifer z h 2 in eq 1 a 10 increase in depth will result in an increase in age of between 10 and 15 for an aquifer that is confined and or receives all its recharge in upgradient areas the age will increase both with depth and distance and can be expressed 2 t h ε r l n h h z x h ε r x r where xr is the length of the upgradient recharge area and x is the distance downgradient from the recharge area cook and bohlke 2000 there are two terms on the rhs of this equation the first represents the increase in age with depth which is generated in the upgradient recharge area eq 1 the second represents the increase in age with distance due to horizontal flow in the part of the aquifer no longer receiving recharge overall the relative increase in age with depth in the part of the aquifer receiving no recharge will be less than for an aquifer with constant recharge for faulted aquifers we first consider the simplest case of one dimensional steady state flow towards and across a fault that has a hydraulic conductivity less than that of the aquifer for the moment we neglect any aquifer offset associated with the faulting the 1d flow assumption means that all the groundwater must flow through the fault there will be a head drop across the fault and the ratio of the head gradient across the fault to the head gradient within the aquifer immediately upgradient and downgradient of the fault will be equal to the ratio between the aquifer and fault hydraulic conductivities haneberg 1995 fig 1 a the groundwater flux will be constant along this flowline and so if the porosity is constant then the velocity and hence the horizontal groundwater age gradient will also be constant fig 1b thus the groundwater age measured at a specific depth will increase linearly with distance equation 2 furthermore the age profile will not be perturbed from that which would occur without the fault even though the head profile shows a marked decrease across the fault which might resemble a step change if no data was available from within the fault itself in a three dimensional aquifer system this might be equivalent to the situation where i the regional groundwater flow is directed towards a fault ii flow is predominantly driven by recharge in upgradient areas and recharge in the vicinity of the fault is negligible and iii the fault hydraulic conductivity is less than that of the aquifer but not sufficiently low for the water table to rise above the land surface leading to spring discharge it also represents a system where the fault is very long so that the resistance to flow around it is much greater than the resistance to flow through it we henceforth refer to this as an infinite fault the resistance to flow through a fault is equal to the fault thickness divided by its transmissivity perpendicular to the fault plane and the resistance to flow around it can be considered as the length of the fault divided by the aquifer transmissivity in contrast if the resistance to flow around the fault is similar to or less than the resistance to flow through it we henceforth refer to this as a finite fault then some of the groundwater flowing towards the fault will be diverted around it marshall et al 2020 the head drop across this type of fault will be less than in the infinite fault case and the head gradient close to and perpendicular to the fault will be reduced as the flow direction changes and the component of flow directed towards the fault is reduced fig 1c the age gradient will also be high immediately downstream of the fault as the flow component directed away from the fault is similarly reduced if measured on a transect perpendicular to the fault the horizontal groundwater age gradient will increase sharply both before and after the fault fig 1d this increase in age gradient reflects the reduction in flow towards the fault and through it as flow is diverted around the fault the increase in age gradient will occur at all depths at the same rate as there is no vertical component of flow in this part of the aquifer and the increase in age can occur over distances of several kilometres marshall et al 2020 in contrast the increase in head gradient only occurs within the fault zone itself a situation similar to that of a finite fault can arise for an infinite fault if the fault permeability varies with fault length so that there are discrete windows where groundwater can flow through the fault the situation is somewhat different in unconfined aquifers with uniform recharge in these situations the fault will still present a barrier to groundwater flow and there will be a head decrease across the fault for an infinite fault the ratio of the head gradient across the fault to the head gradient in the aquifer immediately upstream of the fault will still be equal to the ratio between the aquifer and fault hydraulic conductivities fig 1e this neglects the perturbation to the age profile caused by the decrease in saturated aquifer thickness across the fault and hence assumes that the head drop is small relative to the saturated thickness as discussed above the vertical age profile in an aquifer receiving constant recharge reflects only the recharge rate porosity and aquifer thickness and does not change with distance along the flowline eq 1 the presence of the fault will not change the age distribution in the aquifer and so groundwater age measurements will not reveal the fault s presence for a finite fault the hydraulic gradient decreases across the fault although less than in the case of an infinite fault but the horizontal age gradient will still be close to zero fig 1h if it is not accompanied by a change in aquifer thickness then any fault offset will not greatly affect the age distributions discussed above groundwater flow is likely to be reduced in the parts of the aquifer that become juxtaposed against lower permeability layers see points marked with x in fig 2 the head profile will display increased vertical gradients near the fault but these should diminish with distance downstream if the offset is large then the older water in areas with less groundwater flow near the fault may impact the age profile further downstream and this might be seen as increased vertical stratification if the aquifer thickness changes downstream of the fault then the groundwater velocity will change which will cause a change in both head and age gradients downstream of the fault if a fault is parallel to the predominant direction of groundwater flow then for an aquifer of uniform thickness hydraulic conductivity and recharge there will be no cross fault flow and so the presence of the barrier will not affect either the head or groundwater age gradient however if aquifer conditions particularly hydraulic conductivity or recharge are not the same on either side of the fault then this may induce cross fault flow this will impact both hydraulic head and groundwater chemistry rajabpour and vaezihir 2017 since a transect of bores perpendicular to the fault should represent the component of groundwater flow in this direction i e across the fault a hydraulic head drop should be observed with the change in gradient across the fault proportional to the reduction in hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone as per fig 1a a change in groundwater age gradient across the fault may also occur due to differing groundwater velocities that may occur parallel to the fault on either side of the fault as per fig 1d if a fault is a conduit for vertical flow as well as a barrier then the head and age distributions will not be greatly changed from the barrier only case provided that the vertical flow rate is small relative to the horizontal flow rate across or around the fault if upward vertical along fault flow results in inflow of old water to shallow aquifers then groundwater age may display a step like increase at the fault with older water downgradient of the fault this is likely to be most apparent with tracers that are very sensitive to the presence of old water e g helium the horizontal age gradient further downgradient in the shallow aquifer should be similar to the upgradient age gradient assuming that the total inflow of groundwater at the fault is small relative to the overall flow rate several previous studies have observed tracer concentrations indicating old water at wells close to faults raiber et al 2015 batlle aguilar et al 2017 but we are not aware of any studies that have sampled in sufficient detail to detect changes in the age gradient across faults of course in complex multi aquifer systems the existence of conduit barrier faults can have more complex effects on hydraulic heads and groundwater ages this is particularly the case when vertical movement along a fault causes offsets to aquifer layers and juxtaposition of high and low permeability units some of these complexities were recently illustrated by bense and person 2006 and janos et al 2018 but are not discussed further here other geochemical data are unlikely to be affected by flow through a fault unless vertical or horizontal movement along the fault plane causes a change in geology from one side of the fault to the other or if geochemical changes are associated with the fault or fault filling materials ishikawa et al 2014 pereira et al 2010 changes in major and minor ions including electrical conductivity may occur if vertical flow along a fault causes inflow of water from other aquifers that have a different chemical composition however the absence of geochemical changes cannot rule out conduit behaviour particularly if the overlying and underlying aquifers have a similar geochemical composition groundwater age tracers are likely to be better indicators of vertical flow along faults than other geochemical tracers as groundwater ages will usually be different in overlying and underlying aquifers 3 site description 3 1 para fault adelaide plains the adelaide plains covers approximately 1100 km2 and is bounded by the gulf st vincent in the west the mount lofty ranges in the east the eden burnside fault in the south and the gawler river in the north and includes the metropolitan area of adelaide fig 3 it is part of the st vincent basin and consists of sub horizontal tertiary and quaternary sediments overlying fractured proterozoic rocks the geology defines a multilayered aquifer system the quaternary q sediments comprise a sequence of thin aquifers separated and semi confined by low permeability aquitards in the tertiary sediments sandstone and limestone four different aquifers t1 t2 t3 and t4 are distinguished the shallowest of these the t1 aquifer is underlain by the munno para clay aquitard and is the major productive aquifer the lowest of the tertiary aquifers t4 is underlain by the fractured bedrock aquifer the para fault pf is a major geological boundary and there is a greater thickness of sediments west of it up to 600 m than east of it less than 150 m batlle aguilar et al 2017 a gravity survey indicates that the para fault zone comprises one major fault with a maximum throw of 625 690 m with smaller nearly parallel faults on either side finlayson 1978 preiss 2019 the fault extends to and displaces the bedrock and has been active throughout most of the tertiary period but with the rate of movement decreasing through time the current conceptual model of the adelaide plains groundwater system is that groundwater is mainly recharged in the fractured rock aquifers of the mount lofty ranges and flows west across the eden burnside fault into the tertiary aquifers before finally discharging into gulf st vincent georgiou et al 2011 gerges 1999 rainfall is also believed to recharge the quaternary aquifer although vertical leakage into the tertiary aquifers is considered to be relatively small batlle aguilar et al 2017 groundwater extraction of approximately 7000 ml y 1 occurs for industrial use and managed aquifer recharge has occurred since the late 1990s an average of approximately 4500 ml y 1 has been injected into aquifers over the past 10 years of which approximately 3000 ml y 1 is extracted most of this extraction and injection is associated with the t1 aquifer which is the focus of this study the potentiometric surface indicates flow from the east and southeast towards the west and northwest fig 3 a large depression in the potentiometric surface near grange is due to groundwater extraction for industry in this area managed aquifer recharge injection contributes to the irregular shape of the 0 m ahd hydraulic head contour the adelaide plains has a mediterranean dry climate with mean annual rainfall of about 500 mm mean annual rainfall in parts of the mount lofty ranges exceeds 1000 mm the focus of this paper is an approximately flow parallel southeast northwest transect from the mt lofty ranges to gulf st vincent fig 3 the transect cuts through para fault and para fault west which are both part of the para fault system along the transect the thickness of the t1 aquifer increases from 70 to 80 m southeast of the para fault and between para fault and para fault west to 100 150 m northwest of para fault west 3 2 kanawinka fault otway basin the otway basin covers an area of approximately 100 000 km2 and contains in excess of 6000 m of marine and terrestrial sediments deposited during the cretaceous and tertiary periods love et al 1993 productive groundwater resources occur within the upper few hundred metres of this sedimentary sequence the unconfined aquifer system incorporates sediments of the padthaway bridgewater and coomandook formations and the gambier limestone oligocene to miocene with the latter being by far the largest unit fig 4 while the limestone is karstic in places groundwater flow is generally considered to occur as inter granular pore water flow love et al 1993 the gambier limestone is underlain by a 20 40 m thick aquitard this aquitard is composed of glauconitic and fossiliferous marls and clays of the narrawaturk marl and clay of the mepunga formation as well as laterally intermittent marls at the base of the gambier limestone and brown to black clay and lignite horizons at the top of the dilwyn formation the lower confined aquifer system occurs within underlying interlayered sand and clay layers of the dilwyn formation love et al 1993 amongst the most significant geomorphic features of the region are the stranded beach ridges of the bridgewater formation and the kanawinka escarpment the stranded beach and dune ridges parallel the current coastline and are believed to have formed during quaternary interglacial and insterstadial periods mclaren et al 2011 kanawinka escarpment also roughly parallels the current coastline it extends for over 600 km and may also represent a former coastline or sea cliff mclaren et al 2011 one of the more significant geological features is the kanawinka fault which trends northwest and extends for over 170 km the fault extends to crystalline basement west of bordertown 70 km north of naracoorte fig 4 and at naracoorte the top of the tertiary gambier limestone has been offset by about 40 m cook et al 1977 drik drik fault a segment of the kanawinka fault system in western victoria has an offset of about 70 m singleton et al 1976 movement on the kanawinka fault has occurred at least as recently as 2 2 1 7 million years ago cook et al 1977 regional groundwater flow is predominantly from east to west the hydraulic head gradient in the unconfined aquifer is approximately 2 10 3 in the eastern part of the basin and 7 10 4 further west fig 4 between these two areas regional maps show a head drop of around 20 m over a horizontal distance of around 5 km gradient 4 10 3 in an area roughly coincident with the mapped locations of both the kanawinka escarpment and the kanawinka fault both the escarpment and the head drop have often been attributed to the presence of the fault love et al 1993 mean annual rainfall ranges from 750 mm at millicent to 580 mm at naracoorte land use is dryland and irrigated agriculture and grazing the surface elevation and detailed stratigraphy along a 36 km long transect approximately perpendicular to kanawinka escarpment and kanawinka fault is depicted in fig 4 while the kanawinka fault is often considered to be coincident with the escarpment the available bore logs show an offset of the top of mepunga formation occurring between bores 7023 6909 and 7023 2925 which are between 4 and 11 km west of the escarpment respectively other offsets in the top of the mepunga formation both with coincident offsets of similar magnitude in the top of the underlying dilwyn formation occur further west between 7023 2925 and 7023 2905 and between 7023 0819 and 7023 3675 the total offset of the top of the mepunga formation observed along the transect is approximately 150 m 3 3 willunga fault willunga basin the willunga basin is located approximately 45 km south of adelaide and is a gently dipping wedge shaped basin of cainozoic sediments formed by reactivated palaeozoic faults during the eocene the geological development of the basin is similar to that of the adelaide plains to the north also being bounded by proterozoic rocks to the south and east and gulf st vincent to the west preiss 2019 willunga basin covers an area of approximately 250 km2 and the willunga fault forms the eastern and southern boundary of the basin fig 5 the basin contains three main aquifer systems the port willunga formation aquifer pwf the maslin sands aquifer ms and a fractured basement rock aquifer fra fig 5 the port willunga formation is a calcareous sandy and silty limestone and calcareous sandstone while the maslin sands is a fluvial to marginal marine siliceous sand groundwater in both sedimentary aquifers flows from the northeast to the southwest roughly parallel to fault the mean hydraulic conductivity of the pwf is approximately 1 m d 1 for the ms the mean hydraulic conductivity is approximately 0 5 m d 1 although all pumping tests were conducted on bores in the northern part of the aquifer and may not be representative of the entire aquifer system aldam 1990 the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured rock aquifer has been estimated at 0 1 m d 1 martin et al 2006 although it is likely to be highly variable as flow would be controlled by fractures land use is mostly irrigated agriculture mostly vineyards with some grazing of sheep and cattle mean annual rainfall is approximately 600 mm three transects of bores were drilled across willunga fault with bore screens completed in the fra east of the fault and in the sedimentary aquifers west of the fault all transects are oriented approximately southeast to northwest the central transect is located approximately 7 km south of the northern transect and 3 km north of the southern transect on the southern transect bores west of the fault were only installed in the pwf on the northern transect the pwf is dry fig 6 4 methods groundwater investigations at all three sites have been ongoing for many years and these have included monitoring of groundwater levels and water chemistry as well as some geochemical sampling of groundwater age indicators more recently interest in the roles of the faults has led to targeted drilling and sampling along both kanawinka and willunga faults along the para fault transect geochemical sampling relies only on existing government and private bores and was carried out in january 1992 wells ade025 ade040 ade062 ade130 ade149 as part of regional investigations of the adelaide aquifer gerges 1999 with more targeted investigations in november december 2013 ade005 ade187 ade207 25759 batlle aguilar et al 2017 and december 2020 27008 along kanawinka fault groundwater samples were collected during november 2012 7023 5280 7135 7133 7259 7134 turnadge et al 2013 and july 2020 7023 6798 6794 7075 groundwater samples across the willunga fault were collected in april may 2013 with regional samples from the willunga basin mostly collected between september 2012 and april 2013 as rainfall is low 500 650 mm y 1 rates of groundwater recharge are also low and so groundwater at the three sites presented in this paper is mostly several thousand years old 14c is therefore the preferred approach for determination of groundwater age previous regional scale studies at these sites have also measured cfc 12 3h and or helium on some bores gerges 1999 turnadge et al 2013 battle aguilar et al 2017 but as 14c is the only age indicator available at all three sites and the other tracers are only available and above background on a small number of bores only 14c data are presented in this paper at least three bore volumes were purged prior to sampling except for private bores that had recently been pumped for irrigation water supply samples were collected for 14c and 13c 12c analyses on total dissolved inorganic carbon tdic with most bores also sampled for major ion analysis and electrical conductivity measurement in some cases bores were not sampled for major ions at the time of isotope sample collection and chloride concentration data are obtained from the government database https www waterconnect sa gov au systems gd pages default aspx samples obtained between 2008 and 2010 for all samples 14c analysis was by ams and 13c 12c analysis was by irms laboratory details are not available for 1992 samples gerges 1999 but more recent analyses were carried out by rafter radiocarbon new zealand except the samples collected along kanawinka fault in 2012 which were analysed for 13c 12c at csiro and for 14c at anu errors are not available for 1992 samples but for all others are between 0 15 and 0 2 for δ13c and between 0 1 and 0 3 pmc for 14c apparent 14c ages have been calculated after first correcting 14c activities based on the measured δ13c ratio and assumed 13c values and 14c activities of soil co2 and carbonate minerals 3 a corr a tdic δ r δ m δ tdic δ m where atdic and δtdic are the measured 14c activity and δ13c value on tdic and δr and δm are the assumed initial δ13c ratios in groundwater recharge and carbonate in the aquifer matrix respectively clark and fritz 1997 this equation assumes that the aquifer matrix contains negligible 14c while groundwater extraction causes significant small scale variability in hydraulic head for all aquifers the volumes of water extracted are small relative to the storage volume and so it is reasonable to assume that this has not significantly impacted groundwater ages rather groundwater ages should reflect the flow pattern that existed prior to european settlement when the sites were covered with native vegetation managed aquifer recharge injection in the adelaide plains would impact groundwater ages if injected water was sampled and so these areas have been deliberately avoided to minimise the impacts of groundwater extraction on measured head gradients hydraulic head data are only presented for bores where temporal changes in head are small relative to spatial differences or where data are available for periods before groundwater extraction for the adelaide plains transect hydraulic head data are presented for september which is after the end of winter and usually coincides with the maximum annual water level where possible the most recent data are used although where significant decreases in water level over time are observed data are presented for the time before water levels began to decline for this reason and because water level measurements are not regularly carried out on private bores measurements span a period from the mid 1980s for the otway basin transect hydraulic head measurements are shown for 2008 2009 when data was available for most bores exceptions are bores 7023 485 and 7023 487 1975 and 7023 5280 1996 however bores that have been monitored regularly for more than 12 years show less than 4 m variation over that period which is much less than the variation along the transect and so variation in time of measurement is not considered significant all hydraulic head data presented for the willunga basin was measured in april to may 2013 5 results 5 1 para fault adelaide plains while groundwater flow in the adelaide plains t1 aquifer is generally from southeast to northwest parallel with the transect there is significant small scale spatial variability in hydraulic head due to proximity to sites of groundwater extraction seasonal fluctuations in water levels can also be more than 5 m with highest water levels typically observed in september each year an approximate potentiometric surface is therefore determined using only the highest hydraulic heads measured along the transect fig 7 a the slope of this potentiometric surface decreases from southeast to northwest the predominant direction of regional flow the head gradient east of para fault is approximately 0 003 and west of para fault west it is less than 0 0005 this decrease in gradient is likely to be in part due to the increase in thickness of the t1 aquifer there is no indication of sharp changes in hydraulic head across either fault but wells are not closely spaced and several may be impacted by groundwater extraction carbon 14 activity generally decreases from southeast to northwest along the transect fig 7b δ13c also becomes less depleted to the northwest and 14c and δ13c are correlated fig 8 δ13c values range between 11 5 and 6 6 with 14c values between 1 3 and 36 8 pmc samples with low 14c activities are generally more enriched in δ13c suggesting that the decrease of 14c activity by radioactive decay is enhanced by dissolution of marine carbonate minerals pearson and hanshaw 1970 batlle aguilar et al 2017 reported δ13c values in groundwater samples from across the adelaide plains ranging between 15 2 and 2 8 with uncorrected 14c activities between 0 4 and 91 pmc these authors corrected 14c activities for dissolution of marine carbonate based on the δ13c value of each sample they assumed an initial δ13c value in recharge of 11 3 which was the mean value measured in groundwater in the quaternary aquifer and the fractured rock aquifers in the mount lofty ranges which are the potential recharge sources for the t1 aquifer marine carbonate was assumed to contain negligible 14c eq 3 and have a δ13c value of 0 applying this same correction corrected 14c activities for bores shown in table 1 range between 2 3 and 41 pmc with apparent groundwater ages between 7300 and 31 500 years fig 7c the age gradient along the transect is relatively constant east of para fault west albeit with significant scatter with a mean gradient of approximately 1 y m 1 fig 7c some of the scatter in the age data may be due to differences in screen depths of sampled bores along the transect based on a recharge rate of r 1 mm y 1 aquifer thickness of h 100 m porosity ε 0 2 and sampling depth of z 20 m the vertical age gradient obtained through differentiating eq 2 is estimated to be dt dz 250 y m 1 thus a 10 m variation in sampling depth would result in an age variation of approximately 2500 years this is of the same order as the variation apparent along the transect based on a hydraulic conductivity of 0 2 m d 1 and porosity of 0 2 the mean gradient of 1 y m 1 is consistent with the observed hydraulic gradient the apparent increase in age gradient west of para fault west is only defined by a single 14c value but is consistent with the reduction in hydraulic gradient in this area however it is greater than can be explained by the increase in aquifer thickness and may reflect a reduction in flow rate due to upward leakage to overlying aquifers in this part of the basin the lack of a step change in hydraulic head at the location of either the pf or pfw together with the lack of a clear age discontinuity suggests that the fault is not a significant barrier to flow however the relatively large bore spacing along the transect and the effects of groundwater pumping complicate interpretation chloride and electrical conductivity data also do not show any trend across the fault or chemical anomalies in the vicinity of the fault table 1 batlle aguilar et al 2017 observed anomalously high chloride and helium concentrations in the fractured rock aquifer close to the para fault but north of the transect shown in figs 3 and 7 while this might be due to upward flow along the fault as speculated by batlle aguilar et al 2017 no such anomalies were observed either in the t1 or the underlying t2 aquifer our data and that of batlle aguilar et al 2017 therefore present little evidence of either barrier or conduit behaviour of this fault for the t1 aquifer 5 2 kanawinka fault otway basin the change in surface elevation across the kanawinka escarpment at the transect location is approximately 70 m with most of this change occurring over a horizontal distance of about 5 km fig 9 a the change in hydraulic head is approximately 60 m and this occurs over 5 10 km the maximum observed head gradient is about 10 2 and approximately coincides with the location of greatest topographic gradient while the bore spacing in this area is almost 1 km data appear to describe a smooth head change that contrasts strongly with the step like change shown in fig 1a infinite barrier conceptual model the observed data are therefore not consistent with the presence of a thin low permeability fault core and more consistent with a very wide 5 km zone of reduced hydraulic conductivity the head gradient is approximately one order of magnitude greater than the regional gradient suggesting that the hydraulic conductivity might only be one order of magnitude less however if the reduction in hydraulic conductivity induces some water to flow around the barrier then the head drop across the barrier will be less than the reduction in permeability and so the hydraulic conductivity of the barrier could be more than one order of magnitude less than that of the aquifer there is no trend in either electrical conductivity or chloride with distance along the transect table 2 carbon 14 activity decreases from the northeast to the southwest fig 9b excluding 7023 5280 the most westerly bore 14c and δ13c are correlated table 2 samples with low 14c activities are more enriched in δ13c suggesting dissolution of marine carbonate minerals following love et al 1993 14c ages have been determined after first correcting for dissolution of marine carbonate based on measured δ13c values of tdic and assuming an initial δ13c value in recharge of 14 eq 3 apparent 14c ages increase with distance along the transect fig 9c where the head gradient is steepest and immediately downgradient of this point the horizontal age gradient is approximately 0 8 y m 1 bore 7023 7075 at 20 km distance falls below this trend line but the top of its screen is shallower than that of the other bores in this part of the aquifer fig 4 between 18 and 13 km the age gradient increases to approximately 1 7 y m 1 although this is only based on one bore this bore 7023 5280 which is the most downgradient samples the lower part of the aquifer which may explain the apparently increased horizontal gradient however studies in other parts of the basin estimated the groundwater velocity in the gambier unconfined aquifer from darcy s law to be typically between 5 and 50 m y 1 love et al 1993 the apparent groundwater velocity at the transect location is therefore unlikely to reflect the regional groundwater velocity numerical modelling has found that diversion of flow around barriers of finite length can cause increased groundwater age gradients across barriers and that the zone of increased age gradient can be several kilometres in width even though the barriers may be very narrow marshall et al 2020 fig 1d the large increase in groundwater age observed across kanawinka fault is therefore consistent with water being diverted around a low permeability zone coincident with the escarpment however whether the reduction in permeability reflects the presence of a fault or a reduction in permeability associated with erosion and reworking of marine and terrestrial sediments by wave action is unclear the head gradient is less abrupt than would be expected for a single fault contrast fig 6 with fig 1c while a series of closely spaced faults cannot be ruled out stratigraphic mapping does not show significant displacement of layers in this part of the aquifer it is therefore possible that the observed hydraulic head and age gradients both reflect the decrease in hydraulic conductivity of the embankment sediments and are not directly associated with the fault further north love et al 1993 identified an increase in 14c activity and hence groundwater age in the confined aquifer downgradient of kanawinka fault that may be due to downward leakage from the unconfined aquifer associated with the fault however there are no data from the confined aquifer along the transect examined in the current study 5 3 willunga fault willunga basin three transects of bores were drilled across willunga fault with bore screens completed in the fra east of the fault and in the pwf and ms west of the fault except on the southern transect where bores were only completed in the pwf the spacing of bores along these transects is much closer than at either the para fault or kanawinka fault sites at the northern transect bore 16b screened at 90 m ahd in the pwf west of the fault is dry whereas the water table on the east of the fault in the fractured rock aquifer is approximately 173 m ahd bores 11a 11d indicating a head drop in excess of 80 m over a distance of approximately 60 m fig 6a and 10a the head drop between the fra and the ms bore 16a is 62 m over the same distance in the central transect the head drop across the fault and between the fra and the pwf is 88 m over approximately 37 m and the head drop between the fra and the ms is 63 m over 33 m fig 6b at the southern transect the head drop across the fault between the fra and the pwf is 60 m over 90 m fig 6c at these three transects the head gradient across the fault between the fra and pwf thus ranges between 0 7 and 2 4 and between the fra and ms it ranges between 1 0 and 1 9 the gradient across the fault itself may be even higher than these values because bores may not be located immediately either side of the fault along the northern transect chloride concentration decreases from 283 454 mg l 1 in the fra to the east of the fault to 159 165 mg l 1 in the ms to the west carbon 14 activity decrease from 56 to 69 pmc in the fra to 24 3 pmc in well 13a in the ms fig 10 only a single data point is available for the fra on the central transect 45 pmc and this overlaps with the pwf 40 64 pmc but is distinct from the ms 2 pmc there is significant overlap in activities across the fault on the southern transect 45 75 pmc in fra and 38 59 pmc in pwf across all three transects observed 14c activities are between 38 and 64 pmc in the pwf 2 24 pmc in the ms and 45 76 pmc in the fra apart from one outlier 14c is linearly correlated with δ13c r2 0 78 with δ13c becoming less negative at lower 14c activities table 3 this indicates that lower 14c activities are due to geochemical interactions with aquifer materials as well as radioactive decay since along fault flow in the sedimentary aquifers is likely to greatly exceed cross fault flow it is instructive to examine changes in 14c and chloride parallel to the fault in the ms and pwf relative to values observed in the fra east of the fault fig 11 there is no noticeable trend in 14c activities with distance along the fault in the fra fig 11b d which is consistent with this aquifer being dominated by local recharge rather than regional flow 14c activities in the fra are higher than those in the ms fig 11b 14c activities in the ms aquifer decrease from the north to the south the predominant direction of flow until 10 000 m distance samples from bores located close to the fault fig 6 follow the same trend as those further from the fault locations shown in fig 5 compare red open and closed circles in fig 11 which is contrary to what would be expected if there were high rates of flow across the fault into the ms the increase in 14c activity in the ms more than 200 m from the fault after 12000 m along fault distance fig 11b is believed to be due to leakage from the overlying pwf in this part of the system herczeg and leaney 2002 no data from the ms is available for within 200 m of the fault after 12000 m chloride concentrations in the fra east of the fault increase in the direction of inferred groundwater flow concentrations upgradient of 3400 m are less than 500 mg l 1 whereas at 13300 m concentrations range between 520 and 3100 mg l 1 the chloride concentration in the ms aquifer increases with distance between 3400 and 10200 m and this could be due to leakage across the fault from the fra which has higher chloride concentrations in the pwf 14c activities in the fractured rock and sedimentary aquifer are not sufficiently distinct to use 14c as a tracer of cross fault leakage however chloride concentrations in the pwf decrease between 10 200 and 13 300 m even though activities in the fra are generally greater than those in the sedimentary aquifer this suggests that there cannot be significant cross fault leakage at this location to constrain possible flow rates across the fault we used a simple analytical model of 1d fault parallel flow in the sedimentary aquifers with vertical input from groundwater recharge in the unconfined pwf and lateral groundwater input from cross fault flow from the fra for both ms and pwf the change in concentration with distance in the sedimentary aquifers adjacent to the fault can be expressed 4 q c x r h c r c q f w c f c λ θ c where c is concentration q is the flow rate parallel to the fault m y qf is the flow across the fault into the sedimentary aquifer m y 1 and cf is the concentration of cross fault flow r is the recharge rate m y 1 zero in the case of the confined maslins sand aquifer cr is the concentration of recharge h is the aquifer thickness m λ is the decay coefficient 1 21 10 4 y 1 for 14c and zero for chloride θ is porosity x is distance in the direction of flow i e parallel to the fault m and w m is the assumed width of the flowline where flow from the fault mixes with flow in the sedimentary aquifer if we assume values for q h r cr and cf then we can estimate qf w from changes in concentration c with distance x to apply equation 4 to 14c activities however we need to consider possible differences in tdic concentrations between the fra and sedimentary aquifers mean alkalinity concentrations for bores presented in this paper are 6 1 7 0 and 8 2 meq l 1 for the pwf fra and ms respectively these differences are not considered significant and so correction is not considered necessary for the ms the decrease in 14c activity that is observed in all bores within 4 km of the fault puts an upper limit on the groundwater velocity in this aquifer parallel to the fault of approximately 0 3 m y 1 and hence an upper limit on q of approximately 0 1 m y 1 fig 12 a based on the potentiometric gradient parallel to the fault of approximately 0 005 dfw 2012 this suggests a hydraulic conductivity for the ms aquifer of less than 0 05 m d 1 significantly lower than measured in the upper parts of the basin between 3300 and 10200 m the 14c activity of groundwater in the fra east of the fault is much greater than in the sedimentary aquifer and averages approximately 60 pmc based on the flow rate of q 0 1 m y 1 θ 0 3 and cf 60 pmc a flow across the fault of only qf w 5 10 6 y 1 would result in a 14c activity of 8 4 pmc at 10200 m more than 3 5 times greater than the observed value giving an upper limit on cross fault flow at this location the mean chloride concentration in the ms increases from 159 to 165 mg l 1 at 3300 m to 973 mg l 1 at 10200 m the mean chloride concentration in the fractured rock aquifer increases from 364 mg l 1 to 437 mg l 1 over the same distance but then subsequently increases to 1720 mg l 1 at 13300 m the increase in chloride concentration in the ms between 3300 m and 10200 m can therefore only be explained by flow across the fault if the chloride concentration east of the fault is higher than measured in this part of the system if we use cf 1500 mg l 1 then the observed concentration of 973 mg l 1 at 10200 m is reproduced with qf w 1 4 10 5 y 1 however the chloride concentration in the ms at this location is defined by only a single measurement and the concentration in the fra is extremely variable so the estimated flow rate across the fault is highly uncertain in the pwf chloride concentrations decrease with distance despite the higher concentration in the fra the mean chloride concentration in the pwf is 745 mg l 1 at 10200 m and 560 mg l 1 at 13300 m whereas the mean concentration in the fra between 10 200 and 13 000 m is approximately 1370 mg l 1 this allows estimation of a maximum flow rate across the fault as any flow should have resulted in an increase in concentration rather than a decrease assuming a groundwater flow rate parallel to the fault of q 2 m y 1 based on a mean hydraulic conductivity of 1 m d 1 and hydraulic gradient of approximately 0 005 cf 1370 mg l 1 and r 0 a flux of qf w 1 8 10 4 y 1 results in a chloride concentration in the pwf at 13300 m that is 25 more than the maximum observed value fig 12c since recharge would decrease the chloride concentration including r 0 05 m y 1 herczeg and leaney 2002 h 100 m and cr 100 mg l 1 results in a higher flow rate of qf w 9 10 4 y 1 this value is relatively insensitive to the assumed flow rate in the pwf q and the chloride concentration of groundwater recharge cr but is sensitive to the assumed recharge rate nevertheless doubling the recharge rate to r 0 10 m y 1 would only require an increase in the cross fault flow rate to approximately qf w 1 7 10 3 y 1 to estimate qf we need to first estimate w since the flow rates across the fault are low dispersion rather than advective flow will dominate the mixing process the transverse dispersivity at scales of 1 10 km is estimated from gelhar et al 1992 to be approximately αt 5 m the mixing width w can then be estimated as the scale length for dispersive mixing perpendicular to the fault using 5 w 4 d t t 4 α t v x v 4 α t x where dt is the transverse dispersion coefficient t is travel time and v is the groundwater velocity and x is travel distance both in the direction of flow thus for the ms the distance along the fault parallel transect of x 7 km gives w 375 m for the pwf x 3 km and therefore w 250 m thus the maximum flow rate across the fault into the ms is 0 002 m y 1 5 10 6 y 1 375 m and for the pwf it is 0 45 m y 1 1 8 10 3 y 1 250 m of course there are uncertainties with many of the model parameters and so these results are probably only accurate to within an order of magnitude since analysis of geochemical data allows estimation of maximum rates of flow across the fault and head data provides minimum values for the head gradient across the fault we can calculate maximum values for the hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone we use the head gradients for the central transect as the proximity of the bores to the fault at this site provide the best estimates of the head gradient across the fault the flow rate across the fault into the ms is estimated to be less than 0 002 m y 1 giving a maximum hydraulic conductivity for the fault of 10 3 m y 1 3 10 6 m d 1 for the pwf the flow rate is estimated to be less than 0 45 m y 1 giving a maximum hydraulic conductivity of 0 18 m y 1 5 10 4 m d 1 these values are approximately 4 5 orders of magnitude lower than the estimated hydraulic conductivities of the sedimentary aquifers and 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the fractured rock aquifer 6 discussion a recent review of fault hydrology found that faults were assessed as conduits for groundwater flow at 70 of sites that were investigated and as barriers at 50 of sites scibek et al 2016 at 20 of sites faults exhibited both barrier and conduit behaviour however determining the hydrogeological role of faults is complicated by the biases of different investigation techniques for example hydraulic head data are best suited for identifying the barrier behaviour of faults while studies of inflow to tunnels are best suited for determining conduit behaviour scibek et al 2016 while previous studies using temperature and water chemistry including chemical indicators of groundwater age have mostly been used to infer conduit behaviour e g bense et al 2008 gumm et al 2016 marshall et al 2020 recently illustrated the potential for groundwater age to be used to determine barrier behaviour thus groundwater age can potentially illustrate both barrier and conduit behaviour this paper presents simple conceptual models of hydraulic head and groundwater age perpendicular to and across faults in terms of the resistance to flow across a fault the resistance to flow around the fault and the recharge regime contrasting hydraulic head and groundwater age profiles occur for infinite and finite faults because the latter permit groundwater to flow around the fault rather than through it although the models refer to flow around a finite fault zones of higher fault core permeability within a longer fault could generate the same effect as groundwater may travel laterally along the fault possibly assisted by high along fault permeability within a damage zone caine et al 1996 until a zone of higher fault core permeability is encountered the spatial variability of fault core properties has been widely reported e g de rosa et al 2018 step changes in hydraulic heads occur across both finite and infinite faults and in both upgradient and constant recharge regimes in contrast for upgradient recharge the groundwater age will increase linearly with horizontal distance and this trend will not be perturbed by the presence of an infinite fault that is perpendicular to the flow direction for finite faults with upgradient recharge the horizontal age gradient will increase in the vicinity of the fault this should be able to be detected in transects of bores for constant recharge groundwater age will be less diagnostic layer offsets cause only small perturbation to head and age profiles although changes in aquifer thickness may cause differences between upgradient and downgradient head and age gradients hydraulic head groundwater age chloride concentration and electrical conductivity data are presented across three fault systems to explore the different conceptual models and to examine the utility of these types of measurements for determining fault barrier conduit behaviour while other data can be used to provide information on the hydrological role of faults the purpose of the paper is to illustrate how groundwater age can supplement hydraulic head data in assessing the role of faults rather than to provide a comprehensive analysis of fault behaviour at each site the latter would require a much more comprehensive study potentially involving geophysical surveys saribudak and hawkins 2019 pumping tests adjacent to the fault zone gannon et al 2012 and coring through the fault system itself carpenter et al 2014 to our knowledge groundwater age data collected from multiple wells arranged in short transects across fault systems has not previously been reported at para fault adelaide plains horizontal spacing of bores sampled for 14c averages approximately 1 km variation in bore depth and the difficulty in obtaining bores along a groundwater flow line contributes to relatively wide scatter in the 14c activities and apparent 14c ages nevertheless there is no evidence of an increased horizontal age gradient in the fault zones and no obvious perturbations to the head profile this may suggest that the fault does not present a barrier to cross fault flow in the t1 aquifer there is also no evidence for the presence of old water from deeper layers in the t1 aquifer either in 14c or chloride data suggesting that the fault may not be a significant conduit for vertical flow an earlier study did observe anomalously high chloride and helium concentrations close to the para fault in the deeper fractured rock aquifer approximately 7 km further north batlle aguilar et al 2017 however such anomalies were not observed in the t1 or in the underlying t2 aquifer at the kanawinka fault otway basin horizontal spacing of bores sampled for 14c averages approximately 2 km a steepening of the head gradient is apparent at the location of the kanawinka escarpment but stratigraphic data suggests that the major faulting is located further west however despite a steepening of the gradient there is no sharp head drop such as might be expected across a low permeability fault the horizontal groundwater age gradient in the vicinity of the fault is relatively smooth but much greater than the regional gradient observed elsewhere this might be consistent with a local barrier to flow that is not laterally continuous however the precise location of the fault is uncertain and so it is also uncertain whether the flow barrier represents the fault or a reduction in hydraulic conductivity due to depositional and erosional processes related to development of the kanawinka escarpment chemistry data collected at the site does not show evidence of upward flow from deeper layers although an earlier study 40 km further north identified an increase in 14c activity and hence decrease in groundwater age in the confined aquifer downgradient of the fault that may be due to downward leakage from the unconfined aquifer associated with the fault willunga fault in the willunga basin represents a different geological setting to both para fault and kanawinka fault willunga fault forms the boundary between the sedimentary sequence and fractured rock basement a very large head gradient is observed over a short horizontal distance confirming that the fault represents a low permeability zone changes in groundwater age chloride and electrical conductivity are also observed across the fault since flow in the sedimentary aquifers mostly occurs parallel to the fault changes in water chemistry parallel to the fault in the sedimentary aquifers were used to quantify the rate of cross fault flow thus while the fault is a barrier to flow groundwater can move across it the hydraulic conductivity of the fault core was estimated to be 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than the hydraulic conductivity of the adjacent aquifers based on the rate of cross fault flow and hydraulic gradient this is consistent with estimates of the reduction in fault core permeability at other sites e g evans et al 1997 interpretation of the hydrogeological role of faults from groundwater age data may require a greater data density than is generally available from existing groundwater monitoring networks in the current study specific transects of bores perpendicular to faults were installed at two of the three sites kanawinka fault and willunga fault at para fault existing bores were used and it is possible that the lack of more detailed information at this site has partly contributed to the conclusion that the fault does not act as a hydrogeological barrier data density is important across many areas of hydrogeology and the requirement for high data density increases as aquifer heterogeneity increases miller et al 2016 variation in bore depth along a transect is also likely to be an issue for the use of groundwater age data ideally bores at different depths would allow both vertical and horizontal age gradients to be determined since variations with depth are likely to be more pronounced for groundwater age than for hydraulic head high data density is likely to be more important for groundwater age data however identifying conduit behaviour of faults from groundwater chemistry data may be possible but perhaps not definitive with a much lower data density thus a single measurement in a shallow aquifer of a definitive chemical signature from a deeper aquifer may indicate vertical conduit flow associated with a fault e g gardner et al 2012 gumm et al 2016 but the lack of such an observation does not indicate the lack of conduit flow thus conduit behaviour cannot be ruled out at any of the faults investigated in the present study 7 conclusions measurement of groundwater age along transects of bores perpendicular to and across faults can provide information on both conduit and barrier behaviour of fault zones this paper presents hydraulic head 14c chloride and electrical conductivity in groundwater across three contrasting faults large head and age gradients are apparent at two of the three sites but at one of these sites the gradients may not be coincident with the fault location and may be due to other processes at one site where regional flow is mostly parallel to the fault 14c age and chloride data are used to estimate the rate of cross fault flow the third fault may not be a barrier to cross fault flow as there is no clear increase in either head or age gradient although our data does not indicate conduit behaviour such behaviour has been suggested based on groundwater chemistry at other locations on two of these

3339,the increases in extreme drought events and channel alteration challenge the existing reservoir operation rules therefore reservoir operation should be reconsidered to accommodate these challenges a conflict resolution model for reservoir operation considering the decision makers preference is developed for the conflict between hydropower generation and navigation in dry seasons under channel alteration to achieve the goal of meeting minimum environmental flow landslide stability and river lake connection constraints this model with a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is applied to the three gorges reservoir tgr on the yangtze river the results show that minimum navigation discharge for the post dam period is greater than that for the pre dam period indicating channel alteration both average hydropower generation benefit and navigation reliability decrease with modification of the post dam minimum navigation discharge signifying the adverse effect of damming the total benefits of navigation and hydropower generation decrease with the exceedance probability a higher hydropower generation benefit leads to a smaller navigation benefit reflecting the conflict of interest this study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed conflict resolution model as well as the navigation benefit quantifying method and applicability to similar water resources management problems keywords reservoir operation conflict resolution model drought stress channel alteration nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii decision maker preferences 1 introduction reservoir operation often affects the river environment changes the sediment transport and deposition characteristics and further alters downstream channel morphology chen et al 2015 legleiter 2015 as a result the stage discharge curve of the downstream channel was changed reflecting the channel alteration zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 sun et al 2019 which affected the safe navigation of ships shang et al 2017 for a relatively new reservoir such as three gorges reservoir tgr updating the post dam minimum navigation discharge in the reservoir operation would be necessary for future navigation and hydropower generation recently sun et al 2019 found that after the 10 year post dam period from the closure of the three gorges dam in 2003 channel erosion and sedimentation reached a relatively balanced condition in 2012 this balancing process altered the channel morphological condition after the post dam downstream channel alteration it was found that the minimum navigation discharge could be determined by this relatively stabilized stage discharge relationship furthermore the navigation benefits based on the pre dam and post dam minimum navigation discharge could be evaluated navigation is an essential objective of the three gorges dam operations li et al 2021 and the damage of navigation security would pose a growing threat to economic benefits the total freight volume transported through the tgr exceeded the designed capacity of the three gorges dam in 2011 and was 19 years sooner than expected li et al 2021 according to changjiang times 2014 the tgr reached its navigation bottleneck in 2014 the reported freight volume through the ship lock of the three gorges dam in 2018 was 142 million tons wu 2019 which already exceeded the 2020 freight volume forecasted by li et al 2021 this rapidly growing freight volume suggested a high demand to increase the navigation reliability by maintaining minimum navigation discharge of the tgr the decline of navigation reliability would induce considerable pressure on the tgr operations and affect the navigation benefits especially on cargo transportation furthermore if the ships have to wait at the upstream of the tgr the emissions of greenhouse gases and the economic loss of highly time sensitive cargo such as fresh fruit would be large sun 2013 these adverse effects of navigation security damage pose high risks to people s living and earnings however if the reservoir outflow needs to continuously fulfill the minimum navigation discharge with low inflow the reservoir will be unable to maintain a high upstream water level decreasing the hydropower generation this operation characteristic suggests a tradeoff between hydropower generation and navigation benefits in addition to such increasing concerns of navigation reliability the tgr is also a typical example facing extreme drought impacts huang et al 2021 suggested that the higher air temperature and less precipitation will occur in the upper reaches of the yangtze river from 2020 to 2050 which will eventually reduce the annual runoff by 4 5 if these drought events occur in the future they will unavoidably impact the streamflow of the tgr such drought events reduce the total water supply and the reliability of meeting the downstream water demands chai et al 2019 yu et al 2019a dai et al 2008 indicated that the reduction in tgr downstream runoff in 2006 was mainly attributed to the extreme drought of the yangtze river specifically in a dry year the total inflow of the tgr would be lower than that in normal years and insufficient for satisfying the downstream safe navigation requirement this low inflow condition can result in lower navigation benefit especially in the dry season however limited effort has been made to address the impact of the increased hydrologic drought and downstream channel alteration on the tgr s navigation benefits especially using quantitative evaluation approaches sun 2013 applied a partial greenhouse gas emission cost benefit analysis to quantitatively describe the navigation benefit using equivalent greenhouse gas emission in a normal flow condition li et al 2021 evaluated the navigation benefit of the tgr by freight volume under current climate this study aims to fill this gap by developing a conflict resolution model based on simulated dry season inflow with different exceedance probabilities of low inflow in addition to mitigating the tgr outflow to satisfy safe navigation requirement and maximize the benefits as a multipurpose reservoir the tgr also needs to accomplish ecological environmental and socio economic objectives for instance jiang et al 2020 developed a model to deal with some major purposes of the tgr including sediment flashing fish habitats landslide safety flood releasing and hydropower generation xu et al 2019 estimated a minimum environmental discharge of the tgr for key species of the yangtze river wang et al 2013 examined ecological targets of the tgr such as maintaining river lake connection and enhancing fish spawning most multi purpose reservoir operations require a tradeoff process to reach a balance between these objectives fu et al 2014 giuliani et al 2016 salazar et al 2017 some modeling studies have been conducted to provide conflict resolutions for hydropower water supply environmental flow and other water related activities fu et al 2013 fu et al 2014 hess and fenrich 2017 ren et al 2019 raso et al 2020 recently the game theoretic model has been widely utilized to find the compromising points in the tradeoff process of multi objective optimization by defining the payoffs and the behavior of the players and arriving at a single solution lee 2012 alizadeh et al 2017 shapira et al 2019 shapira et al 2019 developed a new conflict resolution model which considered the decision maker s preferences and provided a set of more efficient conflict resolutions to avoid unrealistic assumptions for a watershed management problem this conflict resolution model is applied to the tgr in this study after achieving some objectives of the tgr as prerequisite constraints the policy choices among alternatives of hydropower generation and navigation benefits would depend on the value judgment of the decision maker in our case the river manager for example the river manager might value the navigation more than hydropower generation because some indirect benefits such as increasing regional economics positively relate to navigation reliability or the river manager might be more willing to maintain the hydropower generation output at a high level since these preferences are important to decision making in hydropower generation navigation conflicts we develop a conflict resolution model to account for the decision maker s preferences and provide the corresponding benefits for data references in the future the channel alteration due to the reservoir operation the anticipated decrease in navigation reliability and the hydrological drought stress on the yangtze river in the coming future require changes in the tgr operation thus it is essential to develop a conflict resolution model to help identify effective conflict resolutions for navigation security accommodation of channel alteration and drought stress and some other objectives of the tgr this study aims 1 to estimate the minimum navigation discharge before and after the operation of the tgr by the revised stage discharge relationships 2 to develop a multi objective model for joint analysis of hydropower generation and navigation benefits considering multiple purposes of the tgr pre dam and post dam minimum navigation discharge requirements and dry season inflows of different exceedance probabilities and 3 to estimate the hydropower generation and navigation benefit considering the decision maker s preferences for quantifying efficient conflict resolutions and comparing the hydropower generation benefits under pre dam and post dam minimum navigation discharge conditions and under different scales of drought stress 2 study area and data 2 1 descriptions of the study area the tgr is located on the yangtze river fig 1 in the subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average annual precipitation of 1 000 1 300 mm hu et al 2014 this run of the river reservoir system has been in operation since 1981 li et al 2011 yu et al 2013 the three gorges dam has a crest elevation of 185 m with a normal pool level of 175 m huang et al 2015 in the tgr operation the water level ranges from 145 m dead water level to 175 m with a utilizable storage capacity of 19 3 billion m3 the reservoir operations need to satisfy the needs for flood control hydropower generation navigation shoreline stability environmental flow ecological flow and some other purposes the gezhouba dam is located 38 km downstream of the tgr along the main channel of the yangtze river fig 1 the yichang station located approximately 6 km downstream of the gezhouba dam or 44 km downstream of the tgr fig 1 is the outflow control station for the tgr s operation the minimum navigation discharge is a baseflow level to be met throughout the year for navigation at the downstream of the dam and is assumed to be a top priority over hydropower generation for the tgr operation from october to the end of march the yangtze river enters its dry season when the water level decreases the low water levels in the dry season could result in navigation suspension and considerable economic losses the minimum discharge for navigation now being used satisfies a water elevation of 39 m above sea level at the ship lock fig 1 immediately downstream of the gezhouba dam since the distance between the ship lock and the yichang station is approximately 2 km fig 1 the natural water loss is assumed negligible within this short distance and the minimum water stage for navigation at the yichang station can be reasonably assumed to be the same as the required navigation elevation threshold of 39 m 2 2 data the ten day duration streamflow data at the yichang hydrological station fig 1 from 1881 to 2008 and the daily streamflow data from 2009 to 2011 were obtained from the yichang hydrology bureau this ten day duration period is the traditional time frame in chinese agricultural society dividing a month into three periods and use 1st 11th and 21st as the starting date of each period these datasets were used for the flow duration curve analysis in this study to determine the exceedance probability of inflow yu and yang 2000 yu et al 2019b the daily stage discharge data at yichang station were obtained from the yichang hydrology bureau and used to create the pre dam and post dam rating curves the tgr started its impoundment in june 2003 so we assumed that the channel system of the middle yangtze river maintained a near equilibrium state before 2003 thus 2002 was selected to reflect the natural state of the downstream channel without the impact of the tgr for determining the pre dam minimum navigation discharge the latest available stage discharge data at yichang in 2015 were utilized for determining the post dam minimum navigation discharge the daily inflow data of the tgr from 2003 to 2017 were obtained from the three gorges official website three gorges projects development co ltd 2020 and utilized for the simulation of inflows the operation of the tgr consists of four operation periods low flow period pre flood high flow period flood pulse period and post flood high flow period and the dry season low flow period from november 1 to april 30 is the study period for this optimal operation model of the tgr the monthly freight volume data were downloaded from the official website of the ministry of transportation and used for the calculation of navigation benefit a set of the tgr storage and water level data were collected to represent the upstream stage volume relationship similarly a set of downstream flow and water level data were utilized to represent the downstream stage discharge relationship and a set of net water head and power capacity data were utilized to represent the relationship between net water head and the maximum power output determined by the turbine generator units 3 methods using the data sorted above a conflict resolution framework was developed as shown in the flowchart fig 2 the minimum navigation discharge was first estimated based on the pre and post dam stage discharge relationships respectively a set of stochastic inflows were simulated to represent different scales of drought stresses based on the flow duration curve analysis the simulated inflows were utilized for the optimal reservoir operation simulation to gain the pareto optimal frontier of hydropower generation and navigation benefits while maintaining other objectives under the pre and post dam minimum navigation discharge respectively then a set of conflict resolutions were developed considering the decision maker s preferences 3 1 minimum navigation discharge estimation reservoir operation changed the sediment transport and deposition characteristics reflected by the pre dam and post dam stage discharge rating curves considering the tgr impoundment starting date and the limitation of the yichang stage discharge dataset the stage discharge data for 2002 and 2015 were selected to represent the pre dam and post dam downstream channel conditions the minimum navigation discharge at the yichang station corresponding to the designed minimum navigation water level can be determined by the stage discharge rating curve as follows 1 q nmin g q z z d min where q nmin is the minimum navigation discharge m3 s g q z is the functional relationship between the daily stage and discharge at the yichang station m3 s z d min is the designed minimum navigable stage m and it is equal to 39 0 m above sea level at the yichang station because of the concrete ship lock requirement two sets of rating curves were used for the yichang station to distinguish the pre dam and post dam minimum navigation discharges fig 2 and the third order polynomial regression was utilized to fit the relationship after quantitatively estimating the channel alteration the drought stress of the tgr was quantitatively evaluated as well 3 2 inflow simulation and flow duration curve analysis to represent hydrological drought stresses of different scales the flow duration curve based on the historical inflows at the yichang station was employed to determine the inflow exceedance probability the flow duration curve describes the relationship between the streamflow rate and its exceedance probability this flow duration curve method is one of the most informative methods to capture the variability of hydrologic conditions from low flow to high flow years yu and yang 2000 yu et al 2019b if the average inflow rate is smaller it would have a higher exceedance probability compared with the historical data however besides the lower average inflow rate the uneven distribution of inflows also challenges reservoir operations for instance if the streamflow is high in the last week but low in the other weeks of the dry season the total inflow would still show a low exceedance probability meanwhile the outflow of the reservoir can hardly achieve a satisfactory navigation or energy output level due to this uneven distribution to minimize the impact of this typical hydrological process and to extend the inflow dataset from the actual inflow thomas fiering s method arselan 2012 alfa et al 2018 was utilized for stochastic inflow simulation of the tgr based on the recorded inflows of the tgr from 2003 to 2017 the equation to generate stochastic inflow is 2 i j 1 i j 1 r j j 1 s j 1 s j i j i j d j s j 1 1 r j j 1 2 where j 1 is the day for which the simulated inflow is generated j is the preceding day i j 1 is the inflow to be simulated during j 1 th day calculated from j th day i j is the inflow during j th day i j 1 is the average actual daily inflow during j 1 th day i j is the average actual daily inflow during j th day r j j 1 is the pearson product moment correlation coefficient between the j t h and j 1 th daily actual inflow sets s j s j 1 are the standard deviations during j th j 1 th day inflows respectively d j is a random normal deviate with zero mean and unit variance arselan 2012 alfa et al 2018 using the thomas fiering s method 300 inflow sequences were generated to represent different hydrologic patterns because of the requirement of the nature of inflow during this process if any simulated daily inflow is negative the simulation is repeated with a newly generated random normal deviate until a positive inflow sequence is obtained instead of the daily inflow sequence of the entire water year the ten day duration inflows dividing a month into three periods with starting dates of 1st 11th and 21st in the dry season from november 1 to april 30 were considered in the following model to balance the coverage of drought events and the efficiency of the computations the streamflow data at the yichang hydrological station fig 1 from 1881 to 2017 were summarized into the average inflow rates for flow duration curve analysis chow 1951 yu and yang 2000 yu et al 2019b to determine the exceedance probability of inflow at the tgr the distance between the yichang hydrological station and the tgr is about 44 km fig 1 and the exceedance probability for the runoff at these two locations were assumed to be the same the pearson type iii distribution was used for flow duration curve analysis since it fitted well in the south china basin li et al 2013 the flow duration curve analysis in the dry season was applied to the simulated inflow to generate 48 groups of the inflow sequences with the highest exceedance probabilities they were sorted into four average exceedance probability categories 85 90 95 and 99 the sequences of inflow with a similar exceedance probability were considered together in the following analysis to reduce the impacts of the typical hydrological patterns the actual hydrological drought stress during the post tgr period was evaluated quantitatively by using the flow duration curve analysis the recorded inflows after the construction of the tgr from 2003 to 2017 were compared with the historical inflows to determine the exceedance probability of the recorded inflows in this period the flow duration curve analysis for the tgr was first applied to the average annual inflow rate values during the entire water year from june 11 to june 10 of the following year in 2003 2017 and then to the inflows of the dry season november 1 to april 30 of the following year in 2003 2017 the actual operation outcome in the dry season of the determined dry year would be compared with the conflict resolutions of similar exceedance probability to evaluate the impact of the optimization operation to quantitatively evaluate the operation outcome the hydropower generation and navigation benefit were calculated using publicly available data 3 3 benefit calculation the hydropower generation benefit was calculated by multiplying the unit price of electricity by the output of hydropower generation the unit price of electricity p e was estimated by using the data from the public report of the tgr company and the price reform document 1101 issued by the national development and reform commission these documents indicated that the hydropower plant of three gorges dam sold electricity to hubei province at a price of 0 2506 yuan kwh which was assumed as the unit price of electricity p e for hydropower generation benefit calculation the freight volume in 2019 was utilized for the total navigational cargos in navigation benefit calculation since this year had the most recent available data before the pandemic impacts on navigation benefits the monthly freight volume data published by the ministry of transport of the people s republic of china water transport 2019 were downloaded showing that the total freight volume was 72 6 million tons during the dry season january to april and november to december of 2019 the total required transshipment over dam freight volume in the dry season was calculated by using this total freight volume in the following analysis after generating the unit price and total freight for benefit calculation the multi objective optimal operation model was developed for producing pareto optimal frontiers fig 2 3 4 multi objective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm based optimal model the objectives of the optimal operation model are increasing navigation benefits increasing hydropower generation benefit maintaining the river lake connection sustaining the minimum environmental flow and ensuring landslide stability wang et al 2013 xu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 because the study period was a dry season some objectives of the tgr operations associated with restricting the tgr flow during the flood seasons e g flood control were not considered in this model wang et al 2013 rheinheimer et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 furthermore some high outflow requirements such as the ideal fish flow that should be over 8 000 m3 s wang et al 2013 were not considered because it would be infeasible to accomplish with the low inflow even via the tgr optimal operation the minimum environmental flow in november and april was also not considered because of the infeasibility to maintain over 11 000 m3 s streamflow xu et al 2019 the minimum environmental flow from december to march 5500 m3 s xu et al 2019 was found to be close to the minimum navigation discharge determined for the post tgr period and thus was considered with the navigation benefits for the conflict resolution model considering the post dam minimum navigation discharge the fulfillment of navigation discharge for the post dam period can also generate environmental benefits since failure to maintain the river lake connection wang et al 2013 or landslide stability wang et al 2013 jiang et al 2020 can pose threatens to human lives these two objectives were maintained as constraints before maximizing the benefits of hydropower generation and navigation these two

al 2020 the navigation and hydropower generation benefits are set as the objectives in this multi objective optimization model the model proposed herein aims to increase the navigation benefit and

is shown fig 2 matlab is utilized for the nsga ii program the maximum generation is set to be 2000 and the population size is set to be 4000 the total number of time steps is 17 the decision variables are the upstream water levels z 1 z 2 z t as scalar values the pareto optimal frontier fig 3 is drawn based on the results from 10 independent runs the crossover distribution index and mutation distribution index are both set to be 10 when initializing the decision variables the upstream water level z t is set to range from 155 m to 175 m for the tgr the initial upstream stage is set to be 175 m and the final upstream stage of the reservoir was set to 155 m required for the actual dry season operation the setting of these initial and final upstream stages provides about 14 3 billion m3 water storage to be released during the operation period all the initial population would go through the water balance equation and constraint violation check the population is then sorted based on the violation rank and parents are selected by using binary tournament selection for mutation crossover and reproduction note that because navigation reliability η is the averaged sum of the binary navigable index y t 0 1 value as described in equation 10 the pareto optimal frontier is not continuously distributed along the navigation benefit fig 3 this discrete pattern makes the unsmooth shape of the pareto optimal frontier it is assumed that at a time scale smaller than the ten day duration period such as a daily scale the relationship between navigation and hydropower generation benefits is smooth so a linear interpolation between these points is performed for the following conflict resolution analysis to provide a baseline reference for the navigation reliability without the optimal operations of the tgr the navigation reliability is calculated using the simulated inflow this comparison aims to understand the channel alteration impacts without optimizing the reservoir operations the pearson correlation is utilized to evaluate the correlation between exceedance probability and navigation reliability a linear regression line is used to fit the relationship to present the gap of navigation reliability between pre dam and post dam requirements the pareto optimal frontier allows us to determine the conflict between hydropower generation and navigation benefits after maintaining the ecological flow and landslide stability comparatively the navigation benefit would always be lower than the hydropower generation benefit note that in the benefit calculations the river manager s judgement about these two objectives is not considered thus the conflict resolution analysis considering the decision maker s preferences is performed in this study as detailed below 3 5 conflict resolution analysis after identifying the pareto optimal frontier the hydropower generation and navigation benefits are normalized to define the utility as rao 1987 shapira et al 2019 16 u e f e f emin f emax f emin 17 u n f n f nmin f nmax f nmin where u e is the utility of the hydropower generation benefit u n is the utility of the navigation benefit f e and f n are the hydropower generation and navigation benefits billion yuan located at the pareto optimal frontier respectively f emin and f emax are the minimum and maximum hydropower generation benefits billion yuan f nmin and f nmax are the minimum and maximum navigation benefits billion yuan the conflict resolutions are based on the modeling of the decision maker s preferences two approaches are considered in this study conflict averse and hero shapira et al 2019 conflict averse is a situation when the decision maker would try to avoid any conflict between two objectives and has known the relative bargaining power of two conflicting players the relative power would be connected with the utopia an ideal point with full utilities 1 1 for both players fig 4 the possible solutions are the intersection between the connection line and pareto optimal frontier fig 4 in this study the relative bargaining power sets of 0 2 0 8 0 5 0 5 and 0 8 0 2 are selected hero is a situation when the decision maker would clearly support one of the conflicting objectives and support its best solution so the points with one full utility would be selected shapira et al 2019 based on these two approaches the optimal frontiers were quantitatively analyzed for five conflict resolutions and the corresponding benefits on both objectives due to the uneven distribution of inflow and random characteristics of the hydrological process the navigation and hydropower generation benefits can be different even with the same exceedance probability the conflict resolutions and corresponding benefits are averaged into four categories of exceedance probability 85 90 95 and 99 to reduce this impact a python script is compiled to locate the intersection points 4 results and discussions 4 1 minimum navigation discharge the stage and discharge data at the yichang hydrological station in 2002 and 2015 were used to develop the corresponding stage discharge rating curves to represent the pre and post dam minimum navigation discharges respectively fig 5 this finding supports sun et al 2019 on the investigation of three downstream stations further away from yichang station concluding that the channel erosion and sedimentation reached a relatively balanced condition starting from 2012 the stage and discharge data at the yichang hydrological station in 2002 and 2015 were used to develop the corresponding stage discharge rating curves to represent the pre and post dam minimum navigation discharges respectively fig 5 the two third order polynomial regression lines both fitted the relationships well r 2 0 99 for both pre dam and post dam relationships the magnitude of the post dam minimum navigation discharge is consistent with the result of sun et al 2019 both demonstrating the evident increase of discharge at low stages from pre dam to post dam note that the fitted curve in this study was generated based on the rating curves at yichang station while the analyses in sun et al 2019 were based on the data from three downstream stations farther from the tgr than yichang station the estimated minimum navigation discharge determined by the fitted curves at the downstream yichang station increased 16 67 from 4 702 3 m3 s at the stage of 39 0 m for the pre dam period to 5 486 3 m3 s for the post dam period meanwhile this determined post dam minimum navigation discharge meets the basic environmental flow required for the survival of key species xu et al 2019 4 2 flow duration curve analysis for the actual inflow the pearson type iii curve fitted the relationship between exceedance probability and inflow well fig 6 the flow duration curve analysis showed that in the post dam period the exceedance probability of actual inflow was high in the entire water year compared with the historical data and two extreme drought years also had a high exceedance probability in the flow duration curve analysis for the dry season suggesting drought stresses during the post tgr period table 1 the average exceedance probability for water years from 2003 to 2017 is 75 51 ranging from 55 35 to 99 56 while in four out of fifteen water years the exceedance probabilities reach over 90 the exceedance probabilities of water years 2006 2009 2011 and 2013 are 99 56 90 09 94 74 and 90 66 respectively table 1 these four dry years are consistent with those identified in previous studies lai et al 2014 guo et al 2018 chai et al 2019 if only considering the dry season in a water year november 1 to april 30 the exceedance probability of the dry season from 2003 to 2017 is lower average exceedance probability is 37 28 ranging from 1 53 to 91 51 but the dry season in water years 2006 and 2009 both presented high exceedance probabilities 81 21 and 91 51 respectively this result shows that the drought stress in the post tgr period is considerable in these years since 2009 is the only water year that has an exceedance probability over 85 in the dry season its hydropower generation and navigation benefits were calculated following the same protocol in the conflict resolution model the same flow duration curve analysis was applied to the simulated inflows based on thomas fiering s method out of 300 sequences 48 sequences of the simulated dry season inflows average inflow rate is 4 943 8 m3 s ranging from 4 043 3 to 5 305 9 m3 s with the highest exceedance probabilities average exceedance probability is 91 9 ranging from 83 7 to 99 9 were selected for the following analysis note that the difference between the initial 175 m and final 155 m upstream stages for reservoir operation also provided about 14 3 billion m3 for potential water release the minimum navigation discharge would be relatively hard to reach for these low inflow sequences 4 3 navigation reliability for simulated inflow without reservoir operations after applying the minimum navigation discharge for the pre dam and post dam periods to the 48 simulated dry season inflow sequences the average navigation reliability decreases 35 6 from the pre dam minimum navigation discharge to the post dam discharge fig 7 this decrease reflects the impact of channel alternation on the navigation reliability without reservoir operations the average navigation reliability under the pre dam navigation discharge is 51 4 equal to 1 1 billion yuan navigation benefit ranging from 22 1 to 82 9 the average navigation reliability under the post dam discharge is 33 1 equal to 0 7 billion yuan navigation benefit ranging from 11 1 to 60 8 the average navigation reliability without optimization operations presents a significant gap 35 6 fig 7 suggesting an unavoidable channel alteration and necessity of optimization operation the navigation reliability is negatively cor 0 44 for the pre dam minimum discharge cor 0 53 for the post dam minimum discharge and significantly p 0 01 for both correlated with the exceedance probability if the drought stress gets more severe for a smaller total inflow volume the navigation reliability will continue to decline this finding which is consistent with those from dai et al 2008 lai et al 2014 and li et al 2018 demonstrates that if extreme droughts aggregate in the future the increasing pressure on navigation will be unavoidable 4 4 conflict resolutions the pareto optimal frontiers based on the output of the nsga ii model presented a non linear tradeoff between navigation and hydropower generation benefits table 2 shows that the policy choices for the decision maker and the corresponding hydropower generation and navigation benefit when an extreme drought occurs such as an inflow rate at 99 exceedance probability the largest benefit loss could reach 1 2 billion yuan hydropower generation benefit and 16 0 million ton navigation benefit compared with an inflow at 85 exceedance probability among all policy choices the actual operation hydropower generation benefit is 5 2 billion yuan and the navigation benefit is 56 6 million ton during the dry season in water year 2009 the average hydropower generation and navigation benefits of a 90 exceedance probability are approximately 2 6 and 1 2 times respectively greater than those for 2009 dry season an important reason for this huge difference is that in water year 2009 the initial upstream water level at the beginning of the dry season was about 170 m which was 5 m lower than the optimization model setting another reason is that the inflow prediction in 2009 is unable to foresee the inflows in 181 days while the optimization model is under the known simulated inflow as an ideal situation but this benefit difference still reflects that this conflict resolution model can optimize the operation of the tgr the average navigation benefit for all exceedance probabilities and all preferences after the tgr operations is 67 6 million tons under the post dam minimum navigation discharge this navigation benefit is about twice of the average navigation benefit calculated by using the inflow without the tgr operations this study for the first time quantitatively evaluated the navigation benefits of the tgr operations during the dry season with a high exceedance probability li et al 2021 also evaluated the navigation benefit of the tgr based on the freight volume for a normal flow condition this study not only utilized the fright volume to quantify the navigation benefit but also under simulated dry season sequences with low inflows the change in the minimum navigation discharge determined for pre and post dam periods affected the navigation benefit on a relatively smaller scale since the maximum navigation benefit was fixed after reaching the full navigation reliability but it showed significant impacts on the hydropower generation benefit the average hydropower generation benefit decreases by 1 8 about 0 2 billion yuan from the pre dam scenario to the post dam scenario fig 8 the largest decrease in the hydropower generation benefit occurred for preferences 1 0 with an exceedance probability of 99 while the hydropower generation benefit loss was 0 5 billion yuan 4 3 decrease from the pre dam to post dam scenario the accommodation of the channel alteration by updating the minimum navigation discharge decreased the hydropower generation benefit with low inflows 5 conclusions the existing operation rules of the tgr need to be reconsidered to accommodate the increases in extreme drought events and channel topographic changes however few efforts have been made to cope with the related operation issues this study aimed to fill this gap by optimizing the multi objective operations of the tgr in dry seasons under altered channel morphology and quantitatively evaluating the impact of hydrologic drought stress an nsga ii based conflict resolution model was developed in this study and applied to the tgr considering five objectives associated with hydropower navigation environmental flow landslide stability and downstream river lake connection five conflict solutions for each exceedance probability were achieved by considering different decision maker preferences it was found that the significant change in the stage discharge relationships for the pre and post tgr periods affected the minimum navigation discharge using the updated minimum navigation discharge both hydropower generation and navigation reliability declined due to the channel alteration lower flows resulted in reduction in the total benefits of navigation and hydropower if the environmental water needs such as the minimum environmental flow landslide stability and river lake connection are fully met the simulation of the conflict resolutions will be very helpful to water managers to modify reservoir operation strategies after channel alteration especially under drought stress this study provides the data reference for the decision makers on the costs and benefits for different scales of drought stress and an ideal situation of the full inflow prediction in a dry season it is also critical to reconsider the downstream channel alteration induced by the tgr damming to effectively manage the limited reservoir storage and achieve competitive objectives it should be noted that the modeling method developed in this study can be further extended and applied to solve other multi objective tradeoff problems for optimal reservoir operation and water resources management under climate changes and post dam channel alteration in the future studies a smaller time step can be considered and a smoother pareto optimal curve can be developed for the conflict resolutions the analysis of navigation benefits can also account for the regional economics and the corresponding impacts on the transshipment over dam process with more additional data to find equilibriums on the economic perspectives an extension from the dry season to the entire water year would also be helpful to incorporate the objectives of flood control and the cruise ship navigation benefit 6 data availability statements water inflow outflow and water level data used in this study are available at the three gorges

3339,the increases in extreme drought events and channel alteration challenge the existing reservoir operation rules therefore reservoir operation should be reconsidered to accommodate these challenges a conflict resolution model for reservoir operation considering the decision makers preference is developed for the conflict between hydropower generation and navigation in dry seasons under channel alteration to achieve the goal of meeting minimum environmental flow landslide stability and river lake connection constraints this model with a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is applied to the three gorges reservoir tgr on the yangtze river the results show that minimum navigation discharge for the post dam period is greater than that for the pre dam period indicating channel alteration both average hydropower generation benefit and navigation reliability decrease with modification of the post dam minimum navigation discharge signifying the adverse effect of damming the total benefits of navigation and hydropower generation decrease with the exceedance probability a higher hydropower generation benefit leads to a smaller navigation benefit reflecting the conflict of interest this study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed conflict resolution model as well as the navigation benefit quantifying method and applicability to similar water resources management problems keywords reservoir operation conflict resolution model drought stress channel alteration nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii decision maker preferences 1 introduction reservoir operation often affects the river environment changes the sediment transport and deposition characteristics and further alters downstream channel morphology chen et al 2015 legleiter 2015 as a result the stage discharge curve of the downstream channel was changed reflecting the channel alteration zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 sun et al 2019 which affected the safe navigation of ships shang et al 2017 for a relatively new reservoir such as three gorges reservoir tgr updating the post dam minimum navigation discharge in the reservoir operation would be necessary for future navigation and hydropower generation recently sun et al 2019 found that after the 10 year post dam period from the closure of the three gorges dam in 2003 channel erosion and sedimentation reached a relatively balanced condition in 2012 this balancing process altered the channel morphological condition after the post dam downstream channel alteration it was found that the minimum navigation discharge could be determined by this relatively stabilized stage discharge relationship furthermore the navigation benefits based on the pre dam and post dam minimum navigation discharge could be evaluated navigation is an essential objective of the three gorges dam operations li et al 2021 and the damage of navigation security would pose a growing threat to economic benefits the total freight volume transported through the tgr exceeded the designed capacity of the three gorges dam in 2011 and was 19 years sooner than expected li et al 2021 according to changjiang times 2014 the tgr reached its navigation bottleneck in 2014 the reported freight volume through the ship lock of the three gorges dam in 2018 was 142 million tons wu 2019 which already exceeded the 2020 freight volume forecasted by li et al 2021 this rapidly growing freight volume suggested a high demand to increase the navigation reliability by maintaining minimum navigation discharge of the tgr the decline of navigation reliability would induce considerable pressure on the tgr operations and affect the navigation benefits especially on cargo transportation furthermore if the ships have to wait at the upstream of the tgr the emissions of greenhouse gases and the economic loss of highly time sensitive cargo such as fresh fruit would be large sun 2013 these adverse effects of navigation security damage pose high risks to people s living and earnings however if the reservoir outflow needs to continuously fulfill the minimum navigation discharge with low inflow the reservoir will be unable to maintain a high upstream water level decreasing the hydropower generation this operation characteristic suggests a tradeoff between hydropower generation and navigation benefits in addition to such increasing concerns of navigation reliability the tgr is also a typical example facing extreme drought impacts huang et al 2021 suggested that the higher air temperature and less precipitation will occur in the upper reaches of the yangtze river from 2020 to 2050 which will eventually reduce the annual runoff by 4 5 if these drought events occur in the future they will unavoidably impact the streamflow of the tgr such drought events reduce the total water supply and the reliability of meeting the downstream water demands chai et al 2019 yu et al 2019a dai et al 2008 indicated that the reduction in tgr downstream runoff in 2006 was mainly attributed to the extreme drought of the yangtze river specifically in a dry year the total inflow of the tgr would be lower than that in normal years and insufficient for satisfying the downstream safe navigation requirement this low inflow condition can result in lower navigation benefit especially in the dry season however limited effort has been made to address the impact of the increased hydrologic drought and downstream channel alteration on the tgr s navigation benefits especially using quantitative evaluation approaches sun 2013 applied a partial greenhouse gas emission cost benefit analysis to quantitatively describe the navigation benefit using equivalent greenhouse gas emission in a normal flow condition li et al 2021 evaluated the navigation benefit of the tgr by freight volume under current climate this study aims to fill this gap by developing a conflict resolution model based on simulated dry season inflow with different exceedance probabilities of low inflow in addition to mitigating the tgr outflow to satisfy safe navigation requirement and maximize the benefits as a multipurpose reservoir the tgr also needs to accomplish ecological environmental and socio economic objectives for instance jiang et al 2020 developed a model to deal with some major purposes of the tgr including sediment flashing fish habitats landslide safety flood releasing and hydropower generation xu et al 2019 estimated a minimum environmental discharge of the tgr for key species of the yangtze river wang et al 2013 examined ecological targets of the tgr such as maintaining river lake connection and enhancing fish spawning most multi purpose reservoir operations require a tradeoff process to reach a balance between these objectives fu et al 2014 giuliani et al 2016 salazar et al 2017 some modeling studies have been conducted to provide conflict resolutions for hydropower water supply environmental flow and other water related activities fu et al 2013 fu et al 2014 hess and fenrich 2017 ren et al 2019 raso et al 2020 recently the game theoretic model has been widely utilized to find the compromising points in the tradeoff process of multi objective optimization by defining the payoffs and the behavior of the players and arriving at a single solution lee 2012 alizadeh et al 2017 shapira et al 2019 shapira et al 2019 developed a new conflict resolution model which considered the decision maker s preferences and provided a set of more efficient conflict resolutions to avoid unrealistic assumptions for a watershed management problem this conflict resolution model is applied to the tgr in this study after achieving some objectives of the tgr as prerequisite constraints the policy choices among alternatives of hydropower generation and navigation benefits would depend on the value judgment of the decision maker in our case the river manager for example the river manager might value the navigation more than hydropower generation because some indirect benefits such as increasing regional economics positively relate to navigation reliability or the river manager might be more willing to maintain the hydropower generation output at a high level since these preferences are important to decision making in hydropower generation navigation conflicts we develop a conflict resolution model to account for the decision maker s preferences and provide the corresponding benefits for data references in the future the channel alteration due to the reservoir operation the anticipated decrease in navigation reliability and the hydrological drought stress on the yangtze river in the coming future require changes in the tgr operation thus it is essential to develop a conflict resolution model to help identify effective conflict resolutions for navigation security accommodation of channel alteration and drought stress and some other objectives of the tgr this study aims 1 to estimate the minimum navigation discharge before and after the operation of the tgr by the revised stage discharge relationships 2 to develop a multi objective model for joint analysis of hydropower generation and navigation benefits considering multiple purposes of the tgr pre dam and post dam minimum navigation discharge requirements and dry season inflows of different exceedance probabilities and 3 to estimate the hydropower generation and navigation benefit considering the decision maker s preferences for quantifying efficient conflict resolutions and comparing the hydropower generation benefits under pre dam and post dam minimum navigation discharge conditions and under different scales of drought stress 2 study area and data 2 1 descriptions of the study area the tgr is located on the yangtze river fig 1 in the subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average annual precipitation of 1 000 1 300 mm hu et al 2014 this run of the river reservoir system has been in operation since 1981 li et al 2011 yu et al 2013 the three gorges dam has a crest elevation of 185 m with a normal pool level of 175 m huang et al 2015 in the tgr operation the water level ranges from 145 m dead water level to 175 m with a utilizable storage capacity of 19 3 billion m3 the reservoir operations need to satisfy the needs for flood control hydropower generation navigation shoreline stability environmental flow ecological flow and some other purposes the gezhouba dam is located 38 km downstream of the tgr along the main channel of the yangtze river fig 1 the yichang station located approximately 6 km downstream of the gezhouba dam or 44 km downstream of the tgr fig 1 is the outflow control station for the tgr s operation the minimum navigation discharge is a baseflow level to be met throughout the year for navigation at the downstream of the dam and is assumed to be a top priority over hydropower generation for the tgr operation from october to the end of march the yangtze river enters its dry season when the water level decreases the low water levels in the dry season could result in navigation suspension and considerable economic losses the minimum discharge for navigation now being used satisfies a water elevation of 39 m above sea level at the ship lock fig 1 immediately downstream of the gezhouba dam since the distance between the ship lock and the yichang station is approximately 2 km fig 1 the natural water loss is assumed negligible within this short distance and the minimum water stage for navigation at the yichang station can be reasonably assumed to be the same as the required navigation elevation threshold of 39 m 2 2 data the ten day duration streamflow data at the yichang hydrological station fig 1 from 1881 to 2008 and the daily streamflow data from 2009 to 2011 were obtained from the yichang hydrology bureau this ten day duration period is the traditional time frame in chinese agricultural society dividing a month into three periods and use 1st 11th and 21st as the starting date of each period these datasets were used for the flow duration curve analysis in this study to determine the exceedance probability of inflow yu and yang 2000 yu et al 2019b the daily stage discharge data at yichang station were obtained from the yichang hydrology bureau and used to create the pre dam and post dam rating curves the tgr started its impoundment in june 2003 so we assumed that the channel system of the middle yangtze river maintained a near equilibrium state before 2003 thus 2002 was selected to reflect the natural state of the downstream channel without the impact of the tgr for determining the pre dam minimum navigation discharge the latest available stage discharge data at yichang in 2015 were utilized for determining the post dam minimum navigation discharge the daily inflow data of the tgr from 2003 to 2017 were obtained from the three gorges official website three gorges projects development co ltd 2020 and utilized for the simulation of inflows the operation of the tgr consists of four operation periods low flow period pre flood high flow period flood pulse period and post flood high flow period and the dry season low flow period from november 1 to april 30 is the study period for this optimal operation model of the tgr the monthly freight volume data were downloaded from the official website of the ministry of transportation and used for the calculation of navigation benefit a set of the tgr storage and water level data were collected to represent the upstream stage volume relationship similarly a set of downstream flow and water level data were utilized to represent the downstream stage discharge relationship and a set of net water head and power capacity data were utilized to represent the relationship between net water head and the maximum power output determined by the turbine generator units 3 methods using the data sorted above a conflict resolution framework was developed as shown in the flowchart fig 2 the minimum navigation discharge was first estimated based on the pre and post dam stage discharge relationships respectively a set of stochastic inflows were simulated to represent different scales of drought stresses based on the flow duration curve analysis the simulated inflows were utilized for the optimal reservoir operation simulation to gain the pareto optimal frontier of hydropower generation and navigation benefits while maintaining other objectives under the pre and post dam minimum navigation discharge respectively then a set of conflict resolutions were developed considering the decision maker s preferences 3 1 minimum navigation discharge estimation reservoir operation changed the sediment transport and deposition characteristics reflected by the pre dam and post dam stage discharge rating curves considering the tgr impoundment starting date and the limitation of the yichang stage discharge dataset the stage discharge data for 2002 and 2015 were selected to represent the pre dam and post dam downstream channel conditions the minimum navigation discharge at the yichang station corresponding to the designed minimum navigation water level can be determined by the stage discharge rating curve as follows 1 q nmin g q z z d min where q nmin is the minimum navigation discharge m3 s g q z is the functional relationship between the daily stage and discharge at the yichang station m3 s z d min is the designed minimum navigable stage m and it is equal to 39 0 m above sea level at the yichang station because of the concrete ship lock requirement two sets of rating curves were used for the yichang station to distinguish the pre dam and post dam minimum navigation discharges fig 2 and the third order polynomial regression was utilized to fit the relationship after quantitatively estimating the channel alteration the drought stress of the tgr was quantitatively evaluated as well 3 2 inflow simulation and flow duration curve analysis to represent hydrological drought stresses of different scales the flow duration curve based on the historical inflows at the yichang station was employed to determine the inflow exceedance probability the flow duration curve describes the relationship between the streamflow rate and its exceedance probability this flow duration curve method is one of the most informative methods to capture the variability of hydrologic conditions from low flow to high flow years yu and yang 2000 yu et al 2019b if the average inflow rate is smaller it would have a higher exceedance probability compared with the historical data however besides the lower average inflow rate the uneven distribution of inflows also challenges reservoir operations for instance if the streamflow is high in the last week but low in the other weeks of the dry season the total inflow would still show a low exceedance probability meanwhile the outflow of the reservoir can hardly achieve a satisfactory navigation or energy output level due to this uneven distribution to minimize the impact of this typical hydrological process and to extend the inflow dataset from the actual inflow thomas fiering s method arselan 2012 alfa et al 2018 was utilized for stochastic inflow simulation of the tgr based on the recorded inflows of the tgr from 2003 to 2017 the equation to generate stochastic inflow is 2 i j 1 i j 1 r j j 1 s j 1 s j i j i j d j s j 1 1 r j j 1 2 where j 1 is the day for which the simulated inflow is generated j is the preceding day i j 1 is the inflow to be simulated during j 1 th day calculated from j th day i j is the inflow during j th day i j 1 is the average actual daily inflow during j 1 th day i j is the average actual daily inflow during j th day r j j 1 is the pearson product moment correlation coefficient between the j t h and j 1 th daily actual inflow sets s j s j 1 are the standard deviations during j th j 1 th day inflows respectively d j is a random normal deviate with zero mean and unit variance arselan 2012 alfa et al 2018 using the thomas fiering s method 300 inflow sequences were generated to represent different hydrologic patterns because of the requirement of the nature of inflow during this process if any simulated daily inflow is negative the simulation is repeated with a newly generated random normal deviate until a positive inflow sequence is obtained instead of the daily inflow sequence of the entire water year the ten day duration inflows dividing a month into three periods with starting dates of 1st 11th and 21st in the dry season from november 1 to april 30 were considered in the following model to balance the coverage of drought events and the efficiency of the computations the streamflow data at the yichang hydrological station fig 1 from 1881 to 2017 were summarized into the average inflow rates for flow duration curve analysis chow 1951 yu and yang 2000 yu et al 2019b to determine the exceedance probability of inflow at the tgr the distance between the yichang hydrological station and the tgr is about 44 km fig 1 and the exceedance probability for the runoff at these two locations were assumed to be the same the pearson type iii distribution was used for flow duration curve analysis since it fitted well in the south china basin li et al 2013 the flow duration curve analysis in the dry season was applied to the simulated inflow to generate 48 groups of the inflow sequences with the highest exceedance probabilities they were sorted into four average exceedance probability categories 85 90 95 and 99 the sequences of inflow with a similar exceedance probability were considered together in the following analysis to reduce the impacts of the typical hydrological patterns the actual hydrological drought stress during the post tgr period was evaluated quantitatively by using the flow duration curve analysis the recorded inflows after the construction of the tgr from 2003 to 2017 were compared with the historical inflows to determine the exceedance probability of the recorded inflows in this period the flow duration curve analysis for the tgr was first applied to the average annual inflow rate values during the entire water year from june 11 to june 10 of the following year in 2003 2017 and then to the inflows of the dry season november 1 to april 30 of the following year in 2003 2017 the actual operation outcome in the dry season of the determined dry year would be compared with the conflict resolutions of similar exceedance probability to evaluate the impact of the optimization operation to quantitatively evaluate the operation outcome the hydropower generation and navigation benefit were calculated using publicly available data 3 3 benefit calculation the hydropower generation benefit was calculated by multiplying the unit price of electricity by the output of hydropower generation the unit price of electricity p e was estimated by using the data from the public report of the tgr company and the price reform document 1101 issued by the national development and reform commission these documents indicated that the hydropower plant of three gorges dam sold electricity to hubei province at a price of 0 2506 yuan kwh which was assumed as the unit price of electricity p e for hydropower generation benefit calculation the freight volume in 2019 was utilized for the total navigational cargos in navigation benefit calculation since this year had the most recent available data before the pandemic impacts on navigation benefits the monthly freight volume data published by the ministry of transport of the people s republic of china water transport 2019 were downloaded showing that the total freight volume was 72 6 million tons during the dry season january to april and november to december of 2019 the total required transshipment over dam freight volume in the dry season was calculated by using this total freight volume in the following analysis after generating the unit price and total freight for benefit calculation the multi objective optimal operation model was developed for producing pareto optimal frontiers fig 2 3 4 multi objective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm based optimal model the objectives of the optimal operation model are increasing navigation benefits increasing hydropower generation benefit maintaining the river lake connection sustaining the minimum environmental flow and ensuring landslide stability wang et al 2013 xu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 because the study period was a dry season some objectives of the tgr operations associated with restricting the tgr flow during the flood seasons e g flood control were not considered in this model wang et al 2013 rheinheimer et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 furthermore some high outflow requirements such as the ideal fish flow that should be over 8 000 m3 s wang et al 2013 were not considered because it would be infeasible to accomplish with the low inflow even via the tgr optimal operation the minimum environmental flow in november and april was also not considered because of the infeasibility to maintain over 11 000 m3 s streamflow xu et al 2019 the minimum environmental flow from december to march 5500 m3 s xu et al 2019 was found to be close to the minimum navigation discharge determined for the post tgr period and thus was considered with the navigation benefits for the conflict resolution model considering the post dam minimum navigation discharge the fulfillment of navigation discharge for the post dam period can also generate environmental benefits since failure to maintain the river lake connection wang et al 2013 or landslide stability wang et al 2013 jiang et al 2020 can pose threatens to human lives these two objectives were maintained as constraints before maximizing the benefits of hydropower generation and navigation these two

al 2020 the navigation and hydropower generation benefits are set as the objectives in this multi objective optimization model the model proposed herein aims to increase the navigation benefit and hydropower generation benefit and develop conflict resolutions based on these two objectives thus the objective functions can be expressed as 5 f e max e p e 6 f n max η f where f e is the total

is shown fig 2 matlab is utilized for the nsga ii program the maximum generation is set to be 2000 and the population size is set to be 4000 the total number of time steps is 17 the decision variables are the upstream water levels z 1 z 2 z t as scalar values the pareto optimal frontier fig 3 is drawn based on the results from 10 independent runs the crossover distribution index and mutation distribution index are both set to be 10 when initializing the decision variables the upstream water level z t is set to range from 155 m to 175 m for the tgr the initial upstream stage is set to be 175 m and the final upstream stage of the reservoir was set to 155 m required for the actual dry season operation the setting of these initial and final upstream stages provides about 14 3 billion m3 water storage to be released during the operation period all the initial population would go through the water balance equation and constraint violation check the population is then sorted based on the violation rank and parents are selected by using binary tournament selection for mutation crossover and reproduction note that because navigation reliability η is the averaged sum of the binary navigable index y t 0 1 value as described in equation 10 the pareto optimal frontier is not continuously distributed along the navigation benefit fig 3 this discrete pattern makes the unsmooth shape of the pareto optimal frontier it is assumed that at a time scale smaller than the ten day duration period such as a daily scale the relationship between navigation and hydropower generation benefits is smooth so a linear interpolation between these points is performed for the following conflict resolution analysis to provide a baseline reference for the navigation reliability without the optimal operations of the tgr the navigation reliability is calculated using the simulated inflow this comparison aims to understand the channel alteration impacts without optimizing the reservoir operations the pearson correlation is utilized to evaluate the correlation between exceedance probability and navigation reliability a linear regression line is used to fit the relationship to present the gap of navigation reliability between pre dam and post dam requirements the pareto optimal frontier allows us to determine the conflict between hydropower generation and navigation benefits after maintaining the ecological flow and landslide stability comparatively the navigation benefit would always be lower than the hydropower generation benefit note that in the benefit calculations the river manager s judgement about these two objectives is not considered thus the conflict resolution analysis considering the decision maker s preferences is performed in this study as detailed below 3 5 conflict resolution analysis after identifying the pareto optimal frontier the hydropower generation and navigation benefits are normalized to define the utility as rao 1987 shapira et al 2019 16 u e f e f emin f emax f emin 17 u n f n f nmin f nmax f nmin where u e is the utility of the hydropower generation benefit u n is the utility of the navigation benefit f e and f n are the hydropower generation and navigation benefits billion yuan located at the pareto optimal frontier respectively f emin and f emax are the minimum and maximum hydropower generation benefits billion yuan f nmin and f nmax are the minimum and maximum navigation benefits billion yuan the conflict resolutions are based on the modeling of the decision maker s preferences two approaches are considered in this study conflict averse and hero shapira et al 2019 conflict averse is a situation when the decision maker would try to avoid any conflict between two objectives and has known the relative bargaining power of two conflicting players the relative power would be connected with the utopia an ideal point with full utilities 1 1 for both players fig 4 the possible solutions are the intersection between the connection line and pareto optimal frontier fig 4 in this study the relative bargaining power sets of 0 2 0 8 0 5 0 5 and 0 8 0 2 are selected hero is a situation when the decision maker would clearly support one of the conflicting objectives and support its best solution so the points with one full utility would be selected shapira et al 2019 based on these two approaches the optimal frontiers were quantitatively analyzed for five conflict resolutions and the corresponding benefits on both objectives due to the uneven distribution of inflow and random characteristics of the hydrological process the navigation and hydropower generation benefits can be different even with the same exceedance probability the conflict resolutions and corresponding benefits are averaged into four categories of exceedance probability 85 90 95 and 99 to reduce this impact a python script is compiled to locate the intersection points 4 results and discussions 4 1 minimum navigation discharge the stage and discharge data at the yichang hydrological station in 2002 and 2015 were used to develop the corresponding stage discharge rating curves to represent the pre and post dam minimum navigation discharges respectively fig 5 this finding supports sun et al 2019 on the investigation of three downstream stations further away from yichang station concluding that the channel erosion and sedimentation reached a relatively balanced condition starting from 2012 the stage and discharge data at the yichang hydrological station in 2002 and 2015 were used to develop the corresponding stage discharge rating curves to represent the pre and post dam minimum navigation discharges respectively fig 5 the two third order polynomial regression lines both fitted the relationships well r 2 0 99 for both pre dam and post dam relationships the magnitude of the post dam minimum navigation discharge is consistent with the result of sun et al 2019 both demonstrating the evident increase of discharge at low stages from pre dam to post dam note that the fitted curve in this study was generated based on the rating curves at yichang station while the analyses in sun et al 2019 were based on the data from three downstream stations farther from the tgr than yichang station the estimated minimum navigation discharge determined by the fitted curves at the downstream yichang station increased 16 67 from 4 702 3 m3 s at the stage of 39 0 m for the pre dam period to 5 486 3 m3 s for the post dam period meanwhile this determined post dam minimum navigation discharge meets the basic environmental flow required for the survival of key species xu et al 2019 4 2 flow duration curve analysis for the actual inflow the pearson type iii curve fitted the relationship between exceedance probability and inflow well fig 6 the flow duration curve analysis showed that in the post dam period the exceedance probability of actual inflow was high in the entire water year compared with the historical data and two extreme drought years also had a high exceedance probability in the flow duration curve analysis for the dry season suggesting drought stresses during the post tgr period table 1 the average exceedance probability for water years from 2003 to 2017 is 75 51 ranging from 55 35 to 99 56 while in four out of fifteen water years the exceedance probabilities reach over 90 the exceedance probabilities of water years 2006 2009 2011 and 2013 are 99 56 90 09 94 74 and 90 66 respectively table 1 these four dry years are consistent with those identified in previous studies lai et al 2014 guo et al 2018 chai et al 2019 if only considering the dry season in a water year november 1 to april 30 the exceedance probability of the dry season from 2003 to 2017 is lower average exceedance probability is 37 28 ranging from 1 53 to 91 51 but the dry season in water years 2006 and 2009 both presented high exceedance probabilities 81 21 and 91 51 respectively this result shows that the drought stress in the post tgr period is considerable in these years since 2009 is the only water year that has an exceedance probability over 85 in the dry season its hydropower generation and navigation benefits were calculated following the same protocol in the conflict resolution model the same flow duration curve analysis was applied to the simulated inflows based on thomas fiering s method out of 300 sequences 48 sequences of the simulated dry season inflows average inflow rate is 4 943 8 m3 s ranging from 4 043 3 to 5 305 9 m3 s with the highest exceedance probabilities average exceedance probability is 91 9 ranging from 83 7 to 99 9 were selected for the following analysis note that the difference between the initial 175 m and final 155 m upstream stages for reservoir operation also provided about 14 3 billion m3 for potential water release the minimum navigation discharge would be relatively hard to reach for these low inflow sequences 4 3 navigation reliability for simulated inflow without reservoir operations after applying the minimum navigation discharge for the pre dam and post dam periods to the 48 simulated dry season inflow sequences the average navigation reliability decreases 35 6 from the pre dam minimum navigation discharge to the post dam discharge fig 7 this decrease reflects the impact of channel alternation on the navigation reliability without reservoir operations the average navigation reliability under the pre dam navigation discharge is 51 4 equal to 1 1 billion yuan navigation benefit ranging from 22 1 to 82 9 the average navigation reliability under the post dam discharge is 33 1 equal to 0 7 billion yuan navigation benefit ranging from 11 1 to 60 8 the average navigation reliability without optimization operations presents a significant gap 35 6 fig 7 suggesting an unavoidable channel alteration and necessity of optimization operation the navigation reliability is negatively cor 0 44 for the pre dam minimum discharge cor 0 53 for the post dam minimum discharge and significantly p 0 01 for both correlated with the exceedance probability if the drought stress gets more severe for a smaller total inflow volume the navigation reliability will continue to decline this finding which is consistent with those from dai et al 2008 lai et al 2014 and li et al 2018 demonstrates that if extreme droughts aggregate in the future the increasing pressure on navigation will be unavoidable 4 4 conflict resolutions the pareto optimal frontiers based on the output of the nsga ii model presented a non linear tradeoff between navigation and hydropower generation benefits table 2 shows that the policy choices for the decision maker and the corresponding hydropower generation and navigation benefit when an extreme drought occurs such as an inflow rate at 99 exceedance probability the largest benefit loss could reach 1 2 billion yuan hydropower generation benefit and 16 0 million ton navigation benefit compared with an inflow at 85 exceedance probability among all policy choices the actual operation hydropower generation benefit is 5 2 billion yuan and the navigation benefit is 56 6 million ton during the dry season in water year 2009 the average hydropower generation and navigation benefits of a 90 exceedance probability are approximately 2 6 and 1 2 times respectively greater than those for 2009 dry season an important reason for this huge difference is that in water year 2009 the initial upstream water level at the beginning of the dry season was about 170 m which was 5 m lower than the optimization model setting another reason is that the inflow prediction in 2009 is unable to foresee the inflows in 181 days while the optimization model is under the known simulated inflow as an ideal situation but this benefit difference still reflects that this conflict resolution model can optimize the operation of the tgr the average navigation benefit for all exceedance probabilities and all preferences after the tgr operations is 67 6 million tons under the post dam minimum navigation discharge this navigation benefit is about twice of the average navigation benefit calculated by using the inflow without the tgr operations this study for the first time quantitatively evaluated the navigation benefits of the tgr operations during the dry season with a high exceedance probability li et al 2021 also evaluated the navigation benefit of the tgr based on the freight volume for a normal flow condition this study not only utilized the fright volume to quantify the navigation benefit but also under simulated dry season sequences with low inflows the change in the minimum navigation discharge determined for pre and post dam periods affected the navigation benefit on a relatively smaller scale since the maximum navigation benefit was fixed after reaching the full navigation reliability but it showed significant impacts on the hydropower generation benefit the average hydropower generation benefit decreases by 1 8 about 0 2 billion yuan from the pre dam scenario to the post dam scenario fig 8 the largest decrease in the hydropower generation benefit occurred for preferences 1 0 with an exceedance probability of 99 while the hydropower generation benefit loss was 0 5 billion yuan 4 3 decrease from the pre dam to post dam scenario the accommodation of the channel alteration by updating the minimum navigation discharge decreased the hydropower generation benefit with low inflows 5 conclusions the existing operation rules of the tgr need to be reconsidered to accommodate the increases in extreme drought events and channel topographic changes however few efforts have been made to cope with the related operation issues this study aimed to fill this gap by optimizing the multi objective operations of the tgr in dry seasons under altered channel morphology and quantitatively evaluating the impact of hydrologic drought stress an nsga ii based conflict resolution model was developed in this study and applied to the tgr considering five objectives associated with hydropower navigation environmental flow landslide stability and downstream river lake connection five conflict solutions for each exceedance probability were achieved by considering different decision maker preferences it was found that the significant change in the stage discharge relationships for the pre and post tgr periods affected the minimum navigation discharge using the updated minimum navigation discharge both hydropower generation and navigation reliability declined due to the channel alteration lower flows resulted in reduction in the total benefits of navigation and hydropower if the environmental water needs such as the minimum environmental flow landslide stability and river lake connection are fully met the simulation of the conflict resolutions will be very helpful to water managers to modify reservoir operation strategies after channel alteration especially under drought stress this study provides the data reference for the decision makers on the costs and benefits for different scales of drought stress and an ideal situation of the full inflow prediction in a dry season it is also critical to reconsider the downstream channel alteration induced by the tgr damming to effectively manage the limited reservoir storage and achieve competitive objectives it should be noted that the modeling method developed in this study can be further extended and applied to solve other multi objective tradeoff problems for optimal reservoir operation and water resources management under climate changes and post dam channel alteration in the future studies a smaller time step can be considered and a smoother pareto optimal curve can be developed for the conflict resolutions the analysis of navigation benefits can also account for the regional economics and the corresponding impacts on the transshipment over dam process with more additional data to find equilibriums on the economic perspectives an extension from the dry season to the entire water year would also be helpful to incorporate the objectives of flood control and the cruise ship navigation benefit 6 data availability statements water inflow outflow and water level data used in this study are available at the three gorges
