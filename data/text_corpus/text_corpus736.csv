3680,estimating groundwater level evolution is a major issue in the context of climate change groundwater is a key resource and can even account in some countries for more than half of the water supply groundwater trend estimates are often used for describing this evolution however the estimated trend obviously strongly depends on available time series length which may be caused by the existence of long term variability of groundwater resources in this paper using a groundwater level database in metropolitan france as an example we address this issue by exploring how much trend estimates are sensitive to low frequency variability of groundwater levels database consists of relatively undisturbed groundwater level time series regarding anthropogenic influence water abstraction by either continuous or periodic pumping frequent changes in trend direction and magnitude are detected according to time series length which can eventually lead to contradictory interpretations of the groundwater resource evolution as presented in first part of this article to assess whether low frequency variability known to originate from climate variability can induce such modifications of trends we explored in a second step the multi time scale variability of groundwater levels using a methodology based on discrete wavelet transform most of the time series displaying changing trends depending on time series length corresponded to aquifers with high amplitude low frequency variability of groundwater levels two predominant low frequency components were detected multi annual 7 years and decadal 17 years we finally examined how much those two low frequency components may affect trend estimates on the longer time period available for this purpose we individually removed each of both components from the original times series by discrete wavelet filtering and re estimated trends in the filtered groundwater level time series the results showed that the groundwater level trends were highly sensitive to the presence of any of these low frequency components which may then strongly influence the estimated trends either by exaggerating or mitigating them these results emphasize that i attributing the estimated trends only to climate change would be hazardous given the large influence of low frequency variability on groundwater level trends ii estimation of trends in hydrological projections resulting from general circulation models gcm outputs in which low frequency variability is not well represented would be subject to strong uncertainty iii a potential change in the amplitude of internal climate variability e g increasing or decreasing low frequency variability in the next decades may lead to substantial changes in groundwater level trends keywords low frequency variability groundwater level trends metropolitan france maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform 1 introduction according to iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2020 the number of scientific publications using the word trend has steadily increased over the past two decades especially in relation to hydroclimatological variables various scientific questions and aims can lead scientists to search for trends in hydrological processes the assessment or forecasting of the qualitative and quantitative evolution of environmental variables such as detecting short to long term increases or decreases are part of this visser et al 2009 giuntoli et al 2013 sakizadeh et al 2019 caporali et al 2020 dudley et al 2020 these questions are related to resource preservation issues in the context of global change for instance the european union s water framework directive is based on this philosophy detect negative trends in water resources streamflow and groundwater levels with the aim of their protection european commission 2009 deterioration of a resource can cause restrictions on freshwater withdrawals in the context of climate change assessing the long term evolution of hydrological variables and associated extremes is a major issue particularly for identifying which parts of this evolution can be attributed to climate change and to anthropogenic forcing massei et al 2020 for groundwater this issue is even more relevant when considering pumping for instance groundwater provides 65 of the water supply in france chataigner and michon 2019 hence the study of long term groundwater level evolution is especially relevant for management purposes and the knowledge of groundwater resource capacity methods for identifying linear or monotonic trends are commonly used for describing changes in hydrological variables stahl et al 2010 lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 blöschl et al 2019 pathak and dodamani 2019 vicente serrano et al 2019 mohanavelu et al 2020 peña angulo et al 2020 although the detection of monotonic trends is a widely used tool for quantifying evolution of hydrological variables its use may still raise questions first they cannot be extrapolated to other study periods and longer or shorter periods regardless of the type of variable considered koutsoyiannis 2006 burn and whitfield 2018 for a given region authors commonly find contradictory or varying results as trends are often not estimated over the same periods a point that is often discussed as a major issue hannaford et al 2013 degefu et al 2019 therefore their non extrapolability makes them poor predictors and unsuitable for forecasting iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2020 second trends commonly reflect long range dependence autocorrelations because of low frequency variability in the hydroclimatic variables of interest iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2020 such variability generated by large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns is the primary source of a misperceived trend as short term periods affected by a trend may actually be part of longer term fluctuations multi temporal trend definition methods have been developed to highlight this dependence of trend assessment on low frequency variability multi annual multidecadal in hydroclimatic variables and to avoid trend misperceptions mccabe and wolock 2002 schmocker fackel and naef 2010 hannaford et al 2013 stojković et al 2014 peña angulo et al 2020 for instance hannaford et al 2013 demonstrated that trend direction and magnitude are highly influenced by interdecadal variability given the influence of interdecadal variability and more generally low frequency variability on the hydrological trends it is crucial to better understand the large scale origin of these fluctuations and how catchments can filter and modify them in this regard gudmundsson et al 2011 indicated that the low frequency variability of runoff directly originates from the large scale atmospheric circulation while the catchments properties control the proportion of variance of low frequency variability in hydrological variables simultaneously a large amount of studies addressed the large scale origins of such variabilities in hydroclimatic variables streamflow precipitation groundwater temperature using climate indices and atmospheric fields massei et al 2010 boé and habets 2014 dieppois et al 2013 dieppois et al 2016 massei et al 2017 neves et al 2019 liesch and wunsch 2019 across the whole metropolitan france area fossa et al 2021 detected 3 yr and 7 yr variabilities in streamflow precipitation and temperature but with fluctuating amplitudes depending on the region at a smaller regional scale particularly in the seine watershed many studies previously highlighted these same two low frequency variabilities in precipitation and streamflow as well as a 17 yr variability massei et al 2007 massei et al 2010 fritier et al 2012 massei and fournier 2012 dieppois et al 2013 massei et al 2017 the north atlantic oscillation nao was described as one significant driver of such temporal signature 7 yr and 17 yr in precipitation and streamflow massei et al 2007 massei et al 2010 later massei et al 2017 highlighted using a composite analysis with sea level pressure slp that the atmospheric pattern associated to the 7 yr variability was not exactly reminiscent of the nao with centers of action actually shifted to the north similarly the pattern associated to 17 yr variability was a spatially extended pattern across the atlantic ocean with lower slp roughly following the gulf stream front this result highlighted that atmospheric patterns associated to 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities are not similar and these atmospheric patterns exhibit centers of action that are not necessarily corresponding to those of established climate indices such as the nao aquifers very often act as rather strong low pass filters leading to high amplitude low frequency variability in groundwater levels in other words aquifers filter out high frequency short term variations of the precipitation input more or less significantly letting only low frequency longer term variations dominate the overall variability of the groundwater level signal some studies also investigated the role played by geological characteristics in controlling the magnitude of these fluctuations in groundwater levels thickness of superficial formations of the vadose zone hydraulic properties of aquifers slimani et al 2009 el janyani et al 2012 velasco et al 2017 in normandy slimani et al 2009 and el janyani et al 2012 identified a significant 7 yr variability in groundwater levels of chalk aquifer consistent with many previous works that had already documented the presence of both 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities and their link to the nao in northern france on precipitation massei et al 2007 or river flow massei et al 2010 2012 2017 later the exact same multi annual and decadal fluctuations were also identified in groundwater levels in great britain rust et al 2019 and on the western european continent liesch and wunsch 2019 neves et al 2019 in this article we specifically addressed the issue of the influence of low frequency variability on groundwater level trend estimates in metropolitan france for instance many changes in trend direction and magnitude were observed depending on the length of time series considered thus leading to completely contradictory conclusions on groundwater level evolutions as exposed in section 3 1 in some surface hydrology studies e g hannaford et al 2013 as mentioned previously such contradictory conclusions were related to low frequency variability therefore as a second step we aimed to determine whether french aquifers concerned by these regular changes in trend direction and magnitude exhibited a significant low frequency variability in groundwater levels in section 3 2 we thus broke down groundwater level signals using discrete wavelet transform and quantified the variance percentage of total signal explained by each time scale of variability finally in a third step we examined if and how low frequency variability influenced trend estimates by filtering out each low frequency component from the original time series using discrete wavelet transform and re estimating trends on filtered time series section 3 3 this last point is particularly important because if the low frequency variability significantly influences the estimated groundwater level trends this has several implications i first regarding the identification of traces of climate change in groundwater levels indeed if the low frequency variability in groundwater levels significantly affects trend estimates it is hazardous to conclude that for instance a decreasing evolution of groundwater levels is directly the result of climate change indeed such trends would then be primarily the result of internal climate variability instead of anthropogenic climate change ii second regarding future projections indeed trend estimates in hydrological projections resulting from gcm outputs in which low frequency variability is not well represented would be subject to strong uncertainty iii third regarding future evolutions indeed a potential change in the amplitude of internal climate variability e g increasing or decreasing low frequency variability in the next decades may lead to substantial changes in groundwater level trends 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 groundwater data for this study we used 215 boreholes in continental france with groundwater level time series being little or not affected by pumping fig 1 they were selected from a brgm database on boreholes not influenced by human activities baulon et al 2020 that was constituted in three steps i a selection of boreholes with time series satisfying criteria of duration minimum amount of data per month maximum length of gaps ii the crossing of pre selected boreholes with other brgm databases on known anthropogenic influences iii numerous visualisations of time series with the hydrogeologists responsible for piezometric networks in order to retain only non influenced boreholes time series of boreholes in this database were initially gathered in the ades database that contains all groundwater data quantity and quality across continental france https ades eaufrance fr the criteria satisfied for selecting groundwater level time series in the database and thus for the present study were the duration of the groundwater level time series must be 30 yr for regions where monitoring history is sufficiently long and 20 yr for regions where monitoring history is shorter the time series must contain a minimum amount of data in a month this minimum amount is divided into two parts a date of sampling frequency change is identified in each time series and the minimum sampling frequency must be at least one datum per month before this date and three data per month after this date the length of consecutive gaps must be 3 yr for time series starting after 1950 and 10 yr for time series starting before 1950 this allows time series in the new database to preserve low frequency variability in the data several gaps in the time series can be allowed if these criteria are respected and if the number of gaps and their lengths are small before data analysis a visual check of the groundwater level time series served to remove or correct erroneous data wishing to qualify the behaviour of water tables by including annual variability we decided to work on monthly averages any missing months in these time series were then filled by linear interpolation before spectral analyses in continental france groundwater level time series in some regions span on a limited historical time period especially in western and southern france hence we decided to focus on two different time spans 1996 2019 and 1976 2019 for all french aquifers the analyses cover the 1996 2019 period ensuring a good trade off between time series length and spatial coverage 215 time series available the longer period spanning 43 years between 1976 and 2019 covered 102 time series in northern france these two periods are referred to as reference periods in our study the selected wells are representative of the various french hydrogeological contexts alluvial sedimentary volcanic and bedrock aquifers but most wells are in sedimentary aquifers primarily in the paris basin and some in the aquitaine basin each well is attached to a hydrogeological area based on the groundwater bodies in the resulting database the seno turonian chalk aquifer of the paris basin is the best represented 60 boreholes followed by jurassic limestone aquifers in lorraine berry and poitou on the rim of the paris basin 19 boreholes and the eocene beauce limestones aquifer 8 boreholes wells in the aquitaine basin mainly capture the jurassic limestone aquifer of the northern part of the basin 7 boreholes and multiple sedimentary hydrogeological formations in the southern part sand limestone 10 boreholes finally most of the wells selected in the rhône valley monitor alluvial and fluvio glacial formations 11 boreholes alluvial aquifers are also well represented in the dataset especially the rhine vosges alluvium 18 boreholes in alsace the garonne alluvium in the toulouse region 3 boreholes and recent alluvium in the mediterranean region 11 boreholes some wells in the central massif are located in volcanic aquifers in various formations with different behaviour of groundwater levels 5 boreholes finally bedrock aquifers are monitored by a few selected wells in the armorican massif 10 boreholes 2 1 2 precipitation data precipitation data used in this study come from the safran reanalysis vidal et al 2010 which provides daily data on an 8 8 km2 mesh covering france from 1958 to 2019 in addition based on meteorological data precipitation p snow temperature and penman monteith potential evapotranspiration pet from the safran reanalysis effective precipitation ep p pet data were computed using a gridded water budget model with 8 km resolution at a daily time step relying on the water budget method of edijatno and michel 1989 the water bugdet method considers that in the water cycle the soil acts as a reservoir caracterized by its water storage capacity edijatno and michel 1989 introduced a quadratic law to progressively empty the soil water reserves and to distribute the positive difference between p and pet between ep and soil storage in the present study the temporal resolution of both precipitation and effective precipitation was set at a monthly time step by using monthly cumulated data 2 2 methods 2 2 1 trends over multiple time series lengths we first estimated groundwater level trends over multiple time series lengths we then determined whether changes in the length of time series affected trend estimates by assessing the stability of trends when comparing the direction and magnitude of trends over decreasing periods the procedure is illustrated in fig 2 a as explained above we split the trend stability analysis into two reference periods 1976 2019 and 1996 2019 corresponding to the best agreements between the spatial distribution of wells and groundwater level time series lengths over northern aquifers 102 boreholes and all of continental france 215 boreholes respectively the 1996 2019 reference period provided an image of the stability of groundwater level trends through whole continental france though over a relatively short period to improve the consistency of the study the 1976 2019 reference period was used for obtaining a longer historical hindsight but covering only northern aquifers due to the data availability to complete the stability analysis we first evaluated the magnitude of trends and their statistical significance over different study periods fig 2a step 1 within the 1976 2019 reference period trends were estimated for all groundwater level time series over six periods 1976 2019 1981 2019 1986 2019 1991 2019 1996 2019 and 2000 2019 within the 1996 2019 reference period groundwater level trends were estimated over two study periods 1996 2019 and 2000 2019 the significance of monotonic trends was determined with a modified mann kendall trend test for autocorrelated data hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 compared to the well known mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall et al 1987 the modified mann kendall trend test considers autocorrelation by correcting probability values p values after accounting for autocorrelation the threshold for statistical significance was set at 5 as we primarily aimed at quantifying changes in groundwater level trends in relation to groundwater stock variation over decreasing time periods which cannot be estimated by the significance value of the modified mann kendall trend test we developed an indicator describing this phenomenon therefore although the statistical significance of trends was also tested in the present study we decided to present only the afore mentioned indicator to develop this indicator we first assessed the magnitude of trends by estimating sen s slope sen 1968 this method was selected as it is less sensitive to outliers than linear regression the slope is defined as the median of the set of slopes calculated between pairs of points to evaluate the relative importance of trends compared to the groundwater stock variation the percentage of decrease or increase in groundwater levels compared to the maximum water level fluctuation wlf was calculated using the following equation 1 percentage o f d e c r e a s e i n c r e a s e se n s s l o p e d u r a t i o n maximum w l f 100 where maximum wlf is the difference between the highest and the lowest groundwater levels measured for a given time series this normalisation of sen s slope by the maximum wlf allowed comparing the magnitude of groundwater trends between aquifers with various water table behaviours and significant differences in their water stock variations the percentages of groundwater level loss gain against maximum wlf were split into five classes according to their magnitude negligible trends between 1 and 1 of maximum wlf moderate upward or downward trends between 1 and 10 or 1 and 10 of the maximum wlf respectively strong upward or downward trends between 10 and 100 or 10 and 100 of the maximum wlf respectively this normalisation was applied to every well for each period analysed the maximum wlf adopted i e that of the two reference periods remained constant from one period to the next as it is a parameter that we used for characterising the groundwater stock variation for each well the trend stability was evaluated by comparing the trend direction and belonging to the above classification for all studied periods fig 2a step 2 for a given borehole the groundwater trend can be stable or unstable in direction we considered a trend direction stable if its direction was constantly upward downward or negligible from one period to another conversely a trend was unstable when its direction fluctuated depending on the study period or whether a trend emerged such as a negligible trend for a given period followed by an upward or downward trend for the next period moreover a direction stable trend can be stable or unstable in magnitude it is stable when the magnitude class does not change between periods and unstable if it does change 2 2 2 groundwater multi timescale variability analysis to determine the importance of low frequency variability in groundwater levels we identified and extracted high to low frequency wavelet components by multiresolution analysis using the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt algorithm like the more common discrete wavelet transform dwt method modwt is an iterative filtering of time series using a series of low and high pass filters producing one high frequency component or wavelet detail and one lower frequency component called approximation or smooth at each scale the smooth component is then further decomposed into a wavelet detail and a smooth component the latter being decomposed again until it can no longer be decomposed the original signal can be reconstructed by summing up all the wavelet details and the last smooth the original signal is then separated into a relatively small number of wavelet components from high to low frequencies which together explain the total variability of the signal for this study the maximum decomposition level used in the modwt was log2 n where n is the length of the time series the least asymmetric symmlet wavelet s20 was used in order to better capture variability at all time scales of sometimes relatively smooth groundwater level time series however unlike dwt modwt was essentially designed to prevent phase shifts in the transform coefficients at all scales by avoiding downsampling reducing by a factor 2 the number of coefficients the signal with increasing scales it results that the computed wavelet and scaling coefficients at each scale remain aligned with the original time series that is the variance explained by these coefficients is located where it truly lies in the time series analysed percival and walden 2000 cornish et al 2003 cornish et al 2006 while not necessarily essential for signal or image processing or numerical compression this property is fundamental for physical interpretation of the wavelet details in multiresolution analysis and has already been used to that purpose in several studies such as percival and mofjeld 1997 massei et al 2017 and pérez ciria et al 2019 the dominant frequency associated with each modwt wavelet detail was calculated by fourier transform of each wavelet detail the modwt also provides the amount of variance or energy explained by each wavelet detail and frequency level the energy percentage of a given wavelet detail expresses the relative importance of this variability in the total signal variability as a result the energy distribution between wavelet details for each well in the database can be extracted and mapped continuous global wavelet spectra were also calculated by averaging the spectral power from the continuous wavelet spectra over time torrence and compo 1998 these analyses used r packages wmtsa constantine and percival 2016 and biwavelet gouhier and grinsted 2012 they were conducted for both reference periods 1976 2019 and 1996 2019 2 2 3 influence of low frequency variability of groundwater levels on trend direction and magnitude the influence of groundwater low frequency variabilities on the trend direction and magnitude was estimated using the modwt method as described in section 2 2 2 summing up all wavelet details and the last smooth rebuilds the original signal based on this assessment we first subtracted the wavelet detail of interest or component corresponding to a specific variability from the original signal i e groundwater level monthly averages fig 2b step 1 we then calculated the sen s slope section 2 2 1 of the filtered signal and normalised it to the maximum wlf of the original signal i e without filtering fig 2b step 2 the interest in keeping a fixed maximum wlf to normalise sen s slopes is to assess only the influence of the removal of the component on the slope and not to assess the influence of the removal of the component combined to variance modification linked to this removal finally we compared the magnitude and direction of the trends between the original and filtered signals to assess the influence of the component on the trend of the original signal this analysis covered both reference periods 1976 2019 and 1996 2019 3 results 3 1 stability of trend directions and magnitudes of groundwater levels in this section we investigate the stability of groundwater level trends that is we aim at determining if trend direction and magnitude change according to the length of time series used for the trend analysis to this end we introduce the notions of trend stability no change in direction or magnitude and instability changes in direction or magnitude over decreasing time periods if trend direction is stable we consider that the length of time series has a minor influence on trend estimate then a conclusion about groundwater level evolution may be drawn conversely if it is unstable the time series length has a significant influence on such estimate then any conclusion regarding groundwater level evolution may not be drawn the trend stability maps for the reference periods 1976 2019 and 1996 2019 are shown on fig 3 from the 1996 2019 reference period some hydrogeological formations show an instability in trend direction positive and negative trend fig 3b these instabilities in trend direction are represented on maps either with a diamond in case of change of sign from a period to another period alterning positive and negative trend or a crossed out circle in case of emerging trend insignificant trend and positive or negative trend these entities are the eocene beauce limestones the seno turonian chalk of artois picardy fig 4 beauval and the jurassic limestones from sarthe to bessin for these entities no conclusions regarding the evolution of groundwater levels can be drawn given the reccurrent change in trend direction according to the length of time series taken into account for the trend analysis conversely the seno turonian chalk of normandy picardy fig 4 goupillières the jurassic limestones of poitou and berry the fluvio glacial formations of the rhône valley fig 4 penol the brittany bedrock champagne and bourgogne chalk exhibit stable trend directions fig 3b for these entities conclusions regarding groundwater level evolution may be drawn they are still downward regardless the study period however if the analysis is conducted over longer periods for hydrogeological entities of northern france particularly for the normandy picardy champagne and bourgogne chalk changes in trend direction or a trend emergence can be detected when changing the time series length fig 3a consequently conclusions regarding the groundwater level evolution drawn for the 1996 2019 reference period are no longer valid for the 1976 2019 reference period since instabilities in trend direction are detected naturally boreholes with trend direction instability between 1996 2019 and 2000 2019 periods are also subject to this instability over longer periods overall the result is not homogeneous within the same hydrogeological unit as we can detect both boreholes with stable and unstable trend directions most boreholes with stable upward or downward trend directions from the shorter reference period 1996 2019 are also stable in magnitude meaning that the importance of slope in relation to groundwater level amplitude does not change class fig 3b dot in the symbol this is the same for the longer reference period 1976 2019 in the western seno turonian chalk of normandy and the lutetian ypresian sands of the paris basin fig 3a overall when stable trend directions are detected from the reference period 1976 2019 for northern france and 1996 2019 for the other regions of france and that conclusions on groundwater level evolutions can be drawn the levels are in the majority decreasing fig 3 the existence of unstable trend directions raises the following question are there low frequency variabilities in groundwater levels that could induce these changes in trend directions and thus influence the trend estimates consequently next section aims to identify the existence and significance of low frequency variability in groundwater level signals 3 2 groundwater level fluctuations across multiple timescales significance and spatial distribution over france in this section we assess the existence significance and spatial distribution of low frequency variability in groundwater level signals over france we aim at determining if the unstable trend directions previously identified could be potentially induced by the existence of low frequency variability in groundwater level signals the energy percentage i e the proportion of the total variance at each timescale of variability can be extracted via modwt and mapped for each groundwater time series fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the energy contained in each spectral component as a function of the hydrogeological entity multi annual 5 12 yr and decadal 12 24 yr variabilities dominate over much of the paris basin from beauce limestones to the seno turonian chalk farther north elsewhere low frequency variability can also prevail over a short period 1996 2019 such as in the fluvio glacial formations of the rhône basin the jurassic limestones of poitou and the alluvial formations of the garonne river increasing the length of the studied period 1976 2019 highlights the prevalence of decadal variability 12 24 yr in groundwater levels in the beauce limestones and in the southern seno turonian chalk of normandy this decadal variability also occurs in significant proportions farther north in the seno turonian chalk of normandy but there its proportion is rather similar to that of the multi annual variability 5 12 yr these observations highlight the inertial nature of water tables in normandy chalk and beauce limestones aquifers fig 6 a and 6b due to their highly capacitive nature particularly in plateau areas roux 2006 in these hydrogeological units groundwater levels depend essentially on recharge from past winters they are particularly sensitive to a succession of dry or wet winters due to the memory effect linked to the regulation power of the water table regeneration of the water table stock spans several successive years with excess winter recharges although these low frequency variabilities multi annual and decadal are substantial components of the total groundwater variability in the seno turonian chalk of the artois picardy region the annual variability explains a larger part of the total groundwater variability than in normandy and picardy fig 5 the groundwater levels on the borders of the seno turonian chalk champagne and bourgogne also display this type of variability but here the annual variability dominates jurassic limestones on the edge of the paris basin from the lorraine region to the berry region also show this predominant annual variability with only a small part of the total variability explained by multi annual and decadal variabilities overall the water tables in these hydrogeological units show a combined behaviour variously significant multi annual to decadal variability is superimposed by prominent annual variability fig 6c and 6d in these aquifers the annual variability is all the more important as their storage capacity decreases with increasing fracturing permeability and proximity to the outlet roux 2006 here groundwater levels strongly depend on infiltrated rainfall during the previous winter while having a memory effect linked to the regulation power of water table annual variability generally becomes predominant in compact highly fractured and low capacitive sedimentary aquifers roux 2006 such as the fissured jurassic limestones of the northern aquitaine basin or in fractured bedrock of brittany figs 5b and 6e in such settings groundwater levels rapidly rise in response to winter rainfall but drop as rapidly as soon as water input stops no typical pattern in the energy distribution is noticeable for alluvial aquifers in france and the dominance of one variability compared to another strongly depends upon the local geological and hydrological context fig 5 boreholes monitoring alluvial formations commonly also monitor the underlying water body in the absence of an impermeable layer consequently the borehole captures the behaviours exhibited by both groundwater bodies hence water tables in alluvial formations can exhibit either an annual multi annual or combined behaviour hydrogeological entities previously described as susceptible to trend direction instabilities are essentially entities for which the water tables display inertial or combined behaviour which means that the existence of a low frequency variability in groundwater levels and in significant proportions could be partly responsible for these instabilities figs 3 and 5 these entities are the normandy picardy chalk the artois picardy chalk the bourgogne and champagne chalk the beauce limestones and the southern jurassic limestones from sarthe to bessin the superposition of all of the global wavelet spectra calculated for each groundwater level time series gives us a synthetic view of the predominant variabilities in groundwater levels of french aquifers fig 7 the three preeminent variabilities in monthly groundwater levels are 1 yr 5 8 yr 7 yr and 12 yr 17 yr the 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities show larger spectral powers and carry the largest part of the low frequency variability in monthly groundwater levels such characteristic variabilities are known to be induced by large scale climatic circulation including the nao and was earlier observed in normandy groundwater levels by slimani et al 2009 and el janyani et al 2012 and in streamflow of the seine river massei et al 2010 later studies highlighted these variabilities in groundwater levels in other countries rust et al 2019 liesch and wunsch 2019 neves et al 2019 since the low frequency variabilities significantly explain groundwater level variability the next section seeks to determine if how and to what extent they influence the estimated trends on the reference periods as the 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities appear to be the predominant low frequencies in groundwater level signals hereafter we provide details on the influence of these two variabilities on groundwater level trends 3 3 influence of groundwater level low frequency variability on trend direction and magnitude in this section we aim at determining the influence of groundwater multi annual 7 yr and decadal 17 yr variabilities on the estimated trends in other words we want to determine whether these low frequency variabilities affect trend estimates and if so whether they aggravate or mitigate the estimated trends on the reference periods to this end we individually removed the detected low frequency components corresponding to multi annual and decadal variabilities and recomputed the trends for the resulting filtered groundwater level signals to assess the effect of such low frequency components on trend magnitude and direction low frequency components to be filtered were chosen based on global wavelet spectra fig 7 for the 1996 2019 reference period only the 7 yr component was filtered from monthly groundwater levels while for the 1976 2019 reference period both 7 yr and 17 yr components were individually filtered figs 8 and 9 figs 8 and 9 show the direction and magnitude of the trend sen s slope maximum wlf ratio of each groundwater time series analysed monthly groundwater levels are in red the 7 yr filtered monthly groundwater levels in grey and the 17 yr filtered groundwater levels in blue only for the 1976 2019 period both figures show the impact of removing a given variability 7 yr or 17 yr on the trend they also indirectly show the influence of a given low frequency variability on unfiltered groundwater level trends by considering the sign of the subtraction between the estimated ratio for unfiltered red and filtered grey or blue groundwater levels nevertheless quantifying the exact contribution of a given variability to unfiltered groundwater level trends is difficult because other low or high frequency variabilities can modulate this contribution for the shorter period 1996 2019 the effect of the 7 yr variability on trends shows a well established spatial pattern throughout france fig 8 in the north for aquifers with inertial or combined behaviour of water tables the 7 yr variability drives levels up in contrast in various southern french aquifers this variability drives groundwater levels down in northern france in chalk sands and eocene limestones of the paris basin we see an accentuation of downward trends fig 10 b goupillières a mitigation of upward trends and reversals in direction from upward to downward trends when the 7 yr variability is filtered from monthly groundwater levels fig 8b1 this effect of removing the 7 yr variability means that in unfiltered original groundwater levels this variability drives groundwater levels upward in other words the 7 yr variability mitigates downward trends and accentuates upward trends the seno turonian chalk of champagne is the only one not displaying this phenomenon around the hydrogeological entities of the paris basin the effect of the 7 yr variability on groundwater levels is more sporadic in southern france we see a reverse pattern from that found in the north fig 8 here removing the 7 yr variability mitigates downward trends fig 10b penol or results in downward trends becoming upward trends fig 8b2 this pattern is observed in all southern hydrogeological units analysed even if locally the removal of the 7 yr variability may have no effect on the trends this non effect could be caused by the fact that the 7 yr variability does not or weakly explain the variability of monthly groundwater levels overall the 7 yr variability drives groundwater levels down in most southern hydrogeological entities in other words the 7 yr variability aggravates downward trends a transitional section between northern and southern patterns can be seen in the jurassic limestones of berry fig 8 here the 7 yr variability can drive groundwater levels upward or downward this transition zone could be attributed to either a transitional climatic zone or a high spatial discrepancy of aquifer properties the 7 yr variability displays a similar pattern for the longer period 1976 2019 as for the shorter one in the paris basin fig 9b removing this variability still results in accentuated downward or mitigated upward trends the main discrepancy compared to the shorter period is due to the fact that in many cases removing the 7 yr variability hardly affects the trend fig 10a goupillières and beauval hence the 7 yr variability either drives groundwater levels upward so mitigates downward trends or has no effect on the trend in the paris basin the seno turonian chalk of champagne also displays this pattern while the upper cretaceous chalk of bourgogne does not the long reference period allows for a robust assessment of the influence of the 17 yr variability on groundwater trends fig 9 as it shows a consistent pattern in hydrogeological units of northern france driving groundwater levels downward so aggravating downward trends the removal of this variability leads to mitigation of downward trends fig 10a goupillières accentuation of upward trends or reversals in trend directions from downward to upward the only hydrogeological unit where the 17 yr variability does not influence the trend is the seno turonian chalk of artois picardy fig 10a beauval fig 10a also shows the importance of the 17 yr variability weakening since the late 2000 s in supporting the trend the trend is largely mitigated when this variability is removed from the monthly groundwater levels at goupillières at beauval this is not the case because the 17 yr variability only accounts for a small part of total variability and therefore has no influence on the trend the degree of influence of a specific variability on the trend can be related to two factors i the proportion of total groundwater variability explained by this variability and ii the length of the time series the greatest influence on trends of removing a specific variability occurs when it accounts for a large part of the total groundwater variability this phenomenon is particularly remarkable in inertial formations for instance removing the 7 yr variability over the 1996 2019 period strongly affects groundwater level trends in beauce limestones seno turonian chalk and fluvio glacial formations in the rhône valley fig 8 as seen earlier the 7 yr variability explains much of the total groundwater variability in these units over the 1996 2019 period fig 5b similarly removing the 17 yr variability over the 1976 2019 period strongly affects groundwater level trends in beauce limestones and southern seno turonian chalk of normandy south of the seine river while this influence weakens farther north until it no longer affects trends in the seno turonian chalk of artois picardy fig 9 this weakening pattern corresponds to a decrease in the significance of the 17 yr variability in monthly groundwater variability from the beauce limestones to the seno turonian chalk of the artois picardy basin farther north fig 5a in addition to the explanatory variance the other major factor that affects the importance of a given variability removal on trends magnitude and direction is the length of the time series thus removing the 7 yr variability over a long period 1976 2019 has less influence on trends than over a shorter period 1996 2019 we see an example of this in the northern part of the seine river in the seno turonian chalk of normandy during the 1976 2019 period the 7 yr variability still explains half of the groundwater level variability fig 5a but its removal from groundwater levels hardly affects trends fig 9 4 discussion in this section we discuss the different items addressed in the section 3 first we discuss how the length of groundwater time series can influence trend estimation and thus conclusions regarding groundwater level evolution we also discuss to what extent it may be related to the presence of low frequency variability in groundwater signals and to what extent the length of groundwater time series is a key parameter to determine the trend origin by trend origin we refer to the physical phenomenon that leads to the groundwater level trend second we discuss the presence of low frequency variability in groundwater levels and the relationship with aquifer and catchments properties finally we discuss the influence of multi annual and decadal variabilities on groundwater trends and compare these results to those obtained for effective precipitation with the aim to determine whether these influences originate from precipitation or whether catchment and aquifer properties disrupt these influences furthermore we develop the implications of such results on the interpretation of estimated groundwater level trends as well as on future evolutions and projections of groundwater levels 4 1 importance of time series length on trend estimates and to discuss the origin of groundwater trends a few studies have previously examined the influence of time series length on the magnitude and statistical significance of hydroclimatic variable trends it emerged that the shorter the study period the greater its magnitude and statistical significance which appeared to be directly linked to low frequency variability hannaford et al 2013 peña angulo et al 2020 the low frequency variability also interferes in the statistical test results with high magnitude trends that may be statistically insignificant but may actually have important implications for water resources morin 2011 fatichi et al 2015 the main method for mitigating the effect of multi annual and multidecadal variabilities on trends is to lengthen the study period as much as possible peña angulo et al 2020 however the main limitation to lengthen the study period comes from the existence of historical data in our case the french piezometric network is relatively young which constrains trend studies to be realised on short periods therefore as much studies burn et al 2012 our trend study is conducted using temporal windows that provide the best compromise between time series length and the spatial coverage of in situ stations we showed that some aquifers exhibiting inertial or combined behaviour of water tables are particularly susceptible to trend direction instabilities alternatively upward and downward when the length of groundwater time series is modified it is therefore difficult to draw a conclusion on the groundwater level evolution shifting trend directions are not specifically inherent to groundwater levels but can also be observed in streamflow and precipitation hannaford et al 2013 stojković et al 2014 espinosa and portela 2020 peña angulo et al 2020 such trends should be interpreted with great care as they may actually correspond to the presence of low frequency variability and do not represent a physically meaningful trend behaviour i e a change in the behaviour of the analyzed phenomenon that may eventually lead to a new yet unknown state for instance as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change or changes in land use however the existence of significant low frequency variability in groundwater levels does not necessarily induce trend direction instabilities as it was observed for some aquifers exhibiting water tables with inertial or combined behaviour in such case with still upward or downward trends regardless the time series length conclusions about groundwater level evolution may be drawn nevertheless observing still upward or downward trends does not allow us to deduce the origin of the trend for instance the detected decreasing trends may be induced either by i the anthropogenic climate change resulting in a decrease in groundwater recharge ii the internal climate variability developed in subsequent paragraphs or iii anthropogenic impacts e g groundwater pumping changes in land cover that may generate a decrease in groundwater recharge internal climate variability i e the low frequency variability may lead to stable trend directions in different ways according our observations not exhaustive first since low frequency variability displays an aperiodic behaviour with regular amplitude modifications consequently trends may be largely guided by these amplitude modifications of low frequency that may lead to a trend direction still upward or downward regardless the length of time series considered developed in section 4 3 second trends detected over relatively short periods may actually be only sections of slower fluctuations consequently the trend direction remains upward or downward regardless the time series length considered since the available length of groundwater level time series is still too short to grasp certain low frequency timescales as fluctuations but they are grasped to be trends so these trends which over short study periods without caution would be imputed easily to climate change may actually only be sections of slower fluctuation from internal climate variability that cannot be evidenced by the length of the study period because large scale atmospheric and oceanic fluctuations are expressed over a wide range of timescales rossi et al 2011 any groundwater trend could be the result of a slower fluctuation for instance the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo oscillates on 60 yr timescales kerr 2000 enfield et al 2001 as mentioned earlier the age of french piezometric networks does not in most cases allow us to grasp such a low frequency timescale as a fluctuation in groundwater levels but it can be grasped to be trend to overcome these drawbacks some studies have used the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method to filter out climate variability in precipitation streamflow or meteorological drought signals and detect non linear trends massei and fournier 2012 sang et al 2014 guo et al 2016 song et al 2020 for instance massei and fournier 2012 concluded that the non linear trend in the daily seine river flow could be related to a larger scale nao fluctuation indicating the reversibility of the phenomenon therefore this highlights the complexity to define whether the trends in hydroclimate variables can be related to climate change or are simply a portion of some low frequency fluctuations of large scale atmospheric or oceanic circulation without considering the anthropogenic impacts which data are often poorly referenced the most limiting factor for distinguishing a climate change origin of the trend from an internal climate variability origin in particular from segments of low frequency fluctuations that may appear as short term trends remains the availability of groundwater level data studies on groundwater level reconstruction might overcome this constraint via for instance deep learning approaches or tree ring based reconstructions vu et al 2021 tegel et al 2020 however disentangling climate change and large scale climate natural variability would still remain difficult even with longer time series as anthropogenic forcing may have already impacted climate variability dong et al 2011 caesar et al 2018 disentangling the determinism of trends in terms of internal climate variability or climate change lies behind the scope of the present study it is rather dedicated to assess how low frequency variability can affect trend estimations owing to the database used the trends possibly detected here cannot result from groundwater abstraction by pumping however as this database does not consider changes in land cover some trends in groundwater levels could then result from such influence involving recharge modifications for instance 4 2 catchment and aquifer properties and their impact on variability time scales of groundwater levels the analysis of the spatial distribution of multi timescale variability revealed the predominance of 1 yr 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities in groundwater levels throughout metropolitan france the 1 yr variability can be explained by the hydrological cycle winter recharge and summer recession while the 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities originate from climatic oceanic large scale variability as already demonstrated by massei et al 2010 massei and fournier 2012 el janyani et al 2012 or more recently rust et al 2019 the present study showed that the significance of the low frequency variability in groundwater levels is highly variable between french hydrogeological entities the low frequency variability can be either predominant in the total variance of groundwater levels or weakly depicted these discrepancies are primarily dependent on intrinsic catchment and aquifer properties such as the permeability and thickness of the unsaturated zone the hydrodynamic properties transmissivity and storage coefficient the aquifer geometry the connection with neighbouring aquifers and river system el janyani et al 2012 rust et al 2018 aquifers constituted of rocks with low matrix porosity and highly fracturated such as limestones and bedrock would tend to exhibit groundwater levels dominated by an annual variability and a weak low frequency variability due to a high diffusivity conversely aquifers with high storage capacity and thickness low transmissivity and significant thickness of superficial formations such as chalk aquifers tend to display groundwater levels dominated by multi annual to decadal variabilities slimani et al 2009 el janyani et al 2012 the exact same behaviour was also recently highlighted by rust et al 2019 in chalk aquifers of great britain however the location in the regional geomorphology valley plateau and hydraulic gradient would exert a strong control on the significance of multi annual and decadal variabilities in groundwater levels el janyani et al 2012 with high amplitude low frequency variations for downgradient piezometers on the contrary piezometers with lower amplitudes of low frequency variations and high amplitudes of annual variations would be generally found at upgradient locations and then not associated to the drainage of large areas of subterranean watersheds such boreholes would then also be located on plateau areas where superficial formations and unsaturated zone are thinner slimani et al 2009 it then turns out that the geomorphological context and properties such as the presence of superficial formations aquifer thickness and transmissivity but also the location within the hydraulic gradient are determinant explanatory factors local conditions would also play a major role in defining the hydrogeological determinism of groundwater level behaviour for instance piezometers located downgradient would correspond to the drainage of a large volume of aquifer and would then display enhanced low frequency behaviour but in karst areas such boreholes are also very likely associated to highly transmissive karst zones the so called output karst that display strong and fast response to precipitation i e favoring high amplitude high frequency variations the influence of such characteristics on the frequency behaviour of groundwater levels has been successfully put in evidence using a physics based modeling approach in the seine watershed schuite et al 2019 on the scale of the whole metropolitan france area however due to the lack of data about physical properties of aquifers and an insufficient gathering of existing data into a database it would be hazardous to get any further into the interpretation of the impact of physical properties on the significance of low frequency variabilities in groundwater levels hence the development of such a database gathering the physical properties of aquifers near boreholes across metropolitan france would be useful for further investigations 4 3 influence of multi annual and decadal variabilities on groundwater trends and comparison with their influence on effective precipitation trends our analyses emphasized the need for long groundwater time series to get better insight into the existence and meaning of trends regarding the presence of low frequency variability extending the groundwater time series period by 20 years revealed a decrease in the influence of multi annual variability 7 yr on trends thus this component only little affected the trend obviously the significance of this influence also depends on the water table behaviour and thus on the relative importance of multi annual or decadal variabilities in the total variance of groundwater levels the more the considered variability multi annual or decadal dominates groundwater levels the more influence it has on the trend we also noted that some trends carried by either the multi annual or decadal variability are caused by changes in the amplitude of the low frequency variabilities over time these regular changes in the variance of low frequency variabilities have been highlighted in many precipitation and streamflow studies fritier et al 2012 dieppois et al 2013 2016 massei et al 2010 2017 in the normandy chalk downward trends detected in groundwater levels seem to be partly related to a weakening of the low frequency variability over time the decadal variability appearing to be the main responsible for these downward trends its removal largely influenced trends they became much smaller in magnitude whereas that of multi annual variability did little or not affect trend magnitude this may also explain the stable downward trends detected in normandy chalk and why changing the time series length has no effect on trend direction in section 3 3 we demonstrated the significant influence of multi annual 7 yr and decadal 17 yr variabilities on groundwater level trends this large influence of such low frequency variabilities on groundwater trends raises the following question is this influence inherent to the aquifer systems or does it influence trends of precipitation and effective precipitation in the same way we thus also analysed these variables to answer this question in all hydrogeological units of the paris basin the decadal variability drives groundwater levels down and thus aggravates downward trends over the 1976 2019 period fig 9 our analyses on precipitation and effective precipitation showed primarily the same influence of decadal variability on precipitation and effective precipitation trends as on groundwater levels fig 11 it drives precipitation levels down attenuating upward trends and accentuating downward trends these consistent results indicate that this influence of decadal variability on groundwater trends is climatologically induced and is not affected by catchment and aquifer systems our study also revealed a reversal of the effect pattern of multi annual variability on trends over the 1996 2019 period between aquifers in northern driving groundwater levels up and southern france driving groundwater levels down fig 8 the analysis of precipitation p data showed that over all of france the influence of multi annual variability on trends is homogeneous it drives precipitation levels down attenuating upward trends and accentuating downward trends fig 12 thus the influence of multi annual variability on trends indicates a reversed pattern between precipitation and groundwater levels in northern france particularly in the paris basin either potential evapotranspiration pet and or aquifer properties may affect the influence of multi annual variability on trends and reverse its effect however we observed a similar influence of multi annual variability on effective precipitation ep trends as on groundwater trends in the paris basin driving effective precipitation levels up fig 13 knowing that ep is equivalent to p pet this result suggests that pet would be responsible for this reversal pattern between precipitation and groundwater levels rather than catchment and aquifer properties in southern france over the 1996 2019 period the influence of multi annual variability is the same on precipitation trends effective precipitation trends and groundwater trends figs 8 12 and 13 it drives levels down by accentuating downward trends attenuating upward trends or reverse trends from upward to downward only the mediterranean region shows atypical results as the multi annual variability drives precipitation and groundwater levels down while driving effective precipitation levels up this indicates that first pet would affect the influence of multi annual variability on trends by reversing the effect between precipitation and effective precipitation and second that catchments and aquifer properties would affect this influence in turn to reverse it again between effective precipitation and groundwater levels to better understand and explain this phenomenon further investigations will be necessary at a regional scale over the longer period of 1976 2019 the influence of multi annual variability on trends of precipitation effective precipitation and groundwater levels is heterogeneous in northern france figs 9 and 11 some regions normandy champagne and artois picardy show a rather consistent influence of multi annual variability on trends regardless of the variable precipitation effective precipitation groundwater levels for these regions the multi annual variability primarily drives levels up attenuating downward trends or accentuating upward trends in other regions however such as bessin beauce and bourgogne the available data indicate different influences of multi annual variability on precipitation effective precipitation and groundwater level trends we will not extend the discussion to these regions because the results showed disparities at the local scale our analysis provides a first insight into the influence of multi annual and decadal variabilities in groundwater levels on estimated trends generally the influence of both low frequency variabilities is also similar on precipitation and effective precipitation trends we observe multi annual and decadal variabilities that aggravate downward trends or mitigate upward trends either in groundwater precipitation and effective precipitation it is known that low frequency variability originating from internal climate variability may modulate anthropogenically driven trends particularly those induced by climate change kingston et al 2020 our result indicates that low frequency variabilities would be able to aggravate trends i e amplify downward trends that might be induced by anthropogenic climate change for regions that are already submitted to regular meteorological and hydrological droughts this result may be particularly alarming such as for the mediterranean region that is defined as an anthropogenic climate change hotspot diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 lionello and scarascia 2018 drobinski et al 2020 tramblay et al 2020 however even if it is accepted that low frequency variability may accentuate attenuate or inverse the long term effects of climate change on hydrological processes fatichi et al 2014 gu et al 2019 massei et al 2020 our methodology in this article does not allow us to obtain residual trends that may be only related to climate change indeed we subtracted individually each low frequency variability to assess their specific influence on trends and consequently there is still some low frequency in residual time series filtered ones on which the trend is re estimated consequently we do not estimate directly the aggravating or mitigating potential of low frequency variability on trends that would be related only to climate change in some areas however discrepancies exist between precipitation and effective precipitation suggesting the possible influence of pet that inverses the effect of multi annual variability on trends over 1996 2019 in the paris basin locally discrepancies can appear between effective precipitation and groundwater levels such as in the beauce area over 1976 2019 due to aquifer properties that significantly filter the multi annual variability which then no longer affects groundwater trends further investigations will be necessary to better understand the processes and physical properties causing the reversal of the influence of low frequency variability on trends between precipitation and groundwater levels the large influence of low frequency variability on estimated groundwater level trends entails several implications first regarding conclusions about traces of climate change in groundwater levels since trends may actually correspond to the presence of low frequency variability and then be primarily the result of internal climate variability instead of anthropogenic climate change second regarding future evolutions of groundwater levels since a potential change in the amplitude of internal climate variability that may also be the consequence of anthropogenic climate change e g increasing or decreasing low frequency variability in the next decades may lead to substantial changes in groundwater level trends consequently the extrapolation of trends estimated over the historical period seems particularly hazardous due to the stochastic and unpredictable behaviour of such low frequency fluctuations third regarding future projections because internal climate variability is often improperly reproduced and is a major source of uncertainties in climate and hydrological projections resulting from gcm outputs terray and boé 2013 qasmi et al 2017 consequently trend estimates resulting from these hydrological projections and in fine resulting from recharge and groundwater level projections would be subject to strong uncertainty 5 conclusion the analysis of groundwater level trends in france showed that a number of aquifers were susceptible to trend direction instabilities i e changes in trend direction according to the length of time series leading to contradictory conclusions about groundwater level evolutions this led to the question of the existence importance and spatial distribution of low frequency variability in groundwater levels of french aquifers groundwater levels were therefore broken down by modwt to estimate the significance of low frequency variabilities in total groundwater level variability it turned out that most of aquifers susceptible to trend direction instabilities exhibit a hydrological variability characterized by a significant low frequency variability they are aquifers with inertial or combined behaviour of water tables given the significant presence of multi annual and decadal variabilities in groundwater levels we aimed to determine if how and to what extent each of these components could affect trend estimates to this end modwt filtering was performed to subtract individually the multi annual or decadal variability from the entire signal and then trends were re estimated on the filtered groundwater level time series the results showed that the groundwater level trends were highly sensitive to the presence of any of these low frequency components which may then strongly influence the estimated trends such results indicate that low frequency variability originating from internal climate variability is capable of attenuating or accentuating groundwater level trends including those that might be associated with climate change in general trend detection is widely used as a tool for assessing changes in groundwater levels nevertheless our study presents features that show that this tool should be used with caution particularly for studying groundwater levels with significant low frequency variability we observed that i trends are highly dependent upon the study period and time series length and cannot be extrapolated ii trends are strongly influenced and guided by low frequency variability and iii trends are often only segments of larger scale fluctuations resulting from large scale atmospheric or oceanic circulation consequently their interpretation and attribution to a physical phenomenon such as climate change vs climate variability remains complex in addition since low frequency variability strongly guides and influences the estimated groundwater level trends potential changes in low frequency variability induced by changes in internal climate variability would necessarily lead to a change in the estimated trends in particular this means that i estimation of trends in hydrological projections resulting from gcm outputs in which low frequency variability is not well respresented would be subject to strong uncertainty ii a potential change in internal climate variability e g increasing or decreasing low frequency variability in the next decades may lead to substantial changes in estimated groundwater level trends consequently future works should focus on assessing the impacts of a potential change in internal climate variability i e low frequency variability on groundwater level trends using different scenarios of amplitude modifications of low frequency variability in addition a sensitivity analysis of the results of this study

3680,estimating groundwater level evolution is a major issue in the context of climate change groundwater is a key resource and can even account in some countries for more than half of the water supply groundwater trend estimates are often used for describing this evolution however the estimated trend obviously strongly depends on available time series length which may be caused by the existence of long term variability of groundwater resources in this paper using a groundwater level database in metropolitan france as an example we address this issue by exploring how much trend estimates are sensitive to low frequency variability of groundwater levels database consists of relatively undisturbed groundwater level time series regarding anthropogenic influence water abstraction by either continuous or periodic pumping frequent changes in trend direction and magnitude are detected according to time series length which can eventually lead to contradictory interpretations of the groundwater resource evolution as presented in first part of this article to assess whether low frequency variability known to originate from climate variability can induce such modifications of trends we explored in a second step the multi time scale variability of groundwater levels using a methodology based on discrete wavelet transform most of the time series displaying changing trends depending on time series length corresponded to aquifers with high amplitude low frequency variability of groundwater levels two predominant low frequency components were detected multi annual 7 years and decadal 17 years we finally examined how much those two low frequency components may affect trend estimates on the longer time period available for this purpose we individually removed each of both components from the original times series by discrete wavelet filtering and re estimated trends in the filtered groundwater level time series the results showed that the groundwater level trends were highly sensitive to the presence of any of these low frequency components which may then strongly influence the estimated trends either by exaggerating or mitigating them these results emphasize that i attributing the estimated trends only to climate change would be hazardous given the large influence of low frequency variability on groundwater level trends ii estimation of trends in hydrological projections resulting from general circulation models gcm outputs in which low frequency variability is not well represented would be subject to strong uncertainty iii a potential change in the amplitude of internal climate variability e g increasing or decreasing low frequency variability in the next decades may lead to substantial changes in groundwater level trends keywords low frequency variability groundwater level trends metropolitan france maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform 1 introduction according to iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2020 the number of scientific publications using the word trend has steadily increased over the past two decades especially in relation to hydroclimatological variables various scientific questions and aims can lead scientists to search for trends in hydrological processes the assessment or forecasting of the qualitative and quantitative evolution of environmental variables such as detecting short to long term increases or decreases are part of this visser et al 2009 giuntoli et al 2013 sakizadeh et al 2019 caporali et al 2020 dudley et al 2020 these questions are related to resource preservation issues in the context of global change for instance the european union s water framework directive is based on this philosophy detect negative trends in water resources streamflow and groundwater levels with the aim of their protection european commission 2009 deterioration of a resource can cause restrictions on freshwater withdrawals in the context of climate change assessing the long term evolution of hydrological variables and associated extremes is a major issue particularly for identifying which parts of this evolution can be attributed to climate change and to anthropogenic forcing massei et al 2020 for groundwater this issue is even more relevant when considering pumping for instance groundwater provides 65 of the water supply in france chataigner and michon 2019 hence the study of long term groundwater level evolution is especially relevant for management purposes and the knowledge of groundwater resource capacity methods for identifying linear or monotonic trends are commonly used for describing changes in hydrological variables stahl et al 2010 lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 blöschl et al 2019 pathak and dodamani 2019 vicente serrano et al 2019 mohanavelu et al 2020 peña angulo et al 2020 although the detection of monotonic trends is a widely used tool for quantifying evolution of hydrological variables its use may still raise questions first they cannot be extrapolated to other study periods and longer or shorter periods regardless of the type of variable considered koutsoyiannis 2006 burn and whitfield 2018 for a given region authors commonly find contradictory or varying results as trends are often not estimated over the same periods a point that is often discussed as a major issue hannaford et al 2013 degefu et al 2019 therefore their non extrapolability makes them poor predictors and unsuitable for forecasting iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2020 second trends commonly reflect long range dependence autocorrelations because of low frequency variability in the hydroclimatic variables of interest iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2020 such variability generated by large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns is the primary source of a misperceived trend as short term periods affected by a trend may actually be part of longer term fluctuations multi temporal trend definition methods have been developed to highlight this dependence of trend assessment on low frequency variability multi annual multidecadal in hydroclimatic variables and to avoid trend misperceptions mccabe and wolock 2002 schmocker fackel and naef 2010 hannaford et al 2013 stojković et al 2014 peña angulo et al 2020 for instance hannaford et al 2013 demonstrated that trend direction and magnitude are highly influenced by interdecadal variability given the influence of interdecadal variability and more generally low frequency variability on the hydrological trends it is crucial to better understand the large scale origin of these fluctuations and how catchments can filter and modify them in this regard gudmundsson et al 2011 indicated that the low frequency variability of runoff directly originates from the large scale atmospheric circulation while the catchments properties control the proportion of variance of low frequency variability in hydrological variables simultaneously a large amount of studies addressed the large scale origins of such variabilities in hydroclimatic variables streamflow precipitation groundwater temperature using climate indices and atmospheric fields massei et al 2010 boé and habets 2014 dieppois et al 2013 dieppois et al 2016 massei et al 2017 neves et al 2019 liesch and wunsch 2019 across the whole metropolitan france area fossa et al 2021 detected 3 yr and 7 yr variabilities in streamflow precipitation and temperature but with fluctuating amplitudes depending on the region at a smaller regional scale particularly in the seine watershed many studies previously highlighted these same two low frequency variabilities in precipitation and streamflow as well as a 17 yr variability massei et al 2007 massei et al 2010 fritier et al 2012 massei and fournier 2012 dieppois et al 2013 massei et al 2017 the north atlantic oscillation nao was described as one significant driver of such temporal signature 7 yr and 17 yr in precipitation and streamflow massei et al 2007 massei et al 2010 later massei et al 2017 highlighted using a composite analysis with sea level pressure slp that the atmospheric pattern associated to the 7 yr variability was not exactly reminiscent of the nao with centers of action actually shifted to the north similarly the pattern associated to 17 yr variability was a spatially extended pattern across the atlantic ocean with lower slp roughly following the gulf stream front this result highlighted that atmospheric patterns associated to 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities are not similar and these atmospheric patterns exhibit centers of action that are not necessarily corresponding to those of established climate indices such as the nao aquifers very often act as rather strong low pass filters leading to high amplitude low frequency variability in groundwater levels in other words aquifers filter out high frequency short term variations of the precipitation input more or less significantly letting only low frequency longer term variations dominate the overall variability of the groundwater level signal some studies also investigated the role played by geological characteristics in controlling the magnitude of these fluctuations in groundwater levels thickness of superficial formations of the vadose zone hydraulic properties of aquifers slimani et al 2009 el janyani et al 2012 velasco et al 2017 in normandy slimani et al 2009 and el janyani et al 2012 identified a significant 7 yr variability in groundwater levels of chalk aquifer consistent with many previous works that had already documented the presence of both 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities and their link to the nao in northern france on precipitation massei et al 2007 or river flow massei et al 2010 2012 2017 later the exact same multi annual and decadal fluctuations were also identified in groundwater levels in great britain rust et al 2019 and on the western european continent liesch and wunsch 2019 neves et al 2019 in this article we specifically addressed the issue of the influence of low frequency variability on groundwater level trend estimates in metropolitan france for instance many changes in trend direction and magnitude were observed depending on the length of time series considered thus leading to completely contradictory conclusions on groundwater level evolutions as exposed in section 3 1 in some surface hydrology studies e g hannaford et al 2013 as mentioned previously such contradictory conclusions were related to low frequency variability therefore as a second step we aimed to determine whether french aquifers concerned by these regular changes in trend direction and magnitude exhibited a significant low frequency variability in groundwater levels in section 3 2 we thus broke down groundwater level signals using discrete wavelet transform and quantified the variance percentage of total signal explained by each time scale of variability finally in a third step we examined if and how low frequency variability influenced trend estimates by filtering out each low frequency component from the original time series using discrete wavelet transform and re estimating trends on filtered time series section 3 3 this last point is particularly important because if the low frequency variability significantly influences the estimated groundwater level trends this has several implications i first regarding the identification of traces of climate change in groundwater levels indeed if the low frequency variability in groundwater levels significantly affects trend estimates it is hazardous to conclude that for instance a decreasing evolution of groundwater levels is directly the result of climate change indeed such trends would then be primarily the result of internal climate variability instead of anthropogenic climate change ii second regarding future projections indeed trend estimates in hydrological projections resulting from gcm outputs in which low frequency variability is not well represented would be subject to strong uncertainty iii third regarding future evolutions indeed a potential change in the amplitude of internal climate variability e g increasing or decreasing low frequency variability in the next decades may lead to substantial changes in groundwater level trends 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 groundwater data for this study we used 215 boreholes in continental france with groundwater level time series being little or not affected by pumping fig 1 they were selected from a brgm database on boreholes not influenced by human activities baulon et al 2020 that was constituted in three steps i a selection of boreholes with time series satisfying criteria of duration minimum amount of data per month maximum length of gaps ii the crossing of pre selected boreholes with other brgm databases on known anthropogenic influences iii numerous visualisations of time series with the hydrogeologists responsible for piezometric networks in order to retain only non influenced boreholes time series of boreholes in this database were initially gathered in the ades database that contains all groundwater data quantity and quality across continental france https ades eaufrance fr the criteria satisfied for selecting groundwater level time series in the database and thus for the present study were the duration of the groundwater level time series must be 30 yr for regions where monitoring history is sufficiently long and 20 yr for regions where monitoring history is shorter the time series must contain a minimum amount of data in a month this minimum amount is divided into two parts a date of sampling frequency change is identified in each time series and the minimum sampling frequency must be at least one datum per month before this date and three data per month after this date the length of consecutive gaps must be 3 yr for time series starting after 1950 and 10 yr for time series starting before 1950 this allows time series in the new database to preserve low frequency variability in the data several gaps in the time series can be allowed if these criteria are respected and if the number of gaps and their lengths are small before data analysis a visual check of the groundwater level time series served to remove or correct erroneous data wishing to qualify the behaviour of water tables by including annual variability we decided to work on monthly averages any missing months in these time series were then filled by linear interpolation before spectral analyses in continental france groundwater level time series in some regions span on a limited historical time period especially in western and southern france hence we decided to focus on two different time spans 1996 2019 and 1976 2019 for all french aquifers the analyses cover the 1996 2019 period ensuring a good trade off between time series length and spatial coverage 215 time series available the longer period spanning 43 years between 1976 and 2019 covered 102 time series in northern france these two periods are referred to as reference periods in our study the selected wells are representative of the various french hydrogeological contexts alluvial sedimentary volcanic and bedrock aquifers but most wells are in sedimentary aquifers primarily in the paris basin and some in the aquitaine basin each well is attached to a hydrogeological area based on the groundwater bodies in the resulting database the seno turonian chalk aquifer of the paris basin is the best represented 60 boreholes followed by jurassic limestone aquifers in lorraine berry and poitou on the rim of the paris basin 19 boreholes and the eocene beauce limestones aquifer 8 boreholes wells in the aquitaine basin mainly capture the jurassic limestone aquifer of the northern part of the basin 7 boreholes and multiple sedimentary hydrogeological formations in the southern part sand limestone 10 boreholes finally most of the wells selected in the rhône valley monitor alluvial and fluvio glacial formations 11 boreholes alluvial aquifers are also well represented in the dataset especially the rhine vosges alluvium 18 boreholes in alsace the garonne alluvium in the toulouse region 3 boreholes and recent alluvium in the mediterranean region 11 boreholes some wells in the central massif are located in volcanic aquifers in various formations with different behaviour of groundwater levels 5 boreholes finally bedrock aquifers are monitored by a few selected wells in the armorican massif 10 boreholes 2 1 2 precipitation data precipitation data used in this study come from the safran reanalysis vidal et al 2010 which provides daily data on an 8 8 km2 mesh covering france from 1958 to 2019 in addition based on meteorological data precipitation p snow temperature and penman monteith potential evapotranspiration pet from the safran reanalysis effective precipitation ep p pet data were computed using a gridded water budget model with 8 km resolution at a daily time step relying on the water budget method of edijatno and michel 1989 the water bugdet method considers that in the water cycle the soil acts as a reservoir caracterized by its water storage capacity edijatno and michel 1989 introduced a quadratic law to progressively empty the soil water reserves and to distribute the positive difference between p and pet between ep and soil storage in the present study the temporal resolution of both precipitation and effective precipitation was set at a monthly time step by using monthly cumulated data 2 2 methods 2 2 1 trends over multiple time series lengths we first estimated groundwater level trends over multiple time series lengths we then determined whether changes in the length of time series affected trend estimates by assessing the stability of trends when comparing the direction and magnitude of trends over decreasing periods the procedure is illustrated in fig 2 a as explained above we split the trend stability analysis into two reference periods 1976 2019 and 1996 2019 corresponding to the best agreements between the spatial distribution of wells and groundwater level time series lengths over northern aquifers 102 boreholes and all of continental france 215 boreholes respectively the 1996 2019 reference period provided an image of the stability of groundwater level trends through whole continental france though over a relatively short period to improve the consistency of the study the 1976 2019 reference period was used for obtaining a longer historical hindsight but covering only northern aquifers due to the data availability to complete the stability analysis we first evaluated the magnitude of trends and their statistical significance over different study periods fig 2a step 1 within the 1976 2019 reference period trends were estimated for all groundwater level time series over six periods 1976 2019 1981 2019 1986 2019 1991 2019 1996 2019 and 2000 2019 within the 1996 2019 reference period groundwater level trends were estimated over two study periods 1996 2019 and 2000 2019 the significance of monotonic trends was determined with a modified mann kendall trend test for autocorrelated data hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 compared to the well known mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall et al 1987 the modified mann kendall trend test considers autocorrelation by correcting probability values p values after accounting for autocorrelation the threshold for statistical significance was set at 5 as we primarily aimed at quantifying changes in groundwater level trends in relation to groundwater stock variation over decreasing time periods which cannot be estimated by the significance value of the modified mann kendall trend test we developed an indicator describing this phenomenon therefore although the statistical significance of trends was also tested in the present study we decided to present only the afore mentioned indicator to develop this indicator we first assessed the magnitude of trends by estimating sen s slope sen 1968 this method was selected as it is less sensitive to outliers than linear regression the slope is defined as the median of the set of slopes calculated between pairs of points to evaluate the relative importance of trends compared to the groundwater stock variation the percentage of decrease or increase in groundwater levels compared to the maximum water level fluctuation wlf was calculated using the following equation 1 percentage o f d e c r e a s e i n c r e a s e se n s s l o p e d u r a t i o n maximum w l f 100 where maximum wlf is the difference between the highest and the lowest groundwater levels measured for a given time series this normalisation of sen s slope by the maximum wlf allowed comparing the magnitude of groundwater trends between aquifers with various water table behaviours and significant differences in their water stock variations the percentages of groundwater level loss gain against maximum wlf were split into five classes according to their magnitude negligible trends between 1 and 1 of maximum wlf moderate upward or downward trends between 1 and 10 or 1 and 10 of the maximum wlf respectively strong upward or downward trends between 10 and 100 or 10 and 100 of the maximum wlf respectively this normalisation was applied to every well for each period analysed the maximum wlf adopted i e that of the two reference periods remained constant from one period to the next as it is a parameter that we used for characterising the groundwater stock variation for each well the trend stability was evaluated by comparing the trend direction and belonging to the above classification for all studied periods fig 2a step 2 for a given borehole the groundwater trend can be stable or unstable in direction we considered a trend direction stable if its direction was constantly upward downward or negligible from one period to another conversely a trend was unstable when its direction fluctuated depending on the study period or whether a trend emerged such as a negligible trend for a given period followed by an upward or downward trend for the next period moreover a direction stable trend can be stable or unstable in magnitude it is stable when the magnitude class does not change between periods and unstable if it does change 2 2 2 groundwater multi timescale variability analysis to determine the importance of low frequency variability in groundwater levels we identified and extracted high to low frequency wavelet components by multiresolution analysis using the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt algorithm like the more common discrete wavelet transform dwt method modwt is an iterative filtering of time series using a series of low and high pass filters producing one high frequency component or wavelet detail and one lower frequency component called approximation or smooth at each scale the smooth component is then further decomposed into a wavelet detail and a smooth component the latter being decomposed again until it can no longer be decomposed the original signal can be reconstructed by summing up all the wavelet details and the last smooth the original signal is then separated into a relatively small number of wavelet components from high to low frequencies which together explain the total variability of the signal for this study the maximum decomposition level used in the modwt was log2 n where n is the length of the time series the least asymmetric symmlet wavelet s20 was used in order to better capture variability at all time scales of sometimes relatively smooth groundwater level time series however unlike dwt modwt was essentially designed to prevent phase shifts in the transform coefficients at all scales by avoiding downsampling reducing by a factor 2 the number of coefficients the signal with increasing scales it results that the computed wavelet and scaling coefficients at each scale remain aligned with the original time series that is the variance explained by these coefficients is located where it truly lies in the time series analysed percival and walden 2000 cornish et al 2003 cornish et al 2006 while not necessarily essential for signal or image processing or numerical compression this property is fundamental for physical interpretation of the wavelet details in multiresolution analysis and has already been used to that purpose in several studies such as percival and mofjeld 1997 massei et al 2017 and pérez ciria et al 2019 the dominant frequency associated with each modwt wavelet detail was calculated by fourier transform of each wavelet detail the modwt also provides the amount of variance or energy explained by each wavelet detail and frequency level the energy percentage of a given wavelet detail expresses the relative importance of this variability in the total signal variability as a result the energy distribution between wavelet details for each well in the database can be extracted and mapped continuous global wavelet spectra were also calculated by averaging the spectral power from the continuous wavelet spectra over time torrence and compo 1998 these analyses used r packages wmtsa constantine and percival 2016 and biwavelet gouhier and grinsted 2012 they were conducted for both reference periods 1976 2019 and 1996 2019 2 2 3 influence of low frequency variability of groundwater levels on trend direction and magnitude the influence of groundwater low frequency variabilities on the trend direction and magnitude was estimated using the modwt method as described in section 2 2 2 summing up all wavelet details and the last smooth rebuilds the original signal based on this assessment we first subtracted the wavelet detail of interest or component corresponding to a specific variability from the original signal i e groundwater level monthly averages fig 2b step 1 we then calculated the sen s slope section 2 2 1 of the filtered signal and normalised it to the maximum wlf of the original signal i e without filtering fig 2b step 2 the interest in keeping a fixed maximum wlf to normalise sen s slopes is to assess only the influence of the removal of the component on the slope and not to assess the influence of the removal of the component combined to variance modification linked to this removal finally we compared the magnitude and direction of the trends between the original and filtered signals to assess the influence of the component on the trend of the original signal this analysis covered both reference periods 1976 2019 and 1996 2019 3 results 3 1 stability of trend directions and magnitudes of groundwater levels in this section we investigate the stability of groundwater level trends that is we aim at determining if trend direction and magnitude change according to the length of time series used for the trend analysis to this end we introduce the notions of trend stability no change in direction or magnitude and instability changes in direction or magnitude over decreasing time periods if trend direction is stable we consider that the length of time series has a minor influence on trend estimate then a conclusion about groundwater level evolution may be drawn conversely if it is unstable the time series length has a significant influence on such estimate then any conclusion regarding groundwater level evolution may not be drawn the trend stability maps for the reference periods 1976 2019 and 1996 2019 are shown on fig 3 from the 1996 2019 reference period some hydrogeological formations show an instability in trend direction positive and negative trend fig 3b these instabilities in trend direction are represented on maps either with a diamond in case of change of sign from a period to another period alterning positive and negative trend or a crossed out circle in case of emerging trend insignificant trend and positive or negative trend these entities are the eocene beauce limestones the seno turonian chalk of artois picardy fig 4 beauval and the jurassic limestones from sarthe to bessin for these entities no conclusions regarding the evolution of groundwater levels can be drawn given the reccurrent change in trend direction according to the length of time series taken into account for the trend analysis conversely the seno turonian chalk of normandy picardy fig 4 goupillières the jurassic limestones of poitou and berry the fluvio glacial formations of the rhône valley fig 4 penol the brittany bedrock champagne and bourgogne chalk exhibit stable trend directions fig 3b for these entities conclusions regarding groundwater level evolution may be drawn they are still downward regardless the study period however if the analysis is conducted over longer periods for hydrogeological entities of northern france particularly for the normandy picardy champagne and bourgogne chalk changes in trend direction or a trend emergence can be detected when changing the time series length fig 3a consequently conclusions regarding the groundwater level evolution drawn for the 1996 2019 reference period are no longer valid for the 1976 2019 reference period since instabilities in trend direction are detected naturally boreholes with trend direction instability between 1996 2019 and 2000 2019 periods are also subject to this instability over longer periods overall the result is not homogeneous within the same hydrogeological unit as we can detect both boreholes with stable and unstable trend directions most boreholes with stable upward or downward trend directions from the shorter reference period 1996 2019 are also stable in magnitude meaning that the importance of slope in relation to groundwater level amplitude does not change class fig 3b dot in the symbol this is the same for the longer reference period 1976 2019 in the western seno turonian chalk of normandy and the lutetian ypresian sands of the paris basin fig 3a overall when stable trend directions are detected from the reference period 1976 2019 for northern france and 1996 2019 for the other regions of france and that conclusions on groundwater level evolutions can be drawn the levels are in the majority decreasing fig 3 the existence of unstable trend directions raises the following question are there low frequency variabilities in groundwater levels that could induce these changes in trend directions and thus influence the trend estimates consequently next section aims to identify the existence and significance of low frequency variability in groundwater level signals 3 2 groundwater level fluctuations across multiple timescales significance and spatial distribution over france in this section we assess the existence significance and spatial distribution of low frequency variability in groundwater level signals over france we aim at determining if the unstable trend directions previously identified could be potentially induced by the existence of low frequency variability in groundwater level signals the energy percentage i e the proportion of the total variance at each timescale of variability can be extracted via modwt and mapped for each groundwater time series fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the energy contained in each spectral component as a function of the hydrogeological entity multi annual 5 12 yr and decadal 12 24 yr variabilities dominate over much of the paris basin from beauce limestones to the seno turonian chalk farther north elsewhere low frequency variability can also prevail over a short period 1996 2019 such as in the fluvio glacial formations of the rhône basin the jurassic limestones of poitou and the alluvial formations of the garonne river increasing the length of the studied period 1976 2019 highlights the prevalence of decadal variability 12 24 yr in groundwater levels in the beauce limestones and in the southern seno turonian chalk of normandy this decadal variability also occurs in significant proportions farther north in the seno turonian chalk of normandy but there its proportion is rather similar to that of the multi annual variability 5 12 yr these observations highlight the inertial nature of water tables in normandy chalk and beauce limestones aquifers fig 6 a and 6b due to their highly capacitive nature particularly in plateau areas roux 2006 in these hydrogeological units groundwater levels depend essentially on recharge from past winters they are particularly sensitive to a succession of dry or wet winters due to the memory effect linked to the regulation power of the water table regeneration of the water table stock spans several successive years with excess winter recharges although these low frequency variabilities multi annual and decadal are substantial components of the total groundwater variability in the seno turonian chalk of the artois picardy region the annual variability explains a larger part of the total groundwater variability than in normandy and picardy fig 5 the groundwater levels on the borders of the seno turonian chalk champagne and bourgogne also display this type of variability but here the annual variability dominates jurassic limestones on the edge of the paris basin from the lorraine region to the berry region also show this predominant annual variability with only a small part of the total variability explained by multi annual and decadal variabilities overall the water tables in these hydrogeological units show a combined behaviour variously significant multi annual to decadal variability is superimposed by prominent annual variability fig 6c and 6d in these aquifers the annual variability is all the more important as their storage capacity decreases with increasing fracturing permeability and proximity to the outlet roux 2006 here groundwater levels strongly depend on infiltrated rainfall during the previous winter while having a memory effect linked to the regulation power of water table annual variability generally becomes predominant in compact highly fractured and low capacitive sedimentary aquifers roux 2006 such as the fissured jurassic limestones of the northern aquitaine basin or in fractured bedrock of brittany figs 5b and 6e in such settings groundwater levels rapidly rise in response to winter rainfall but drop as rapidly as soon as water input stops no typical pattern in the energy distribution is noticeable for alluvial aquifers in france and the dominance of one variability compared to another strongly depends upon the local geological and hydrological context fig 5 boreholes monitoring alluvial formations commonly also monitor the underlying water body in the absence of an impermeable layer consequently the borehole captures the behaviours exhibited by both groundwater bodies hence water tables in alluvial formations can exhibit either an annual multi annual or combined behaviour hydrogeological entities previously described as susceptible to trend direction instabilities are essentially entities for which the water tables display inertial or combined behaviour which means that the existence of a low frequency variability in groundwater levels and in significant proportions could be partly responsible for these instabilities figs 3 and 5 these entities are the normandy picardy chalk the artois picardy chalk the bourgogne and champagne chalk the beauce limestones and the southern jurassic limestones from sarthe to bessin the superposition of all of the global wavelet spectra calculated for each groundwater level time series gives us a synthetic view of the predominant variabilities in groundwater levels of french aquifers fig 7 the three preeminent variabilities in monthly groundwater levels are 1 yr 5 8 yr 7 yr and 12 yr 17 yr the 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities show larger spectral powers and carry the largest part of the low frequency variability in monthly groundwater levels such characteristic variabilities are known to be induced by large scale climatic circulation including the nao and was earlier observed in normandy groundwater levels by slimani et al 2009 and el janyani et al 2012 and in streamflow of the seine river massei et al 2010 later studies highlighted these variabilities in groundwater levels in other countries rust et al 2019 liesch and wunsch 2019 neves et al 2019 since the low frequency variabilities significantly explain groundwater level variability the next section seeks to determine if how and to what extent they influence the estimated trends on the reference periods as the 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities appear to be the predominant low frequencies in groundwater level signals hereafter we provide details on the influence of these two variabilities on groundwater level trends 3 3 influence of groundwater level low frequency variability on trend direction and magnitude in this section we aim at determining the influence of groundwater multi annual 7 yr and decadal 17 yr variabilities on the estimated trends in other words we want to determine whether these low frequency variabilities affect trend estimates and if so whether they aggravate or mitigate the estimated trends on the reference periods to this end we individually removed the detected low frequency components corresponding to multi annual and decadal variabilities and recomputed the trends for the resulting filtered groundwater level signals to assess the effect of such low frequency components on trend magnitude and direction low frequency components to be filtered were chosen based on global wavelet spectra fig 7 for the 1996 2019 reference period only the 7 yr component was filtered from monthly groundwater levels while for the 1976 2019 reference period both 7 yr and 17 yr components were individually filtered figs 8 and 9 figs 8 and 9 show the direction and magnitude of the trend sen s slope maximum wlf ratio of each groundwater time series analysed monthly groundwater levels are in red the 7 yr filtered monthly groundwater levels in grey and the 17 yr filtered groundwater levels in blue only for the 1976 2019 period both figures show the impact of removing a given variability 7 yr or 17 yr on the trend they also indirectly show the influence of a given low frequency variability on unfiltered groundwater level trends by considering the sign of the subtraction between the estimated ratio for unfiltered red and filtered grey or blue groundwater levels nevertheless quantifying the exact contribution of a given variability to unfiltered groundwater level trends is difficult because other low or high frequency variabilities can modulate this contribution for the shorter period 1996 2019 the effect of the 7 yr variability on trends shows a well established spatial pattern throughout france fig 8 in the north for aquifers with inertial or combined behaviour of water tables the 7 yr variability drives levels up in contrast in various southern french aquifers this variability drives groundwater levels down in northern france in chalk sands and eocene limestones of the paris basin we see an accentuation of downward trends fig 10 b goupillières a mitigation of upward trends and reversals in direction from upward to downward trends when the 7 yr variability is filtered from monthly groundwater levels fig 8b1 this effect of removing the 7 yr variability means that in unfiltered original groundwater levels this variability drives groundwater levels upward in other words the 7 yr variability mitigates downward trends and accentuates upward trends the seno turonian chalk of champagne is the only one not displaying this phenomenon around the hydrogeological entities of the paris basin the effect of the 7 yr variability on groundwater levels is more sporadic in southern france we see a reverse pattern from that found in the north fig 8 here removing the 7 yr variability mitigates downward trends fig 10b penol or results in downward trends becoming upward trends fig 8b2 this pattern is observed in all southern hydrogeological units analysed even if locally the removal of the 7 yr variability may have no effect on the trends this non effect could be caused by the fact that the 7 yr variability does not or weakly explain the variability of monthly groundwater levels overall the 7 yr variability drives groundwater levels down in most southern hydrogeological entities in other words the 7 yr variability aggravates downward trends a transitional section between northern and southern patterns can be seen in the jurassic limestones of berry fig 8 here the 7 yr variability can drive groundwater levels upward or downward this transition zone could be attributed to either a transitional climatic zone or a high spatial discrepancy of aquifer properties the 7 yr variability displays a similar pattern for the longer period 1976 2019 as for the shorter one in the paris basin fig 9b removing this variability still results in accentuated downward or mitigated upward trends the main discrepancy compared to the shorter period is due to the fact that in many cases removing the 7 yr variability hardly affects the trend fig 10a goupillières and beauval hence the 7 yr variability either drives groundwater levels upward so mitigates downward trends or has no effect on the trend in the paris basin the seno turonian chalk of champagne also displays this pattern while the upper cretaceous chalk of bourgogne does not the long reference period allows for a robust assessment of the influence of the 17 yr variability on groundwater trends fig 9 as it shows a consistent pattern in hydrogeological units of northern france driving groundwater levels downward so aggravating downward trends the removal of this variability leads to mitigation of downward trends fig 10a goupillières accentuation of upward trends or reversals in trend directions from downward to upward the only hydrogeological unit where the 17 yr variability does not influence the trend is the seno turonian chalk of artois picardy fig 10a beauval fig 10a also shows the importance of the 17 yr variability weakening since the late 2000 s in supporting the trend the trend is largely mitigated when this variability is removed from the monthly groundwater levels at goupillières at beauval this is not the case because the 17 yr variability only accounts for a small part of total variability and therefore has no influence on the trend the degree of influence of a specific variability on the trend can be related to two factors i the proportion of total groundwater variability explained by this variability and ii the length of the time series the greatest influence on trends of removing a specific variability occurs when it accounts for a large part of the total groundwater variability this phenomenon is particularly remarkable in inertial formations for instance removing the 7 yr variability over the 1996 2019 period strongly affects groundwater level trends in beauce limestones seno turonian chalk and fluvio glacial formations in the rhône valley fig 8 as seen earlier the 7 yr variability explains much of the total groundwater variability in these units over the 1996 2019 period fig 5b similarly removing the 17 yr variability over the 1976 2019 period strongly affects groundwater level trends in beauce limestones and southern seno turonian chalk of normandy south of the seine river while this influence weakens farther north until it no longer affects trends in the seno turonian chalk of artois picardy fig 9 this weakening pattern corresponds to a decrease in the significance of the 17 yr variability in monthly groundwater variability from the beauce limestones to the seno turonian chalk of the artois picardy basin farther north fig 5a in addition to the explanatory variance the other major factor that affects the importance of a given variability removal on trends magnitude and direction is the length of the time series thus removing the 7 yr variability over a long period 1976 2019 has less influence on trends than over a shorter period 1996 2019 we see an example of this in the northern part of the seine river in the seno turonian chalk of normandy during the 1976 2019 period the 7 yr variability still explains half of the groundwater level variability fig 5a but its removal from groundwater levels hardly affects trends fig 9 4 discussion in this section we discuss the different items addressed in the section 3 first we discuss how the length of groundwater time series can influence trend estimation and thus conclusions regarding groundwater level evolution we also discuss to what extent it may be related to the presence of low frequency variability in groundwater signals and to what extent the length of groundwater time series is a key parameter to determine the trend origin by trend origin we refer to the physical phenomenon that leads to the groundwater level trend second we discuss the presence of low frequency variability in groundwater levels and the relationship with aquifer and catchments properties finally we discuss the influence of multi annual and decadal variabilities on groundwater trends and compare these results to those obtained for effective precipitation with the aim to determine whether these influences originate from precipitation or whether catchment and aquifer properties disrupt these influences furthermore we develop the implications of such results on the interpretation of estimated groundwater level trends as well as on future evolutions and projections of groundwater levels 4 1 importance of time series length on trend estimates and to discuss the origin of groundwater trends a few studies have previously examined the influence of time series length on the magnitude and statistical significance of hydroclimatic variable trends it emerged that the shorter the study period the greater its magnitude and statistical significance which appeared to be directly linked to low frequency variability hannaford et al 2013 peña angulo et al 2020 the low frequency variability also interferes in the statistical test results with high magnitude trends that may be statistically insignificant but may actually have important implications for water resources morin 2011 fatichi et al 2015 the main method for mitigating the effect of multi annual and multidecadal variabilities on trends is to lengthen the study period as much as possible peña angulo et al 2020 however the main limitation to lengthen the study period comes from the existence of historical data in our case the french piezometric network is relatively young which constrains trend studies to be realised on short periods therefore as much studies burn et al 2012 our trend study is conducted using temporal windows that provide the best compromise between time series length and the spatial coverage of in situ stations we showed that some aquifers exhibiting inertial or combined behaviour of water tables are particularly susceptible to trend direction instabilities alternatively upward and downward when the length of groundwater time series is modified it is therefore difficult to draw a conclusion on the groundwater level evolution shifting trend directions are not specifically inherent to groundwater levels but can also be observed in streamflow and precipitation hannaford et al 2013 stojković et al 2014 espinosa and portela 2020 peña angulo et al 2020 such trends should be interpreted with great care as they may actually correspond to the presence of low frequency variability and do not represent a physically meaningful trend behaviour i e a change in the behaviour of the analyzed phenomenon that may eventually lead to a new yet unknown state for instance as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change or changes in land use however the existence of significant low frequency variability in groundwater levels does not necessarily induce trend direction instabilities as it was observed for some aquifers exhibiting water tables with inertial or combined behaviour in such case with still upward or downward trends regardless the time series length conclusions about groundwater level evolution may be drawn nevertheless observing still upward or downward trends does not allow us to deduce the origin of the trend for instance the detected decreasing trends may be induced either by i the anthropogenic climate change resulting in a decrease in groundwater recharge ii the internal climate variability developed in subsequent paragraphs or iii anthropogenic impacts e g groundwater pumping changes in land cover that may generate a decrease in groundwater recharge internal climate variability i e the low frequency variability may lead to stable trend directions in different ways according our observations not exhaustive first since low frequency variability displays an aperiodic behaviour with regular amplitude modifications consequently trends may be largely guided by these amplitude modifications of low frequency that may lead to a trend direction still upward or downward regardless the length of time series considered developed in section 4 3 second trends detected over relatively short periods may actually be only sections of slower fluctuations consequently the trend direction remains upward or downward regardless the time series length considered since the available length of groundwater level time series is still too short to grasp certain low frequency timescales as fluctuations but they are grasped to be trends so these trends which over short study periods without caution would be imputed easily to climate change may actually only be sections of slower fluctuation from internal climate variability that cannot be evidenced by the length of the study period because large scale atmospheric and oceanic fluctuations are expressed over a wide range of timescales rossi et al 2011 any groundwater trend could be the result of a slower fluctuation for instance the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo oscillates on 60 yr timescales kerr 2000 enfield et al 2001 as mentioned earlier the age of french piezometric networks does not in most cases allow us to grasp such a low frequency timescale as a fluctuation in groundwater levels but it can be grasped to be trend to overcome these drawbacks some studies have used the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method to filter out climate variability in precipitation streamflow or meteorological drought signals and detect non linear trends massei and fournier 2012 sang et al 2014 guo et al 2016 song et al 2020 for instance massei and fournier 2012 concluded that the non linear trend in the daily seine river flow could be related to a larger scale nao fluctuation indicating the reversibility of the phenomenon therefore this highlights the complexity to define whether the trends in hydroclimate variables can be related to climate change or are simply a portion of some low frequency fluctuations of large scale atmospheric or oceanic circulation without considering the anthropogenic impacts which data are often poorly referenced the most limiting factor for distinguishing a climate change origin of the trend from an internal climate variability origin in particular from segments of low frequency fluctuations that may appear as short term trends remains the availability of groundwater level data studies on groundwater level reconstruction might overcome this constraint via for instance deep learning approaches or tree ring based reconstructions vu et al 2021 tegel et al 2020 however disentangling climate change and large scale climate natural variability would still remain difficult even with longer time series as anthropogenic forcing may have already impacted climate variability dong et al 2011 caesar et al 2018 disentangling the determinism of trends in terms of internal climate variability or climate change lies behind the scope of the present study it is rather dedicated to assess how low frequency variability can affect trend estimations owing to the database used the trends possibly detected here cannot result from groundwater abstraction by pumping however as this database does not consider changes in land cover some trends in groundwater levels could then result from such influence involving recharge modifications for instance 4 2 catchment and aquifer properties and their impact on variability time scales of groundwater levels the analysis of the spatial distribution of multi timescale variability revealed the predominance of 1 yr 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities in groundwater levels throughout metropolitan france the 1 yr variability can be explained by the hydrological cycle winter recharge and summer recession while the 7 yr and 17 yr variabilities originate from climatic oceanic large scale variability as already demonstrated by massei et al 2010 massei and fournier 2012 el janyani et al 2012 or more recently rust et al 2019 the present study showed that the significance of the low frequency variability in groundwater levels is highly variable between french hydrogeological entities the low frequency variability can be either predominant in the total variance of groundwater levels or weakly depicted these discrepancies are primarily dependent on intrinsic catchment and aquifer properties such as the permeability and thickness of the unsaturated zone the hydrodynamic properties transmissivity and storage coefficient the aquifer geometry the connection with neighbouring aquifers and river system el janyani et al 2012 rust et al 2018 aquifers constituted of rocks with low matrix porosity and highly fracturated such as limestones and bedrock would tend to exhibit groundwater levels dominated by an annual variability and a weak low frequency variability due to a high diffusivity conversely aquifers with high storage capacity and thickness low transmissivity and significant thickness of superficial formations such as chalk aquifers tend to display groundwater levels dominated by multi annual to decadal variabilities slimani et al 2009 el janyani et al 2012 the exact same behaviour was also recently highlighted by rust et al 2019 in chalk aquifers of great britain however the location in the regional geomorphology valley plateau and hydraulic gradient would exert a strong control on the significance of multi annual and decadal variabilities in groundwater levels el janyani et al 2012 with high amplitude low frequency variations for downgradient piezometers on the contrary piezometers with lower amplitudes of low frequency variations and high amplitudes of annual variations would be generally found at upgradient locations and then not associated to the drainage of large areas of subterranean watersheds such boreholes would then also be located on plateau areas where superficial formations and unsaturated zone are thinner slimani et al 2009 it then turns out that the geomorphological context and properties such as the presence of superficial formations aquifer thickness and transmissivity but also the location within the hydraulic gradient are determinant explanatory factors local conditions would also play a major role in defining the hydrogeological determinism of groundwater level behaviour for instance piezometers located downgradient would correspond to the drainage of a large volume of aquifer and would then display enhanced low frequency behaviour but in karst areas such boreholes are also very likely associated to highly transmissive karst zones the so called output karst that display strong and fast response to precipitation i e favoring high amplitude high frequency variations the influence of such characteristics on the frequency behaviour of groundwater levels has been successfully put in evidence using a physics based modeling approach in the seine watershed schuite et al 2019 on the scale of the whole metropolitan france area however due to the lack of data about physical properties of aquifers and an insufficient gathering of existing data into a database it would be hazardous to get any further into the interpretation of the impact of physical properties on the significance of low frequency variabilities in groundwater levels hence the development of such a database gathering the physical properties of aquifers near boreholes across metropolitan france would be useful for further investigations 4 3 influence of multi annual and decadal variabilities on groundwater trends and comparison with their influence on effective precipitation trends our analyses emphasized the need for long groundwater time series to get better insight into the existence and meaning of trends regarding the presence of low frequency variability extending the groundwater time series period by 20 years revealed a decrease in the influence of multi annual variability 7 yr on trends thus this component only little affected the trend obviously the significance of this influence also depends on the water table behaviour and thus on the relative importance of multi annual or decadal variabilities in the total variance of groundwater levels the more the considered variability multi annual or decadal dominates groundwater levels the more influence it has on the trend we also noted that some trends carried by either the multi annual or decadal variability are caused by changes in the amplitude of the low frequency variabilities over time these regular changes in the variance of low frequency variabilities have been highlighted in many precipitation and streamflow studies fritier et al 2012 dieppois et al 2013 2016 massei et al 2010 2017 in the normandy chalk downward trends detected in groundwater levels seem to be partly related to a weakening of the low frequency variability over time the decadal variability appearing to be the main responsible for these downward trends its removal largely influenced trends they became much smaller in magnitude whereas that of multi annual variability did little or not affect trend magnitude this may also explain the stable downward trends detected in normandy chalk and why changing the time series length has no effect on trend direction in section 3 3 we demonstrated the significant influence of multi annual 7 yr and decadal 17 yr variabilities on groundwater level trends this large influence of such low frequency variabilities on groundwater trends raises the following question is this influence inherent to the aquifer systems or does it influence trends of precipitation and effective precipitation in the same way we thus also analysed these variables to answer this question in all hydrogeological units of the paris basin the decadal variability drives groundwater levels down and thus aggravates downward trends over the 1976 2019 period fig 9 our analyses on precipitation and effective precipitation showed primarily the same influence of decadal variability on precipitation and effective precipitation trends as on groundwater levels fig 11 it drives precipitation levels down attenuating upward trends and accentuating downward trends these consistent results indicate that this influence of decadal variability on groundwater trends is climatologically induced and is not affected by catchment and aquifer systems our study also revealed a reversal of the effect pattern of multi annual variability on trends over the 1996 2019 period between aquifers in northern driving groundwater levels up and southern france driving groundwater levels down fig 8 the analysis of precipitation p data showed that over all of france the influence of multi annual variability on trends is homogeneous it drives precipitation levels down attenuating upward trends and accentuating downward trends fig 12 thus the influence of multi annual variability on trends indicates a reversed pattern between precipitation and groundwater levels in northern france particularly in the paris basin either potential evapotranspiration pet and or aquifer properties may affect the influence of multi annual variability on trends and reverse its effect however we observed a similar influence of multi annual variability on effective precipitation ep trends as on groundwater trends in the paris basin driving effective precipitation levels up fig 13 knowing that ep is equivalent to p pet this result suggests that pet would be responsible for this reversal pattern between precipitation and groundwater levels rather than catchment and aquifer properties in southern france over the 1996 2019 period the influence of multi annual variability is the same on precipitation trends effective precipitation trends and groundwater trends figs 8 12 and 13 it drives levels down by accentuating downward trends attenuating upward trends or reverse trends from upward to downward only the mediterranean region shows atypical results as the multi annual variability drives precipitation and groundwater levels down while driving effective precipitation levels up this indicates that first pet would affect the influence of multi annual variability on trends by reversing the effect between precipitation and effective precipitation and second that catchments and aquifer properties would affect this influence in turn to reverse it again between effective precipitation and groundwater levels to better understand and explain this phenomenon further investigations will be necessary at a regional scale over the longer period of 1976 2019 the influence of multi annual variability on trends of precipitation effective precipitation and groundwater levels is heterogeneous in northern france figs 9 and 11 some regions normandy champagne and artois picardy show a rather consistent influence of multi annual variability on trends regardless of the variable precipitation effective precipitation groundwater levels for these regions the multi annual variability primarily drives levels up attenuating downward trends or accentuating upward trends in other regions however such as bessin beauce and bourgogne the available data indicate different influences of multi annual variability on precipitation effective precipitation and groundwater level trends we will not extend the discussion to these regions because the results showed disparities at the local scale our analysis provides a first insight into the influence of multi annual and decadal variabilities in groundwater levels on estimated trends generally the influence of both low frequency variabilities is also similar on precipitation and effective precipitation trends we observe multi annual and decadal variabilities that aggravate downward trends or mitigate upward trends either in groundwater precipitation and effective precipitation it is known that low frequency variability originating from internal climate variability may modulate anthropogenically driven trends particularly those induced by climate change kingston et al 2020 our result indicates that low frequency variabilities would be able to aggravate trends i e amplify downward trends that might be induced by anthropogenic climate change for regions that are already submitted to regular meteorological and hydrological droughts this result may be particularly alarming such as for the mediterranean region that is defined as an anthropogenic climate change hotspot diffenbaugh and giorgi 2012 lionello and scarascia 2018 drobinski et al 2020 tramblay et al 2020 however even if it is accepted that low frequency variability may accentuate attenuate or inverse the long term effects of climate change on hydrological processes fatichi et al 2014 gu et al 2019 massei et al 2020 our methodology in this article does not allow us to obtain residual trends that may be only related to climate change indeed we subtracted individually each low frequency variability to assess their specific influence on trends and consequently there is still some low frequency in residual time series filtered ones on which the trend is re estimated consequently we do not estimate directly the aggravating or mitigating potential of low frequency variability on trends that would be related only to climate change in some areas however discrepancies exist between precipitation and effective precipitation suggesting the possible influence of pet that inverses the effect of multi annual variability on trends over 1996 2019 in the paris basin locally discrepancies can appear between effective precipitation and groundwater levels such as in the beauce area over 1976 2019 due to aquifer properties that significantly filter the multi annual variability which then no longer affects groundwater trends further investigations will be necessary to better understand the processes and physical properties causing the reversal of the influence of low frequency variability on trends between precipitation and groundwater levels the large influence of low frequency variability on estimated groundwater level trends entails several implications first regarding conclusions about traces of climate change in groundwater levels since trends may actually correspond to the presence of low frequency variability and then be primarily the result of internal climate variability instead of anthropogenic climate change second regarding future evolutions of groundwater levels since a potential change in the amplitude of internal climate variability that may also be the consequence of anthropogenic climate change e g increasing or decreasing low frequency variability in the next decades may lead to substantial changes in groundwater level trends consequently the extrapolation of trends estimated over the historical period seems particularly hazardous due to the stochastic and unpredictable behaviour of such low frequency fluctuations third regarding future projections because internal climate variability is often improperly reproduced and is a major source of uncertainties in climate and hydrological projections resulting from gcm outputs terray and boé 2013 qasmi et al 2017 consequently trend estimates resulting from these hydrological projections and in fine resulting from recharge and groundwater level projections would be subject to strong uncertainty 5 conclusion the analysis of groundwater level trends in france showed that a number of aquifers were susceptible to trend direction instabilities i e changes in trend direction according to the length of time series leading to contradictory conclusions about groundwater level evolutions this led to the question of the existence importance and spatial distribution of low frequency variability in groundwater levels of french aquifers groundwater levels were therefore broken down by modwt to estimate the significance of low frequency variabilities in total groundwater level variability it turned out that most of aquifers susceptible to trend direction instabilities exhibit a hydrological variability characterized by a significant low frequency variability they are aquifers with inertial or combined behaviour of water tables given the significant presence of multi annual and decadal variabilities in groundwater levels we aimed to determine if how and to what extent each of these components could affect trend estimates to this end modwt filtering was performed to subtract individually the multi annual or decadal variability from the entire signal and then trends were re estimated on the filtered groundwater level time series the results showed that the groundwater level trends were highly sensitive to the presence of any of these low frequency components which may then strongly influence the estimated trends such results indicate that low frequency variability originating from internal climate variability is capable of attenuating or accentuating groundwater level trends including those that might be associated with climate change in general trend detection is widely used as a tool for assessing changes in groundwater levels nevertheless our study presents features that show that this tool should be used with caution particularly for studying groundwater levels with significant low frequency variability we observed that i trends are highly dependent upon the study period and time series length and cannot be extrapolated ii trends are strongly influenced and guided by low frequency variability and iii trends are often only segments of larger scale fluctuations resulting from large scale atmospheric or oceanic circulation consequently their interpretation and attribution to a physical phenomenon such as climate change vs climate variability remains complex in addition since low frequency variability strongly guides and influences the estimated groundwater level trends potential changes in low frequency variability induced by changes in internal climate variability would necessarily lead to a change in the estimated trends in particular this means that i estimation of trends in hydrological projections resulting from gcm outputs in which low frequency variability is not well respresented would be subject to strong uncertainty ii a potential change in internal climate variability e g increasing or decreasing low frequency variability in the next decades may lead to substantial changes in estimated groundwater level trends consequently future works should focus on assessing the impacts of a potential change in internal climate variability i e low frequency variability on groundwater level trends using different scenarios of amplitude modifications of low frequency variability in addition a sensitivity analysis of the results of this study

3681,a better understanding of sediment dynamics and variability may provide helpful insights for improving the efficiency of community based monitoring strategies enhancing sediment yield estimation and optimizing soil conservation practices however this issue is rarely studied in karst areas which are experiencing severe soil erosion and sediment concentrations and load are highly variable the objectives of this study were to characterize the daily suspended sediment concentrations ssc and sediment load sl variability and to test whether the watershed scale and lithology exerted substantial influence on this variability in 40 karst watersheds 420 3 4 105 km2 in southwest china several indicators of variability were used for daily ssc and sl including standard deviation coefficient of deviation inhomogeneity coefficient the percentage of annual sl exported in 2 of the time ms2 and the percentage of time necessary to transport 50 of the annual sl ts50 results indicated that the daily ssc and sl had high temporal variability and the sl demonstrated stronger variability than the ssc on average half of the annual sediment load was discharged in 2 3 of the time in the period 2009 2012 implying that a few erosive events dominated the annual sediment load the temporal variability of daily ssc and sl were scale dependent and a larger watershed generally had a lower temporal variability the ms2 and ts50 were relatively stable when the area of the watershed was greater than 0 15 million km2 however no significant relationship was detected between karst coverage and ms2 or ts50 since karst coverage might not completely represent the characteristics of the 3 d hydrogeological structure in karst regions the results from this study can help improve river flow management and control soil loss in karst watersheds keywords soil erosion temporal variability watershed scale lithology karst ecosystems 1 introduction soil erosion plays an important role in structuring landscapes recycling of earth materials and exchanging substances between the continents and oceans cook et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 borrelli et al 2020 it also has a significant influence on water quality the structure and function of ecosystems and can have disastrous effects on infrastructure when it happens quickly during floods and landslides syvitski et al 2005 wang et al 2016 generally soil erosion rates are orders of magnitude greater than natural soil formation rates and exhibit high temporal variability li et al 2020a wuepper et al 2020 for example the actual soil erosion rates for farmland are 3 40 times greater than the upper limit of soil loss tolerance in europe verheijen et al 2009 soil erosion varies from year to year and the annual sediment load depends mainly on a few erosive events that occur over a few days gonzález hidalgo et al 2007 therefore identify the soil erosion and sediment load variability can help to improve soil erosion management strategies many previous studies have investigated temporal variability of suspended sediment concentrations or sediment loads in watersheds of various sizes yang et al 2002 mutema et al 2016 gao et al 2018 mize et al 2018 meybeck et al 2003 investigated some suspended sediment concentration variability indicators such as the mean to median ratios percentage of time necessary to transport half of the annual sediment load ts50 percentage of annual sediment load discharged in 2 of time ms2 to compare the temporal patterns of daily sediment concentrations in 60 watersheds with area ranging from 64 km2 to 3 2 107 km2 haritashya et al 2006 evaluated the temporal variations in suspended sediment concentration sediment load and sediment yield in a himalayan glacier watershed and found that 50 of the total runoff can transport 59 64 of the total sediment sediment yield decreases with watershed scale since it takes longer for eroded particles to transport greater distances de vente and poesen 2005 lu et al 2005 parsons et al 2006 however few studies have investigated the influence of watershed scale on sediment load variability especially in karst regions where ecologically fragile areas experience serious soil erosion duvert et al 2011 li et al 2019b sok et al 2021 karst landforms comprise between 7 and 12 of the earth s continental surface hartmann et al 2014 brandt et al 2018 karst landscapes are characterized by the discontinuous soil overlaying a highly irregular epikarst surface with high permeability since there is a direct relationship between surface morphology and subsurface hydrology gutiérrez et al 2014 wang et al 2019 the soil formation rate in karst regions is low and soil can be difficult to recover once it is lost jiang et al 2014 thus it is essential to understand the underlying dynamics of soil erosion to control soil loss in this region the differences in lithology greatly affect the development of landforms and soil erosion jiang et al 2014 on one hand strong and uneven soluble carbonate rocks create large fragmented areas of heterogeneous karst which can experience soil erosion wang et al 2019 on the other hand the fractures fissures cracks sinkholes and underground conduit systems facilitate rapid water flow into groundwater and thus may have a significant effect on soil erosion and sediment yield zhang et al 2019 li et al 2020b li et al 2019b indicated that the lithology exerts substantial influence on annual sediment yield and a watershed with a large karst coverage generally has a low annual sediment yield previous studies also indicated that a few daily erosive rainfall events may dominate the annual sediment yield and thus identification of the factors influencing the temporal variation of daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load is essential to control sediment delivery in fragile karst ecosystems estrany et al 2010 duvert et al 2011 gonzález hidalgo et al 2013 li et al 2020b however it is unclear whether the scale of a watershed and lithology significantly influence daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load variability in karst regions the objectives of this study were to identify the temporal variability of daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load and to explore whether the watershed scale and lithology influence this variability in 40 karst watersheds in southwest china which contains one of the largest contiguously karst areas in the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wujiang 104 15 109 20 e 26 09 30 12 n and xijiang 21 36 27 00 n 102 16 113 23 e karst watersheds in southwest china fig 1 a were selected as the study area exposed carbonate rock is widespread and accounts for 77 and 44 of the total land area for the wujiang and xijiang watersheds respectively fig 1b the wujiang river originates from the wumeng ranges and is a branch of the yangtze river the wujiang river has a total length of 1037 km and the watershed area is 8 8 104 km2 the elevation of the wujiang watershed ranges from 113 to 2888 m this region is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate and the mean annual temperature is about 12 c during 1955 2015 the annual precipitation ranges from 850 to 1600 mm and more than 70 of the annual total occurs between may and october according to observations the mean annual runoff depth and sediment load in the wujiang river were 552 mm and 273 t km 2 respectively from 1955 to 2015 li et al 2019b the xijiang river originates from the yunnan provinces and flows through the guizhou guangxi and guangdong provinces eventually flowing into the south china sea the xijiang river is the largest tributary of the zhujiang river and has a total length of 2214 km a drainage area of 3 5 105 km2 a mean annual runoff depth of 651 mm and mean annual sediment load of 184 t km 2 li et al 2019b the climate is typically subtropical to tropical monsoon with a mean annual temperature of 14 to 22 c during 1955 2015 the mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 2200 mm and more than 80 of the rain falls during the wet season between april and october li et al 2020b altogether 40 sub watersheds were selected in the study area fig 1c there were 11 hydrological stations that were observed in the wujiang river and 29 in the xijiang river detailed information about the selected 40 sub watersheds can be found in table 1 2 2 data the mean daily flow discharge m3 s 1 and suspended sediment concentrations ssc kg m 3 from 2009 to 2012 were acquired for the 40 hydrological stations from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the location of the hydrological stations can be found in fig 1 the mean daily sediment load sl kg s 1 km 2 was calculated as the ratio of sediment fluxes mean daily discharge ssc to watershed area the mean daily discharge and suspended sediment concentrations records were continuous from 2009 to 2012 in all 40 karst watersheds except the xiangjiang watershed no7 the mean daily discharge and suspended sediment concentrations were only observed in 2009 in the xiangjiang watershed and thus this watershed had a one year dataset for analysis the homogeneity and reliability of the dataset were checked before release a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 m 30 m was downloaded from the geospatial data cloud according to the watershed area of the 40 hydrological stations the boundary of the 40 sub watersheds were extracted from the dem using arcgis 10 3 software the spatial distribution of the exposed carbonate rocks was obtained from the institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences 2 3 indicators of ssc and sl variability some metrics proposed by meybeck et al 2003 were used to evaluate the variability in daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load specifically for each year from 2009 to 2012 the standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv and the inhomogeneity coefficient ic of the daily ssc and sl were calculated the ic was expressed as the following equation 1 ic t 1 n φ t s t s t 1 n s t 2 φ t 0 s t s 1 s t s where s t refers to the daily suspend sediment concentration or sediment load n refers to the total number days of one year i e 365 or 366 s refers to the mean daily suspend sediment concentration or sediment load of one year the greater the ic value the lager variability is the daily suspend sediment concentration and sediment load for one year the daily suspended sediment loads were initially ranked in magnitude subsequently beginning with the highest daily suspended sediment loads the daily sediment load duration curves were built and the percentage of sediment load discharged in 2 of the time approximately 7 days were represented as ms2 that is ms2 corresponded to the seventh highest daily sediment load observed in one hydrological year similarly the percentage of time needed to carry 50 of the sediment load was expressed as ts50 hence these five indicators of variability sd cv ic ms2 and ts50 were proposed for daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load 2 4 statistical analysis a one way analysis of variance anova followed by least significant difference lsd p 0 05 method was used to detect differences in coefficient of variation cv or inhomogeneity coefficient ic between suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load simple linear and nonlinear regressions were used to quantify the effects of watershed scale and karst coverage on the suspended sediment concentration and sediment load variability all analyses were performed using spss 22 0 software 3 results 3 1 variability in ssc and sl the daily sscs for 2009 to 2012 for the 40 karst sub watersheds are shown in fig 2 for 40 karst watersheds the maximum annual mean ssc in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 were 0 23 kg m 3 0 49 kg m 3 0 27 kg m 3 and 0 42 kg m 3 respectively fig 2 in 2010 the sd of the ssc of the 40 sub watersheds ranged from 0 004 to 1 82 kg m 3 which was greater than those in the other three years table 2 the mean values for sd of the ssc and sl in the 40 sub watersheds were similar between years the coefficient of variation for sd of the ssc and sl in all 40 sub watersheds were highly variable cv greater than 100 indicating that the sd of the ssc and sl varied substantially between heterogeneous karst watersheds the coefficient of variation for ic of the ssc and sl both exhibited weak variability table 2 the daily sl in 2010 2011 and 2012 all showed strong variability cv greater than 100 which were greater than those of daily ssc table 2 fig 3 similarly a significant difference in ic was observed between ssc and sl p 0 05 the ic values of the sl were much greater than those of the ssc table 2 fig 4 the annual sediment load duration curves were obtained by graphing the percent of daily sediment load versus percent of time and these curves were used to calculate the ms2 and ts50 for each karst watershed table 2 fig 5 according to table 2 and fig 5 for 40 selected karst watersheds 6 94 12 93 27 98 and 16 84 of the sediment load was exported in 2 of the time in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively ts50 varied from 0 05 to 23 84 for all 40 karst watersheds during 2009 2012 on average the ms2 for the 40 watersheds were all greater than 55 during 2009 2012 indicating that more than 55 of the sediment load was exported in about 7 days similarly half of the annual sediment load ts50 was exported in 2 04 1 76 1 53 and 2 23 of the time in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively 3 2 effect of watershed scale on ssc and sl variability the standard deviation of the ssc and sl were both significantly influenced by watershed scale r 2 0 17 p 0 01 and r 2 0 27 p 0 01 respectively and decreased with watershed scale as a power function fig 6 a indicating that the variability of ssc and sl is high when the watershed scale is small similarly watershed scale had a significant negative correlation with ms2 when the watershed scale was 0 15 million km2 r 2 0 46 p 0 01 fig 6b while it had a positive effect on ts50 when the watershed scale was 0 15 million km2 r 2 0 65 p 0 01 fig 6b when the watershed scale was larger than 0 15 million km2 the ms2 and ts50 were relatively stable 3 3 effect of lithology on ssc and sl variability no significant relationship was observed between karst coverage and sd of the ssc fig 6c p greater than 0 05 while karst coverage had a significant influence on sd of the sediment load fig 6c p 0 01 similarly there were no significant relationships between karst coverage and ms2 and karst coverage and ts50 fig 6d p greater than 0 05 4 discussion we proposed a set of metrics that included the standard deviation coefficient of deviation and inhomogeneity coefficient for the daily suspended sediment concentrations and load the percentage of annual sl exported in 2 of the time and the percentage of time necessary to transport 50 of the annual sl to describe the variability of ssc and sl in karst watersheds generally the coefficient of variation and inhomogeneity coefficient of the sl was significantly greater than ssc p 0 05 figs 3 and 4 the possible explanation is that the sl was calculated based on the daily ssc and runoff and thus stronger variability was observed in daily sl this result is consistent with previous studies haritashya et al 2006 mano et al 2009 ma et al 2010 the ts50 varied substantially between different karst watersheds table 2 fig 5 on one hand the karst watershed has unique hydrogeology rugged geomorphology heterogeneous landscapes and rich biodiversity jiang et al 2014 li et al 2020b the complexity of this watershed was partly responsible for the high variability in ts50 on the other hand little soil erosion occurred during the normal rainfall events since the fissures and fractures in the epikarst acted as a reservoir storing large volumes of rainwater wilcox et al 2008 hartmann et al 2014 li et al 2019a therefore large runoff and soil losses were mainly observed in extreme rainfall events which may also enhance the variability in ts50 for different karst watersheds high sediment loads were transported over small amounts of time and a few large erosive events dominated the annual sediment loads in karst watersheds some previous studies also showed that the annual sediment load depended on a few erosive events martı nez casasnovas et al 2002 haritashya et al 2006 estrany et al 2010 gonzalez hidalgo et al 2012 gonzalez hidalgo et al 2013 specifically by selecting 60 watersheds from the humid tropics to subarctic and arid regions meybeck et al 2003 found that the ms2 ranged from 6 3 to 92 6 and the ts50 ranged from 0 14 to 26 6 in four watersheds mano et al 2009 observed that 38 84 of the annual sediment load was transported in 7 days ms2 duvert et al 2011 reported that in 7 days ms2 rivers exported between 63 and 97 of the annual sediment load and 50 of the annual sediment load was carried in only 0 04 to 1 2 of the time ts50 in four watersheds of the mexican highlands the watershed scale is an important factor influencing daily sediment variability fig 6a b meybeck et al 2003 indicated that the ms2 decreased with watershed scale with 50 90 of the suspended sediment load discharged over 2 of the time for smallest watersheds 64 500 km2 and this proportion varying from 10 to 30 for watersheds exceeding 0 1 million km2 generally the small watersheds were characterized by a large relief ratio and therefore the eroded sediment had less opportunity to deposit in small watersheds than in relatively greater watersheds syvitski 2003 de vente and poesen 2005 zhang et al 2015 as the watershed scale increased sediment sinks generally dominated rather than sediment sources lane et al 1997 verstraeten et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 li et al 2020b specifically it took longer for suspended sediments to travel greater distances as the watershed scale increased walling 1983 griffiths et al 2006 parsons et al 2006 de vente et al 2013 as a result more eroded sediment was deposited during transport in concavities floodplains and alluvial plains of rivers and therefore the sediment transport rate decreased lu et al 2005 de vente et al 2007 vercruysse et al 2017 compared with the small watershed the larger watershed had a greater likelihood of sediment deposition during sediment transport and temporal variation in sediment concentrations and sediment load were scale dependent de vente et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 therefore in current study when the watershed scale was lower than 1 5 105 km2 the ms2 and ts50 were both significantly correlated with drainage area when the watershed scale was larger than 1 5 105 km2 the ms2 and ts50 were relatively stable it is important to note that the karst coverage had no significant influence on the variability of ssc and sl in karst watersheds fig 6 c d however some previous studies showed that the runoff coefficient decreased with increased karst coverage in karst watersheds zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2020 on one hand the rainfall can promptly recharge groundwater systems through the complex network of fissures cracks and caves and the runoff varies greatly depending on bedrock permeability hartmann et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 on the other hand as the uppermost zone of carbonate rocks the epikarst is generally as high as ten meters and therefore has high rain water storage capacity li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 as a result some rain water can be retained in the epikarst systems and generally increased with the karst coverage fu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 differing from runoff the eroded sediments from the surface and subsurface can commonly fill the conduits caves and sinkholes and block the drainage outlet in karst depressions jiang et al 2014 fischer et al 2017 li et al 2021 under this circumstance the karst depressions are often inundated after a long duration of heavy rain or rainstorms li et al 2019a cao et al 2020 as a result the majority of runoff ultimately flows into other karst watersheds while most of the eroded sediments are deposited in the karst depressions jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 the connectivity of the conduits caves and sinkholes can exert substantial influence on sediment transport heckmann et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 najafi et al 2020 therefore the effect of lithology on sediment load variability may be more complex than the runoff and thus the karst coverage had no significant effect on the variability of ssc and sl in karst watersheds actually the lithology index of karst coverage may not fully represent the 3d hydrogeological structure such as the interconnected fractures caves and karstic conduits which determined the main flow of the hydrosystem some comprehensive index such as hydrological or sediment connectivity should be considered in future studies to characterize the complex heterogeneous and anisotropic hydrogeological conditions in karst watersheds 5 conclusions the daily suspend sediment concentrations and sediment load generally exhibited high temporal variability especially in karst regions where a typically ecologically fragile zone experiencing serious soil erosion this study thus aimed to identify the variability of daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load and to investigate their relationships with watershed scale and karst coverage in 40 selected karst watersheds results indicated that the daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load were indeed both highly variable in karst watersheds due to the sediment load was determined by multiplying sediment concentration by runoff a larger variability was observed in daily sediment load than that of sediment concentration generally a large proportion of annual sediment load is transported over a short period of time therefore a few daily erosive rainfall events could be responsible for large quantities of sediment transport in karst watersheds therefore mitigation strategies for soil loss can be targeted within these daily erosive events watershed scale has a profound influence on daily sediment variability specifically the temporal variability of suspended sediment concentration and sediment load were negatively related to watershed scale when the watershed area was 0 15 million km2 and the ms2 and ts50 were basically unchanged when the watershed scale was larger than 0 15 million km2 the relatively high proportion of gentle and flat slopes in large watersheds generally enhanced sediment deposition and thus the variability of sediment was scale dependent different from watershed scale the effect of lithology on daily sediment variability was complex and no significant differences were found between ms2 ts50 and karst coverage in future studies establishing a comprehensive index that characterizes the features of hydrogeological structure rather than karst coverage may help better explore the effect of lithology on sediment variability credit authorship contribution statement

3681,a better understanding of sediment dynamics and variability may provide helpful insights for improving the efficiency of community based monitoring strategies enhancing sediment yield estimation and optimizing soil conservation practices however this issue is rarely studied in karst areas which are experiencing severe soil erosion and sediment concentrations and load are highly variable the objectives of this study were to characterize the daily suspended sediment concentrations ssc and sediment load sl variability and to test whether the watershed scale and lithology exerted substantial influence on this variability in 40 karst watersheds 420 3 4 105 km2 in southwest china several indicators of variability were used for daily ssc and sl including standard deviation coefficient of deviation inhomogeneity coefficient the percentage of annual sl exported in 2 of the time ms2 and the percentage of time necessary to transport 50 of the annual sl ts50 results indicated that the daily ssc and sl had high temporal variability and the sl demonstrated stronger variability than the ssc on average half of the annual sediment load was discharged in 2 3 of the time in the period 2009 2012 implying that a few erosive events dominated the annual sediment load the temporal variability of daily ssc and sl were scale dependent and a larger watershed generally had a lower temporal variability the ms2 and ts50 were relatively stable when the area of the watershed was greater than 0 15 million km2 however no significant relationship was detected between karst coverage and ms2 or ts50 since karst coverage might not completely represent the characteristics of the 3 d hydrogeological structure in karst regions the results from this study can help improve river flow management and control soil loss in karst watersheds keywords soil erosion temporal variability watershed scale lithology karst ecosystems 1 introduction soil erosion plays an important role in structuring landscapes recycling of earth materials and exchanging substances between the continents and oceans cook et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 borrelli et al 2020 it also has a significant influence on water quality the structure and function of ecosystems and can have disastrous effects on infrastructure when it happens quickly during floods and landslides syvitski et al 2005 wang et al 2016 generally soil erosion rates are orders of magnitude greater than natural soil formation rates and exhibit high temporal variability li et al 2020a wuepper et al 2020 for example the actual soil erosion rates for farmland are 3 40 times greater than the upper limit of soil loss tolerance in europe verheijen et al 2009 soil erosion varies from year to year and the annual sediment load depends mainly on a few erosive events that occur over a few days gonzález hidalgo et al 2007 therefore identify the soil erosion and sediment load variability can help to improve soil erosion management strategies many previous studies have investigated temporal variability of suspended sediment concentrations or sediment loads in watersheds of various sizes yang et al 2002 mutema et al 2016 gao et al 2018 mize et al 2018 meybeck et al 2003 investigated some suspended sediment concentration variability indicators such as the mean to median ratios percentage of time necessary to transport half of the annual sediment load ts50 percentage of annual sediment load discharged in 2 of time ms2 to compare the temporal patterns of daily sediment concentrations in 60 watersheds with area ranging from 64 km2 to 3 2 107 km2 haritashya et al 2006 evaluated the temporal variations in suspended sediment concentration sediment load and sediment yield in a himalayan glacier watershed and found that 50 of the total runoff can transport 59 64 of the total sediment sediment yield decreases with watershed scale since it takes longer for eroded particles to transport greater distances de vente and poesen 2005 lu et al 2005 parsons et al 2006 however few studies have investigated the influence of watershed scale on sediment load variability especially in karst regions where ecologically fragile areas experience serious soil erosion duvert et al 2011 li et al 2019b sok et al 2021 karst landforms comprise between 7 and 12 of the earth s continental surface hartmann et al 2014 brandt et al 2018 karst landscapes are characterized by the discontinuous soil overlaying a highly irregular epikarst surface with high permeability since there is a direct relationship between surface morphology and subsurface hydrology gutiérrez et al 2014 wang et al 2019 the soil formation rate in karst regions is low and soil can be difficult to recover once it is lost jiang et al 2014 thus it is essential to understand the underlying dynamics of soil erosion to control soil loss in this region the differences in lithology greatly affect the development of landforms and soil erosion jiang et al 2014 on one hand strong and uneven soluble carbonate rocks create large fragmented areas of heterogeneous karst which can experience soil erosion wang et al 2019 on the other hand the fractures fissures cracks sinkholes and underground conduit systems facilitate rapid water flow into groundwater and thus may have a significant effect on soil erosion and sediment yield zhang et al 2019 li et al 2020b li et al 2019b indicated that the lithology exerts substantial influence on annual sediment yield and a watershed with a large karst coverage generally has a low annual sediment yield previous studies also indicated that a few daily erosive rainfall events may dominate the annual sediment yield and thus identification of the factors influencing the temporal variation of daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load is essential to control sediment delivery in fragile karst ecosystems estrany et al 2010 duvert et al 2011 gonzález hidalgo et al 2013 li et al 2020b however it is unclear whether the scale of a watershed and lithology significantly influence daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load variability in karst regions the objectives of this study were to identify the temporal variability of daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load and to explore whether the watershed scale and lithology influence this variability in 40 karst watersheds in southwest china which contains one of the largest contiguously karst areas in the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wujiang 104 15 109 20 e 26 09 30 12 n and xijiang 21 36 27 00 n 102 16 113 23 e karst watersheds in southwest china fig 1 a were selected as the study area exposed carbonate rock is widespread and accounts for 77 and 44 of the total land area for the wujiang and xijiang watersheds respectively fig 1b the wujiang river originates from the wumeng ranges and is a branch of the yangtze river the wujiang river has a total length of 1037 km and the watershed area is 8 8 104 km2 the elevation of the wujiang watershed ranges from 113 to 2888 m this region is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate and the mean annual temperature is about 12 c during 1955 2015 the annual precipitation ranges from 850 to 1600 mm and more than 70 of the annual total occurs between may and october according to observations the mean annual runoff depth and sediment load in the wujiang river were 552 mm and 273 t km 2 respectively from 1955 to 2015 li et al 2019b the xijiang river originates from the yunnan provinces and flows through the guizhou guangxi and guangdong provinces eventually flowing into the south china sea the xijiang river is the largest tributary of the zhujiang river and has a total length of 2214 km a drainage area of 3 5 105 km2 a mean annual runoff depth of 651 mm and mean annual sediment load of 184 t km 2 li et al 2019b the climate is typically subtropical to tropical monsoon with a mean annual temperature of 14 to 22 c during 1955 2015 the mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 2200 mm and more than 80 of the rain falls during the wet season between april and october li et al 2020b altogether 40 sub watersheds were selected in the study area fig 1c there were 11 hydrological stations that were observed in the wujiang river and 29 in the xijiang river detailed information about the selected 40 sub watersheds can be found in table 1 2 2 data the mean daily flow discharge m3 s 1 and suspended sediment concentrations ssc kg m 3 from 2009 to 2012 were acquired for the 40 hydrological stations from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the location of the hydrological stations can be found in fig 1 the mean daily sediment load sl kg s 1 km 2 was calculated as the ratio of sediment fluxes mean daily discharge ssc to watershed area the mean daily discharge and suspended sediment concentrations records were continuous from 2009 to 2012 in all 40 karst watersheds except the xiangjiang watershed no7 the mean daily discharge and suspended sediment concentrations were only observed in 2009 in the xiangjiang watershed and thus this watershed had a one year dataset for analysis the homogeneity and reliability of the dataset were checked before release a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 m 30 m was downloaded from the geospatial data cloud according to the watershed area of the 40 hydrological stations the boundary of the 40 sub watersheds were extracted from the dem using arcgis 10 3 software the spatial distribution of the exposed carbonate rocks was obtained from the institute of geochemistry chinese academy of sciences 2 3 indicators of ssc and sl variability some metrics proposed by meybeck et al 2003 were used to evaluate the variability in daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load specifically for each year from 2009 to 2012 the standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv and the inhomogeneity coefficient ic of the daily ssc and sl were calculated the ic was expressed as the following equation 1 ic t 1 n φ t s t s t 1 n s t 2 φ t 0 s t s 1 s t s where s t refers to the daily suspend sediment concentration or sediment load n refers to the total number days of one year i e 365 or 366 s refers to the mean daily suspend sediment concentration or sediment load of one year the greater the ic value the lager variability is the daily suspend sediment concentration and sediment load for one year the daily suspended sediment loads were initially ranked in magnitude subsequently beginning with the highest daily suspended sediment loads the daily sediment load duration curves were built and the percentage of sediment load discharged in 2 of the time approximately 7 days were represented as ms2 that is ms2 corresponded to the seventh highest daily sediment load observed in one hydrological year similarly the percentage of time needed to carry 50 of the sediment load was expressed as ts50 hence these five indicators of variability sd cv ic ms2 and ts50 were proposed for daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load 2 4 statistical analysis a one way analysis of variance anova followed by least significant difference lsd p 0 05 method was used to detect differences in coefficient of variation cv or inhomogeneity coefficient ic between suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load simple linear and nonlinear regressions were used to quantify the effects of watershed scale and karst coverage on the suspended sediment concentration and sediment load variability all analyses were performed using spss 22 0 software 3 results 3 1 variability in ssc and sl the daily sscs for 2009 to 2012 for the 40 karst sub watersheds are shown in fig 2 for 40 karst watersheds the maximum annual mean ssc in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 were 0 23 kg m 3 0 49 kg m 3 0 27 kg m 3 and 0 42 kg m 3 respectively fig 2 in 2010 the sd of the ssc of the 40 sub watersheds ranged from 0 004 to 1 82 kg m 3 which was greater than those in the other three years table 2 the mean values for sd of the ssc and sl in the 40 sub watersheds were similar between years the coefficient of variation for sd of the ssc and sl in all 40 sub watersheds were highly variable cv greater than 100 indicating that the sd of the ssc and sl varied substantially between heterogeneous karst watersheds the coefficient of variation for ic of the ssc and sl both exhibited weak variability table 2 the daily sl in 2010 2011 and 2012 all showed strong variability cv greater than 100 which were greater than those of daily ssc table 2 fig 3 similarly a significant difference in ic was observed between ssc and sl p 0 05 the ic values of the sl were much greater than those of the ssc table 2 fig 4 the annual sediment load duration curves were obtained by graphing the percent of daily sediment load versus percent of time and these curves were used to calculate the ms2 and ts50 for each karst watershed table 2 fig 5 according to table 2 and fig 5 for 40 selected karst watersheds 6 94 12 93 27 98 and 16 84 of the sediment load was exported in 2 of the time in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively ts50 varied from 0 05 to 23 84 for all 40 karst watersheds during 2009 2012 on average the ms2 for the 40 watersheds were all greater than 55 during 2009 2012 indicating that more than 55 of the sediment load was exported in about 7 days similarly half of the annual sediment load ts50 was exported in 2 04 1 76 1 53 and 2 23 of the time in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively 3 2 effect of watershed scale on ssc and sl variability the standard deviation of the ssc and sl were both significantly influenced by watershed scale r 2 0 17 p 0 01 and r 2 0 27 p 0 01 respectively and decreased with watershed scale as a power function fig 6 a indicating that the variability of ssc and sl is high when the watershed scale is small similarly watershed scale had a significant negative correlation with ms2 when the watershed scale was 0 15 million km2 r 2 0 46 p 0 01 fig 6b while it had a positive effect on ts50 when the watershed scale was 0 15 million km2 r 2 0 65 p 0 01 fig 6b when the watershed scale was larger than 0 15 million km2 the ms2 and ts50 were relatively stable 3 3 effect of lithology on ssc and sl variability no significant relationship was observed between karst coverage and sd of the ssc fig 6c p greater than 0 05 while karst coverage had a significant influence on sd of the sediment load fig 6c p 0 01 similarly there were no significant relationships between karst coverage and ms2 and karst coverage and ts50 fig 6d p greater than 0 05 4 discussion we proposed a set of metrics that included the standard deviation coefficient of deviation and inhomogeneity coefficient for the daily suspended sediment concentrations and load the percentage of annual sl exported in 2 of the time and the percentage of time necessary to transport 50 of the annual sl to describe the variability of ssc and sl in karst watersheds generally the coefficient of variation and inhomogeneity coefficient of the sl was significantly greater than ssc p 0 05 figs 3 and 4 the possible explanation is that the sl was calculated based on the daily ssc and runoff and thus stronger variability was observed in daily sl this result is consistent with previous studies haritashya et al 2006 mano et al 2009 ma et al 2010 the ts50 varied substantially between different karst watersheds table 2 fig 5 on one hand the karst watershed has unique hydrogeology rugged geomorphology heterogeneous landscapes and rich biodiversity jiang et al 2014 li et al 2020b the complexity of this watershed was partly responsible for the high variability in ts50 on the other hand little soil erosion occurred during the normal rainfall events since the fissures and fractures in the epikarst acted as a reservoir storing large volumes of rainwater wilcox et al 2008 hartmann et al 2014 li et al 2019a therefore large runoff and soil losses were mainly observed in extreme rainfall events which may also enhance the variability in ts50 for different karst watersheds high sediment loads were transported over small amounts of time and a few large erosive events dominated the annual sediment loads in karst watersheds some previous studies also showed that the annual sediment load depended on a few erosive events martı nez casasnovas et al 2002 haritashya et al 2006 estrany et al 2010 gonzalez hidalgo et al 2012 gonzalez hidalgo et al 2013 specifically by selecting 60 watersheds from the humid tropics to subarctic and arid regions meybeck et al 2003 found that the ms2 ranged from 6 3 to 92 6 and the ts50 ranged from 0 14 to 26 6 in four watersheds mano et al 2009 observed that 38 84 of the annual sediment load was transported in 7 days ms2 duvert et al 2011 reported that in 7 days ms2 rivers exported between 63 and 97 of the annual sediment load and 50 of the annual sediment load was carried in only 0 04 to 1 2 of the time ts50 in four watersheds of the mexican highlands the watershed scale is an important factor influencing daily sediment variability fig 6a b meybeck et al 2003 indicated that the ms2 decreased with watershed scale with 50 90 of the suspended sediment load discharged over 2 of the time for smallest watersheds 64 500 km2 and this proportion varying from 10 to 30 for watersheds exceeding 0 1 million km2 generally the small watersheds were characterized by a large relief ratio and therefore the eroded sediment had less opportunity to deposit in small watersheds than in relatively greater watersheds syvitski 2003 de vente and poesen 2005 zhang et al 2015 as the watershed scale increased sediment sinks generally dominated rather than sediment sources lane et al 1997 verstraeten et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 li et al 2020b specifically it took longer for suspended sediments to travel greater distances as the watershed scale increased walling 1983 griffiths et al 2006 parsons et al 2006 de vente et al 2013 as a result more eroded sediment was deposited during transport in concavities floodplains and alluvial plains of rivers and therefore the sediment transport rate decreased lu et al 2005 de vente et al 2007 vercruysse et al 2017 compared with the small watershed the larger watershed had a greater likelihood of sediment deposition during sediment transport and temporal variation in sediment concentrations and sediment load were scale dependent de vente et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 therefore in current study when the watershed scale was lower than 1 5 105 km2 the ms2 and ts50 were both significantly correlated with drainage area when the watershed scale was larger than 1 5 105 km2 the ms2 and ts50 were relatively stable it is important to note that the karst coverage had no significant influence on the variability of ssc and sl in karst watersheds fig 6 c d however some previous studies showed that the runoff coefficient decreased with increased karst coverage in karst watersheds zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2020 on one hand the rainfall can promptly recharge groundwater systems through the complex network of fissures cracks and caves and the runoff varies greatly depending on bedrock permeability hartmann et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 on the other hand as the uppermost zone of carbonate rocks the epikarst is generally as high as ten meters and therefore has high rain water storage capacity li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 as a result some rain water can be retained in the epikarst systems and generally increased with the karst coverage fu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 differing from runoff the eroded sediments from the surface and subsurface can commonly fill the conduits caves and sinkholes and block the drainage outlet in karst depressions jiang et al 2014 fischer et al 2017 li et al 2021 under this circumstance the karst depressions are often inundated after a long duration of heavy rain or rainstorms li et al 2019a cao et al 2020 as a result the majority of runoff ultimately flows into other karst watersheds while most of the eroded sediments are deposited in the karst depressions jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 the connectivity of the conduits caves and sinkholes can exert substantial influence on sediment transport heckmann et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 najafi et al 2020 therefore the effect of lithology on sediment load variability may be more complex than the runoff and thus the karst coverage had no significant effect on the variability of ssc and sl in karst watersheds actually the lithology index of karst coverage may not fully represent the 3d hydrogeological structure such as the interconnected fractures caves and karstic conduits which determined the main flow of the hydrosystem some comprehensive index such as hydrological or sediment connectivity should be considered in future studies to characterize the complex heterogeneous and anisotropic hydrogeological conditions in karst watersheds 5 conclusions the daily suspend sediment concentrations and sediment load generally exhibited high temporal variability especially in karst regions where a typically ecologically fragile zone experiencing serious soil erosion this study thus aimed to identify the variability of daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load and to investigate their relationships with watershed scale and karst coverage in 40 selected karst watersheds results indicated that the daily suspended sediment concentrations and sediment load were indeed both highly variable in karst watersheds due to the sediment load was determined by multiplying sediment concentration by runoff a larger variability was observed in daily sediment load than that of sediment concentration generally a large proportion of annual sediment load is transported over a short

3682,urban flooding is a global metropolitan problem therefore establishing reliable streamflow forecasting models is critical for flood control and planning in urban areas furthermore assessing the importance and uncertainty of model predictors is useful for managers however these predictors are still underevaluated to address these concerns we developed a novel hybrid model ga bart that integrates a genetic algorithm ga with the bayesian additive regression tree bart model for hourly streamflow forecasting a case study was conducted in the jungrang urban basin which is located on the han river in south korea the model was built and evaluated based on data collected during 39 heavy rain events from 2003 to 2020 to compare the model s forecast capability a support vector regression model hybridized with a genetic algorithm ga svr and a multiple linear regression mlr model was constructed an analysis of multiple datasets including different input predictors was performed to define the optimal set for streamflow forecasting the results illustrated that the ga bart model outperformed the ga svr and mlr models in multistep ahead streamflow forecasts with improved measures of the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae relative error nash sutcliffe efficiency nse time lag and correlation coefficient cc in addition the ga bart model could reasonably determinethe relative importance of the input variables this study demonstrated that despite some disadvantages in the five and six hour step ahead forecasts the hybrid ga bart model can be a good option among the available models for hourly streamflow forecasting keywords bayesian additive regression trees hybrid model genetic algorithm streamflow forecasting urban flood 1 introduction urban flooding is becoming a critical challenge for metropolitan areas as global warming causes more frequent occurrences of unpredictable and extreme weather nguyen and bae 2020 wang et al 2019 hence streamflow forecasting to help mitigate the damage has recently received much attention from scientists chu et al 2021 ni et al 2020a sohrabi et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 streamflow forecasting plays a crucial role in water resource control especially in highly urbanized areas that are very vulnerable to flooding during heavy rainfall events berkhahn et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in addition managers can benefit from assessments of the importance and uncertainty of model predictors however such assessments are lacking in previous studies therefore streamflow forecasting with fine time steps and evaluations of predictors is a critical need for urban basins in addition to using physical based models many recent studies have shown a widespread use of data driven models in streamflow forecasting e g mosavi et al 2018 ni et al 2020b ren et al 2020 data driven methods are superior to physical based approaches because they do not consider the complex processes of rainfall runoff mechanisms and they can be easily implemented ren et al 2020 scientists have applied various statistical and data driven algorithms including the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis yaseen et al 2017

and predict streamflow at different tempo spatial scales their research was successful in modeling complex hydrological mechanisms and produced reliable results in streamflow predictions mosavi et al 2018 compared with the abovementioned data driven methods tree based models have cheaper computation costs ni et al 2020b although other machine learning methods are similar to black box prediction models decision tree dt models provide a simple visualization of how the algorithms operate gharaei manesh et al 2016 and do not use any assumptions for predictor variables in recent years dt models have gained significant research attention for solving hydrological issues a variety of tree based algorithms such as the classification and regression tree cart ibrahim and karakurt 2013 lee and kim 2020 random forest rf abbasi et al 2020 carranza et al 2021 desai and ouarda 2021 and extreme gradient boosting xgboost algorithms naghibi et al 2020 nguyen et al 2021a ni et al 2020b zhang et al 2019 have been established and have produced promising results for runoff generation streamflow simulation and forecasting water potential assessment and drought prediction nevertheless the abovementioned tree based models and machine learning algorithms do not consider the importance and uncertainty of the predictor variables as an ensemble tree the bayesian additive regression tree bart uses problem solving techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of each predictor inspired by ensemble approaches and boosting algorithms the bart is characterized by a bayesian statistical model that includes a prior probability and a likelihood function chipman et al 2012 this method allows full posterior inference of the expected regression function and possible predictor effects at the boundary the bart is operated as a sum of tree ensemble which takes into account the effects of many different dts in a regression framework the fitting and inference of the model are executed by using an iterative bayesian backfitting markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach for generating samples from a posterior function as a result the bart is a probabilistic based model that is not only a powerful method but also allows a quantitative assessment of predictor uncertainty tan and roy 2019 in recent years the bart model has been widely applied to numerous academic studies including predictions on environmental issues kansanen et al 2019 kropat et al 2015 sevinc et al 2020 and in construction engineering luat et al 2020 zamanian et al 2020 due to its effectiveness the bart has been expanded to biostatistics and medical studies liang et al 2018 sparapani et al 2020 2016 yang liu et al 2015 and for its prediction of driver behavior tan et al 2017 2018 the algorithm has outperformed causal inference data analysis dorie et al 2019 hahn et al 2017 the bart was used to estimate daily concentrations of pm2 5 matter in the air zhang et al 2020 however to our knowledge the application of the bart to hydrological prediction studies needs to be explored in addition many previous hydrological studies using machine learning algorithms only evaluated the predictive results without assessing the importance and uncertainty of the predictors therefore in this study we explored the ability of the bart model to predict hourly multistep ahead streamflow for urban areas along with a consideration of the relative importance and uncertainty of its input predictors in our previous studies we used machine learning algorithms to correct the forecasted radar based rainfall for urban catchment inundation nguyen et al 2021c 2021b nguyen and bae 2020 river water level and streamflow forecasting le et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021a however this study is one of the first to use a bart to predict the hourly multistep ahead streamflow for urban basins and quantify the importance of its predictors furthermore this study considered various time step input sets to evaluate the best input set for developing the proposed model in hydrology some of the standalone artificial intelligence approaches do not perform efficiently in terms of accuracy and capturing the complexity of noise in hydrological data fotovatikhah et al 2018 to develop a robust machine learning ml model optimization algorithms integrated into the ml model must be used to tune the hyperparameters dodangeh et al

iwo have been progressively developed for modeling and handling hydrological processes the genetic algorithm ga uses a stochastic search approach that is motivated by the concepts of evolution and natural selection the ga imitates the evolutionary mechanisms of biological entities including selection crossover and mutation scrucca 2013 zhang and geem 2019 the ga has been demonstrated to be completely useful for hydrometeorological applications chlumecký et al 2017 horton et al 2018 tegegne and kim 2020 nonlinear hydrological mechanisms in river system predictions were handled and improved using gas fotovatikhah et al 2018 therefore in the present study a ga was selected for integration with the bart model and to serve with svr as a benchmark model the goal of this research is to propose a novel approach of integrating a bart model with a genetic optimization algorithm referred to as ga bart for hourly streamflow forecasting in an urban basin the performance of the hybrid bart model is compared with two benchmark models including the svr model using the ga method ga svr and mlr various input sets are arranged to develop the prediction models which are based on previous hourly rainfall in addition the relative importance and uncertainty of input predictors are examined in this study the remaining sections of this article are presented as follows a general overview of the algorithms and performance indicators is illustrated in section 2 information about the case study data and model development is provided in section 3 the fourth and fifth sections present the results and a related discussion finally the summary of this paper is shown in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 multiple linear regression mlr the mlr is a popular statistical algorithm that formulates the relationship between explanatory input variables and a response output variable every independent variable x is associated with a value of the output variable y mlr is an extension algorithm of the ordinary least squares ols regression method the formulation of the mlr given n input variables can be defined as follows 1 y β 0 β 1 x i 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n where y is the dependent variable x i is an explanatory input variable β 0 is the y intercept constant term β i is the slope coefficient for each explanatory variable and is the error term of the model known as the residuals in a mlr model the parameters are tuned in such a way that they obtain the best agreement between the predicted and observed values during the training stage sahour et al 2020 ideally the mlr model would have data points that are precisely aligned with the fitted regression line 2 2 support vector regression svr svr which was first proposed by vapnik 1995 is an extended version of the regression of a support vector machine svm that includes a module of classification algorithm the svr algorithm seeks a mapping of correlation formulations to fit the training dataset to a higher dimensional characteristic space the algorithm uses a structural risk minimization approach to solve the formulation luo et al 2019 vapnik 2013 if m training data samples are x i y i i m where i 1 2 m x i denotes the vector of an input and y i presents the corresponding output the mapping formulation is defined as follows 2 f ω ϕ x b where ϕ denotes nonlinear mapping ω is the slope vector and b is the offset svr uses a loss function and an objective function to acquire the regression parameters in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively the functions enable the svr algorithm to avoid overfitting the training data samples 3 l f x i y i 0 i f f x i y i ε f x i y i ε i f f x i y i ε 4 m i n 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 m l f x i y i m i n 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 m ξ i ξ i subject to f x i y i ε ξ i y i f x i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where ε presents a positive error threshold ξ i and ξ i are the slack variables of the i th sample from ε and c denotes the regularized constant estimated from the complexity of the model and the empirical accumulative error luo et al 2019 when c decreases the learning rate increases and the empirical risk decreases dodangeh et al 2020 to solve the objective function eq 3 lagrange multipliers are applied and then the nonlinear regression function is represented as follows 5 f x i 1 m ζ i ζ i k x x i b where ζ i and ζ i denote the lagrange coefficients k x x i presents the kernel function and k x x i ϕ x ϕ x i in this study the nonlinear kernel function named the radial basis was used the parameters sigma and c of the radial kernel function were optimized by a genetic algorithm 2 3 bayesian additive regression trees barts first developed by chipman et al 2012 the bart is known as the bayesian approach for flexibly estimating nonparametric functions and nonlinear problems with high dimensional input data the bart combines the concepts of bayesian inference with sum of tree ensemble methods in addition the bart algorithm uses the mcmc approach to estimate the uncertainties of the data and the developed model tan and roy 2019 let y represents an output that corresponds to the d dimensional input vector x x 1 x 2 x d the formal definitions of bart can be expressed as 6 y f x ε i ε i n 0 σ 2 7 f x j 1 m g x t j m j where t j presents the j th binary tree structure m j denotes the terminal node parameters related to t j m is the regression tree number ε i is an error term that has a normal distribution with variance σ 2 and f denotes the sum of regression trees g x t j m j a single regression tree of the bart is characterized by the parameters t m each regression tree g x t j m j represents a complete tree which includes a root and two node sets terminal nodes and interior nodes a tree is formed by decision rules that determine the interior nodes x i c where c is the splitting threshold value and x i denotes the splitting variable in a leaf node each x value is connected to an individual terminal node and is assigned a scalar μ j m μ 1 μ b b denotes the total number of leaves in eq 6 the function g x t j m j assigns μ ij to x in the bart algorithm a prior is applied to all the parameters of the sum of trees model t j m j and σ to avoid the undue influence of a single tree chipman et al 2012 the regularization prior is formed as 8 p t j m j σ p σ j m p μ ij t j p t j where the tree parameters t j m j are not interdependent and are independent of σ and the vector parameters of terminal nodes of every tree are assumed to be independent within the prior the prior p t j is divided into three aspects 1 the probability of a nonterminal node at depth d 0 1 2 is controlled by 9 α 1 d β α 0 1 β 0 2 the distribution of the splitting threshold value c at each interior node and 3 the distribution of the decision rule given in each interior node for p μ ij t j the conjugate normal distribution n μ μ σ μ 2 was used in the prior the hyperparameters μ μ and σ μ are chosen so that the sum of μ ij under the sum of trees models e y x with a high probability is between y max and y min the actual min and max of y in the dataset for tree number m the selection conditions of μ μ and σ μ are m μ μ k m σ μ y min and m μ μ k m σ μ y max the default k value is 2 and can be optimized in the training stage for p σ the inverse chi square distribution is used σ 2 ν λ χ ν 2 a data informed prior method is utilized to specify the hyperparameters ν and λ the data informed prior method in this case was used to allocate a substantial probability to the whole range of probable values of σ to avoid overconcentration and overdispersion the posterior distribution is induced from the prior by using an iterative bayesian back fitting mcmc method for sampling chipman et al 2012 according to chipman et al 2012 the iterative back fitting mcmc algorithm overcomes the limitations of the single tree mcmc model such as the quick gradation of a single large tree and the tendency to get stuck in the local neighborhood of that tree the posterior distribution is presented as follows 10 p t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 y l y t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 p t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 where l denotes the likelihood function that can be defined as 11 l y t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 n l y n t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 in this study the hyperparameters m k α β and ν were adjusted automatically by the genetic optimization algorithm the following sections briefly introduce information about the genetic algorithm 2 4 genetic algorithm genetic algorithms gas developed by goldberg 1989 and holland 1975 are motivated by the natural phenomenon of biological evolution gas use nature inspired operators including selection crossover and mutation operators gas identify the optimal values in a complex search range by using stochastic optimization the method has the flexibility to allow optimization of continuous and discontinuous ranges regardless of whether they are constrained or unconstrained fig 1 shows the ga scheme diagram the three nature inspired operators are briefly presented below 2 4 1 selection operator at the beginning of the algorithm the generation population is created randomly in the search space the parent derived chromosomes are chosen from the population based on their selection probability then the fitness value is obtained for each chromosome the elements that have better objective values are properly selected for the next population 2 4 2 crossover operator a new chromosome is generated by exchanging its parent genes old generation of chromosomes in the selection stage the crossover operator reduces genetic and population diversity by facilitating the combination of beneficial genes in this study a uniform crossover method was applied to change the chromosomes from an old generation to a new generation 2 4 3 mutation operator after new chromosomes are created some of them can be mutated with a random probability mutation shows the change of a chromosomal gene in which a gene can be added to or deleted from the genes of a population the mutation operator works to prevent an untimely convergence therefore it increases the likelihood of generating better chromosomes 2 5 performance measures in this study we used graphical and statistical performance measures that are widely used in hydrological studies seven statistical indicators including the mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient cc nash sutcliffe efficiency nse time lag tl bias and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the model s performance these seven performance measures can provide a comprehensive evaluation of the closeness of a predicted behavior to observations the advantages and disadvantages of the indicators are described in moriasi et al 2015 the indicator equations are presented as follows 12 rmse 1 n i 1 n sf i pre sf i obs 2 13 cc i 1 n sf i pre sf mean pre sf i obs sf mean obs i 1 n sf i pre sf mean pre 2 i 1 n sf i obs sf mean obs 2 14 nse 1 i 1 n sf i obs sf i pre 2 i 1 n sf i obs sf mean obs 2 15 tl t pre t obs 16 bias i 1 n sf i obs sf i pre n 17 mae i 1 n sf i obs sf i pre n 18 mape i 1 n sf i obs sf i pre sf i obs n 100 where sf i pre and sf i obs are the predicted and observed streamflow at time step i respectively sf mean obs is the average value of the streamflow and sf max pre and sf max obs are the predicted and observed peaks of the streamflow respectively 3 materials and model development 3 1 study area and data preparation the jungrang urban basin located in the lower part of the han river basin is divided into an upstream subbasin and a downstream subbasin which together cover a total area of 299 87 km2 the downstream subbasin is part of the seoul metropolitan area which is highly urbanized in the city of seoul urban floods normally occur within a few hours of heavy rainfall events this region is characterized by a continental monsoon climate with an uneven distribution of precipitation throughout the year hence the annual precipitation in this city 1200 1600 mm is higher than in other urban areas at the same latitude lei et al 2021 heavy rainfall events normally occur from june to september annually because the downstream part of the jungrang basin is a lower lying area with a limited drainage capacity the basin has one of the highest flood risks in the area lei et al 2021 historical flood events caused significant damage to the jungrang basin in 2006 2010 and 2011 therefore since hourly streamflow predictions for this basin are needed the jungrang urban basin was selected as a case study fig 2 depicts the location of the jungrang basin in south korea rain gauges and hydrological stations in this study we collected observed rainfall data from ten automatic weather station aws gauges of the korean meteorological administration kma and the water resources management information system wamis the kma rain gauges are identified by the ids 406 407 408 409 424 532 598 and 599 the wamis gauges are identified by the ids 10 184 010 and 10184125 we collected streamflow and water level data from the han river flood control office hrfco for the jungrang wolgye and singok stations the temporal resolution of the data is one hour table 1 presents the heavy rainfall events used in this study the events numbered 1 to 33 were used for the training and validation stages six events from numbers 34 to 39 were used for the testing stage the time series river streamflow depends on many natural factors such as rainfall underground recharge groundwater level and evaporation unlike daily or monthly predictions the contribution of evaporation which is governed mainly by radiation and wind speed might be negligible for hourly predictions rainfall data are a significant forcing input for not only hydrological models but also for data driven methods in this work the mean areal precipitation map of the upstream and downstream parts were used as the main predictor variables this separation of rainfall by subbasin can significantly contribute to the model s accuracy and optimize the computation time and complexity of the data driven models map data were estimated from the rain gauges by using the thiessen method in this study we used a combination of inputs that included the map of the subbasins at time step t and previous time steps e g t 1 t 2 and water level and streamflow of the stations at time step t for multistep ahead streamflow predictions notably the water level and streamflow predictors at time step t can be considered as indicators of both groundwater and initial streamflow conditions the sets of combination inputs were created with different previous time steps of rainfall to find the best predictor set in this work six previous time steps were examined due to the small size of the basin for 1 hour ahead prediction the input combinations were represented as follows 19 d 1 s f j t 1 mapu t mapu t 1 mapd t mapd t 1 wls t wlw t sfj t 20 d 2 s f j t 1 mapu t m a p u t 2 mapd t mapd t 2 wls t wlw t sfj t 21 d 3 s f j

d 6 s f j t 1 mapu t m a p u t 6 mapd t mapd t 6 wls t wlw t sfj t where sfj t and sfj t 1 is the streamflow of time steps t and t 1 at jungrang station respectively mapu t 1 mapu t 2 mapu t 3 mapu t 4 mapu t 5 and mapu t 6 denote the map of the upstream subbasin at the six previous time steps mapd t 1 mapd t 2 mapd t 3 mapd t 4 mapd t 5 and mapd t 6 denote the map of the downstream subbasin at the previous time steps wls t and wlw t denote the water level of time step t at the singok station and wolgye station respectively the models for the remaining time steps used the same input combinations as in the 1 hour step 3 2 model implementation and training in this study the hybrid models ga bart and ga svr were developed based on the r packages bartmachine kapelner and bleich 2020 kernlab karatzoglou et al 2019 and ga scrucca 2019 2013 for predicting streamflow at the jungrang gyo station there were six training datasets that included 33 events from 2003 to 2017 the input variables consisted of the map data for the subbasins water level of the two stations singok and wolgye and streamflow at the jungrang station the target variable was the multistep ahead streamflow of the jungrang station for the training stage to find the best population size for the ga the parametric approach was applied to the 1 hour ahead streamflow prediction with the dataset d3 the same values of the ga parameter were used to optimize the bart and svr for the remaining datasets and time steps in the ga bart model five hyperparameters including the number of trees m base hyperparameter in the prior tree α power parameter in prior tree β shrinkage parameter for the prior probability k and degrees of freedom for the inverse prior nu were considered to find the optimal sets by using the ga method the definitions for the hyperparameters can be found in the abovementioned documents in this work the values for m α β k and nu were searched in the ranges of 10 100 0 1 1 5 1 4 and 1 5 respectively the search details of the ga algorithm for the bart model and the sensitivity analysis of the parameters were referred to in previous studies chipman et al 2012 luat et al 2020 tan and roy 2019 to develop the hybrid ga svr model two parameters of the svr model using the radial basis kernel sigma and c were searched in the ranges of 0 005 2 and 0 01 10 respectively in the hybrid models the rmse was utilized as a fitness function of the optimization process fig 3 the k fold cross validation approach was used to avoid overfitting in training the models the 5 fold cross validation method was set for the two hybrid models ga bart and ga svr because it was commonly used in previous studies james et al 2013 ni et al 2020b for the ga algorithm integrated with the bart and svr the size of the population p s and the maximum generation number n gmax were defined by a parametric approach the crossover rate r c and mutation rate r m of the ga operator were selected to be 0 7 and 0 03 respectively and were set at the initial step specifically the uniform crossover approach was used in the present research because it is the most advanced crossover compared to the one point crossover and two point crossover hu and di paolo 2009 syswerda 1989 this method allows the child chromosomes to consider all the possibilities of replicating different genes from its parents by using a mixing rate to generate chromosomal genes fig 2 to find the appropriate p s ten ga bart models using the 5 fold cross validation method and a set of p s values 20 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 500 were developed the same procedure was applied to the ga svr model fig 4 shows the performances of the ga bart and ga svr corresponding to the p s set for the ga bart model the rmse values were constant after 110 generations and the optimal p s was 300 for the ga svr model the rmse values were constant after 130 generations and the optimal p s was 250 3 3 model testing for the testing stage six events from 2018 to 2020 corresponding to different datasets for each prediction time step were tested notably the six input combinations and their forecasting measures were analyzed to find the best predictor set subsequent analyses of the multistep ahead forecasts were based on these results of the best predictor set table 2 illustrates the performance of the three models with the six input combinations for the one hour ahead streamflow prediction according to table 2 the input combinations d3 and d6 had the best performance among the combinations however the d6 combination performed slightly better than the d3 combination the ga bart model of the d6 combination had the best performance with a rmse 25 12 m3 s mae 8 00 m3 s nse 0 96 and mape 9 0 whereas the ga svr and mlr had a rmse 30 30 m3 s and 30 47 m3 s mae 13 16 m3 s and 9 96 m3 s nse 0 94 and 0 93 and mape 39 5 and 20 04 respectively the tabulated results showed that the input combinations with more data from previous rainfall time steps d3 d4 d5 and d6 might perform better than the input combinations with fewer rainfall data d1 and d2 this can be further explained by fig 5 which shows the forecasting skills of the ga bart model for the one to six hour ahead streamflow predictions based on the six input combinations generally the combinations d3 d4 d5 and d6 produced lower rmse values fig 5 a and lower mae values fig 5 b than the d1 and d2 combinations in multistep ahead streamflow forecasting especially for three to six hour ahead predictions this result initially shows that achieving good hourly multistep predictions of streamflow requires an input combination of many previous steps notably the model based on the d6 input combination had the best forecasting skill in the time steps compared to the other combinations therefore the input combination d6 was selected to perform further testing and analysis for the remaining steps from t 2 to t 6 4 results 4 1 performance of the hybrid models the capabilities of the proposed ga bart model and the comparative ga svr and mlr models were evaluated based on the observed streamflow at the jungrang station in the urban basin this section provides a detailed predictability performance of the d6 dataset in forecasting the one to six hour ahead streamflow table 3 indicates the performance of ga bart ga svm and mlr in multistep ahead predictions based on the d6 dataset for the test events as the number of time steps increased the accuracy of the hybrid models typically declined for the one hour ahead prediction the three models had good forecasting skills in terms of the cc and nse however the ga bart outperformed the ga svr and mlr with a 5 18 m3 s and 5 35 m3 s lower rmse 5 16 m3 s and 1 96 m3 s lower mae and approximately 30 and 11 lower relative error mape respectively the ga bart had a better bias than the two comparative models for the first prediction step for the two hour ahead prediction both hybrid models yielded a similar performance with respect to rmse cc and nse however the ga bart performed better than the ga svr in terms of the mae mape and bias for the three hour ahead prediction both models performed similarly to the one hour ahead forecast except in terms of bias values the bias values of the ga bart and ga svr were equivalent to each other in the three hour ahead prediction the mlr had slightly lower measures in terms of the rmse cc and nse however the mlr had a better performance in terms of the mae and mape compared to the ga svr model for the three time steps 1 h 2 h and 3 h the performance of the two hybrid models in the four hour ahead prediction was similar to their performance in the two hour ahead time step the mlr had a poorer performance than the two hybrid models in terms of the five indicators for the four hour ahead forecast the forecasting skills of both models for the five and six hour ahead predictions were quite similar in the two time steps the ga bart performed better than the ga svr and mlr with a lower rmse value and higher cc and nse values the ga bart had a better bias value for the five hour ahead prediction and an equivalent bias value for the six hour ahead prediction compared to the ga svr the mlr performance was much poorer than the ga svr in the five and six hour ahead predictions generally the ga bart had a better forecasting skill than the ga svr and mlr fig 6 shows the performance of the models in terms of continuous six hour lead time predictions based on the test events the six hour lead time results were integrated from the multistep ahead models at each time step t as shown in fig 6 the ga bart outperformed the ga svr and mlr with lower rmse and mae values and higher cc values notably for cc measures the ga bart model yielded a significantly better performance than the ga svr for one hour to four hour lead times but the ga bart only performed similarly to the ga svr in the five hour and six hour lead times the mlr had slightly better rmse and mae measures for the one to four hour lead times fig 6 a and 6 b for the cc measure the mlr had a better performance for the one and two hour lead times however it had a remarkably poorer performance for the three to six hour lead times compared to the ga svr fig 7 presents an easy way to examine the performance of the three models in terms of hydrographs of the observed versus the one three and five step ahead predicted streamflow for four events 34 36 38 and 39 for the one hour ahead forecasts the three models captured the behavior of the time series streamflow well however the ga svr produced a notable underestimation of the second peak streamflow fig 7 a and an overestimation of the low flow period fig 7 d compared to the ga bart for events 34 and 36 respectively the mlr generated slight underestimations of the second peak streamflow fig 7 a and the low flow period fig 7 d compared to the ga bart the ga bart showed a slightly better performance when generating the third peak streamflow compared to the remaining two models for event 39 fig 7 j for the three hour ahead forecasts whereas the ga svr and mlr produced significantly underestimated peak streamflow predictions the ga bart generated acceptable peak streamflow forecasts for events 38 and 39 fig 7 h and k for the three hour ahead prediction for event 34 the mlr produced a better peak streamflow than the ga bart and ga svr for event 36 the ga bart overestimated the peak streamflow in comparison with the ga svr and mlr for the five hour ahead prediction similar to the three hour ahead time step the ga bart captured a better streamflow behavior than the ga svr for events 38 and 39 fig 7 f and l in addition the ga bart had a better performance when streamflow decreased compared to the ga svr and mlr for event 36 fig 7 f table 4 presents the time lag between the predicted and observed occurrences of the streamflow peaks for the tested events the ga bart outperformed the ga svr and mlr with fewer time lags of the streamflow peak from the four to six hour ahead predictions for events 36 37 and 38 the ga bart provided better time lags for the third streamflow peak for event 39 compared to the two comparative models the three models produced similar time lags for the multistep ahead predictions in event 35 the ga svr had slightly better time lags than the ga bart and mlr for event 34 however for event 34 when comprehensively considering all the performance variables especially in time series behavior the ga bart clearly produced a more reliable prediction than the ga svr and mlr fig 8 presents the scatter plots of the ga bart ga svr and mlr models for the t 1 t 3 and t 5 streamflow predictions as shown in fig 8 a the ga bart performed better than ga svr and mlr in terms of its high values of streamflow for the one hour ahead prediction although it was not better at measuring the cc compared to the other two models for the three and five hour ahead predictions the ga svr predicted more underestimated points than the ga bart and mlr especially for streamflow values larger than 600 m3 s notably the mlr generated more outliers and more abnormal forecasts the value of streamflow forecasts was equal to or close to zero compared to the ga bart and ga svr for the three and five hour time steps fig 8 b and 8 c in addition the ga bart had a larger cc value than the ga svr and mlr for the five hour ahead prediction 4 2 importance of input predictors first it is important to check the bart s assumption of the gibbs sampler convergence fig 9 shows four types of convergence diagnostics of the ga bart model for the one hour ahead prediction based on the d6 input combination fig 9 a b illustrates the bart performance during the burn in time which represents the changes in the variance σ 2 sigsq in fig 9 a and the acceptance ratio based on prior information fig 9 b fig 9 c d presents the average number of nodes and leaves across m trees fig 9 c and tree depth fig 9 d after burn in as seen in fig 9 the ga bart model had a stable evolution based on the acceptance rate and the given parameters after the 700th mcmc iteration one of the most important advantages of the bart model is its capability of evaluating the importance of the input predictors the input importance can be estimated by exploring the splitting rules in m trees in the mcmc iterations after burn in the relative importance of an input predictor is represented by its frequency and is selected by calculating the splitting rule across all posterior samples fig 10 presents the relative importance of the eighteen input predictors the ranges at the top of the bars represent the 95 confidence intervals of the input variables as seen in fig 10 all the considered predictors of the d6 dataset affect the streamflow forecasts of the steps for the prediction steps the most significant predictor affecting the streamflow forecasts was streamflow at the jungrang station at time step t with a relative importance of approximately 20 3 21 4 and 17 4 for the one three and five hour ahead predictions respectively for the one hour ahead prediction the map in the downstream subbasin at time step t and the water level at the singok station at time step t had relative importance values of 9 4 and 8 6 respectively fig 10 a the two following predictors were the water level at the wolgye station and the map in the upstream subbasin at time step t 1 which were measured as 7 3 and 6 8 respectively the relative importance of the remaining predictors decreased from 5 2 to 2 2 these results for the one hour ahead prediction reasonably reflected natural hydrological mechanisms and the routing of streamflow in the basin when the order of the significant input predictors was as follows the streamflow at the junrang station at time step t map in the downstream subbasin at time step t water level at the singok station at time step t and then the map in the upstream subbasin at time step t 1 for the three hour ahead prediction the map in the upstream subbasin at time step t and the water level at the singok station at time step t had relative importance values of 10 6 and 8 6 respectively fig 10 b the next two predictors were the map in the downstream subbasin at time step t 1 and the water level at the wolgye station which had measures of 8 1 and 7 8 respectively for the five hour ahead prediction after the highest impact of streamflow at the junrang station at time step t 17 4 the water level at the wolgye station and the map in the upstream subbasin at time step t had high proportions of 10 3 and 10 2 respectively fig 10 c notably the uncertainty of the predictors for the five hour ahead predictions was higher than that for the one and three hour ahead predictions especially for the rainfall predictors this uncertainty increased as the time step increased this phenomenon can be attributed to the decreasing accuracy of the forecasts with increasing prediction time steps 5 discussion the ga bart model s outperformance of other models can be explained by its superior structure namely its use of a fully bayesian probability approach its ability to treat high dimensional input data by variable selection and its interactions of additive tree structures the bart shares the same advanced features of two popular ensemble tree based approaches random forest and gradient boosting algorithms that combine predictions of many trees however as a bayesian tree based model the bart can provide regularization and prevent any single tree from dominating the total fit by using a set of priors for the structure and leaf parameters and a likelihood for the data in the terminal nodes specifically the bart considers tree structure and leaf nodes as unknown parameters that are estimated jointly in a single bayesian hierarchical model therefore the model can effectively treat high dimensional input predictors and easily calculate the effects of input predictors and their uncertainty analysis of the importance of the input predictors proved the ability of the bart model to generate a reasonable effect for each predictor the results of the 1 hour ahead prediction showed that the significant input predictors were streamflow at the junrang station and map in the downstream subbasin at time step t the water level at the singok station at time step t and map in the upstream subbasin at time step t 1 the impact level of the predictors clearly showed natural streamflow routing and was consistent with hydrological mechanisms in the basin when increasing the prediction time step the uncertainty of the input predictors increased the increased uncertainty of the predictors reflected the decreased accuracy of the bart model for long prediction time steps the correlation between the predictors and the target streamflow prediction became weaker at longer time steps compared to the one and two hour ahead time steps notably the rainfall predictor uncertainty significantly increased with steps although the ga bart model outperformed the ga svr and mlr models the ga bart model had some drawbacks that need to be discussed the ga bart overestimated streamflow predictions fig 7 e g and k and produced slight fluctuations in the streamflow behavior for longer range more hours ahead predictions fig 7 e f k and l the hybrid model produced large time lags for the five to six hour ahead predictions table 4 in addition the model had a relatively poor performance in terms of the cc 0 69 and nse 0 47 for the six hour ahead predictions these limitations might be related to the basin scale which is relatively small in a small basin the streamflow is very sensitive to hydrological variables especially rainfall variability generally the effectiveness of rainfall forecasting often deteriorates as the prediction step increases not only in physical models but also in data driven models therefore the prediction accuracy at five and six hours ahead normally decreases furthermore using historical data without changing other hydrological features and correlated parameters such as basin cover changes over multiple decades might be a source of error as mentioned above this study applied several models to predict the hourly multistep ahead streamflow for a small urban basin the training data were built from a long period of data from 2003 to 2017 with 33 heavy rainfall events the testing stage was conducted with six recent events from 2018 to 2020 in addition in this study we evaluated different datasets of input combinations to find an appropriate predictor set the best predictor set was determined according to its performance measures and then applied to the models in this study these abovementioned configurations ensured that the results could be generalized to basinswith the same conditions and characteristics however to explore the bart model for other types of basins a comprehensive investigation of the scope and capability of the model is required in future work the bart model should be examined at different spatiotemporal scales of the basin and compared with other powerful recent models in addition its ability to reasonably assess the importance of predictors can be leveraged for integration with other predictive machine learning models 6 conclusions effective urban flood control requires the ability to reliably predict the streamflow during heavy rainfall events accurate streamflow forecasting remains a critical need and has garnered considerable attention because of the complexity of hydrological mechanisms in this study we developed and examined the novel ga bart model and two comparative models ga svr and mlr the performance of the models was evaluated for multistep ahead predictions in the jungrang urban basin data from 39 heavy rain events were collected from rain gauges and hydrological stations from 2003 to 2020 the following conclusions were achieved from these results 1 the capabilities of the hybrid bart model and the optimal input predictors d6 for hourly multistep ahead streamflow forecasting were based on acceptable performance measures such as the rmse cc nse mae and mape 2 compared to the benchmark models ga svr and mlr the bart model can generate more reliable streamflow predictions than the ga svr with lower mape rmse and mae values higher cc and nse values and a better time lag and bias 3 in addition the bart model can provide a reasonable assessment of relative input predictors the assessment might help water resource managers improve the accuracy of forecasts and early flood warnings in the basin despite the limitations of five and six hour ahead forecasts i e overestimations of streamflow peak large time lags and poor cc and nse values the bart performed better than the benchmark models at these steps in this case the hybrid ga bart can be a good option among the available models for hourly streamflow forecasting in future studies the bart model should be investigated in combination with other machine learning models to take advantage of its ability to assess the importance of input predictors assessment of the bart model s performance at different spatial basin scales and temporal steps should be explored in addition to enhance hourly multistep ahead forecasts it might be necessary to consider other correlated predictors as discussed and periodic patterns from daily and monthly data declaration of competing interest

3682,urban flooding is a global metropolitan problem therefore establishing reliable streamflow forecasting models is critical for flood control and planning in urban areas furthermore assessing the importance and uncertainty of model predictors is useful for managers however these predictors are still underevaluated to address these concerns we developed a novel hybrid model ga bart that integrates a genetic algorithm ga with the bayesian additive regression tree bart model for hourly streamflow forecasting a case study was conducted in the jungrang urban basin which is located on the han river in south korea the model was built and evaluated based on data collected during 39 heavy rain events from 2003 to 2020 to compare the model s forecast capability a support vector regression model hybridized with a genetic algorithm ga svr and a multiple linear regression mlr model was constructed an analysis of multiple datasets including different input predictors was performed to define the optimal set for streamflow forecasting the results illustrated that the ga bart model outperformed the ga svr and mlr models in multistep ahead streamflow forecasts with improved measures of the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae relative error nash sutcliffe efficiency nse time lag and correlation coefficient cc in addition the ga bart model could reasonably determinethe relative importance of the input variables this study demonstrated that despite some disadvantages in the five and six hour step ahead forecasts the hybrid ga bart model can be a good option among the available models for hourly streamflow forecasting keywords bayesian additive regression trees hybrid model genetic algorithm streamflow forecasting urban flood 1 introduction urban flooding is becoming a critical challenge for metropolitan areas as global warming causes more frequent occurrences of unpredictable and extreme weather nguyen and bae 2020 wang et al 2019 hence streamflow forecasting to help mitigate the damage has recently received much attention from scientists chu et al 2021 ni et al 2020a sohrabi et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 streamflow forecasting plays a crucial role in water resource control especially in highly urbanized areas that are very vulnerable to flooding during heavy rainfall events berkhahn et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in addition managers can benefit from assessments of the importance and uncertainty of model predictors however such assessments are lacking in previous studies therefore streamflow forecasting with fine time steps and evaluations of predictors is a critical need for urban basins in addition to using physical based models many recent studies have shown a widespread use of data driven models in streamflow forecasting e g mosavi et al 2018 ni et al 2020b ren et al 2020 data driven methods are superior to physical based approaches because they do not consider the complex processes of rainfall runoff mechanisms and they can be easily implemented ren et al 2020 scientists have applied various statistical and data driven algorithms including the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis yaseen et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 artificial neural network based models freire et al 2019 prasad et al 2017 taormina and chau 2015 deep neural network models long short term memory lstm network and sequence to

support vector regression svr adnan et al 2020 luo et al 2019 and multiple linear regression mlr algorithms chokmani et al 2008 kim et al 2018 salmasi and abraham 2021 to solve hydrological problems and predict streamflow at different tempo spatial scales their research was successful in modeling complex hydrological mechanisms and produced reliable results in streamflow predictions mosavi et al 2018 compared with the abovementioned data driven methods tree based models have cheaper computation costs ni et al 2020b although other machine learning methods are similar to black box prediction models decision tree dt models provide a simple visualization of how the algorithms operate gharaei manesh et al 2016 and do not use any assumptions for predictor variables in recent years dt models have gained significant research attention for solving hydrological issues a variety of tree based algorithms such as the classification and regression tree cart ibrahim and karakurt 2013 lee and kim 2020 random forest rf abbasi et al 2020 carranza et al 2021 desai and ouarda 2021 and extreme gradient boosting xgboost algorithms naghibi et al 2020 nguyen et al 2021a ni et al 2020b zhang et al 2019 have been established and have produced promising results for runoff generation streamflow simulation and forecasting water potential assessment and drought prediction nevertheless the abovementioned tree based models and machine learning algorithms do not consider the importance and uncertainty of the predictor variables as an ensemble tree the bayesian additive regression tree bart uses problem solving techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of each predictor inspired by ensemble approaches and boosting algorithms the bart is characterized by a bayesian statistical model that includes a prior probability and a likelihood function chipman et al 2012 this method allows full posterior inference of the expected regression function and possible predictor effects at the boundary the bart is operated as a sum of tree ensemble which takes into account the effects of many different dts in a regression framework the fitting and inference of the model are executed by using an iterative bayesian backfitting markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach for generating samples from a posterior function as a result the bart is a probabilistic based model that is not only a powerful method but also allows a quantitative assessment of predictor uncertainty tan and roy 2019 in recent years the bart model has been widely applied to numerous academic studies including predictions on environmental issues kansanen et al 2019 kropat et al 2015 sevinc et al 2020 and in construction engineering luat et al 2020 zamanian et al 2020 due to its effectiveness the bart has been expanded to biostatistics and medical studies liang et al 2018 sparapani et al 2020 2016 yang liu et al 2015 and for its prediction of driver behavior tan et al 2017 2018 the algorithm has outperformed causal inference data analysis dorie et al 2019 hahn et al 2017 the bart was used to estimate daily concentrations of pm2 5 matter in the air zhang et al 2020 however to our knowledge the application of the bart to hydrological prediction studies needs to be explored in addition many previous hydrological studies using machine learning algorithms only evaluated the predictive results without assessing the importance and uncertainty of the predictors therefore in this study we explored the ability of the bart model to predict hourly multistep ahead streamflow for urban areas along with a consideration of the relative importance and uncertainty of its input predictors in our previous studies we used machine learning algorithms to correct the forecasted radar based rainfall for urban catchment inundation nguyen et al 2021c 2021b nguyen and bae 2020 river water level and streamflow forecasting le et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021a however this study is one of the first to use a bart to predict the hourly multistep ahead streamflow for urban basins and quantify the importance of its predictors furthermore this study considered various time step input sets to evaluate the best input set for developing the proposed model in hydrology some of the standalone artificial intelligence approaches do not perform efficiently in terms of accuracy and capturing the complexity of noise in hydrological data fotovatikhah et al 2018 to develop a robust machine learning ml model optimization algorithms integrated into the ml model must be used to tune the hyperparameters dodangeh et al 2020 instead of running trials and errors of nonhybrid approaches ml models with metaheuristic approaches can estimate the parameters automatically fotovatikhah et al 2018 a literature review reveals that hybrid ml models incorporating nature inspired algorithms e g genetic algorithms particle swarm optimization pso ant colony optimization aco differential evolution de invasive weed optimization iwo have been progressively developed for modeling and handling hydrological processes the genetic algorithm ga uses a stochastic search approach that is motivated by the concepts of evolution and natural selection the ga imitates the evolutionary mechanisms of biological entities including selection crossover and mutation scrucca 2013 zhang and geem 2019 the ga has been demonstrated to be completely useful for hydrometeorological applications chlumecký et al 2017 horton et al 2018 tegegne and kim 2020 nonlinear hydrological mechanisms in river system predictions were handled and improved using gas fotovatikhah et al 2018 therefore in the present study a ga was selected for integration with the bart model and to serve with svr as a benchmark model the goal of this research is to propose a novel approach of integrating a bart model with a genetic optimization algorithm referred to as ga bart for hourly streamflow forecasting in an urban basin the performance of the hybrid bart model is compared with two benchmark models including the svr model using the ga method ga svr and mlr various input sets are arranged to develop the prediction models which are based on previous hourly rainfall in addition the relative importance and uncertainty of input predictors are examined in this study the remaining sections of this article are presented as follows a general overview of the algorithms and performance indicators is illustrated in section 2 information about the case study data and model development is provided in section 3 the fourth and fifth sections present the results and a related discussion finally the summary of this paper is shown in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 multiple linear regression mlr the mlr is a popular statistical algorithm that formulates the relationship between explanatory input variables and a response output variable every independent variable x is associated with a value of the output variable y mlr is an extension algorithm of the ordinary least squares ols regression method the formulation of the mlr given n input variables can be defined as follows 1 y β 0 β 1 x i 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n where y is the dependent variable x i is an explanatory input variable β 0 is the y intercept constant term β i is the slope coefficient for each explanatory variable and is the error term of the model known as the residuals in a mlr model the parameters are tuned in such a way that they obtain the best agreement between the predicted and observed values during the training stage sahour et al 2020 ideally the mlr model would have data points that are precisely aligned with the fitted regression line 2 2 support vector regression svr svr which was first proposed by vapnik 1995 is an extended version of the regression of a support vector machine svm that includes a module of classification algorithm the svr algorithm seeks a mapping of correlation formulations to fit the training dataset to a higher dimensional characteristic space the algorithm uses a structural risk minimization approach to solve the formulation luo et al 2019 vapnik 2013 if m training data samples are x i y i i m where i 1 2 m x i denotes the vector of an input and y i presents the corresponding output the mapping formulation is defined as follows 2 f ω ϕ x b where ϕ denotes nonlinear mapping ω is the slope vector and b is the offset svr uses a loss function and an objective function to acquire the regression parameters in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively the functions enable the svr algorithm to avoid overfitting the training data samples 3 l f x i y i 0 i f f x i y i ε f x i y i ε i f f x i y i ε 4 m i n 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 m l f x i y i m i n 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 m ξ i ξ i subject to f x i y i ε ξ i y i f x i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where ε presents a positive error threshold ξ i and ξ i are the slack variables of the i th sample from ε and c denotes the regularized constant estimated from the complexity of the model and the empirical accumulative error luo et al 2019 when c decreases the learning rate increases and the empirical risk decreases dodangeh et al 2020 to solve the objective function eq 3 lagrange multipliers are applied and then the nonlinear regression function is represented as follows 5 f x i 1 m ζ i ζ i k x x i b where ζ i and ζ i denote the lagrange coefficients k x x i presents the kernel function and k x x i ϕ x ϕ x i in this study the nonlinear kernel function named the radial basis was used the parameters sigma and c of the radial kernel function were optimized by a genetic algorithm 2 3 bayesian additive regression trees barts first developed by chipman et al 2012 the bart is known as the bayesian approach for flexibly estimating nonparametric functions and nonlinear problems with high dimensional input data the bart combines the concepts of bayesian inference with sum of tree ensemble methods in addition the bart algorithm uses the mcmc approach to estimate the uncertainties of the data and the developed model tan and roy 2019 let y represents an output that corresponds to the d dimensional input vector x x 1 x 2 x d the formal definitions of bart can be expressed as 6 y f x ε i ε i n 0 σ 2 7 f x j 1 m g x t j m j where t j presents the j th binary tree structure m j denotes the terminal node parameters related to t j m is the regression tree number ε i is an error term that has a normal distribution with variance σ 2 and f denotes the sum of regression trees g x t j m j a single regression tree of the bart is characterized by the parameters t m each regression tree g x t j m j represents a complete tree which includes a root and two node sets terminal nodes and interior nodes a tree is formed by decision rules that determine the interior nodes x i c where c is the splitting threshold value and x i denotes the splitting variable in a leaf node each x value is connected to an individual terminal node and is assigned a scalar μ j m μ 1 μ b b denotes the total number of leaves in eq 6 the function g x t j m j assigns μ ij to x in the bart algorithm a prior is applied to all the parameters of the sum of trees model t j m j and σ to avoid the undue influence of a single tree chipman et al 2012 the regularization prior is formed as 8 p t j m j σ p σ j m p μ ij t j p t j where the tree parameters t j m j are not interdependent and are independent of σ and the vector parameters of terminal nodes of every tree are assumed to be independent within the prior the prior p t j is divided into three aspects 1 the probability of a nonterminal node at depth d 0 1 2 is controlled by 9 α 1 d β α 0 1 β 0 2 the distribution of the splitting threshold value c at each interior node and 3 the distribution of the decision rule given in each interior node for p μ ij t j the conjugate normal distribution n μ μ σ μ 2 was used in the prior the hyperparameters μ μ and σ μ are chosen so that the sum of μ ij under the sum of trees models e y x with a high probability is between y max and y min the actual min and max of y in the dataset for tree number m the selection conditions of μ μ and σ μ are m μ μ k m σ μ y min and m μ μ k m σ μ y max the default k value is 2 and can be optimized in the training stage for p σ the inverse chi square distribution is used σ 2 ν λ χ ν 2 a data informed prior method is utilized to specify the hyperparameters ν and λ the data informed prior method in this case was used to allocate a substantial probability to the whole range of probable values of σ to avoid overconcentration and overdispersion the posterior distribution is induced from the prior by using an iterative bayesian back fitting mcmc method for sampling chipman et al 2012 according to chipman et al 2012 the iterative back fitting mcmc algorithm overcomes the limitations of the single tree mcmc model such as the quick gradation of a single large tree and the tendency to get stuck in the local neighborhood of that tree the posterior distribution is presented as follows 10 p t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 y l y t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 p t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 where l denotes the likelihood function that can be defined as 11 l y t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 n l y n t j μ j j 1 m σ 2 in this study the hyperparameters m k α β and ν were adjusted automatically by the genetic optimization algorithm the following sections briefly introduce information about the genetic algorithm 2 4 genetic algorithm genetic algorithms gas developed by goldberg 1989 and holland 1975 are motivated by the natural phenomenon of biological evolution gas use nature inspired operators including selection crossover and mutation operators gas identify the optimal values in a complex search range by using stochastic optimization the method has the flexibility to allow optimization of continuous and discontinuous ranges regardless of whether they are constrained or unconstrained fig 1 shows the ga scheme diagram the three nature inspired operators are briefly presented below 2 4 1 selection operator at the beginning of the algorithm the generation population is created randomly in the search space the parent derived chromosomes are chosen from the population based on their selection probability then the fitness value is obtained for each chromosome the elements that have better objective values are properly selected for the next population 2 4 2 crossover operator a new chromosome is generated by exchanging its parent genes old generation of chromosomes in the selection stage the crossover operator reduces genetic and population diversity by facilitating the combination of beneficial genes in this study a uniform crossover method was applied to change the chromosomes from an old generation to a new generation 2 4 3 mutation operator after new chromosomes are created some of them can be mutated with a random probability mutation shows the change of a chromosomal gene in which a gene can be added to or deleted from the genes of a population the mutation operator works to prevent an untimely convergence therefore it increases the likelihood of generating better chromosomes 2 5 performance measures in this study we used graphical and statistical performance measures that are widely used in hydrological studies seven statistical indicators including the mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient cc nash sutcliffe efficiency nse time lag tl bias and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the model s performance these seven performance measures can provide a comprehensive evaluation of the closeness of a predicted behavior to observations the advantages and disadvantages of the indicators are described in moriasi et al 2015 the indicator equations are presented as follows 12 rmse 1 n i 1 n sf i pre sf i obs 2 13 cc i 1 n sf i pre sf mean pre sf i obs sf mean obs i 1 n sf i pre sf mean pre 2 i 1 n sf i obs sf mean obs 2 14 nse 1 i 1 n sf i obs sf i pre 2 i 1 n sf i obs sf mean obs 2 15 tl t pre t obs 16 bias i 1 n sf i obs sf i pre n 17 mae i 1 n sf i obs sf i pre n 18 mape i 1 n sf i obs sf i pre sf i obs n 100 where sf i pre and sf i obs are the predicted and observed streamflow at time step i respectively sf mean obs is the average value of the streamflow and sf max pre and sf max obs are the predicted and observed peaks of the streamflow respectively 3 materials and model development 3 1 study area and data preparation the jungrang urban basin located in the lower part of the han river basin is divided into an upstream subbasin and a downstream subbasin which together cover a total area of 299 87 km2 the downstream subbasin is part of the seoul metropolitan area which is highly urbanized in the city of seoul urban floods normally occur within a few hours of heavy rainfall events this region is characterized by a continental monsoon climate with an uneven distribution of precipitation throughout the year hence the annual precipitation in this city 1200 1600 mm is higher than in other urban areas at the same latitude lei et al 2021 heavy rainfall events normally occur from june to september annually because the downstream part of the jungrang basin is a lower lying area with a limited drainage capacity the basin has one of the highest flood risks in the area lei et al 2021 historical flood events caused significant damage to the jungrang basin in 2006 2010 and 2011 therefore since hourly streamflow predictions for this basin are needed the jungrang urban basin was selected as a case study fig 2 depicts the location of the jungrang basin in south korea rain gauges and hydrological stations in this study we collected observed rainfall data from ten automatic weather station aws gauges of the korean meteorological administration kma and the water resources management information system wamis the kma rain gauges are identified by the ids 406 407 408 409 424 532 598 and 599 the wamis gauges are identified by the ids 10 184 010 and 10184125 we collected streamflow and water level data from the han river flood control office hrfco for the jungrang wolgye and singok stations the temporal resolution of the data is one hour table 1 presents the heavy rainfall events used in this study the events numbered 1 to 33 were used for the training and validation stages six events from numbers 34 to 39 were used for the testing stage the time series river streamflow depends on many natural factors such as rainfall underground recharge groundwater level and evaporation unlike daily or monthly predictions the contribution of evaporation which is governed mainly by radiation and wind speed might be negligible for hourly predictions rainfall data are a significant forcing input for not only hydrological models but also for data driven methods in this work the mean areal precipitation map of the upstream and downstream parts were used as the main predictor variables this separation of rainfall by subbasin can significantly contribute to the model s accuracy and optimize the computation time and complexity of the data driven models map data were estimated from the rain gauges by using the thiessen method in this study we used a combination of inputs that included the map of the subbasins at time step t and previous time steps e g t 1 t 2 and water level and streamflow of the stations at time step t for multistep ahead streamflow predictions notably the water level and streamflow predictors at time step t can be considered as indicators of both groundwater and initial streamflow conditions the sets of combination inputs were created with different previous time steps of rainfall to find the best predictor set in this work six previous time steps were examined due to the small size of the basin for 1 hour ahead prediction the input combinations were represented as follows 19 d 1 s f j t 1 mapu t mapu t 1 mapd t mapd t 1 wls t wlw t sfj t 20 d 2 s f j t 1 mapu t m a p u t 2 mapd t mapd t 2 wls t wlw t sfj t 21 d 3 s f j

d 6 s f j t 1 mapu t m a p u t 6 mapd t mapd t 6 wls t wlw t sfj t where sfj t and sfj t 1 is the streamflow of time steps t and t 1 at jungrang station respectively mapu t 1 mapu t 2 mapu t 3 mapu t 4 mapu t 5 and mapu t 6 denote the map of the upstream subbasin at the six previous time steps mapd t 1 mapd t 2 mapd t 3 mapd t 4 mapd t 5 and mapd t 6 denote the map of the downstream subbasin at the previous time steps wls t and wlw t denote the water level of time step t at the singok station and wolgye station respectively the models for the remaining time steps used the same input combinations as in the 1 hour step 3 2 model implementation and training in this study the hybrid models ga bart and ga svr were developed based on the r packages bartmachine kapelner and bleich 2020 kernlab karatzoglou et al 2019 and ga scrucca 2019 2013 for predicting streamflow at the jungrang gyo station there were six training datasets that included 33 events from 2003 to 2017 the input variables consisted of the map data for the subbasins water level of the two stations singok and wolgye and streamflow at the jungrang station the target variable was the multistep ahead streamflow of the jungrang station for the training stage to find the best population size for the ga the parametric approach was applied to the 1 hour ahead streamflow prediction with the dataset d3 the same values of the ga parameter were used to optimize the bart and svr for the remaining datasets and time steps in the ga bart model five hyperparameters including the number of trees m base hyperparameter in the prior tree α power parameter in prior tree β shrinkage parameter for the prior probability k and degrees of freedom for the inverse prior nu were considered to find the optimal sets by using the ga method the definitions for the hyperparameters can be found in the abovementioned documents in this work the values for m α β k and nu were searched in the ranges of 10 100 0 1 1 5 1 4 and 1 5 respectively the search details of the ga algorithm for the bart model and the sensitivity analysis of the parameters were referred to in previous studies chipman et al 2012 luat et al 2020 tan and roy 2019 to develop the hybrid ga svr model two parameters of the svr model using the radial basis kernel sigma and c were searched in the ranges of 0 005 2 and 0 01 10 respectively in the hybrid models the rmse was utilized as a fitness function of the optimization process fig 3 the k fold cross validation approach was used to avoid overfitting in training the models the 5 fold cross validation method was set for the two hybrid models ga bart and ga svr because it was commonly used in previous studies james et al 2013 ni et al 2020b for the ga algorithm integrated with the bart and svr the size of the population p s and the maximum generation number n gmax were defined by a parametric approach the crossover rate r c and mutation rate r m of the ga operator were selected to be 0 7 and 0 03 respectively and were set at the initial step specifically the uniform crossover approach was used in the present research because it is the most advanced crossover compared to the one point crossover and two point crossover hu and di paolo 2009 syswerda 1989 this method allows the child chromosomes to consider all the possibilities of replicating different genes from its parents by using a mixing rate to generate chromosomal genes fig 2 to find the appropriate p s ten ga bart models using the 5 fold cross validation method and a set of p s values 20 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 500 were developed the same procedure was applied to the ga svr model fig 4 shows the performances of the ga bart and ga svr corresponding to the p s set for the ga bart model the rmse values were constant after 110 generations and the optimal p s was 300 for the ga svr model the rmse values were constant after 130 generations and the optimal p s was 250 3 3 model testing for the testing stage six events from 2018 to 2020 corresponding to different datasets for each prediction time step were tested notably the six input combinations and their forecasting measures were analyzed to find the best predictor set subsequent analyses of the multistep ahead forecasts were based on these results of the best predictor set table 2 illustrates the performance of the three models with the six input combinations for the one hour ahead streamflow prediction according to table 2 the input combinations d3 and d6 had the best performance among the combinations however the d6 combination performed slightly better than the d3 combination the ga bart model of the d6 combination had the best performance with a rmse 25 12 m3 s mae 8 00 m3 s nse 0 96 and mape 9 0 whereas the ga svr and mlr had a rmse 30 30 m3 s and 30 47 m3 s mae 13 16 m3 s and 9 96 m3 s nse 0 94 and 0 93 and mape 39 5 and 20 04 respectively the tabulated results showed that the input combinations with more data from previous rainfall time steps d3 d4 d5 and d6 might perform better than the input combinations with fewer rainfall data d1 and d2 this can be further explained by fig 5 which shows the forecasting skills of the ga bart model for the one to six hour ahead streamflow predictions based on the six input combinations generally the combinations d3 d4 d5 and d6 produced lower rmse values fig 5 a and lower mae values fig 5 b than the d1 and d2 combinations in multistep ahead streamflow forecasting especially for three to six hour ahead predictions this result initially shows that achieving good hourly multistep predictions of streamflow requires an input combination of many previous steps notably the model based on the d6 input combination had the best forecasting skill in the time steps compared to the other combinations therefore the input combination d6 was selected to perform further testing and analysis for the remaining steps from t 2 to t 6 4 results 4 1 performance of the hybrid models the capabilities of the proposed ga bart model and the comparative ga svr and mlr models were evaluated based on the observed streamflow at the jungrang station in the urban basin this section provides a detailed predictability performance of the d6 dataset in forecasting the one to six hour ahead streamflow table 3 indicates the performance of ga bart ga svm and mlr in multistep ahead predictions based on the d6 dataset for the test events as the number of time steps increased the accuracy of the hybrid models typically declined for the one hour ahead prediction the three models had good forecasting skills in terms of the cc and nse however the ga bart outperformed the ga svr and mlr with a 5 18 m3 s and 5 35 m3 s lower rmse 5 16 m3 s and 1 96 m3 s lower mae and approximately 30 and 11 lower relative error mape respectively the ga bart had a better bias than the two comparative models for the first prediction step for the two hour ahead prediction both hybrid models yielded a similar performance with respect to rmse cc and nse however the ga bart performed better than the ga svr in terms of the mae mape and bias for the three hour ahead prediction both models performed similarly to the one hour ahead forecast except in terms of bias values the bias values of the ga bart and ga svr were equivalent to each other in the three hour ahead prediction the mlr had slightly lower measures in terms of the rmse cc and nse however the mlr had a better performance in terms of the mae and mape compared to the ga svr model for the three time steps 1 h 2 h and 3 h the performance of the two hybrid models in the four hour ahead prediction was similar to their performance in the two hour ahead time step the mlr had a poorer performance than the two hybrid models in terms of the five indicators for the four hour ahead forecast the forecasting skills of both models for the five and six hour ahead predictions were quite similar in the two time steps the ga bart performed better than the ga svr and mlr with a lower rmse value and higher cc and nse values the ga bart had a better bias value for the five hour ahead prediction and an equivalent bias value for the six hour ahead prediction compared to the ga svr the mlr performance was much poorer than the ga svr in the five and six hour ahead predictions generally the ga bart had a better forecasting skill than the ga svr and mlr fig 6 shows the performance of the models in terms of continuous six hour lead time predictions based on the test events the six hour lead time results were integrated from the multistep ahead models at each time step t as shown in fig 6 the ga bart outperformed the ga svr and mlr with lower rmse and mae values and higher cc values notably for cc measures the ga bart model yielded a significantly better performance than the ga svr for one hour to four hour lead times but the ga bart only performed similarly to the ga svr in the five hour and six hour lead times the mlr had slightly better rmse and mae measures for the one to four hour lead times fig 6 a and 6 b for the cc measure the mlr had a better performance for the one and two hour lead times however it had a remarkably poorer performance for the three to six hour lead times compared to the ga svr fig 7 presents an easy way to examine the performance of the three models in terms of hydrographs of the observed versus the one three and five step ahead predicted streamflow for four events 34 36 38 and 39 for the one hour ahead forecasts the three models captured the behavior of the time series streamflow well however the ga svr produced a notable underestimation of the second peak streamflow fig 7 a and an overestimation of the low flow period fig 7 d compared to the ga bart for events 34 and 36 respectively the mlr generated slight underestimations of the second peak streamflow fig 7 a and the low flow period fig 7 d compared to the ga bart the ga bart showed a slightly better performance when generating the third peak streamflow compared to the remaining two models for event 39 fig 7 j for the three hour ahead forecasts whereas the ga svr and mlr produced significantly underestimated peak streamflow predictions the ga bart generated acceptable peak streamflow forecasts for events 38 and 39 fig 7 h and k for the three hour ahead prediction for event 34 the mlr produced a better peak streamflow than the ga bart and ga svr for event 36 the ga bart overestimated the peak streamflow in comparison with the ga svr and mlr for the five hour ahead prediction similar to the three hour ahead time step the ga bart captured a better streamflow behavior than the ga svr for events 38 and 39 fig 7 f and l in addition the ga bart had a better performance when streamflow decreased compared to the ga svr and mlr for event 36 fig 7 f table 4 presents the time lag between the predicted and observed occurrences of the streamflow peaks for the tested events the ga bart outperformed the ga svr and mlr with fewer time lags of the streamflow peak from the four to six hour ahead predictions for events 36 37 and 38 the ga bart provided better time lags for the third streamflow peak for event 39 compared to the two comparative models the three models produced similar time lags for the multistep ahead predictions in event 35 the ga svr had slightly better time lags than the ga bart and mlr for event 34 however for event 34 when comprehensively considering all the performance variables especially in time series behavior the ga bart clearly produced a more reliable prediction than the ga svr and mlr fig 8 presents the scatter plots of the ga bart ga svr and mlr models for the t 1 t 3 and t 5 streamflow predictions as shown in fig 8 a the ga bart performed better than ga svr and mlr in terms of its high values of streamflow for the one hour ahead prediction although it was not better at measuring the cc compared to the other two models for the three and five hour ahead predictions the ga svr predicted more underestimated points than the ga bart and mlr especially for streamflow values larger than 600 m3 s notably the mlr generated more outliers and more abnormal forecasts the value of streamflow forecasts was equal to or close to zero compared to the ga bart and ga svr for the three and five hour time steps fig 8 b and 8 c in addition the ga bart had a larger cc value than the ga svr and mlr for the five hour ahead prediction 4 2 importance of input predictors first it is important to check the bart s assumption of the gibbs sampler convergence fig 9 shows four types of convergence diagnostics of the ga bart model for the one hour ahead prediction based on the d6 input combination fig 9 a b illustrates the bart performance during the burn in time which represents the changes in the variance σ 2 sigsq in fig 9 a and the acceptance ratio based on prior information fig 9 b fig 9 c d presents the average number of nodes and leaves across m trees fig 9 c and tree depth fig 9 d after burn in as seen in fig 9 the ga bart model had a stable evolution based on the acceptance rate and the given parameters after the 700th mcmc iteration one of the most important advantages of the bart model is its capability of evaluating the importance of the input predictors the input importance can be estimated by exploring the splitting rules in m trees in the mcmc iterations after burn in the relative importance of an input predictor is represented by its frequency and is selected by calculating the splitting rule across all posterior samples fig 10 presents the relative importance of the eighteen input predictors the ranges at the top of the bars represent the 95 confidence intervals of the input variables as seen in fig 10 all the considered predictors of the d6 dataset affect the streamflow forecasts of the steps for the prediction steps the most significant predictor affecting the streamflow forecasts was streamflow at the jungrang station at time step t with a relative importance of approximately 20 3 21 4 and 17 4 for the one three and five hour ahead predictions respectively for the one hour ahead prediction the map in the downstream subbasin at time step t and the water level at the singok station at time step t had relative importance values of 9 4 and 8 6 respectively fig 10 a the two following predictors were the water level at the wolgye station and the map in the upstream subbasin at time step t 1 which were measured as 7 3 and 6 8 respectively the relative importance of the remaining predictors decreased from 5 2 to 2 2 these results for the one hour ahead prediction reasonably reflected natural hydrological mechanisms and the routing of streamflow in the basin when the order of the significant input predictors was as follows the streamflow at the junrang station at time step t map in the downstream subbasin at time step t water level at the singok station at time step t and then the map in the upstream subbasin at time step t 1 for the three hour ahead prediction the map in the upstream subbasin at time step t and the water level at the singok station at time step t had relative importance values of 10 6 and 8 6 respectively fig 10 b the next two predictors were the map in the downstream subbasin at time step t 1 and the water level at the wolgye station which had measures of 8 1 and 7 8 respectively for the five hour ahead prediction after the highest impact of streamflow at the junrang station at time step t 17 4 the water level at the wolgye station and the map in the upstream subbasin at time step t had high proportions of 10 3 and 10 2 respectively fig 10 c notably the uncertainty of the predictors for the five hour ahead predictions was higher than that for the one and three hour ahead predictions especially for the rainfall predictors this uncertainty increased as the time step increased this phenomenon can be attributed to the decreasing accuracy of the forecasts with increasing prediction time steps 5 discussion the ga bart model s outperformance of other models can be explained by its superior structure namely its use of a fully bayesian probability approach its ability to treat high dimensional input data by variable selection and its interactions of additive tree structures the bart shares the same advanced features of two popular ensemble tree based approaches random forest and gradient boosting algorithms that combine predictions of many trees however as a bayesian tree based model the bart can provide regularization and prevent any single tree from dominating the total fit by using a set of priors for the structure and leaf parameters and a likelihood for the data in the terminal nodes specifically the bart considers tree structure and leaf nodes as unknown parameters that are estimated jointly in a single bayesian hierarchical model therefore the model can effectively treat high dimensional input predictors and easily calculate the effects of input predictors and their uncertainty analysis of the importance of the input predictors proved the ability of the bart model to generate a reasonable effect for each predictor the results of the 1 hour ahead prediction showed that the significant input predictors were streamflow at the junrang station and map in the downstream subbasin at time step t the water level at the singok station at time step t and map in the upstream subbasin at time step t 1 the impact level of the predictors clearly showed natural streamflow routing and was consistent with hydrological mechanisms in the basin when increasing the prediction time step the uncertainty of the input predictors increased the increased uncertainty of the predictors reflected the decreased accuracy of the bart model for long prediction time steps the correlation between the predictors and the target streamflow prediction became weaker at longer time steps compared to the one and two hour ahead time steps notably the rainfall predictor uncertainty significantly increased with steps although the ga bart model outperformed the ga svr and mlr models the ga bart model had some drawbacks that need to be discussed the ga bart overestimated streamflow predictions fig 7 e g and k and produced slight fluctuations in the streamflow behavior for longer range more hours ahead predictions fig 7 e f k and l the hybrid model produced large time lags for the five to six hour ahead predictions table 4 in addition the model had a relatively poor performance in terms of the cc 0 69 and nse 0 47 for the six hour ahead predictions these limitations might be related to the basin scale which is relatively small in a small basin the streamflow is very sensitive to hydrological variables especially rainfall variability generally the effectiveness of rainfall forecasting often deteriorates as the prediction step increases not only in physical models but also in data driven models therefore the prediction accuracy at five and six hours ahead normally decreases furthermore using historical data without changing other hydrological features and correlated parameters such as basin cover changes over multiple decades might be a source of error as mentioned above this study applied several models to predict the hourly multistep ahead streamflow for a small urban basin the training data were built from a long period of data from 2003 to 2017 with 33 heavy rainfall events the testing stage was conducted with six recent events from 2018 to 2020 in addition in this study we evaluated different datasets of input combinations to find an appropriate predictor set the best predictor set was determined according to its performance measures and then applied to the models in this study these abovementioned configurations ensured that the results could be generalized to basinswith the same conditions and characteristics however to explore the bart model for other types of basins a comprehensive investigation of the scope and capability of the model is required in future work the bart model should be examined at different spatiotemporal scales of the basin and compared with other powerful recent models in addition its ability to reasonably assess the importance of predictors can be leveraged for integration with other predictive machine learning models 6 conclusions effective urban flood control requires the ability to reliably predict the streamflow during heavy rainfall events accurate streamflow forecasting remains a critical need and has garnered considerable attention because of the complexity of hydrological mechanisms in this study we developed and examined the novel ga bart model and two comparative models ga svr and mlr the performance of the models was evaluated for multistep ahead predictions in the jungrang urban basin data from 39 heavy rain events were collected from rain gauges and hydrological stations from 2003 to 2020 the following conclusions were achieved from these results 1 the capabilities of the hybrid bart model and the optimal input predictors d6 for hourly multistep ahead streamflow forecasting were based on acceptable performance measures such as the rmse cc nse mae and mape 2 compared to the benchmark models ga svr and mlr the bart model can generate more reliable streamflow predictions than the ga svr with lower mape rmse and mae values higher cc and nse values and a better time lag and bias 3 in addition the bart model can provide a reasonable assessment of relative input predictors the assessment might help water resource managers improve the accuracy of forecasts and early flood warnings in the basin despite the limitations of five and six hour ahead forecasts i e overestimations of streamflow peak large time lags and poor cc and nse values the bart performed better than the benchmark models at these steps in this case the hybrid ga bart can be a good option among the available models for hourly streamflow forecasting in future studies the bart model should be investigated in combination with other machine learning models to take advantage of its ability to assess the importance of input predictors assessment of the bart model s performance at different spatial basin scales and temporal steps should be explored in addition to enhance hourly multistep ahead forecasts it might be necessary to consider other correlated predictors as discussed and periodic patterns from daily and monthly data declaration of competing interest

3683,whether or not the impact of warming on mountain snow and runoff can be offset by precipitation increases has not been well examined but it is crucially important for future downstream water supply using the physically based cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm elasticity percent change in runoff divided by change in a climate forcing and the sensitivity of snow regimes to perturbations were investigated in three well instrumented mountain research basins spanning the northern north american cordillera hourly meteorological observations were perturbed using air temperature and precipitation changes and were then used to force hydrological models for each basin in all three basins lower temperature sensitivities of annual runoff volume 6 c 1 and higher sensitivities of peak snowpack 17 c 1 showed that annual runoff was far less sensitive to temperature than the snow regime higher and lower precipitation elasticities of annual runoff 1 5 2 1 and peak snowpack 0 7 1 1 indicated that the runoff change is primarily attributed to precipitation change and secondarily to warming a low discrepancy between observed and simulated precipitation elasticities showed that the model results are reliable and one can conduct sensitivity analysis the air temperature elasticities however must be interpreted with care as the projected warmings range beyond the observed temperatures and hence it is not possible to test their reliability simulations using multiple elevations showed that the timing of peak snowpack was most sensitive to temperature for the range of warming expected from north american climate model simulations the impacts of warming on annual runoff but not on peak snowpack can be offset by the size of precipitation increases projected for the near future period 2041 2070 to offset the impact of 2 c warming on annual runoff precipitation would need to increase by less than 5 in all three basins to offset the impact of 2 c warming on peak snowpack however precipitation would need to increase by 12 in wolf creek in yukon territory 18 in marmot creek in the canadian rockies and an amount greater than the maximum projected at reynolds mountain in idaho the role of increased precipitation as a compensator for the impact of warming on snowpack is more effective at the highest elevations and higher latitudes increased precipitation leads to resilient and strongly coupled snow and runoff regimes contrasting sharply with the sensitive and weakly coupled regimes at low elevations and in temperate climate zones

offset by precipitation increases this has not been resolved in the literature e g arnell 1999 prowse et al 2006 luo et al 2008 the specific objective for this sensitivity analysis is therefore to quantify the response of simulated mountain hydrological processes to changes in air temperature and precipitation associated with future climate change 2 data sources three well instrumented and therefore data rich headwater research basins located in the northern north american cordillera were used to simulate potential hydrological responses to warming and precipitation changes wolf creek yukon territory canada marmot creek alberta canada and reynolds mountain east hereafter reynolds mountain idaho usa fig 1 the availability of long term data from multiple hydrometeorological stations

temperature relative humidity wind speed incoming shortwave radiation precipitation and streamflow discharge for each basin were used consistent with the ideal gas law relative humidity was held constant to allow water vapour pressure to change with temperature the forcing data are publicly available from 1993 to 2011 for wolf creek rasouli et al 2019c from 2006 to 2013 for marmot creek fang et al 2019 from 1984 to 2008 for reynolds mountain reba et al 2011 all three basins are snow dominated under the current climate and are partially covered by coniferous forests at lower altitudes wolf creek has spruce and pine forests marmot creek has larch fir spruce and pine forests and reynolds mountain has fir pine and aspen forests all elevations in wolf creek and the high elevations in marmot creek are very cold a cold snow season with high precipitation leads to a nine month snow season at high elevations in marmot creek high wind speeds in the alpine zones of all three basins redistribute snow by wind transport and result in substantive blowing snow sublimation losses needleleaf canopy snow interception and sublimation losses from intercepted snow are important in all three basins air temperatures of the forested elevations in wolf creek are lower than for the alpine zone in winter due to strong inversions in the yukon river valley in contrast reynolds mountain and lower elevations in marmot creek have warmer air temperatures with fewer freezing days making these more sensitive to warming 3 methods 3 1 hydrological modelling snow and runoff regimes are simulated using models created with the physically based crhm platform pomeroy et al 2007 models for each basin were developed based on elevation ranges of slope and aspect and vegetation type modules that describe the major hydrological mechanisms in cold regions and used in this study include 1 radiation module that computes shortwave and longwave irradiance and adjusts the shortwave radiation on slopes 2 albedo module that estimates snow and snow free surface albedos 3 canopy module that estimates the sub canopy short and longwave irradiance and turbulent transfer to snow and the interception of snowfall and rainfall and its subsequent drip unloading sublimation and or evaporation from the forest canopy 4 blowing snow module that simulates the wind redistribution of blowing snow from one hydrological response unit hru to another including blowing snow sublimation losses 5 energy balance snowmelt and surface sublimation module that estimates snowmelt net radiation sensible heat latent heat ground heat advection from rainfall and in internal energy changes 6 infiltration module that estimates snowmelt and rainfall infiltration into frozen and unfrozen soils and surface runoff if snowmelt or rainfall exceeds the infiltration rate 7 evaporation module that estimates actual evapotranspiration from unsaturated surfaces using an energy balance and extension of penman s equation to the unsaturated case and from wetted surfaces including lakes and stream channels priestley and taylor 1972 8 soil and hillslope module that estimates soil moisture depressional storage surface and sub surface flows and moisture withdraws by roots in two soil layers and groundwater discharge in a saturated groundwater layer horizontal and vertical drainage from the soil and groundwater layers and hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated zone are estimated using darcy hubbert 1956 and brooks and corey 1964 relationships and 9 routing module that estimates runoff lag and route timing the crhm models for each mountain basin were developed and evaluated with basin observations as per fang et al 2013 rasouli et al 2014 rasouli et al 2015 and rasouli 2017 and were then used to assess the elasticity and sensitivity of the hydrological response to climate change by perturbing the model forcings the models were run using hrus that are spatially discretized based on vegetation type and height land slope and aspect and soil depth the spatial resolution of the crhm models was that of the hrus which had different sizes ranging from less than 1 km2 to greater than 20 km2 and the temporal resolution was hourly hrus were aggregated into three groups of alpine shrub tundra and forest for wolf creek four groups of alpine treeline forest and forest clearings for marmot creek and four groups of blowing snow source sink sublimation and sheltered from the wind for reynolds mountain these divisions were based on topographic exposure and vegetation height pomeroy et al 1997 blowing snow sink hrus included drift riparian and tall vegetation hrus the forested landscapes were divided into those that are subject to interception and subsequent sublimation evergreen trees and those that are cleared gaps or have minimal winter interception capacity sheltered from the wind pomeroy et al 2002 the sensitivity experiments use the crhm basin models driven with perturbed forcings to simulate outputs such as snowpack and the timing and magnitude of runoff to assess the precipitation and air temperature elasticity of the snowpack and runoff the sensitivities of interest are the hydrological responses to increases in air temperature and changes in precipitation that use the observed time series of air temperature and precipitation perturbed changes in the ranges projected by climate models under the special report on emissions scenarios sres a2 business as usual and the representative concentration pathways rcps and are consistent with the recently defined shared socioeconomic pathways ssps of global change for these three basins rather than simulations based upon individual climate models this linear sensitivity analysis and associated elasticities provide an assessment of the scale of alteration of the hydrological cycle in mountain basins within the range estimated by climate change predictions this approach illustrates how both the individual and the combination of changes in air temperature and precipitation might induce hydrological changes in these basins knowing how combinations of warming and precipitation changes induce future hydrological change in mountain basins from northern to mid latitudes can be used to assess the possible impacts of climate change 3 2 climate perturbation sensitivity a climate perturbation sensitivity method is introduced here in which the current climate is perturbed based on projected future climatological changes with this method a climate perturbation signal of the future atmosphere is added to high resolution baseline hourly observations the general perturbation approach and the method used here has two main assumptions i gcm outputs for current and future climates show relative changes rather than absolute changes in climate and ii the number of precipitation events is constant in current and future climates semadeni davies et al 2008 the perturbation method only modifies the observed past and does not consider future changes in frequency and intensity of weather patterns the assumption of linear scaling used for temperature in the perturbation method may introduce uncertainties for non linear variables such as precipitation particularly for extremes kay et al 2009 it is also assumed that the basin vegetation and in the case of wolf creek permafrost williams et al 2015 will remain unchanged the range of annual perturbations in precipitation and warming considered for this study is based on the atmospheric changes estimated by the sres a2 scenario and two rcps which are consistent with the recent ssp5 8 5 the climate dataset used for the sres a2 scenario was obtained from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap these simulations provide climate data for regional climate models driven with gcm boundary conditions mearns et al 2007 the range of temperature and precipitation perturbations was chosen based on the average climate changes that were obtained for rcps and for the eleven narccap regional climate models for the periods 2041 2070 minus 1971 2000 the climate dataset used for rcp scenarios was adapted from the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc barros et al 2014 which is consistent with the ssp scenarios provided in the recently published six assessment report ipcc 2021 these two rcps corresponding to specific radiative forcing values of 2 6 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 were used as a basis for long term and near term modelling experiments in climate change studies the ssp5 8 5 scenario represents a fossil fueled development with very high co2 emissions that will roughly double from current levels by 2050 table 1 summarizes the expected change for air temperature and precipitation in the southern yukon territory wolf creek canadian rockies marmot creek and northwestern usa reynolds mountain most modelled scenarios project the future climate to be wetter but some sres scenarios moss et al 2010 show regional decreases in annual precipitation of up to 15 for the 2080 s rather than following any specific sress rcp or ssp the sensitivity analysis spans potential changes in air temperature and precipitation from all sress rcp and ssp perturbing air temperature by 0 c to 5 c in 1 c intervals and precipitation by 20 to 20 in 10 intervals these changes were applied to observations from all three basins the degree of hydrological sensitivity to climatic changes is evident in the resulting shape and slope of contours of change in a variable fig 2 the contours were estimated by linear interpolation between the mean responses to the 30 combinations of warming 0 c to 5 c in intervals of 1 c and precipitation change 20 to 20 in intervals of 10 when elasticity of a hydrological variable is high and it is more sensitive to air temperature increase or precipitation change the contour line is perpendicular to that axis temperature fig 2a precipitation fig 2b when the variable is sensitive to a linear interaction of air temperature and precipitation changes there will be a slope in the contour line fig 2c if the interaction is complex the slope and the contours will not be straight lines fig 2d applying the same ranges of change in air temperature and precipitation to each of the three basins allows direct comparison of the responses of the simulation model for each basin different combinations of warming and precipitation change make it possible to estimate how much additional precipitation is needed to offset the impacts of a specific air temperature increase on annual runoff and peak snowpack the additional precipitation increases needed to offset the temperature increases were estimated based on the interpolation of the two contour lines above and below the present climate values precipitation elasticity unitless is the percent change in peak snowpack or runoff per percent change in precipitation and air temperature elasticity c 1 is the percent change in peak snowpack and runoff per 1 c warming these were estimated by averaging responses to the 30 combinations of warming and precipitation change and obtaining the ratio of runoff and precipitation changes δ q δ p and the ratio of runoff and temperature changes δ q δ t in the three mountain basins the precipitation elasticity of runoff can be reliably estimated by calculating the slope of the linear fit to the scatter plots hoerling et al 2019 sensitivities of five main characteristics that describe a basin snow regime were investigated these characteristics are the timing of snowcover initiation snow season start snow free date snow season end duration of the snow season duration of snowmelt period and magnitude of the peak snowpack the duration of the snow season is the difference between the date of snowcover initiation and the date the basin becomes snow free the duration of the melt period is the difference between the date of peak snow water equivalent swe and the date the basin becomes snow free the mean annual peak snow accumulation is defined as the average maximum swe over the hydrological year and occurs in march or april in these basins 4 results the performance of the models developed to study the sensitivities of annual runoff and snow regimes to warming and precipitation elasticity was evaluated against actual observations the models represented observed swe and runoff at the outlet of the basins reasonably well based on a nash sutcliffe efficiency score of 0 72 for runoff fig 3 and the fact that the models were physically based with no calibration for snow simulations and a minimal calibration for routing parameters the robustness of the model in representing snowpack is more apparent at the station in the sheltered hru in reynolds mountain where there is a snow pillow with continuous snow records fig 3c relatively low performance of the model in capturing peak runoffs in wolf creek fig 3d is due to the streamflow outburst associated with rapid ice breakup at the outlet of coal lake within this basin fig 1a which generates high flows in the spring melt season and is due to a mechanism which is not represented in crhm the inter annual anomalies relative to the long term averages were assessed for observed air temperature precipitation annual peak snowpack and annual runoff in the three basins fig 4 the elasticities and sensitivity of observed peak swe and annual runoff to warming anomaly and precipitation changes were determined mean annual air temperature in all three basins has less inter annual variability than precipitation which makes it challenging to assess impacts of future warming on snow and runoff using observed analogies fig 4 in contrast the variability of the precipitation anomalies which were obtained from subtracting annual precipitation from the long term average were sufficiently large to allow assessment of future changes using observed inter annual variability of precipitation observed precipitation and temperature elasticities showed that peak swe fig 4a and annual runoff fig 4d were both sensitive to precipitation change and warming in wolf creek precipitation elasticity showed that peak swe fig 4b and annual runoff fig 4e were more sensitive to precipitation change in marmot creek and because the maximum warming anomaly observed is less than 1 c it is difficult to project warming effect on snow and runoff regimes using observed data a modest observed warming of 1 c decreased peak swe by 50 mm fig 4c and annual runoff by 75 mm in reynolds mountain fig 4f and the slope of the contours showed that there was a complex interaction of observed air temperature and precipitation changes in this basin the models developed in this study were physically based and most parameters were uncalibrated and their performance in representing observations made them suitable for studying future conditions and conducting sensitivity analyses with high confidence the modelling uncertainties in representing observed high flows and hydrological sensitivities to changes in air temperature and precipitation fig 4 suggested that these uncertainties could propagate to the simulations for sensitivity analyses therefore one needs to interpret these temperature results with care these uncertainties were partly unavoidable as the analogies of future conditions were limited in historical data especially for warmings greater than 1 c similar to the observed sensitivities fig 4a the magnitude and timing of annual peak snowpack are sensitive to both air temperature and precipitation changes in wolf creek as shown in fig 5 the interaction between air temperature and precipitation affecting peak swe is evident in the curvature and slope of the contours the interaction is complex in the alpine and shrub tundra curved contour lines fig 5a and c but less so in the forest fig 5e the sensitivity of peak swe to precipitation is somewhat higher in the high elevation alpine zone contours have higher slope and its sensitivity to temperature is somewhat higher in the lower elevation shrub tundra and forest zones contours have lower slope the peak swe in the shrub tundra zone is very sensitive to a decrease in precipitation with warming due to precipitation phase change and suppression of blowing snow redistribution from the alpine zone under warmer air temperatures rasouli et al 2014 and drops from 162 mm to 75 mm 87 mm reduction fig 5c with 80 of precipitation and 5 c of warming the sensitivity of peak swe to increasing precipitation in the shrub tundra zone declines as the temperature warms the peak swe in the forested zone is slightly less sensitive to temperature than shrub tundra because unloading of intercepted snow from the canopy where it is prone to sublimation increases with winter air temperatures and moderates the impact of declining snowfall with rising temperature whether 20 additional precipitation can offset the effect of warming on snowpacks in wolf creek is illustrated in fig 5 by comparing the black dot indicating no change in air temperature or precipitation to the white dot indicating the degree of warming that can be offset by a 20 increase in precipitation a 20 increase in precipitation can offset the effect of warming of 3 5 c in the alpine zone fig 5a 2 7 c in the shrub tundra fig 5c and 3 c in the forest zone fig 5e on peak swe there is no clear pattern to the small changes of less than six days in the timing of peak swe in the wolf creek alpine zone with air temperature and precipitation changes fig 5b this is likely due to the persistently colder temperatures during winter at high elevations in the subarctic fig 5b in the shrub tundra and forest the mean annual peak swe occurs 25 and 20 days earlier respectively with 5 c of warming and 20 reduced precipitation fig 5d and f in cold continental marmot creek peak swe in all zones is influenced by changes in both air temperature and precipitation but responds more strongly to air temperature than in subarctic wolf creek fig 6 peak swe is more influenced by warming temperature at lower elevations due to the influence of lapse rates on precipitation phase and other factors because of reduced blowing snow inputs from the alpine zone the treeline forest zone loses the most snow 422 mm under 5 c of warming and 20 less precipitation fig 6c but because it has the highest snow accumulation snow is still deep and its proportional change with temperature was not substantially different from the other zones in contrast almost all swe is lost in the marmot creek forest zone under this scenario suggesting a high sensitivity of snowpacks to warming and drying in this elevation zone the response of the peak swe to warming and precipitation changes shows that an increase in precipitation of 20 slightly greater than the maximum indicated by climate models can offset the effect on peak swe of warming in the alpine of 2 9 c fig 6a in the treeline forests of 2 1 c fig 6c and in the forest and forest clearing of 1 8 c fig 6c and g the peak snowpack in marmot creek is more sensitive to warming and so increased precipitation can offset less of a temperature increase than in wolf creek the changes in the simulated timing of peak swe in marmot creek are substantial and complex timing responded much more to warming than to precipitation change and precipitation increases could not compensate for any degree of warming at any elevation fig 6b d f and h in the alpine forest and forest clearing zones peak swe advanced between 19 and 28 days for 2 c of warming and between 60 and 70 days for 5 c in contrast the treeline forest peak swe timing advanced only 10 and 27 days for 2 c and 5 c of warming its lower sensitivity range of contours due to the high snow accumulation in this zone associated with continued redistribution of snow from the alpine fig 6d in reynolds mountain annual peak swe is very sensitive to increases in air temperature and much less sensitive to changes in precipitation fig 7 a c e and g the slope and curvature of the annual peak swe contours show the sensitivity to precipitation change decreases as temperature increases this suggests that the effects of warming on swe cannot be easily offset by increased precipitation a precipitation increase of 20 can offset warming up to from 1 2 c to 1 5 c depending on location the warmest and driest scenario 5 c and 20 precipitation resulted in peak swe declines in all zones e g from 570 mm to 58 mm in the sink fig 7a and from 427 mm to 39 mm in the interception zones fig 7e the blowing snow sink zone lost more snow with warming and drying than other zones due to the suppression of blowing snow transport from the source zone fig 7a the response of the timing of annual peak swe is much more sensitive to warming than to precipitation change in all zones in reynolds mountain fig 7b d f and h the timing changes in reynolds mountain are the largest amongst the three basins with the change in peak swe date being between 50 and 70 days earlier for the maximum 5 c warming additional precipitation of 20 can only offset the effect of 0 5 c of warming on peak swe date fig 7b d f and h the rate of change in the simulated snowpacks can be estimated in relation to air temperature air temperature elasticity of peak swe is 8 c 1 in wolf creek 10 c 1 in marmot creek and 17 c 1 in reynolds mountain table 2 since the air temperature elasticity is defined as percent change of peak swe per degree not percent of warming it has higher values than the precipitation elasticity which is unitless and defined as percent change of peak swe per percent change of precipitation the loss of snowpack with warming is reflected in the reduction in the snowcover duration of 11 days in wolf creek 18 days in marmot creek and 30 days in reynolds mountain per degree of warming table 2 the duration of snowmelt declines between 0 and 9 days per degree of warming in all basins much less than the snowcover duration and smaller than the advance in the timing of snow disappearance which ranges from 7 wolf creek to 13 marmot creek to 21 reynolds mountain days per degree of warming snow melts more slowly as the melt season advances in some of these simulations which partly offsets the impact of the decrease in peak snowpack on snowmelt period duration the sensitivity of five main characteristics of basin snow regimes to warming and change in precipitation averaged over wolf creek shows that both changes in precipitation and warming affect the magnitude of the peak swe fig 8 a precipitation increases of 20 can offset a 3 c temperature increase in wolf creek peak swe delay in the initiation start of snow accumulation is sensitive to warming rates above 3 c regardless of precipitation changes fig 8b the snow free snow season end date advances from june 28 in the recent climate to june 11 with a warming of 2 c fig 8c table 3 the snow free date is also sensitive to warming and almost insensitive to precipitation changes fig 8c the snow season duration in wolf creek is also driven by warming and not by precipitation changes fig 8d the snowmelt period the timing difference between peak swe and the snow free date is sensitive to warming and almost insensitive to precipitation changes fig 8e in marmot creek the peak swe drops from 220 mm to 92 mm under a warming of 5 c and decreasing precipitation 20 fig 8f table 3 the timing of the start of snow accumulation is not affected substantially by either warming or precipitation fig 8g but increased temperatures have a large effect on the end date fig 8h and snow season duration fig 8i this is reduced with increased precipitation the duration of the melt season is also not affected fig 8j in contrast to wolf creek the initiation date of snow accumulation is sensitive to precipitation changes and would advance if warming rates are below 2 c and precipitation increases the snow free date advances from early june in the recent climate to late may with a warming of 2 c fig 8h similar to the ablation period the snow accumulation start date is sensitive to precipitation changes and to a lesser extent to warming with concomitant warming 5 c and decreasing precipitation the snow free date across the basin advances by 77 days to late march fig 8h as shown in fig 8 the snow free date is sensitive to warming but insensitive to precipitation changes in marmot creek and snow season length is affected by both warming and precipitation changes similar to wolf creek the combination of air temperature increasing by at least 2 c and precipitation increasing by less than 20 results in declining peak swe and deviation from the historical ranges of snowpack in marmot creek in reynolds mountain with warming of 5 c and decreasing precipitation of 20 the mean annual peak swe decreases from 390 mm to 47 mm fig 8k table 3 and snow accumulation starts later fig 8l and ends earlier fig 8m the duration of the snow season fig 8n and duration of the melt period snow season fig 8o become much shorter than in the present climate table 3 a 1 c warming advances the timing of peak swe by approximately 15 days table 2 the magnitude of peak swe is more sensitive to temperature than precipitation fig 8k the timing of the snow regime is sensitive to temperature and less so to precipitation fig 8l o the peak swe is 136 mm in wolf creek 220 mm in marmot creek and 390 mm in reynolds mountain wolf creek and reynolds peak swe occur in early march and in marmot creek it occurs in late april table 3 with a 20 decline in precipitation and a warming of 5 c peak swe declines to 61 mm 55 decrease in wolf creek to 92 mm 58 in marmot creek and to 47 mm 88 decrease in reynolds mountain with a 20 increase in precipitation and no warming peak swe increases to 169 mm 24 in wolf creek to 281 mm in marmot creek 28 and to 486 mm 25 in reynolds mountain with 5 c warming and no changes in precipitation the onset of snow accumulation is delayed 17 days in wolf creek 23 days in marmot creek and 42 days in reynolds mountain and the end of winter comes earlier by 37 days in wolf creek 67 days in marmot creek and 104 days in reynolds mountain when compared to no changes table 3 a 20 increase in precipitation would lengthen the snowcover duration by 5 to 20 days the simulated air temperature elasticities and sensitivities of simulated annual runoff δ q and peak snowpack δ s w e changes to air temperature change δ t were compared against the observed elasticities in the present climate for the three basins fig 9 observed and simulated changes were obtained by subtracting annual magnitudes from the long term averages the air temperature elasticities of runoff the slopes of δ q δ t in the observed and simulated scenarios matched well in wolf creek and marmot creek with less than 6 discrepancy fig 9a and 9b the discrepancy between observed and simulated precipitation elasticity of runoff however was relatively high 38 c 1 in reynolds mountain the observed and simulated air temperature elasticities matched well in wolf creek fig 9d but because of the shorter observation record in marmot creek the inter annual variability of observed air temperatures did not cover the range of future warming projected by climate models fig 9e the simulated air temperature elasticity of peak swe was underestimated in reynolds mountain as twice the observed elasticity fig 9f the observed slopes of δ q δ p which represent the precipitation elasticity of runoff for the present climate matched well with the projected changes in annual runoff and the discrepancy between observed and simulated elasticities was less than 0 8 fig 10 a c the projected precipitation elasticity of annual runoff are 1 7 in wolf creek fig 10a 1 5 in marmot creek fig 10b and 2 1 in reynolds mountain fig 10c the observed slopes of the δ s w e δ p which represent observed precipitation elasticity of peak snowpack in the present climate also matched well with the projected precipitation elasticity of peak snowpack the projected precipitation elasticity of peak swe δ s w e δ p is from 0 7 to 1 1 and the observed precipitation elasticity of peak snowpack is from 0 4 to 1 9 in the three basins fig 10d and f with discrepancies ranging between 0 1 and 1 2 table 4 the lower discrepancy between observed and simulated precipitation elasticities of runoff and peak swe fig 10 showed that the results of sensitivity analysis are reliable and have less uncertainty in all three basins the higher discrepancy between observed and simulated air temperature elasticities of runoff in reynolds mountain fig 9c and peak swe in marmot creek fig 9e showed that the results of sensitivity analysis are less reliable in these two basins and one must interpret the results with care the simulations show that changes in snow regime in these mountain basins result in smaller changes in mean annual runoff than peak swe unlike peak swe mean annual runoff is more sensitive to changes in precipitation than air temperature fig 11 the near vertical lines in fig 11a and b indicate that changes in mean annual runoff are driven predominately by precipitation in wolf creek and marmot creek whilst temperature more strongly impacts runoff in reynolds mountain a 1 c warming in wolf creek resulted in a 3 decrease in the annual runoff table 2 total decreases rise to 14 for a 5 c warming 171 to 147 mm table 3 fig 11a the most extreme scenario of climate warming and decreased precipitation caused larger declines in runoff but if precipitation increases there is strong compensation for instance if precipitation increases by 20 annual runoff increases by 35 mm from 171 to 206 mm with 5 c of warming mean annual runoff is more sensitive than snow regime to precipitation change in wolf creek similarly in marmot creek a 5 c increase in air temperature results in a 4 decrease in the mean annual runoff 402 to 384 mm table 3 fig 11b the combination of 5 c of warming and 20 decreased precipitation reduces mean annual runoff by 34 135 mm from 402 to 267 mm table 3 fig 11b in reynolds mountain mean annual runoff has a stronger temperature sensitivity than wolf creek or marmot creek fig 11 a 5 c increase in temperature results in a 29 371 to 263 mm table 3 decrease in the mean annual runoff the combination of 5 c of warming and 20 decrease in precipitation reduces annual runoff by 43 371 to 161 mm table 3 change in mean annual runoff fig 11 contrasts with the change in mean annual peak swe figs 5 7 in that mean annual runoff is more sensitive to precipitation than temperature the sensitivity of annual runoff to temperature increase in reynolds mountain is because of the longer snow free season and an increased growing season and energy flux for evapotranspiration with increasing temperature fig 7 whilst runoff responds to both precipitation change and warming fig 11c in contrast to the sensitivity of snowpack to warming in reynolds mountain annual runoff is less sensitive and the impact of warming on annual runoff can be partly offset by an increase in precipitation in reynolds mountain annual runoff changes are given in table 3 under different scenarios of warming and changes in precipitation annual runoff responds strongly to precipitation changes in wolf creek and marmot creek and to both warming and precipitation changes in reynolds mountain annual runoff is the most resilient to warming in marmot creek and most sensitive to warming in reynolds mountain under 5 c and a 20 increased precipitation annual runoff increases from 171 mm to 206 mm 20 in wolf creek and increases from 402 mm to 518 mm 29 in marmot creek and from 371 mm to 415 mm 12 in reynolds mountain table 3 this shows that increased precipitation with warming increases the runoff in marmot creek more than the other two basins this is due to the very cold alpine snowpack at marmot creek which is relatively unaffected by warming in contrast to the warm snowpacks at reynolds mountain which become ephemeral with warming the amount of additional precipitation needed to offset the effect of increased temperature on peak swe and annual runoff under future climate can be estimated from the sensitivity analysis the largest increases in precipitation projected by the sres and rcps used here and narccap rcm gcms are 34 for wolf creek 18 for marmot creek and 16 for reynolds mountain this also covers the range from ssp5 8 5 similarly in wolf creek when warming is limited to 1 c increased precipitation of 4 can offset the effect of warming on peak swe fig 12 a but with warming of 5 c an increase in precipitation of 34 would be required to offset the effect of warming in marmot creek the effect of 1 c warming on peak swe can be offset by 8 increase in precipitation however the effect of 5 c warming on peak swe would require precipitation increases that are greater than expected from rcp scenarios and narccap simulations in reynolds mountain the impact of 1 c warming on peak swe can be offset by 16 increase in precipitation but the offset required for more than 2 c warming exceeds the projected maximum precipitation increases annual runoff is less sensitive than peak snowpack to warming and smaller precipitation increases are required to offset the effects of warming simulated here these differences are due to differences in the fraction of snowfall converted to rainfall in each basin under a warmer climate the additional precipitation needed to offset the impact of warming on runoff varies with elevation range precipitation regime and latitude offsetting the effect of warming of 5 c on annual runoff would require precipitation increases of 8 in wolf creek fig 12a 3 in marmot creek fig 12b and 14 in reynolds mountain fig 12c rasouli et al 2019a showed that the reduced snow sublimation loss offset reduced snowfall amounts and increased evapotranspiration loss offset increased rainfall amounts the evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio did not substantially change under a moderate warming of 2 2 2 6 c in the three basins table 5 and the increased evapotranspiration was largely due to enhanced wetness as a result of increased precipitation and to less extent due to warming here an energy balance method to calculate actual evapotranspiration restrained by continuity in surface and soil moisture availability was used and relative humidity rather than absolute humidity was held constant with warming so the overestimation of evapotranspiration with climate warming that is a feature of empirical and potential evapotranspiration schemes was avoided with the crhm models milly and dunne 2016 5 discussion air temperatures in late winter and spring have a key role in determining the sensitivity of snowpack in mountain basins to warming lettenmaier and gan 1990 stewart et al 2004 mccabe and clark 2005 the results presented above demonstrate and quantify the sensitivity of annual peak snowpack and its timing and of annual runoff to air temperature and precipitation changes and their interaction in the three basins sensitivity of annual peak snowpack timing to air temperature and precipitation changes in the three basins shows that the sensitivity of peak swe timing to precipitation changes is greater in the colder climate conditions reynolds mountain responds to warming only fig 7 marmot creek responds to warming and to a lesser extent to precipitation fig 6 and wolf creek responds to a complex interaction of warming and precipitation change fig 5 the potential for precipitation to counteract the effect of warming on the magnitude of the annual peak snowpack becomes smaller as latitude decreases therefore regional responses to warming and changes to precipitation must be considered bower et al 2004 particularly when evaluating future mountain hydrology roche et al 2018 sultana and choi 2018 this is because the snowpack is shallow and warm at the beginning and end of the season shallow warm snow ripens and melts faster than deep cold snow as it requires less energy input to overcome cold content and fill its liquid water holding capacity colbeck 1976 simulations of future conditions for snow regimes in reynolds mountain are in accord with the swe magnitude and timing trajectories of the past 50 years nayak et al 2010 the future simulations of peak swe and runoff elasticities are compared with observed analogies figs 9 and 10 precipitation and air temperature elasticities show minimal discrepancies except for air temperature elasticity of peak swe in marmot creek fig 9e and runoff in reynolds mountain fig 9c higher discrepancies in the air temperature elasticities in these two basins are likely due to a wider warming range used in the sensitivity analyses 0 c to 5 c which is not covered in the inter annual variability of the observation period less than 1 5 c fig 4 higher rates of warming and increased precipitation are projected by rcms in the northern latitudes mearns et al 2007 latitudinal change in the role of precipitation increase in offsetting the effect of warming on cold regions hydrology implies that even though northern latitudes will warm more graversen et al 2008 they may also have more precipitation therefore the precipitation increase may offset the impact of warming on snow and hydrological regimes in northern basins it is also expected that the response of hydrological processes in different latitudes to the same climatic change will differ although the snow regime in marmot creek fig 6 is as sensitive as in wolf creek fig 5 to warming and a decrease in precipitation its runoff regime is less sensitive than that in wolf creek partly due to a seasonal maxima of precipitation in spring during the seasonal snowmelt in marmot creek figs 8 and 9a and b these results are consistent with findings and projections for other mountain areas sultana and choi 2018 roche et al 2018 jennings and molotch 2019 lópez moreno et al 2020 the relatively lower sensitivity of the forest zone peak snow in wolf creek fig 5e is because of the increased unloading and hence reduced sublimation of intercepted snow at warmer air temperatures that counteracts the reduced snowfall pomeroy et al 2015 the higher resiliency of the marmot creek snowpack is due to smaller changes at high elevations and in the blowing snow sink zone of the treeline forest in which a deep snowpack is deposited that remains until mid summer macdonald et al 2010 harder et al 2015 rasouli et al 2019a the high elevation and high latitude basins are more resilient to warming because their temperatures are currently well below that required to shift the precipitation phase bavay et al 2013 jennings and molotch 2019 the snowpack lasts longer on the ground at high elevations in marmot creek which moderates the impact of snow loss at low elevations on runoff rasouli et al 2019a lópez moreno et al 2020 a high elevation band with air temperatures similar to that in low elevations in wolf creek and a rainy environment in the spring and early summer peak runoff period pomeroy et al 2016 explain why the drop in peak snow accumulation fig 9e is not reflected by a proportional drop in annual runoff fig 9b in marmot creek this highlights the role of spatial redistribution of snow on heterogeneous hydrological responses at different elevations in marmot creek the snow and runoff regimes are the most sensitive to warming in reynolds mountain because of the i higher annual mean air temperature ii near freezing air temperatures in winter and iii fewer number of days with freezing temperatures 120 days a year rasouli et al 2019a compared with the other basins rasouli et al 2019a found that under a moderate warming and increased precipitation of 7 and 2 in marmot creek and reynolds mountain respectively the annual runoff remained unchanged due to the offsetting effect of increased precipitation on increased evapotranspiration and offsetting effect of decreased sublimation on reduced snowfall rasouli et al 2019a less sensitivity of annual runoff to warming relative to snowpacks suggests that warming mountain snowpacks can be decoupled from hydrological regimes lópez moreno et al 2020 snowpack regimes in reynolds mountain are more sensitive to warming than to changes in precipitation similar to the cascade mountains of oregon usa sproles et al 2013 the air temperature elasticity of snowpack was found to be 8 c 1 in wolf creek 10 c 1 in marmot creek and 17 c 1 in reynolds mountain table 2 in wolf creek these results are similar to reductions per degree warming observed in the svalbard archipelago 79 n lópez moreno et al 2016 snowpack loss in marmot creek is in the range of 11 20 c 1 reduction reported for the pyrenees lópez moreno et al 2013 lópez moreno et al 2014 and comparable to a 15 c 1 reduction reported for the swiss alps beniston et al 2003 snow loss in reynolds mountain is similar to a 20 c 1 reduction reported for the washington cascades casola et al 2009 the results here are consistent with other basins with similar climates and that climate change affects snowpack in mountain basins across the globe with large reductions at mid latitudes and relatively small reductions at high latitudes roche et al 2018 sultana and choi 2018 under the severe warming of 5 c and 20 increased precipitation annual runoff increases in all three basins table 3 fig 10a c because of the increasing importance of rain in warmer climates suggesting that precipitation increase has a primary role in changing annual total runoff and there is a large shift in the runoff mechanism from being snowmelt driven to rainfall driven this shift may result in reduced runoff berghuijs et al 2014 if precipitation does not increase table 3 it might also alter forest vegetation over time by making it more prone to wildfire and disease the air temperature and precipitation elasticities of annual runoff and annual peak snowpack increase from the northern basin to the southern basin figs 9 and 10 the high slope of δ q δ t and variability around the fitted line for reynolds mountain indicate a strong sensitivity of annual runoff to warming and precipitation change fig 9c suggesting that changes in annual runoff are attributable to both warming and precipitation change in the southern basin the changes in annual runoff are not attributable to warming in the colder wolf creek and marmot creek fig 9a and 10b as demonstrated by the minimal variability around the fitted δ q δ p lines fig 10a and 10b and relatively mild slope of δ q δ t fig 9a and 10b the high slope of δ s w e δ t fig 9d f the low slope of δ s w e δ p fig 10d f and high variability around the fitted lines show that the changes in annual peak snowpack are primarily attributable to warming and secondarily to precipitation change in all three basins and particularly in reynolds mountain 5 1 offsetting temperature increases the impact of warming of 1 c on swe values over the winter and spring seasons can be offset by a precipitation increase of 20 for almost all swe values in all snow regimes in reynolds mountain however warming of 2 c or more cannot be offset by increases in precipitation of less than 20 the sensitivity of swe in the blowing snow source and sink hrus to warming is higher than that in the forested intercepted snow and sheltered forest gap hrus this is due to suppression of blowing snow redistribution processes by warming in wolf creek 61 n not only more warming but also an increase in precipitation is expected graversen et al 2008 which indicates that precipitation increases could partly offset the effect of warming on cold regions hydrology despite the uniformity of high mountain climates and similar response per degree warming the implication of these results is that mountain snow regime responses to climate change can differ substantially lópez moreno et al 2020 as noted for the three basins across north america studied here therefore regional analysis is required the large difference between snowpack response in reynolds mountain and wolf creek implies that warming in cool climates affects the maximum accumulated snowpack more than it does in cold climates warming affects the phase of precipitation causing a shift from snowfall to rainfall in the spring and fall transition seasons poulin et al 2011 whitfield and shook 2020 and a shift from march to january in reynolds mountain april to february in marmot creek and less than a month in wolf creek for the timing of peak snow accumulation table 3 the impacts of warming on snowpacks can be partly offset by a precipitation increase in the cold wolf creek and marmot creek climates but not in the cool reynolds mountain climate the snow season is expected to shorten by about two months in the subarctic wolf creek from 9 to 7 months three and half months in the cold marmot creek from 6 to 4 months and five months in the cool reynolds mountain basin from 6 to 1 month with concomitant warming and a decline in precipitation table 3 this implies that under climate warming the response of the snow hydrology to a precipitation increase changes with latitude from very little in reynolds mountain to very large in wolf creek snow hydrology is more sensitive to warming and precipitation phase change in the southern basin and is more resilient in marmot creek the sensitivity of annual runoff to warming in the three basins increases from north to south and it is in the range of 1 c 1 to 6 c 1 table 2 while projected precipitation elasticity is in the range of 1 5 to 2 1 table 4 indicating that the runoff change is primarily attributed to precipitation change and secondarily to warming hoerling et al 2019 separated the effects of temperature and precipitation changes on upper colorado river streamflow and found that two thirds of the climate change signal effect on declining streamflow over the past century was attributable to precipitation change warming had the secondary effect and runoff showed a modest sensitivity of 2 5 c 1 in contrast to annual runoff the projected temperature elasticity of annual peak snowpack is in the range of 8 c 1 to 17 c 1 lesser in wolf creek and higher in reynolds mountain table 2 while precipitation elasticity is in the range of 0 7 to 1 1 table 4 which indicates that changes in the annual peak snowpack is primarily attributed to warming and secondarily to precipitation change 6 conclusions annual perturbations of observed hourly air temperature and precipitation were used to drive physically based cold regions hydrological models of the elasticity and sensitivity of snow and runoff regimes in well instrumented mountain research basins that span the northern north american cordillera peak snowpack is sensitive to both warming and precipitation change in wolf creek in the subarctic yukon and is more sensitive to temperature in reynolds mountain in temperate idaho peak snowpack is most sensitive to warming in the sheltered site in reynolds mountain and to both warming and precipitation change in the blowing snow sink regime in reynolds mountain at lower elevations in marmot creek and the shrub tundra zone in wolf creek peak snowpack timing is more sensitive to warming in marmot creek and reynolds mountain but in wolf creek precipitation more strongly affects the timing of peak swe as temperatures remain largely below zero snow season start end and duration were found to be sensitive to warming in temperate idaho and subarctic yukon and to both warming and precipitation change in the continental canadian rockies marmot creek the scenario with severe climate warming and decreased precipitation in all three basins caused dramatic declines in swe a shortened snow covered period and decreases in annual runoff the decreases in snowpack depth and advances in the timing of peak snowpack are weakly reflected in changes to runoff regime in each basin the large changes in snowpack found here do not result in similar magnitude changes in annual runoff if precipitation decreases with warming the impacts on snowpacks are amplified with major implications for ecology winter transportation and hydrology smaller snowpacks and warmer weather would cause an increase in the snow free period which also would lengthen the evapotranspiration season increasing the annual evapotranspiration loss the importance of rainfall runoff mechanisms in these basins increases while snowmelt decreases under warmer and drier climatic conditions annual runoff decreases the projected precipitation elasticity of annual runoff increases from 1 7 in wolf creek to 2 1 in reynolds mountain and precipitation elasticity of snowpack increases from 0 7 in reynolds mountain to 1 1 in wolf creek indicating that increased precipitation would increase annual runoff more in the wet basin in the south than in the dry basin in the north increased precipitation resulted in more increased snowpack in the cold basin in the north than in the cool basin in the south for the same degree of warming the magnitude of the air temperature elasticity of annual runoff increases from 0 8 c 1 in marmot creek to 5 8 c 1 in reynolds mountain and the magnitude of air temperature elasticity of snowpack increases from 8 c 1 in wolf creek to 17 c 1 in reynolds mountain this shows that increased warming will decrease annual runoff and snowpack more in the wet basin in the south than the dry basin in the north under the same precipitation conditions the observed and simulated precipitation and air temperature elasticities of peak snowpack and runoff showed minimal discrepancies except for the air temperature elasticity of peak swe in marmot creek and of runoff in reynolds mountain the changes in annual runoff in the colder basins and elevations however are more attributable to precipitation change while the changes in peak snowpack are more attributable to warming in basins with cool climates and higher elevations changes in annual runoff are attributable to both precipitation change and warming increased precipitation expected from many climate projections can partially offset the effect of warming on snowpack and annual runoff the role of precipitation as a compensator for the impact of warming on peak snowpack and annual runoff is most effective in the colder high elevations and high latitudes and its effectiveness is reduced where snow regimes currently depend on blowing snow transport and redistribution which is very sensitive to temperature with increased precipitation high elevation and high latitude basin snow and hydrological regimes can be resilient to warming at lower elevations and latitudes however the impact of warming cannot be offset by any projected maximum precipitation increases in future climates the coupling of snow regimes to streamflow hydrology will remain strong in northern canada but weaker in the mountains of idaho and alberta as the climate warms in a manner consistent with the global decoupling noted by lópez moreno et al 2020 declaration of competing

3683,whether or not the impact of warming on mountain snow and runoff can be offset by precipitation increases has not been well examined but it is crucially important for future downstream water supply using the physically based cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm elasticity percent change in runoff divided by change in a climate forcing and the sensitivity of snow regimes to perturbations were investigated in three well instrumented mountain research basins spanning the northern north american cordillera hourly meteorological observations were perturbed using air temperature and precipitation changes and were then used to force hydrological models for each basin in all three basins lower temperature sensitivities of annual runoff volume 6 c 1 and higher sensitivities of peak snowpack 17 c 1 showed that annual runoff was far less sensitive to temperature than the snow regime higher and lower precipitation elasticities of annual runoff 1 5 2 1 and peak snowpack 0 7 1 1 indicated that the runoff change is primarily attributed to precipitation change and secondarily to warming a low discrepancy between observed and simulated precipitation elasticities showed that the model results are reliable and one can conduct sensitivity analysis the air temperature elasticities however must be interpreted with care as the projected warmings range beyond the observed temperatures and hence it is not possible to test their reliability simulations using multiple elevations showed that the timing of peak snowpack was most sensitive to temperature for the range of warming expected from north american climate model simulations the impacts of warming on annual runoff but not on peak snowpack can be offset by the size of precipitation increases projected for the near future period 2041 2070 to offset the impact of 2 c warming on annual runoff precipitation would need to increase by less than 5 in all three basins to offset the impact of 2 c warming on peak snowpack however precipitation would need to increase by 12 in wolf creek in yukon territory 18 in marmot creek in the canadian rockies and an amount greater than the maximum projected at reynolds mountain in idaho the role of increased precipitation as a compensator for the impact of warming on snowpack is more effective at the highest elevations and higher latitudes increased precipitation leads to resilient and strongly coupled snow and runoff regimes contrasting sharply with the sensitive and weakly coupled regimes at low elevations and in temperate climate zones

in the high elevation reynolds creek experimental watershed usa nayak 2008 a common approach for investigating the hydrological response to climate change is to apply climate model projections under

warming were studied in the coast mountains of yukon territory canada rasouli et al 2014 this study applies elasticity and sensitivity analyses to both snow and runoff regimes in a comparable way using physically based models designed using the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm representing three data rich headwater basins that span the northern north american cordillera this research investigates how the magnitude and timing of peak snowpack and annual runoff respond to combinations of temperature increases 0 c to 5 c and precipitation changes 20 10 0 10 and 20 by considering 30 combinations applied to each of the three mountain headwater basins the elasticity and sensitivity of hydrological responses to changes in forcings can be compared this increases the understanding of the relationships between changes in forcing and model response in these basins the main question addressed is whether the impact of warming on mountain snow and annual runoff can be offset by precipitation increases this has not been resolved in the literature e g arnell 1999 prowse et al 2006 luo et al 2008 the specific objective for this sensitivity analysis is therefore to quantify the response of simulated mountain hydrological processes to changes in air temperature and precipitation associated with future climate change 2 data sources three well instrumented and therefore data rich headwater research basins located in the northern north american cordillera were used to simulate potential hydrological responses to warming and precipitation changes wolf creek yukon territory canada marmot creek alberta canada and reynolds mountain east hereafter reynolds mountain idaho usa fig 1 the availability of long term data from multiple hydrometeorological stations at different elevations in each basin makes these basins uniquely suitable case studies for conducting sensitivity analysis on hydrological processes high quality measurements of hourly air temperature relative humidity wind speed incoming shortwave radiation precipitation and streamflow discharge for each basin were used consistent with the ideal gas law relative humidity was held constant to allow water vapour pressure to change with temperature the forcing data are publicly available from 1993 to 2011 for wolf creek rasouli et al 2019c from 2006 to 2013 for marmot creek fang et al 2019 from 1984 to 2008 for reynolds mountain reba et al 2011 all three basins are snow dominated under the current climate and are partially covered by coniferous forests at lower altitudes wolf creek has spruce and pine forests marmot creek has larch fir spruce and pine forests and reynolds mountain has fir pine and aspen forests all elevations in wolf creek and the high elevations in marmot creek are very cold a cold snow season with high precipitation leads to a nine month snow season at high elevations in marmot creek high wind speeds in the alpine zones of all three basins redistribute snow by wind transport and result in substantive blowing snow sublimation losses needleleaf canopy snow interception and sublimation losses from intercepted snow are important in all three basins air temperatures of the forested elevations in wolf creek are lower than for the alpine zone in winter due to strong inversions in the yukon river valley in contrast reynolds mountain and lower elevations in marmot creek have warmer air temperatures with fewer freezing days making these more sensitive to warming 3 methods 3 1 hydrological modelling snow and runoff regimes are simulated using models created with the physically based crhm platform pomeroy et al 2007 models for each basin were developed based on elevation ranges of slope and aspect and vegetation type modules that describe the major hydrological mechanisms in cold regions and used in this study include 1 radiation module that computes shortwave and longwave irradiance and adjusts the shortwave radiation on slopes 2 albedo module that estimates snow and snow free surface albedos 3 canopy module that estimates the sub canopy short and longwave irradiance and turbulent transfer to snow and the interception of snowfall and rainfall and its subsequent drip unloading sublimation and or evaporation from the forest canopy 4 blowing snow module that simulates the wind redistribution of blowing snow from one hydrological response unit hru to another including blowing snow sublimation losses 5 energy balance snowmelt and surface sublimation module that estimates snowmelt net radiation sensible heat latent heat ground heat advection from rainfall and in internal energy changes 6 infiltration module that estimates snowmelt and rainfall infiltration into frozen and unfrozen soils and surface runoff if snowmelt or rainfall exceeds the infiltration rate 7 evaporation module that estimates actual evapotranspiration from unsaturated surfaces using an energy balance and extension of penman s equation to the unsaturated case and from wetted surfaces including lakes and stream channels priestley and taylor 1972 8 soil and hillslope module that estimates soil moisture depressional storage surface and sub surface flows and moisture withdraws by roots in two soil layers and groundwater discharge in a saturated groundwater layer horizontal and vertical drainage from the soil and groundwater layers and hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated zone are estimated using darcy hubbert 1956 and brooks and corey 1964 relationships and 9 routing module that estimates runoff lag and route timing the crhm models for each mountain basin were developed and evaluated with basin observations as per fang et al 2013 rasouli et al 2014 rasouli et al 2015 and rasouli 2017 and were then used to assess the elasticity and sensitivity of the hydrological response to climate change by perturbing the model forcings the models were run using hrus that are spatially discretized based on vegetation type and height land slope and aspect and soil depth the spatial resolution of the crhm models was that of the hrus which had different sizes ranging from less than 1 km2 to greater than 20 km2 and the temporal resolution was hourly hrus were aggregated into three groups of alpine shrub tundra and forest for wolf creek four groups of alpine treeline forest and forest clearings for marmot creek and four groups of blowing snow source sink sublimation and sheltered from the wind for reynolds mountain these divisions were based on topographic exposure and vegetation height pomeroy et al 1997 blowing snow sink hrus included drift riparian and tall vegetation hrus the forested landscapes were divided into those that are subject to interception and subsequent sublimation evergreen trees and those that are cleared gaps or have minimal winter interception capacity sheltered from the wind pomeroy et al 2002 the sensitivity experiments use the crhm basin models driven with perturbed forcings to simulate outputs such as snowpack and the timing and magnitude of runoff to assess the precipitation and air temperature elasticity of the snowpack and runoff the sensitivities of interest are the hydrological responses to increases in air temperature and changes in precipitation that use the observed time series of air temperature and precipitation perturbed changes in the ranges projected by climate models under the special report on emissions scenarios sres a2 business as usual and the representative concentration pathways rcps and are consistent with the recently defined shared socioeconomic pathways ssps of global change for these three basins rather than simulations based upon individual climate models this linear sensitivity analysis and associated elasticities provide an assessment of the scale of alteration of the hydrological cycle in mountain basins within the range estimated by climate change predictions this approach illustrates how both the individual and the combination of changes in air temperature and precipitation might induce hydrological changes in these basins knowing how combinations of warming and precipitation changes induce future hydrological change in mountain basins from northern to mid latitudes can be used to assess the possible impacts of climate change 3 2 climate perturbation sensitivity a climate perturbation sensitivity method is introduced here in which the current climate is perturbed based on projected future climatological changes with this method a climate perturbation signal of the future atmosphere is added to high resolution baseline hourly observations the general perturbation approach and the method used here has two main assumptions i gcm outputs for current and future climates show relative changes rather than absolute changes in climate and ii the number of precipitation events is constant in current and future climates semadeni davies et al 2008 the perturbation method only modifies the observed past and does not consider future changes in frequency and intensity of weather patterns the assumption of linear scaling used for temperature in the perturbation method may introduce uncertainties for non linear variables such as precipitation particularly for extremes kay et al 2009 it is also assumed that the basin vegetation and in the case of wolf creek permafrost williams et al 2015 will remain unchanged the range of annual perturbations in precipitation and warming considered for this study is based on the atmospheric changes estimated by the sres a2 scenario and two rcps which are consistent with the recent ssp5 8 5 the climate dataset used for the sres a2 scenario was obtained from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap these simulations provide climate data for regional climate models driven with gcm boundary conditions mearns et al 2007 the range of temperature and precipitation perturbations was chosen based on the average climate changes that were obtained for rcps and for the eleven narccap regional climate models for the periods 2041 2070 minus 1971 2000 the climate dataset used for rcp scenarios was adapted from the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc barros et al 2014 which is consistent with the ssp scenarios provided in the recently published six assessment report ipcc 2021 these two rcps corresponding to specific radiative forcing values of 2 6 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 were used as a basis for long term and near term modelling experiments in climate change studies the ssp5 8 5 scenario represents a fossil fueled development with very high co2 emissions that will roughly double from current levels by 2050 table 1 summarizes the expected change for air temperature and precipitation in the southern yukon territory wolf creek canadian rockies marmot creek and northwestern usa reynolds mountain most modelled scenarios project the future climate to be wetter but some sres scenarios moss et al 2010 show regional decreases in annual precipitation of up to 15 for the 2080 s rather than following any specific sress rcp or ssp the sensitivity analysis spans potential changes in air temperature and precipitation from all sress rcp and ssp perturbing air temperature by 0 c to 5 c in 1 c intervals and precipitation by 20 to 20 in 10 intervals these changes were applied to observations from all three basins the degree of hydrological sensitivity to climatic changes is evident in the resulting shape and slope of contours of change in a variable fig 2 the contours were estimated by linear interpolation between the mean responses to the 30 combinations of warming 0 c to 5 c in intervals of 1 c and precipitation change 20 to 20 in intervals of 10 when elasticity of a hydrological variable is high and it is more sensitive to air temperature increase or precipitation change the contour line is perpendicular to that axis temperature fig 2a precipitation fig 2b when the variable is sensitive to a linear interaction of air temperature and precipitation changes there will be a slope in the contour line fig 2c if the interaction is complex the slope and the contours will not be straight lines fig 2d applying the same ranges of change in air temperature and precipitation to each of the three basins allows direct comparison of the responses of the simulation model for each basin different combinations of warming and precipitation change make it possible to estimate how much additional precipitation is needed to offset the impacts of a specific air temperature increase on annual runoff and peak snowpack the additional precipitation increases needed to offset the temperature increases were estimated based on the interpolation of the two contour lines above and below the present climate values precipitation elasticity unitless is the percent change in peak snowpack or runoff per percent change in precipitation and air temperature elasticity c 1 is the percent change in peak snowpack and runoff per 1 c warming these were estimated by averaging responses to the 30 combinations of warming and precipitation change and obtaining the ratio of runoff and precipitation changes δ q δ p and the ratio of runoff and temperature changes δ q δ t in the three mountain basins the precipitation elasticity of runoff can be reliably estimated by calculating the slope of the linear fit to the scatter plots hoerling et al 2019 sensitivities of five main characteristics that describe a basin snow regime were investigated these characteristics are the timing of snowcover initiation snow season start snow free date snow season end duration of the snow season duration of snowmelt period and magnitude of the peak snowpack the duration of the snow season is the difference between the date of snowcover initiation and the date the basin becomes snow free the duration of the melt period is the difference between the date of peak snow water equivalent swe and the date the basin becomes snow free the mean annual peak snow accumulation is defined as the average maximum swe over the hydrological year and occurs in march or april in these basins 4 results the performance of the models developed to study the sensitivities of annual runoff and snow regimes to warming and precipitation elasticity was evaluated against actual observations the models represented observed swe and runoff at the outlet of the basins reasonably well based on a nash sutcliffe efficiency score of 0 72 for runoff fig 3 and the fact that the models were physically based with no calibration for snow simulations and a minimal calibration for routing parameters the robustness of the model in representing snowpack is more apparent at the station in the sheltered hru in reynolds mountain where there is a snow pillow with continuous snow records fig 3c relatively low performance of the model in capturing peak runoffs in wolf creek fig 3d is due to the streamflow outburst associated with rapid ice breakup at the outlet of coal lake within this basin fig 1a which generates high flows in the spring melt season and is due to a mechanism which is not represented in crhm the inter annual anomalies relative to the long term averages were assessed for observed air temperature precipitation annual peak snowpack and annual runoff in the three basins fig 4 the elasticities and sensitivity of observed peak swe and annual runoff to warming anomaly and precipitation changes were determined mean annual air temperature in all three basins has less inter annual variability than precipitation which makes it challenging to assess impacts of future warming on snow and runoff using observed analogies fig 4 in contrast the variability of the precipitation anomalies which were obtained from subtracting annual precipitation from the long term average were sufficiently large to allow assessment of future changes using observed inter annual variability of precipitation observed precipitation and temperature elasticities showed that peak swe fig 4a and annual runoff fig 4d were both sensitive to precipitation change and warming in wolf creek precipitation elasticity showed that peak swe fig 4b and annual runoff fig 4e were more sensitive to precipitation change in marmot creek and because the maximum warming anomaly observed is less than 1 c it is difficult to project warming effect on snow and runoff regimes using observed data a modest observed warming of 1 c decreased peak swe by 50 mm fig 4c and annual runoff by 75 mm in reynolds mountain fig 4f and the slope of the contours showed that there was a complex interaction of observed air temperature and precipitation changes in this basin the models developed in this study were physically based and most parameters were uncalibrated and their performance in representing observations made them suitable for studying future conditions and conducting sensitivity analyses with high confidence the modelling uncertainties in representing observed high flows and hydrological sensitivities to changes in air temperature and precipitation fig 4 suggested that these uncertainties could propagate to the simulations for sensitivity analyses therefore one needs to interpret these temperature results with care these uncertainties were partly unavoidable as the analogies of future conditions were limited in historical data especially for warmings greater than 1 c similar to the observed sensitivities fig 4a the magnitude and timing of annual peak snowpack are sensitive to both air temperature and precipitation changes in wolf creek as shown in fig 5 the interaction between air temperature and precipitation affecting peak swe is evident in the curvature and slope of the contours the interaction is complex in the alpine and shrub tundra curved contour lines fig 5a and c but less so in the forest fig 5e the sensitivity of peak swe to precipitation is somewhat higher in the high elevation alpine zone contours have higher slope and its sensitivity to temperature is somewhat higher in the lower elevation shrub tundra and forest zones contours have lower slope the peak swe in the shrub tundra zone is very sensitive to a decrease in precipitation with warming due to precipitation phase change and suppression of blowing snow redistribution from the alpine zone under warmer air temperatures rasouli et al 2014 and drops from 162 mm to 75 mm 87 mm reduction fig 5c with 80 of precipitation and 5 c of warming the sensitivity of peak swe to increasing precipitation in the shrub tundra zone declines as the temperature warms the peak swe in the forested zone is slightly less sensitive to temperature than shrub tundra because unloading of intercepted snow from the canopy where it is prone to sublimation increases with winter air temperatures and moderates the impact of declining snowfall with rising temperature whether 20 additional precipitation can offset the effect of warming on snowpacks in wolf creek is illustrated in fig 5 by comparing the black dot indicating no change in air temperature or precipitation to the white dot indicating the degree of warming that can be offset by a 20 increase in precipitation a 20 increase in precipitation can offset the effect of warming of 3 5 c in the alpine zone fig 5a 2 7 c in the shrub tundra fig 5c and 3 c in the forest zone fig 5e on peak swe there is no clear pattern to the small changes of less than six days in the timing of peak swe in the wolf creek alpine zone with air temperature and precipitation changes fig 5b this is likely due to the persistently colder temperatures during winter at high elevations in the subarctic fig 5b in the shrub tundra and forest the mean annual peak swe occurs 25 and 20 days earlier respectively with 5 c of warming and 20 reduced precipitation fig 5d and f in cold continental marmot creek peak swe in all zones is influenced by changes in both air temperature and precipitation but responds more strongly to air temperature than in subarctic wolf creek fig 6 peak swe is more influenced by warming temperature at lower elevations due to the influence of lapse rates on precipitation phase and other factors because of reduced blowing snow inputs from the alpine zone the treeline forest zone loses the most snow 422 mm under 5 c of warming and 20 less precipitation fig 6c but because it has the highest snow accumulation snow is still deep and its proportional change with temperature was not substantially different from the other zones in contrast almost all swe is lost in the marmot creek forest zone under this scenario suggesting a high sensitivity of snowpacks to warming and drying in this elevation zone the response of the peak swe to warming and precipitation changes shows that an increase in precipitation of 20 slightly greater than the maximum indicated by climate models can offset the effect on peak swe of warming in the alpine of 2 9 c fig 6a in the treeline forests of 2 1 c fig 6c and in the forest and forest clearing of 1 8 c fig 6c and g the peak snowpack in marmot creek is more sensitive to warming and so increased precipitation can offset less of a temperature increase than in wolf creek the changes in the simulated timing of peak swe in marmot creek are substantial and complex timing responded much more to warming than to precipitation change and precipitation increases could not compensate for any degree of warming at any elevation fig 6b d f and h in the alpine forest and forest clearing zones peak swe advanced between 19 and 28 days for 2 c of warming and between 60 and 70 days for 5 c in contrast the treeline forest peak swe timing advanced only 10 and 27 days for 2 c and 5 c of warming its lower sensitivity range of contours due to the high snow accumulation in this zone associated with continued redistribution of snow from the alpine fig 6d in reynolds mountain annual peak swe is very sensitive to increases in air temperature and much less sensitive to changes in precipitation fig 7 a c e and g the slope and curvature of the annual peak swe contours show the sensitivity to precipitation change decreases as temperature increases this suggests that the effects of warming on swe cannot be easily offset by increased precipitation a precipitation increase of 20 can offset warming up to from 1 2 c to 1 5 c depending on location the warmest and driest scenario 5 c and 20 precipitation resulted in peak swe declines in all zones e g from 570 mm to 58 mm in the sink fig 7a and from 427 mm to 39 mm in the interception zones fig 7e the blowing snow sink zone lost more snow with warming and drying than other zones due to the suppression of blowing snow transport from the source zone fig 7a the response of the timing of annual peak swe is much more sensitive to warming than to precipitation change in all zones in reynolds mountain fig 7b d f and h the timing changes in reynolds mountain are the largest amongst the three basins with the change in peak swe date being between 50 and 70 days earlier for the maximum 5 c warming additional precipitation of 20 can only offset the effect of 0 5 c of warming on peak swe date fig 7b d f and h the rate of change in the simulated snowpacks can be estimated in relation to air temperature air temperature elasticity of peak swe is 8 c 1 in wolf creek 10 c 1 in marmot creek and 17 c 1 in reynolds mountain table 2 since the air temperature elasticity is defined as percent change of peak swe per degree not percent of warming it has higher values than the precipitation elasticity which is unitless and defined as percent change of peak swe per percent change of precipitation the loss of snowpack with warming is reflected in the reduction in the snowcover duration of 11 days in wolf creek 18 days in marmot creek and 30 days in reynolds mountain per degree of warming table 2 the duration of snowmelt declines between 0 and 9 days per degree of warming in all basins much less than the snowcover duration and smaller than the advance in the timing of snow disappearance which ranges from 7 wolf creek to 13 marmot creek to 21 reynolds mountain days per degree of warming snow melts more slowly as the melt season advances in some of these simulations which partly offsets the impact of the decrease in peak snowpack on snowmelt period duration the sensitivity of five main characteristics of basin snow regimes to warming and change in precipitation averaged over wolf creek shows that both changes in precipitation and warming affect the magnitude of the peak swe fig 8 a precipitation increases of 20 can offset a 3 c temperature increase in wolf creek peak swe delay in the initiation start of snow accumulation is sensitive to warming rates above 3 c regardless of precipitation changes fig 8b the snow free snow season end date advances from june 28 in the recent climate to june 11 with a warming of 2 c fig 8c table 3 the snow free date is also sensitive to warming and almost insensitive to precipitation changes fig 8c the snow season duration in wolf creek is also driven by warming and not by precipitation changes fig 8d the snowmelt period the timing difference between peak swe and the snow free date is sensitive to warming and almost insensitive to precipitation changes fig 8e in marmot creek the peak swe drops from 220 mm to 92 mm under a warming of 5 c and decreasing precipitation 20 fig 8f table 3 the timing of the start of snow accumulation is not affected substantially by either warming or precipitation fig 8g but increased temperatures have a large effect on the end date fig 8h and snow season duration fig 8i this is reduced with increased precipitation the duration of the melt season is also not affected fig 8j in contrast to wolf creek the initiation date of snow accumulation is sensitive to precipitation changes and would advance if warming rates are below 2 c and precipitation increases the snow free date advances from early june in the recent climate to late may with a warming of 2 c fig 8h similar to the ablation period the snow accumulation start date is sensitive to precipitation changes and to a lesser extent to warming with concomitant warming 5 c and decreasing precipitation the snow free date across the basin advances by 77 days to late march fig 8h as shown in fig 8 the snow free date is sensitive to warming but insensitive to precipitation changes in marmot creek and snow season length is affected by both warming and precipitation changes similar to wolf creek the combination of air temperature increasing by at least 2 c and precipitation increasing by less than 20 results in declining peak swe and deviation from the historical ranges of snowpack in marmot creek in reynolds mountain with warming of 5 c and decreasing precipitation of 20 the mean annual peak swe decreases from 390 mm to 47 mm fig 8k table 3 and snow accumulation starts later fig 8l and ends earlier fig 8m the duration of the snow season fig 8n and duration of the melt period snow season fig 8o become much shorter than in the present climate table 3 a 1 c warming advances the timing of peak swe by approximately 15 days table 2 the magnitude of peak swe is more sensitive to temperature than precipitation fig 8k the timing of the snow regime is sensitive to temperature and less so to precipitation fig 8l o the peak swe is 136 mm in wolf creek 220 mm in marmot creek and 390 mm in reynolds mountain wolf creek and reynolds peak swe occur in early march and in marmot creek it occurs in late april table 3 with a 20 decline in precipitation and a warming of 5 c peak swe declines to 61 mm 55 decrease in wolf creek to 92 mm 58 in marmot creek and to 47 mm 88 decrease in reynolds mountain with a 20 increase in precipitation and no warming peak swe increases to 169 mm 24 in wolf creek to 281 mm in marmot creek 28 and to 486 mm 25 in reynolds mountain with 5 c warming and no changes in precipitation the onset of snow accumulation is delayed 17 days in wolf creek 23 days in marmot creek and 42 days in reynolds mountain and the end of winter comes earlier by 37 days in wolf creek 67 days in marmot creek and 104 days in reynolds mountain when compared to no changes table 3 a 20 increase in precipitation would lengthen the snowcover duration by 5 to 20 days the simulated air temperature elasticities and sensitivities of simulated annual runoff δ q and peak snowpack δ s w e changes to air temperature change δ t were compared against the observed elasticities in the present climate for the three basins fig 9 observed and simulated changes were obtained by subtracting annual magnitudes from the long term averages the air temperature elasticities of runoff the slopes of δ q δ t in the observed and simulated scenarios matched well in wolf creek and marmot creek with less than 6 discrepancy fig 9a and 9b the discrepancy between observed and simulated precipitation elasticity of runoff however was relatively high 38 c 1 in reynolds mountain the observed and simulated air temperature elasticities matched well in wolf creek fig 9d but because of the shorter observation record in marmot creek the inter annual variability of observed air temperatures did not cover the range of future warming projected by climate models fig 9e the simulated air temperature elasticity of peak swe was underestimated in reynolds mountain as twice the observed elasticity fig 9f the observed slopes of δ q δ p which represent the precipitation elasticity of runoff for the present climate matched well with the projected changes in annual runoff and the discrepancy between observed and simulated elasticities was less than 0 8 fig 10 a c the projected precipitation elasticity of annual runoff are 1 7 in wolf creek fig 10a 1 5 in marmot creek fig 10b and 2 1 in reynolds mountain fig 10c the observed slopes of the δ s w e δ p which represent observed precipitation elasticity of peak snowpack in the present climate also matched well with the projected precipitation elasticity of peak snowpack the projected precipitation elasticity of peak swe δ s w e δ p is from 0 7 to 1 1 and the observed precipitation elasticity of peak snowpack is from 0 4 to 1 9 in the three basins fig 10d and f with discrepancies ranging between 0 1 and 1 2 table 4 the lower discrepancy between observed and simulated precipitation elasticities of runoff and peak swe fig 10 showed that the results of sensitivity analysis are reliable and have less uncertainty in all three basins the higher discrepancy between observed and simulated air temperature elasticities of runoff in reynolds mountain fig 9c and peak swe in marmot creek fig 9e showed that the results of sensitivity analysis are less reliable in these two basins and one must interpret the results with care the simulations show that changes in snow regime in these mountain basins result in smaller changes in mean annual runoff than peak swe unlike peak swe mean annual runoff is more sensitive to changes in precipitation than air temperature fig 11 the near vertical lines in fig 11a and b indicate that changes in mean annual runoff are driven predominately by precipitation in wolf creek and marmot creek whilst temperature more strongly impacts runoff in reynolds mountain a 1 c warming in wolf creek resulted in a 3 decrease in the annual runoff table 2 total decreases rise to 14 for a 5 c warming 171 to 147 mm table 3 fig 11a the most extreme scenario of climate warming and decreased precipitation caused larger declines in runoff but if precipitation increases there is strong compensation for instance if precipitation increases by 20 annual runoff increases by 35 mm from 171 to 206 mm with 5 c of warming mean annual runoff is more sensitive than snow regime to precipitation change in wolf creek similarly in marmot creek a 5 c increase in air temperature results in a 4 decrease in the mean annual runoff 402 to 384 mm table 3 fig 11b the combination of 5 c of warming and 20 decreased precipitation reduces mean annual runoff by 34 135 mm from 402 to 267 mm table 3 fig 11b in reynolds mountain mean annual runoff has a stronger temperature sensitivity than wolf creek or marmot creek fig 11 a 5 c increase in temperature results in a 29 371 to 263 mm table 3 decrease in the mean annual runoff the combination of 5 c of warming and 20 decrease in precipitation reduces annual runoff by 43 371 to 161 mm table 3 change in mean annual runoff fig 11 contrasts with the change in mean annual peak swe figs 5 7 in that mean annual runoff is more sensitive to precipitation than temperature the sensitivity of annual runoff to temperature increase in reynolds mountain is because of the longer snow free season and an increased growing season and energy flux for evapotranspiration with increasing temperature fig 7 whilst runoff responds to both precipitation change and warming fig 11c in contrast to the sensitivity of snowpack to warming in reynolds mountain annual runoff is less sensitive and the impact of warming on annual runoff can be partly offset by an increase in precipitation in reynolds mountain annual runoff changes are given in table 3 under different scenarios of warming and changes in precipitation annual runoff responds strongly to precipitation changes in wolf creek and marmot creek and to both warming and precipitation changes in reynolds mountain annual runoff is the most resilient to warming in marmot creek and most sensitive to warming in reynolds mountain under 5 c and a 20 increased precipitation annual runoff increases from 171 mm to 206 mm 20 in wolf creek and increases from 402 mm to 518 mm 29 in marmot creek and from 371 mm to 415 mm 12 in reynolds mountain table 3 this shows that increased precipitation with warming increases the runoff in marmot creek more than the other two basins this is due to the very cold alpine snowpack at marmot creek which is relatively unaffected by warming in contrast to the warm snowpacks at reynolds mountain which become ephemeral with warming the amount of additional precipitation needed to offset the effect of increased temperature on peak swe and annual runoff under future climate can be estimated from the sensitivity analysis the largest increases in precipitation projected by the sres and rcps used here and narccap rcm gcms are 34 for wolf creek 18 for marmot creek and 16 for reynolds mountain this also covers the range from ssp5 8 5 similarly in wolf creek when warming is limited to 1 c increased precipitation of 4 can offset the effect of warming on peak swe fig 12 a but with warming of 5 c an increase in precipitation of 34 would be required to offset the effect of warming in marmot creek the effect of 1 c warming on peak swe can be offset by 8 increase in precipitation however the effect of 5 c warming on peak swe would require precipitation increases that are greater than expected from rcp scenarios and narccap simulations in reynolds mountain the impact of 1 c warming on peak swe can be offset by 16 increase in precipitation but the offset required for more than 2 c warming exceeds the projected maximum precipitation increases annual runoff is less sensitive than peak snowpack to warming and smaller precipitation increases are required to offset the effects of warming simulated here these differences are due to differences in the fraction of snowfall converted to rainfall in each basin under a warmer climate the additional precipitation needed to offset the impact of warming on runoff varies with elevation range precipitation regime and latitude offsetting the effect of warming of 5 c on annual runoff would require precipitation increases of 8 in wolf creek fig 12a 3 in marmot creek fig 12b and 14 in reynolds mountain fig 12c rasouli et al 2019a showed that the reduced snow sublimation loss offset reduced snowfall amounts and increased evapotranspiration loss offset increased rainfall amounts the evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio did not substantially change under a moderate warming of 2 2 2 6 c in the three basins table 5 and the increased evapotranspiration was largely due to enhanced wetness as a result of increased precipitation and to less extent due to warming here an energy balance method to calculate actual evapotranspiration restrained by continuity in surface and soil moisture availability was used and relative humidity rather than absolute humidity was held constant with warming so the overestimation of evapotranspiration with climate warming that is a feature of empirical and potential evapotranspiration schemes was avoided with the crhm models milly and dunne 2016 5 discussion air temperatures in late winter and spring have a key role in determining the sensitivity of snowpack in mountain basins to warming lettenmaier and gan 1990 stewart et al 2004 mccabe and clark 2005 the results presented above demonstrate and quantify the sensitivity of annual peak snowpack and its timing and of annual runoff to air temperature and precipitation changes and their interaction in the three basins sensitivity of annual peak snowpack timing to air temperature and precipitation changes in the three basins shows that the sensitivity of peak swe timing to precipitation changes is greater in the colder climate conditions reynolds mountain responds to warming only fig 7 marmot creek responds to warming and to a lesser extent to precipitation fig 6 and wolf creek responds to a complex interaction of warming and precipitation change fig 5 the potential for precipitation to counteract the effect of warming on the magnitude of the annual peak snowpack becomes smaller as latitude decreases therefore regional responses to warming and changes to precipitation must be considered bower et al 2004 particularly when evaluating future mountain hydrology roche et al 2018 sultana and choi 2018 this is because the snowpack is shallow and warm at the beginning and end of the season shallow warm snow ripens and melts faster than deep cold snow as it requires less energy input to overcome cold content and fill its liquid water holding capacity colbeck 1976 simulations of future conditions for snow regimes in reynolds mountain are in accord with the swe magnitude and timing trajectories of the past 50 years nayak et al 2010 the future simulations of peak swe and runoff elasticities are compared with observed analogies figs 9 and 10 precipitation and air temperature elasticities show minimal discrepancies except for air temperature elasticity of peak swe in marmot creek fig 9e and runoff in reynolds mountain fig 9c higher discrepancies in the air temperature elasticities in these two basins are likely due to a wider warming range used in the sensitivity analyses 0 c to 5 c which is not covered in the inter annual variability of the observation period less than 1 5 c fig 4 higher rates of warming and increased precipitation are projected by rcms in the northern latitudes mearns et al 2007 latitudinal change in the role of precipitation increase in offsetting the effect of warming on cold regions hydrology implies that even though northern latitudes will warm more graversen et al 2008 they may also have more precipitation therefore the precipitation increase may offset the impact of warming on snow and hydrological regimes in northern basins it is also expected that the response of hydrological processes in different latitudes to the same climatic change will differ although the snow regime in marmot creek fig 6 is as sensitive as in wolf creek fig 5 to warming and a decrease in precipitation its runoff regime is less sensitive than that in wolf creek partly due to a seasonal maxima of precipitation in spring during the seasonal snowmelt in marmot creek figs 8 and 9a and b these results are consistent with findings and projections for other mountain areas sultana and choi 2018 roche et al 2018 jennings and molotch 2019 lópez moreno et al 2020 the relatively lower sensitivity of the forest zone peak snow in wolf creek fig 5e is because of the increased unloading and hence reduced sublimation of intercepted snow at warmer air temperatures that counteracts the reduced snowfall pomeroy et al 2015 the higher resiliency of the marmot creek snowpack is due to smaller changes at high elevations and in the blowing snow sink zone of the treeline forest in which a deep snowpack is deposited that remains until mid summer macdonald et al 2010 harder et al 2015 rasouli et al 2019a the high elevation and high latitude basins are more resilient to warming because their temperatures are currently well below that required to shift the precipitation phase bavay et al 2013 jennings and molotch 2019 the snowpack lasts longer on the ground at high elevations in marmot creek which moderates the impact of snow loss at low elevations on runoff rasouli et al 2019a lópez moreno et al 2020 a high elevation band with air temperatures similar to that in low elevations in wolf creek and a rainy environment in the spring and early summer peak runoff period pomeroy et al 2016 explain why the drop in peak snow accumulation fig 9e is not reflected by a proportional drop in annual runoff fig 9b in marmot creek this highlights the role of spatial redistribution of snow on heterogeneous hydrological responses at different elevations in marmot creek the snow and runoff regimes are the most sensitive to warming in reynolds mountain because of the i higher annual mean air temperature ii near freezing air temperatures in winter and iii fewer number of days with freezing temperatures 120 days a year rasouli et al 2019a compared with the other basins rasouli et al 2019a found that under a moderate warming and increased precipitation of 7 and 2 in marmot creek and reynolds mountain respectively the annual runoff remained unchanged due to the offsetting effect of increased precipitation on increased evapotranspiration and offsetting effect of decreased sublimation on reduced snowfall rasouli et al 2019a less sensitivity of annual runoff to warming relative to snowpacks suggests that warming mountain snowpacks can be decoupled from hydrological regimes lópez moreno et al 2020 snowpack regimes in reynolds mountain are more sensitive to warming than to changes in precipitation similar to the cascade mountains of oregon usa sproles et al 2013 the air temperature elasticity of snowpack was found to be 8 c 1 in wolf creek 10 c 1 in marmot creek and 17 c 1 in reynolds mountain table 2 in wolf creek these results are similar to reductions per degree warming observed in the svalbard archipelago 79 n lópez moreno et al 2016 snowpack loss in marmot creek is in the range of 11 20 c 1 reduction reported for the pyrenees lópez moreno et al 2013 lópez moreno et al 2014 and comparable to a 15 c 1 reduction reported for the swiss alps beniston et al 2003 snow loss in reynolds mountain is similar to a 20 c 1 reduction reported for the washington cascades casola et al 2009 the results here are consistent with other basins with similar climates and that climate change affects snowpack in mountain basins across the globe with large reductions at mid latitudes and relatively small reductions at high latitudes roche et al 2018 sultana and choi 2018 under the severe warming of 5 c and 20 increased precipitation annual runoff increases in all three basins table 3 fig 10a c because of the increasing importance of rain in warmer climates suggesting that precipitation increase has a primary role in changing annual total runoff and there is a large shift in the runoff mechanism from being snowmelt driven to rainfall driven this shift may result in reduced runoff berghuijs et al 2014 if precipitation does not increase table 3 it might also alter forest vegetation over time by making it more prone to wildfire and disease the air temperature and precipitation elasticities of annual runoff and annual peak snowpack increase from the northern basin to the southern basin figs 9 and 10 the high slope of δ q δ t and variability around the fitted line for reynolds mountain indicate a strong sensitivity of annual runoff to warming and precipitation change fig 9c suggesting that changes in annual runoff are attributable to both warming and precipitation change in the southern basin the changes in annual runoff are not attributable to warming in the colder wolf creek and marmot creek fig 9a and 10b as demonstrated by the minimal variability around the fitted δ q δ p lines fig 10a and 10b and relatively mild slope of δ q δ t fig 9a and 10b the high slope of δ s w e δ t fig 9d f the low slope of δ s w e δ p fig 10d f and high variability around the fitted lines show that the changes in annual peak snowpack are primarily attributable to warming and secondarily to precipitation change in all three basins and particularly in reynolds mountain 5 1 offsetting temperature increases the impact of warming of 1 c on swe values over the winter and spring seasons can be offset by a precipitation increase of 20 for almost all swe values in all snow regimes in reynolds mountain however warming of 2 c or more cannot be offset by increases in precipitation of less than 20 the sensitivity of swe in the blowing snow source and sink hrus to warming is higher than that in the forested intercepted snow and sheltered forest gap hrus this is due to suppression of blowing snow redistribution processes by warming in wolf creek 61 n not only more warming but also an increase in precipitation is expected graversen et al 2008 which indicates that precipitation increases could partly offset the effect of warming on cold regions hydrology despite the uniformity of high mountain climates and similar response per degree warming the implication of these results is that mountain snow regime responses to climate change can differ substantially lópez moreno et al 2020 as noted for the three basins across north america studied here therefore regional analysis is required the large difference between snowpack response in reynolds mountain and wolf creek implies that warming in cool climates affects the maximum accumulated snowpack more than it does in cold climates warming affects the phase of precipitation causing a shift from snowfall to rainfall in the spring and fall transition seasons poulin et al 2011 whitfield and shook 2020 and a shift from march to january in reynolds mountain april to february in marmot creek and less than a month in wolf creek for the timing of peak snow accumulation table 3 the impacts of warming on snowpacks can be partly offset by a precipitation increase in the cold wolf creek and marmot creek climates but not in the cool reynolds mountain climate the snow season is expected to shorten by about two months in the subarctic wolf creek from 9 to 7 months three and half months in the cold marmot creek from 6 to 4 months and five months in the cool reynolds mountain basin from 6 to 1 month with concomitant warming and a decline in precipitation table 3 this implies that under climate warming the response of the snow hydrology to a precipitation increase changes with latitude from very little in reynolds mountain to very large in wolf creek snow hydrology is more sensitive to warming and precipitation phase change in the southern basin and is more resilient in marmot creek the sensitivity of annual runoff to warming in the three basins increases from north to south and it is in the range of 1 c 1 to 6 c 1 table 2 while projected precipitation elasticity is in the range of 1 5 to 2 1 table 4 indicating that the runoff change is primarily attributed to precipitation change and secondarily to warming hoerling et al 2019 separated the effects of temperature and precipitation changes on upper colorado river streamflow and found that two thirds of the climate change signal effect on declining streamflow over the past century was attributable to precipitation change warming had the secondary effect and runoff showed a modest sensitivity of 2 5 c 1 in contrast to annual runoff the projected temperature elasticity of annual peak snowpack is in the range of 8 c 1 to 17 c 1 lesser in wolf creek and higher in reynolds mountain table 2 while precipitation elasticity is in the range of 0 7 to 1 1 table 4 which indicates that changes in the annual peak snowpack is primarily attributed to warming and secondarily to precipitation change 6 conclusions annual perturbations of observed hourly air temperature and precipitation were used to drive physically based cold regions hydrological models of the elasticity and sensitivity of snow and runoff regimes in well instrumented mountain research basins that span the northern north american cordillera peak snowpack is sensitive to both warming and precipitation change in wolf creek in the subarctic yukon and is more sensitive to temperature in reynolds mountain in temperate idaho peak snowpack is most sensitive to warming in the sheltered site in reynolds mountain and to both warming and precipitation change in the blowing snow sink regime in reynolds mountain at lower elevations in marmot creek and the shrub tundra zone in wolf creek peak snowpack timing is more sensitive to warming in marmot creek and reynolds mountain but in wolf creek precipitation more strongly affects the timing of peak swe as temperatures remain largely below zero snow season start end and duration were found to be sensitive to warming in temperate idaho and subarctic yukon and to both warming and precipitation change in the continental canadian rockies marmot creek the scenario with severe climate warming and decreased precipitation in all three basins caused dramatic declines in swe a shortened snow covered period and decreases in annual runoff the decreases in snowpack depth and advances in the timing of peak snowpack are weakly reflected in changes to runoff regime in each basin the large changes in snowpack found here do not result in similar magnitude changes in annual runoff if precipitation decreases with warming the impacts on snowpacks are amplified with major implications for ecology winter transportation and hydrology smaller snowpacks and warmer weather would cause an increase in the snow free period which also would lengthen the evapotranspiration season increasing the annual evapotranspiration loss the importance of rainfall runoff mechanisms in these basins increases while snowmelt decreases under warmer and drier climatic conditions annual runoff decreases the projected precipitation elasticity of annual runoff increases from 1 7 in wolf creek to 2 1 in reynolds mountain and precipitation elasticity of snowpack increases from 0 7 in reynolds mountain to 1 1 in wolf creek indicating that increased precipitation would increase annual runoff more in the wet basin in the south than in the dry basin in the north increased precipitation resulted in more increased snowpack in the cold basin in the north than in the cool basin in the south for the same degree of warming the magnitude of the air temperature elasticity of annual runoff increases from 0 8 c 1 in marmot creek to 5 8 c 1 in reynolds mountain and the magnitude of air temperature elasticity of snowpack increases from 8 c 1 in wolf creek to 17 c 1 in reynolds mountain this shows that increased warming will decrease annual runoff and snowpack more in the wet basin in the south than the dry basin in the north under the same precipitation conditions the observed and simulated precipitation and air temperature elasticities of peak snowpack and runoff showed minimal discrepancies except for the air temperature elasticity of peak swe in marmot creek and of runoff in reynolds mountain the changes in annual runoff in the colder basins and elevations however are more attributable to precipitation change while the changes in peak snowpack are more attributable to warming in basins with cool climates and higher elevations changes in annual runoff are attributable to both precipitation change and warming increased precipitation expected from many climate projections can partially offset the effect of warming on snowpack and annual runoff the role of precipitation as a compensator for the impact of warming on peak snowpack and annual runoff is most effective in the colder high elevations and high latitudes and its effectiveness is reduced where snow regimes currently depend on blowing snow transport and redistribution which is very sensitive to temperature with increased precipitation high elevation and high latitude basin snow and hydrological regimes can be resilient to warming at lower elevations and latitudes however the impact of warming cannot be offset by any projected maximum precipitation increases in future climates the coupling of snow regimes to streamflow hydrology will remain strong in northern canada but weaker in the mountains of idaho and alberta as the climate warms in a manner consistent with the global decoupling noted by lópez moreno et al 2020 declaration of competing

3684,under global warming extreme hydrological events are experiencing increasingly violent fluctuations investigating changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation ep events is particularly critical for understanding the hydrological response to climate change based on high precision and long term daily grid precipitation data obtained from asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite 25 ep indices were examined for the tienshan mountains region of central asia tmca here the relationship between ep and associated large scale climate teleconnections is revealed by using a series of approaches such as trend analysis and the geographical detector method gmd a statistical tool to measure and attribute spatial stratified heterogeneity the results show an overall increase in ep during 1951 2014 as reflected in the 25 indices furthermore the number of consecutive dry days cdd decreased from 87 02 to 69 35 while the number of consecutive wet days cwd increased from 3 89 to 4 61 meanwhile the increasing trend of total precipitation prcptot was 18 43 mm 10a and changes in ep frequency were shown to increase with event rareness for r95p the observed changes in frequency are 34 46 but these jump to 96 58 for r99p moreover the study also notes that changes in ep are elevation dependent with middle altitude areas 1500 3500 m being most sensitive to change rates as well the study reveals that the occurrence of ep responds non linearly to climatic teleconnections and that the combined effect of two factors generally make much larger contributions to ep than the summation of individual factors further analyses indicate strong zonal circulation at 500 hpa 1000 hpa potential height increases airflow from west to east and the weakening of the east asian summer monsoon accompanied by the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the increase in mongolian anticyclone activity all bring sufficient exogenous water vapor from the north atlantic and indian ocean to the tmca keywords global warming extreme precipitation large scale climate teleconnections tienshan mountains central asia 1 introduction extreme precipitation ep often causes natural disasters such as floods landslides and mudslides posing an enormous threat to human society donat et al 2016 gao et al 2020 fischer and knutti 2015 with global warming there is an increase in the water vapor content in the atmosphere as well as an acceleration of the water cycle alexandra 2018 allen and ingram 2002 fischer and knutti 2016 irannezhad et al 2020 lenderink and fowler 2017 zhang et al 2012c more importantly the changes and trends of ep events are more sensitive to climate change than average precipitation chen et al 2016 schär et al 2016 duan et al 2019 fischer et al 2014 from a global perspective although the total amount of precipitation has not changed significantly trenberth 2011 detectable increases in ep have been found westra et al 2013 still the intensity frequency and duration of ep show an upward trajectory that is largely attributable to human activities gudmundsson et al 2021 meanwhile the spatial patterns of changes in ep are complex with regionally distinct trend signs donat et al 2013 konapala et al 2017 lehmann et al 2015 min et al 2011 pfahl et al 2017 consequently ep research has become an increasingly important topic fang et al 2019 myhre et al 2019 duan et al 2019 fischer and knutti 2015 generally human induced climate change has affected many weather and climate extremes worldwide ipcc 2021 for instance changes of ep indices exhibited an upward trend in intensity over large parts of eastern europe asia south america the mediterranean southeast asia and northwestern parts of north america donat et al 2013 specifically ma et al 2020 found that total summer precipitation precipitation extreme maximum 1 day precipitation heavy precipitation days daily precipitation 10 mm consecutive wet days daily precipitation 1 mm significantly increased in central asia besides myhre et al 2019 indicated that the increase in the frequency and intensity of ep i e the amount of daily precipitation above the 99th percentile r99p and the amount of daily precipitation above the 99 97th percentile including all days r99 97pall was generally greater in europe and japan than that experienced in the united states or australia from 1981 to 2010 the number of global precipitation events exceeding the record increased substantially with quite pronounced regional differences such as an increase of 80 in southeast asia summer and a decline of 24 in australia winter lehmann et al 2015 with every additional increment of global warming changes in extremes will continue to become larger ipcc 2021 the high sensitivity of ep to the additional 0 5 warming at 1 5 and 2 0 global warming levels will be observed in southeast asia for example the magnitude of the increase in r20mm very heavy precipitation days will reach 29 28 from the original 20 66 ge et al 2019 furthermore duan et al 2019 indicated that averaged maximum yearly precipitation will be likely to increase by approximately 18 under 4 k compared to the past in china meanwhile ep variability is affected by multiple factors including the climate system variability ali et al 2018 berg et al 2009 ding et al 2019 parisa et al 2020 the global large scale atmospheric oceanic circulation patterns shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 ding et al 2019 chen et al 2020 irannezhad et al 2021

al 2019 wang et al 2021 and the anthropogenic forcing fischer and knutti 2015 konapala et al 2017 etc perlwitz et al 2017 have indicated that regional climate variability cannot be understood without considering the role of large scale atmospheric circulation lots of considerable previous research have paid attention to the potential linkage of ep and associated large scale climate teleconnection patterns shi et al 2017 ding et al 2019 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 as an instance wang et al 2019 indicated that the eastward wind field anomalies at 850 hpa over the eurasian continent together with enhanced anticyclonic circulation near 47 n and 100 e provided favorable conditions for the occurrence of ep events over northwest china ning et al 2021 also demonstrated that summer extreme precipitation events in arid northwest china are significantly dominated by a deep zonal wave pattern associated with the deepening of the western siberian trough central asian high and mongolian high the arctic polar vortex east asian trough and circulation at 850 hpa have a great impact on ep in winter in northeast china zhang et al 2020a the strength and location of western north pacific subtropical high are closely related to the variation of summer precipitation in eastern china zhang et al 2017 el niño southern oscillation enso is an important factor driving the internal variability of climate trenberth et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 demonstrated that enso is one of main drivers for annual precipitation or ep periodic variation in xinjiang an arid semiarid region of china chen et al 2020 showed that the close linkage between the weaken east asian summer monsoon and the increasing summer precipitation in arid central asia thus we can clearly conclude that the ep variability associated large scale climate teleconnection factors across different regions shows obvious disparities the tienshan mountains known as the water tower of central asia chen et al 2016 yu et al 2020 are located in the hinterland of eurasia far from any sea they lie adjacent to the central asian nations of kazakhstan uzbekistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan and xinjiang in china since the past half a century the warming rate in central asia is significantly higher than that in the global or northern hemisphere which is bound to lead to changes in the spatiotemporal distribution and form of precipitation chen et al 2017 moreover extreme precipitation indices such as total summer precipitation and persistent precipitation extreme have been significantly augmented in central asia ma et al 2020 yao et al 2021 zhang 2018 zou et al 2021 generally several kinds of natural and secondary disasters caused by extreme climate events are reported in central asia leading to significant damage to the economy and society zhang 2018 zou et al 2021 for example natural disasters such as floods landslides and debris flow have affected 13 5 of the total land area of kazakhstan while 85 of the total land area of tajikistan is at risk of debris flow and the formation area of strong debris flow accounts for 32 additionally about 50 000 signs of landslides were recorded in the country of which 1500 threaten residential areas zhang 2018 still with the disintegration of the soviet union in the last century complex issues such as multiple political entities transboundary rivers and lack of hydro meteorological data have become intertwined making the handling of water related issues a challenging task therefore understanding the spatiotemporal variability of ep and its related large scale climate teleconnections mechanism in such politically volatile but ecologically fragile region is essential hence to comprehend the response of extreme events to global warming and finding better strategies to cope with water resources management the present study investigates extreme precipitation events and associated large scale climate teleconnections of the tmca for the past approximately 60 years 1951 2014 based on aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources data this work detected changes in 25 ep indices including the number of consecutive dry days cdd the number of continuous wet days cwd and the total precipitation prcptot the study also investigates the corresponding relationship with different climatic teleconnections factors and the specific objectives of this work are 1 to clarify the temporal and spatial changes of ep in the tmca during 1951 2014 and 2 to determine the degree of influence of climatic teleconnections factors on ep events and explain the associated large scale climatic circulation mechanisms 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the tienshan mountains region in central asia tmca sprawls across the nations of kazakhstan uzbekistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan as well as the xinjiang uygur autonomous region in northwest china the mountains span over 2500 km from east to west and around 250 350 km from north to south chen et al 2016 2017 li et al 2020c as shown in fig 1 the tmca is subdivided into the sub regions of west tienshan mountains middle tienshan

datasets 2 2 1 observed data generally most of the studies relied on meteorological station data but traditional station data has some limitations in time series and data integrity these limitations are especially pronounced in mountain regions making it difficult for researchers to discern long term changes kidd et al 2017 the aphrodite water resources project jointly carried out by the research

the performance of global climate models yatagai et al 2008 2012 samuels et al 2018 kim et al 2019 gusain et al 2020 however it has to be admitted that the author reluctantly regridded the raw spatial

meteorological administration https cmdp ncccma net monitoring cn index 130 php in addition there are 2 summer monsoon indices including the south asian summer monsoon index sam and east asian summer monsoon index eam which were obtained from collaborative work environment kit http ljp gcess cn dct page 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 extreme precipitation diagnosis the proxy climate indicator is one of the most commonly used methods for diagnosing ep characteristics at present the 27 core extreme climate indices proposed by the international expert group on climate change detection and indicators etccdi crd are widely applied in identifying hydro climate extremes among which 11 indices are related to ep ding et al 2019 irannezhad et al 2017 2021 zhang et al 2020a wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however artificial and misleading conclusions may be produced if we calculate precipitation percentiles while ignoring the changes in the frequency of the number of wet days schar et al 2016 therefore another 14 extended indices based on different percentage thresholds of wet day and all day precipitation have been added to the original group for example counting annual total precipitation determining the threshold according to the 95 99 99 9 and 99 95 percentiles based on the all day precipitation 1961 1990 that is r95pall r99pall r99 9pall r99 95pall the above indices can describe the temporal and spatial changes in ep from the perspective of duration frequency and intensity the determination method of indices threshold can be divided into the two categories of absolute threshold indices and relative threshold indices table s2 presents the specific meanings and calculation formulas for these indices 2 3 2 determination of impact factor the geographical detector method gdm is a set of statistical methods for detecting spatial stratified heterogeneity and revealing the driving forces behind them wang and xu 2017 xie et al 2020 generally based on the q value of the single driving factor and the two driving factors we can quantify the contribution of a single driving factor to the dependent variable attribute or phenomenon and judge whether there is interaction between the two factors please check the details about the gdm from wang and xu 2017 nevertheless since this method has a clear physical mechanism and does not need a linear hypothesis it is widely used in the fields of medicine health regional construction ecology atmospheric science and geosciences liao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b zhao et al 2020 therefore the strategy can be used to quantify the impacts of different large scale climate teleconnections on ep since the explanatory variables required to be input in the model must be a certain type of quantity we discretized 16 climate factors through the natural breaks jenks classification the factor contribution is measured by the following formula 1 q 1 ssw sst 2 ssw h 1 l n h δ h 2 3 sst n δ 2 where q is the degree of explanation contribution of a specific factor to the dependent variable with a value range of 0 1 ssw is the sum of variance within the strata sst is the total variance of the whole region h is the stratification number of the factor n nh represent the number of units in the whole area and layer h respectively and δ2 δh 2 refer to the variances of the dependent variables within the whole area and layer h respectively the larger the value of q the higher the degree of factor that explains the dependent variable 3 results 3 1 temporal changes of extreme precipitation we calculated ep indices over each grid box and then calculated the average over the region the mean values of cdd and cwd were 82 94 d and 4 18 d indicating that cdd has been continuously decreasing at a rate of 3 70 d decade p 0 01 while cwd has significantly increased at rates of 0 15 d decade p 0 01 fig 2 a table 1 besides the number of days with daily precipitation higher than 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm r5mm r10mm r20mm showed slightly decreasing trends as well the maximum precipitation per day rx1day and maximum precipitation for 5 consecutive days rx5day decreased slightly although prcptot showed increased rates of 18 43 mm decade however r95pall r99pall r99 9pall r99 95pall showed increasing trend and the significant levels of trend in r99 9pall r99 95pall are above 5 these changes indicate that the trend of extreme precipitation in the tmca toward humidification is mainly caused by less frequent of dry days and intensified in extremely strong precipitation fig 2 fig 3 b table 1 moreover around 1998 ep underwent an obvious change fig 2 fig 3 table 1 to put into perspective the mean values of cdd prcptot and frequency of r95p all r95pfall in 1951 1997 were 86 89 d 169 65 mm and 18 17 d respectively these changed to 71 99 d 171 64 mm and 28 42 d respectively 1998 2014 this informs that the frequency and intensity of ep in the tmca had increased in recent years moreover it is obvious that the frequency change rates of ep events increase according to their rarity specifically the frequency change rates that occurred once every 20 days 100 days 1000 days and 2000 days based on the wet period 1961 1990 r95pfwet r99pfwet r99 9pfwet r99 95pfwet was on average 34 46 96 58 597 58 and 853 98 respectively fig 3c 3 2 spatial distribution of extreme precipitation indices the characters of ep indices in the tmca have strong heterogeneity generally ep in the west tienshan mountains and middle tienshan mountains differs from that in the north and east tienshans with the latter two areas showing an increasing trend fig 4 fig 5 table s3 for case in point from 1951 to 2014 the tendencies of prcptot range from 10 08 to 18 43 mm decade fig 4c table s3 the results of the linear tendencies show that 65 03 34 70 0 and 1 36 of grids have decreasing trends in the west middle north and east tienshan mountains whereas 34 97 65 30 100 and 98 64 of grids exhibit increasing trends table s3 meanwhile 24 32 59 56 100 63 27 of grids indicate significant increasing trends p 0 05 in the west middle north and east tienshans whereas only 51 91 and 21 58 of the grids have significant decreasing trends p 0 05 in the west and middle tienshans in terms of r5mm r10mm and r20mm in the tmca the trends essentially remained the same the west tienshan mountains mainly showed a decreasing trend while all of the north and east tienshan mountains and most of the middle tienshan mountains showed an increasing trend fig 4d g h over the past 64 years r5mm r10mm and r20mm ranged from 0 93 to 0 97 d decade 0 52 to 0 20 d decade and 0 12 to 0 01 d decade respectively table s3 the r95pwet r95pall series indices with the threshold determined based on the wet all period from 1961 to 1990 also revealed the same spatial distribution characteristics this is characterized by a decreasing trend in the west tienshan mountains and western regions of the middle tienshan mountains and an increasing trend in the north and east tienshans as well as in the northern and eastern regions of the middle tienshans fig 5 additionally the trend change of the r95pall series indices is stronger than that of the r95pwet as presented in table s3 the change trend intensity for the r95pall series indices is approximately 1 86 6 67 times that of the r95pwet series indices more specifically all days demonstrate a less strict selection threshold compared to wet days 3 3 changes in extreme precipitation indices at different altitudes as mentioned previously the terrain in the tmca is highly complex most of the region is located at middle altitudes 1500 3500 m while about 20 is located at low altitudes 1500 m and 16 at high altitudes 3500 m li et al 2020c to reflect the changes in ep at different altitudes we calculated the changes in ep indices for low middle and high altitude areas the results show that ep indices have good dependency with altitude fig 6 for example the mean value of cdd in 1951 2014 decreases according to elevation with 95 84 88 86 d and 79 58 d at low middle and high altitudes meanwhile rx1day increases from 10 42 mm to 11 86 mm and 12 43 mm and the r95pfwet also rises from 1 72 d at low altitudes to 2 01 d and 2 22 d at middle and high altitudes respectively fig 6a b f series indices for areas of different altitudes an interesting phenomenon is noticed where the rate of frequency intensity change of ep events in middle altitude areas is stronger than that in high and low altitude areas we also noted that the rarer the extreme precipitation events were the greater the change rate of frequency intensity became fig 7 a b for example the increasing rate of r95pall ep events occurring once every 20 days at middle altitudes was 21 62 whereas it was in high and low altitude area it was 15 81 and 12 02 respectively additionally the changing rates of r99 95pall events ep events occurring once every 2000 days were 112 21 72 19 and 5 61 in middle high and low altitude regions respectively fig 7a 3 4 analysis of large scale climatic teleconnections affecting extreme precipitation 3 4 1 quantitative assessment of large scale climatic teleconnections contribution rate the above analysis shows that the increase in ep in the tmca is the result of the comprehensive effect of intensity frequency and duration of precipitation however there is a strong correlation among the selected 25 ep indices fig s1 for that 8 ep indices cdd prcptot r10mm rx1day r95pwet r95pall r99 95pfwet and r99 95pfall taking into account the type and independence of indices used for exploring the influence of large scale climatic teleconnections by the gdm this study quantified the magnitude of the effect of each factor on ep by calculating the q values which is a kind of detector in gdm table s4 based on these values the order of influence of all the large scale climatic teleconnections is shown in fig 8 although there are differences in the influence of large scale climatic teleconnections factors on ep indices sam amo ninob nsi sf ao and 30zw are the most important ones sam has the largest impact on ep with an average contribution rate of 23 while the average contribution of amo nino b nsi sf ao and 30zw is 22 21 19 11 10 and 9 respectively fig 8 the contribution of all factors to ep also showed differences in sub regions for cdd the largest driving factor in the middle north and east tienshan mountains is nino b with contribution rates of 35 40 and 34 respectively while the largest driving factor in the west tienshan mountains is sam with a contribution rate of 24 meanwhile for r10mm ao and sam are the main driving factors in the west and middle tienshan mountains with contribution rates of 38 and 37 respectively the main driving factors in the north tienshans are amo and nsi 3 4 2 influence of interactions between large scale climatic teleconnections shi et al 2017 found that the occurrence of ep is often the result of comprehensive effects of multiple factors to analyze the influence of interaction between various climatic teleconnections factors on the occurrence of ep we used an interaction detector a kind of detector in gdm to quantitatively evaluate the explanatory power when two factors simultaneously act on ep as shown in fig 9 and fig s2 the factors of all sub regions had an interactive effect on ep the interaction of various factors was divided into two types bivariate enhancement q x1 x2 q x1 and q x2 and nonlinear enhancement q x1 x2 q x1 q x2 it is worth noting that in bivariate enhancement the explanatory power of the interaction of the two proxy variables is greater than that of any variable prior to the interaction and that different manifestations highlighting cdd as an example all interactions are nonlinear enhancement except tsn sf in the west tienshan mountains while the interactions of tsn sf denote nonlinear enhancement in the middle north and east tienshan mountains fig 9a d from a spatial perspective there are differences in large scale climatic teleconnections factors associated with ep in different regions for r10mm the interaction of sf azi has the strongest explanatory power in the west and middle tienshan mountains while sam nsi sam 30zw have the strongest in the north and east tienshans respectively fig 9i l moreover the same two factors can have different interaction results in different sub regions taking r95pwet as an example the interaction of sam nsi has the strongest explanatory power in the middle and north tienshan mountains at 65 and 92 respectively while the interaction result in the west and east tienshan mountains is only 59 and 61 respectively fig s2a d 4 discussion 4 1 obvious spatial heterogeneity of extreme precipitation indices the current investigations on the changes of ep indicate a wet tendency in the tmca especially in recent years these results are strongly supported by previous studies chen et al 2016 chen et al 2020 ma et al 2020 ning et al 2021 yao et al 2021 zhang 2018 zhang et al 2012a zhang et al 2012c zhang et al 2013 zou et al 2021 for example we concluded that the consecutive wet days show a significant increase trend with a multi year average of 4 18 days from 1951 to 2014 in tmca and extended to 4 56 days in 1998 2014 based on aphrodite data table 1 the results are consistent with those results in xinjiang of china zhang et al 2012a and central asia ca ma et al 2020 according to meteorological observations the annual maximum consecutive wet days are mostly 2 4 days and are lengthened after 1987 in xinjiang zhang et al 2012a in ca maximum number of consecutive wet days in summer are 0 6 days during 1979 2018 increasing at rate of 0 02d a during 1978 2018 and 2 66 days a in 1996 2018 ma et al 2020 according to the changes of 25 ep indices we found that ep in the tmca toward humidification is mainly caused by less frequent dry days and intensified extremely strong precipitation fig 2 fig 3 and table 1 a similar phenomenon is also identified in xinjiang china zhang et al 2012c and ca yao et al 2021 that a wetting tendency was mainly attributed to increasing high precipitation there behaviors indicate the wettest days become more frequent at the expense of days with light or no precipitation fischer and knutti 2016 moreover changes in ep across the tmca seem to be inherent with the climate change around the world an increasing trend of ep is also identified in the world s dry and wet regions donat et al 2016 europe and the us fischer and knutti 2016 southeast asia ge et al 2019 irannezhad et al 2021 central asia ma et al 2020 yao et al 2021 zou et al 2021 eastern china zhang et al 2017 arid northwest china ning et al 2021 zhang et al 2012c etc the trend of ep indices shows strong spatial heterogeneity in the tmca fig 4 fig 5 for instance cwd in the north and east tienshan mountains shows an increasing trend but a decreasing trend appears in the eastern part of the west tienshan mountains and the western part of the middle tienshan mountains besides r5mm r10mm and r20mm tend to decrease mainly in the west tienshan mountains but increasing in the north tienshan mountains and most areas of the east and middle tienshan mountains in fact the obvious heterogeneity of ep in spatial pattern changes exists in many studies showing the opposite trend in different regions donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2016 ipcc 2021 zhang et al 2012c zhang et al 2018b even in the same geographical area the characteristics of different sub regions may be different deng et al 2014 ding et al 2019 irannezhad et al 2021 zhang et al 2012b zhang et al 2012c zhang et al 2013 for example zhang et al 2012c claimed that the strong extreme precipitation was more obvious in northern xinjiang and western region which weak extreme precipitation was more obvious in southern xinjiang and eastern region indicating that north xinjiang was getting wetter compared with south xinjiang in the tmca we found that the spatial changes of temperature precipitation snowfall snow area glacier deceleration rate and water storage also exhibit obvious heterogeneity besides extreme precipitation specifically from 1961 to 2014 the temperature in most areas of the tmca increased 0 0 4 c 10a however the temperature in the west and middle tienshan mountains dropped about 0 2 0 5 c 10a deng et al 2018 during the same period precipitation in the middle and east tienshan mountains showed an increasing trend at a rate between 0 and 15 mm 10a while precipitation in the west tienshan mountains showed a decreasing trend with a maximum decreasing rate of about 20 60 mm 10a deng et al 2018 from associated large scale climate teleconnections we found that the factors affecting ep also vary across different sub regions table s5 as for the absolute threshold indices of ep sf azi is the most critical factor in the west tienshan mountains in addition to sf azi sam nsi is important to ep in the middle tienshan mountains while sam amo sam nsi and sam 30zw are the main factors affecting ep in the north and east tienshan mountains regarding relative threshold indices ep is mostly affected by sam amo and sam nsi in the middle north and east tienshan mountains while amo nino3 4 is important in the west tienshan mountains moreover chen et al 2020 noted two key water vapor sources in arid central asia one is the westerly water vapor transport from the north atlantic and the other is the monsoon water vapor transport from the tropical indian ocean and the south china sea via the eastern and northern periphery of the tibetan plateau however the contribution of the monsoon water vapor transport was increasing with the continued weakening of the east asian monsoon since 1958 it has become the dominant source for the lower troposphere in arid central asia in our study ep is more strongly influenced by azi westerly wind circulation in the west tienshan mountains while for sam monsoon water vapor nsi contributes more to ep in the north and east tienshan mountains these climatic teleconnections explain why there is such a large difference in ep between western and eastern tmca we also noticed an interesting phenomenon in that the rate of frequency intensity change in ep events in the middle altitude areas is stronger than that in the high and low altitude areas thus the most sensitive change in the middle altitude may be related to the anti edw anti elevation dependent warming in this region li et al 2020a snow ice albedo feedback is a key physical mechanism that leads to this phenomenon because mountains have warmed at a higher rate than the rest of the land surface rangwala and miller 2012 however li et al 2020b found a general reduction in snow cover fraction from the high mountains to the low mountains from 2002 to 2017 snow melts in middle altitude areas decreases the surface albedo and thus the surface absorbs more solar radiation and strengthens atmospheric surface feedback therefore in our study the middle altitude areas are the most sensitive to the extreme precipitation variations 4 2 possible forcing factors of extreme precipitation variation we first quantified the magnitude of effect on ep of each associated large scale climatic teleconnections and then analyzed the explanatory power of interaction of the above factors on ep events using the gdm our results unveiled that sam amo ninob nsi sf ao and 30zw are the most important factors impacting ep and that the interaction of multiple factors is more likely to cause an ep event in general sam nsi sam 30zw sf azi and amo nino 3 4 have the strongest explanatory power on ep el niño southern oscillation enso is an important factor driving the internal variability of climate it also has a significant impact on global dry and wet change through ocean atmosphere interactions trenberth et al 2014 over the past 60 years el niño has charted an increasing trend fig 10 b and when it occurs most of the low latitudes south of 40 n in central asia are dominated by significant abnormal high pressure while areas north of 40 n experience abnormal low pressure the low pressure anomalies induced by enso strengthen the westerly and southwesterly winds from the north atlantic and the indian ocean and further facilitate the transport of large amounts of water vapor to central asia hu et al 2019 ma et al 2020 studying wind speeds and geopotential heights at the 500hpa altitude also found that there were negative geopotential highs and abnormal cyclones over northern central asia after 1998 as well as positive geopotential highs and abnormal anticyclones over mongolia in this situation the westerly wind was strengthened bringing a humid climate which provided favorable precipitation conditions to northern kazakhstan and the tienshan mountains in central asia the westerly index azi is an indicator of the westerly wind component of the average geostrophic wind speed which can quantitatively describe the strength of the zonal circulation shi et al 2011 from fig 11 a we can see that an increasing trend was detected in general when the azi increases the zonal circulation from west to east strengthens and the movement of 45 60 n airflow on the 500 hpa isobaric surface speeds up at the same time the meridional circulation from north to south weakens and the movement of 60 150 e airflow on 500 hpa isobaric surface slows down ning et al 2021 concluded that summer extreme precipitation events in xinjiang are characterized by zonal wave patterns which strongly supported our results it is generally believed that north atlantic moisture carried by mid latitude westerlies dominates precipitation changes in arid central asia where monsoon moisture is beyond their reach chen et al 2020 however many studies have confirmed that monsoonal water vapour transport is affecting precipitation variations not only in arid central asia but also in non monsoon regions including the northwest arid area of china chen et al 2020 chen et al 2021 ding et al 2019 monsoonal transport is related to the weakening of the eam which is accompanied by the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the increase in mongolian anticyclone activity chen et al 2020 in recent decades the eam has the greatest influence on interannual variation of the first corresponding time coefficient pc1s of r95p r10mm and r20mm through the lancang mekong river basin where climate variability is strongly affected by monsoons irannezhad et al 2021 we can see an obvious increasing trend in the nsi and a decreasing trend in the sam and eam for the past 60 years fig 11b c d the increase in nsi is beneficial to the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high that promotes the westward transport of water vapor from the indian and pacific oceans and enhances summer precipitation in arid central asia chen et al 2020 the amo shift in the warm and cold phases possibly had a profound impact on changes in extreme precipitation not only in and around the atlantic ocean but also in china we can see that the amo entered a warm phase at the end of the 1990s fig 11e ding et al 2019 found that the change trend for all extreme precipitation indices is significantly greater when the amo enters a warm phase in non monsoon regions of china irannezhad et al 2021 concluded that the strongest teleconnection associated wet dry spells was amo in the lancang mekong river basin in our study amo is another climatic teleconnection factor which has the greatest influence on ep besides sam the contribution rate of amo to the number of consecutive dry days in the west middle north and east tienshan mountains is 13 30 36 30 respectively meanwhile an increasing trend was detected in the ao with most of these trends in recent years being a positive phase fig 11f the positive phase of ao brings low pressure to the arctic surface along with enhanced zonal circulation and weakened meridional circulation which increases the surface temperature in the middle latitudes generally the zonal circulation at the 500 hpa and 1000 hpa potential height increases while the meridional circulation weakens accelerating the movement of air flow from west to east and bringing sufficient exogenous water vapor from the north atlantic the weakening of the eam is accompanied by the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and an increase in mongolian anticyclone activity which benefits monsoonal water vapour transport from the tropical indian ocean and south china sea on the other hand rising temperatures lead to greater evaporation resulting in an increase in water vapor molecules in the air which undoubtedly provides favorable conditions for the formation of regional precipitation 4 3 uncertainty analysis and future prospects there are two main uncertainties or limitations encountered in this study the first is the selection of the dataset due to the sparsity of in situ stations and limitations in time series we had to choose precipitation data sets in the tmca despite major variations in topography altitude and glacial distribution therefore to make the results more convincing we also referred to the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa climate prediction center cpc precipitation dataset which has good agreement with gpcp and trmm 3b42 v7 in depicting the precipitation in central asia during 1997 8 2018 with the correlation coefficients of 0 89 and 0 91 respectively ma et al 2020 the selected aphrodite data shows a coincident trend and the correlation coefficient achieves 0 85 p 0 001 with the cpc during 1979 2014 fig s3 we chose the aphrodite dataset to depict ep in the tmca with its advantage in high spatial resolution and long spatial extension secondly the driving mechanism of ep change is highly complex owing to numerous factors affecting regional precipitation variability these include climate system variability large scale atmospheric circulation patterns regional environment characteristics human activities and so on ding et al 2019 irannezhad et al 2021 in this investigation we only analyzed the influence of associated large scale climatic teleconnections therefore further research could involve a comprehensive physical mechanisms analysis as the climate warms the water cycle accelerates and the intensity of precipitation and risk of flooding increases posing serious threats to arid regions donat et al 2016 yet heavy precipitation events do not occur frequently in arid areas most flood control projects and water conservancy infrastructure are designed according to the intensity time frequency idf curve of ep in historical periods however under increasingly erratic climate change conditions the frequency and intensity of ep events have significantly altered if no corresponding measures are taken even small changes in ep will have a sizeable impact on society donat et al 2016 pfahl et al 2017 parisa et al 2020 there is no doubt that human activities warm the atmosphere oceans and land and this warming is unprecedented over many centuries to thousands of years ipcc 2021 global climate models project that global surface temperatures will continue to rise and the global average surface temperature over 2081 2100 is very likely to be 3 3 to 5 7 higher than in the pre industrial period taking into account the very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario ipcc 2021 under this background changes in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation become larger at the global scale extreme daily precipitation events are projected to intensify by about 7 for every 1 c of global warming ipcc 2021 in central asia rx1day and rx5day are expected to increase robustly at a rate of 6 30 and 5 71 for each 1 c of global warming peng et al 2020 additional 0 5 c warmer from 1 5 c to 2 0 c global warming targets can double increase of extreme precipitation in china wang et al 2020 r20mm is also projected to increase by 8 6 in southeast asia ge et al 2019 what s more the vulnerability or exposures of human society and natural ecosystems to climate extreme change will be greatly increased in the future in the global monsoon region the areal and population exposures of dangerous extreme precipitation would increase consistently with warming zhang et al 2018c most regions of china will have a higher occurrence rate of extreme precipitation in a warmer climate and exposures of land and population to rx5day in the western arid semi arid region and the qinghai tibet plateau are the most sensitive to climate warming wang et al 2020 therefore in the next work we should not only consider the credibility of the data but also pay attention to the changes and risk prediction of extreme precipitation under different warming levels and different emission scenarios 5 conclusion this paper assessed the temporal and spatial changes of ep in the tienshan mountains region of central asia from 1951 to 2014 it also determined the climate system factors affecting ep based on gmd in our investigations we found the following 1 from 1951 to 2014 the cdd in the tmca decreased at a rate of 3 70 d 10a p 0 001 and the cwd increased at a rate of 0 15 d 10a p 0 001 further r5mm r10mm and r20 mm showed a slight decrease 2 the rarer that extreme precipitation events are the greater the change rate of frequency intensity becomes across different altitude areas ep indices show good elevation dependence meanwhile the increasing trend of ep in the eastern part of the tmca was stronger than that in the western region 3 finally gmd found that sam amo ninob nsi sf ao and 30zw were the most important factors affecting ep during the study period overall the joint contribution of multi factors to ep events was larger than the contribution of single factors and the enhancement of zonal circulation at 500 hpa and 1000 hpa accelerated the airflow from west to east finally the weakening of the eam accompanied by the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the increase in mongolian anticyclone activity were shown to bring sufficient exogenous water vapor from the north atlantic and indian

3684,under global warming extreme hydrological events are experiencing increasingly violent fluctuations investigating changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation ep events is particularly critical for understanding the hydrological response to climate change based on high precision and long term daily grid precipitation data obtained from asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite 25 ep indices were examined for the tienshan mountains region of central asia tmca here the relationship between ep and associated large scale climate teleconnections is revealed by using a series of approaches such as trend analysis and the geographical detector method gmd a statistical tool to measure and attribute spatial stratified heterogeneity the results show an overall increase in ep during 1951 2014 as reflected in the 25 indices furthermore the number of consecutive dry days cdd decreased from 87 02 to 69 35 while the number of consecutive wet days cwd increased from 3 89 to 4 61 meanwhile the increasing trend of total precipitation prcptot was 18 43 mm 10a and changes in ep frequency were shown to increase with event rareness for r95p the observed changes in frequency are 34 46 but these jump to 96 58 for r99p moreover the study also notes that changes in ep are elevation dependent with middle altitude areas 1500 3500 m being most sensitive to change rates as well the study reveals that the occurrence of ep responds non linearly to climatic teleconnections and that the combined effect of two factors generally make much larger contributions to ep than the summation of individual factors further analyses indicate strong zonal circulation at 500 hpa 1000 hpa potential height increases airflow from west to east and the weakening of the east asian summer monsoon accompanied by the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the increase in mongolian anticyclone activity all bring sufficient exogenous water vapor from the north atlantic and indian ocean to the tmca keywords global warming extreme precipitation large scale climate teleconnections tienshan mountains central asia 1 introduction extreme precipitation ep often causes natural disasters such as floods landslides and mudslides posing an enormous threat to human society donat et al 2016 gao et al 2020 fischer and knutti 2015 with global warming there is an increase in the water vapor content in the atmosphere as well as an acceleration of the water cycle alexandra 2018 allen and ingram 2002 fischer and knutti 2016 irannezhad et al 2020 lenderink and fowler 2017 zhang et al 2012c more importantly the changes and trends of ep events are more sensitive to climate change than average precipitation chen et al 2016 schär et al 2016 duan et al 2019 fischer et al 2014 from a global perspective although the total amount of precipitation has not changed significantly trenberth 2011 detectable increases in ep have been found westra et al 2013 still the intensity frequency and duration of ep show an upward trajectory that is largely attributable to human activities gudmundsson et al 2021 meanwhile the spatial patterns of changes in ep are complex with regionally distinct trend signs donat et al 2013 konapala et al 2017 lehmann et al 2015 min et al 2011 pfahl et al 2017 consequently ep research has become an increasingly important topic fang et al 2019 myhre et al 2019 duan et al 2019 fischer and knutti 2015 generally human induced climate change has affected many weather and climate extremes worldwide ipcc 2021 for instance changes of ep indices exhibited an upward trend in intensity over large parts of eastern europe asia south america the mediterranean southeast asia and northwestern parts of north america donat et al 2013 specifically ma et al 2020 found that total summer precipitation precipitation extreme maximum 1 day precipitation heavy precipitation days daily precipitation 10 mm consecutive wet days daily precipitation 1 mm significantly increased in central asia besides myhre et al 2019 indicated that the increase in the frequency and intensity of ep i e the amount of daily precipitation above the 99th percentile r99p and the amount of daily precipitation above the 99 97th percentile including all days r99 97pall was generally greater in europe and japan than that experienced in the united states or australia from 1981 to 2010 the number of global precipitation events exceeding the record increased substantially with quite pronounced regional differences such as an increase of 80 in southeast asia summer and a decline of 24 in australia winter lehmann et al 2015 with every additional increment of global warming changes in extremes will continue to become larger ipcc 2021 the high sensitivity of ep to the additional 0 5 warming at 1 5 and 2 0 global warming levels will be observed in southeast asia for example the magnitude of the increase in r20mm very heavy precipitation days will reach 29 28 from the original 20 66 ge et al 2019 furthermore duan et al 2019 indicated that averaged maximum yearly precipitation will be likely to increase by approximately 18 under 4 k compared to the past in china meanwhile ep variability is affected by multiple factors including the climate system variability ali et al 2018 berg et al 2009 ding et al 2019 parisa et al 2020 the global large scale atmospheric oceanic circulation patterns shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 ding et al 2019 chen et al 2020 irannezhad et al 2021 ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a human activities min et al 2011 fischer and knutti 2015 gudmundsson et al 2021 konapala et al 2017 the regional geographical characteristics ding et al 2019 li et al 2020a ma et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and so on specifically the main factors such as the solar activity zhang et al 2021 the dew point temperature ali et al 2018 the latitude longitude altitude ding et al 2019 wang et al 2021 and the anthropogenic forcing fischer and knutti 2015 konapala et al 2017 etc perlwitz et al 2017 have indicated that regional climate variability cannot be understood without considering the role of large scale atmospheric circulation lots of considerable previous research have paid attention to the potential linkage of ep and associated large scale climate teleconnection patterns shi et al 2017 ding et al 2019 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 as an instance wang et al 2019 indicated that the eastward wind field anomalies at 850 hpa over the eurasian continent together with enhanced anticyclonic circulation near 47 n and 100 e provided favorable conditions for the occurrence of ep events over northwest china ning et al 2021 also demonstrated that summer extreme precipitation events in arid northwest china are significantly dominated by a deep zonal wave pattern associated with the deepening of the western siberian trough central asian high and mongolian high the arctic polar vortex east asian trough and circulation at 850 hpa have a great impact on ep in winter in northeast china zhang et al 2020a the strength and location of western north pacific subtropical high are closely related to the variation of summer precipitation in eastern china zhang et al 2017 el niño southern oscillation enso is an important factor driving the internal variability of climate trenberth et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 demonstrated that enso is one of main drivers for annual precipitation or ep periodic variation in xinjiang an arid semiarid region of china chen et al 2020 showed that the close linkage between the weaken east asian summer monsoon and the increasing summer precipitation in arid central asia thus we can clearly conclude that the ep variability associated large scale climate teleconnection factors across different regions shows obvious disparities the tienshan mountains known as the water tower of central asia chen et al 2016 yu et al 2020 are located in the hinterland of eurasia far from any sea they lie adjacent to the central asian nations of kazakhstan uzbekistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan and xinjiang in china since the past half a century the warming rate in central asia is significantly higher than that in the global or northern hemisphere which is bound to lead to changes in the spatiotemporal distribution and form of precipitation chen et al 2017 moreover extreme precipitation indices such as total summer precipitation and persistent precipitation extreme have been significantly augmented in central asia ma et al 2020 yao et al 2021 zhang 2018 zou et al 2021 generally several kinds of natural and secondary disasters caused by extreme climate events are reported in central asia leading to significant damage to the economy and society zhang 2018 zou et al 2021 for example natural disasters such as floods landslides and debris flow have affected 13 5 of the total land area of kazakhstan while 85 of the total land area of tajikistan is at risk of debris flow and the formation area of strong debris flow accounts for 32 additionally about 50 000 signs of landslides were recorded in the country of which 1500 threaten residential areas zhang 2018 still with the disintegration of the soviet union in the last century complex issues such as multiple political entities transboundary rivers and lack of hydro meteorological data have become intertwined making the handling of water related issues a challenging task therefore understanding the spatiotemporal variability of ep and its related large scale climate teleconnections mechanism in such politically volatile but ecologically fragile region is essential hence to comprehend the response of extreme events to global warming and finding better strategies to cope with water resources management the present study investigates extreme precipitation events and associated large scale climate teleconnections of the tmca for the past approximately 60 years 1951 2014 based on aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources data this work detected changes in 25 ep indices including the number of consecutive dry days cdd the number of continuous wet days cwd and the total precipitation prcptot the study also investigates the corresponding relationship with different climatic teleconnections factors and the specific objectives of this work are 1 to clarify the temporal and spatial changes of ep in the tmca during 1951 2014 and 2 to determine the degree of influence of climatic teleconnections factors on ep events and explain the associated large scale climatic circulation mechanisms 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the tienshan mountains region in central asia tmca sprawls across the nations of kazakhstan uzbekistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan as well as the xinjiang uygur autonomous region in northwest china the mountains span over 2500 km from east to west and around 250 350 km from north to south chen et al 2016 2017 li et al 2020c as shown in fig 1 the tmca is subdivided into the sub regions of west tienshan mountains middle tienshan mountains north tienshan mountains and east tienshan mountains the altitude of the mountains ranges from 284 m to 7126 m and includes valleys and lowlands below 1500 m low altitude shrub forest distribution areas at 1500 3000 m middle altitude and glaciers above 3000 m high altitude the present study mainly refers to the mountain areas in the middle and high altitude deng et al 2018 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 observed data generally most of the studies relied on meteorological station data but traditional station data has some limitations in time series and data integrity these limitations are especially pronounced in mountain regions making it difficult for researchers to discern long term changes kidd et al 2017 the aphrodite water resources project jointly carried out by the research institute for human and nature and the meteorological research institute of the japan meteorological agency provide a set of highly resolved daily grid precipitation data over monsoon asian middle east and russia northern eurasia yatagai et al 2008 yatagai et al 2012 http aphrodite st hirosaki u ac jp download the gridded fields of daily precipitation are defined by interpolating rain gauge observations obtained from meteorological and hydrological stations across the region in combination with the intelligent interpolation algorithm of a digital elevation model chen et al 2008 compared with other grid data aphrodite takes into consideration the influence of terrain on precipitation and also has a more uniform spatial distribution it is often used as observational data for evaluating the performance of global climate models yatagai et al 2008 2012 samuels et al 2018 kim et al 2019 gusain et al 2020 however it has to be admitted that the author reluctantly regridded the raw spatial resolution 0 05 degree data to 0 25 and 0 5 degree products due to the data policy this process potentially influences extreme values yatagai et al 2008 yatagai et al 2012 furthermore aphrodite has been applied in the mountainous areas of central asia fang 2016 the eastern mediterranean samuels et al 2018 and the asian summer monsoon region kim et al 2019 irannezhad et al 2021 concerning extreme

research results berg et al 2009 deng et al 2014 ding et al 2019 chen et al 2020 ma et al 2020 irannezhad et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 16 atmospheric teleconnections indices with month long scale resolutions were selected to explore the relationship between regional ep and associated large scale climate teleconnections in the tmca table s1 these indices include 14 large scale ocean atmosphere

meteorological administration https cmdp ncccma net monitoring cn index 130 php in addition there are 2 summer monsoon indices including the south asian summer monsoon index sam and east asian summer monsoon index eam which were obtained from collaborative work environment kit http ljp gcess cn dct page 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 extreme precipitation diagnosis the proxy climate indicator is one of the most commonly used methods for diagnosing ep characteristics at present the 27 core extreme climate indices proposed by the international expert group on climate change detection and indicators etccdi crd are widely applied in identifying hydro climate extremes among which 11 indices are related to ep ding et al 2019 irannezhad et al 2017 2021 zhang et al 2020a wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however artificial and misleading conclusions may be produced if we calculate precipitation percentiles while ignoring the changes in the frequency of the number of wet days schar et al 2016 therefore another 14 extended indices based on different percentage thresholds of wet day and all day precipitation have been added to the original group for example counting annual total precipitation determining the threshold according to the 95 99 99 9 and 99 95 percentiles based on the all day precipitation 1961 1990 that is r95pall r99pall r99 9pall r99 95pall the above indices can describe the temporal and spatial changes in ep from the perspective of duration frequency and intensity the determination method of indices threshold can be divided into the two categories of absolute threshold indices and relative threshold indices table s2 presents the specific meanings and calculation formulas for these indices 2 3 2 determination of impact factor the geographical detector method gdm is a set of statistical methods for detecting spatial stratified heterogeneity and revealing the driving forces behind them wang and xu 2017 xie et al 2020 generally based on the q value of the single driving factor and the two driving factors we can quantify the contribution of a single driving factor to the dependent variable attribute or phenomenon and judge whether there is interaction between the two factors please check the details about the gdm from wang and xu 2017 nevertheless since this method has a clear physical mechanism and does not need a linear hypothesis it is widely used in the fields of medicine health regional construction ecology atmospheric science and geosciences liao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b zhao et al 2020 therefore the strategy can be used to quantify the impacts of different large scale climate teleconnections on ep since the explanatory variables required to be input in the model must be a certain type of quantity we discretized 16 climate factors through the natural breaks jenks classification the factor contribution is measured by the following formula 1 q 1 ssw sst 2 ssw h 1 l n h δ h 2 3 sst n δ 2 where q is the degree of explanation contribution of a specific factor to the dependent variable with a value range of 0 1 ssw is the sum of variance within the strata sst is the total variance of the whole region h is the stratification number of the factor n nh represent the number of units in the whole area and layer h respectively and δ2 δh 2 refer to the variances of the dependent variables within the whole area and layer h respectively the larger the value of q the higher the degree of factor that explains the dependent variable 3 results 3 1 temporal changes of extreme precipitation we calculated ep indices over each grid box and then calculated the average over the region the mean values of cdd and cwd were 82 94 d and 4 18 d indicating that cdd has been continuously decreasing at a rate of 3 70 d decade p 0 01 while cwd has significantly increased at rates of 0 15 d decade p 0 01 fig 2 a table 1 besides the number of days with daily precipitation higher than 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm r5mm r10mm r20mm showed slightly decreasing trends as well the maximum precipitation per day rx1day and maximum precipitation for 5 consecutive days rx5day decreased slightly although prcptot showed increased rates of 18 43 mm decade however r95pall r99pall r99 9pall r99 95pall showed increasing trend and the significant levels of trend in r99 9pall r99 95pall are above 5 these changes indicate that the trend of extreme precipitation in the tmca toward humidification is mainly caused by less frequent of dry days and intensified in extremely strong precipitation fig 2 fig 3 b table 1 moreover around 1998 ep underwent an obvious change fig 2 fig 3 table 1 to put into perspective the mean values of cdd prcptot and frequency of r95p all r95pfall in 1951 1997 were 86 89 d 169 65 mm and 18 17 d respectively these changed to 71 99 d 171 64 mm and 28 42 d respectively 1998 2014 this informs that the frequency and intensity of ep in the tmca had increased in recent years moreover it is obvious that the frequency change rates of ep events increase according to their rarity specifically the frequency change rates that occurred once every 20 days 100 days 1000 days and 2000 days based on the wet period 1961 1990 r95pfwet r99pfwet r99 9pfwet r99 95pfwet was on average 34 46 96 58 597 58 and 853 98 respectively fig 3c 3 2 spatial distribution of extreme precipitation indices the characters of ep indices in the tmca have strong heterogeneity generally ep in the west tienshan mountains and middle tienshan mountains differs from that in the north and east tienshans with the latter two areas showing an increasing trend fig 4 fig 5 table s3 for case in point from 1951 to 2014 the tendencies of prcptot range from 10 08 to 18 43 mm decade fig 4c table s3 the results of the linear tendencies show that 65 03 34 70 0 and 1 36 of grids have decreasing trends in the west middle north and east tienshan mountains whereas 34 97 65 30 100 and 98 64 of grids exhibit increasing trends table s3 meanwhile 24 32 59 56 100 63 27 of grids indicate significant increasing trends p 0 05 in the west middle north and east tienshans whereas only 51 91 and 21 58 of the grids have significant decreasing trends p 0 05 in the west and middle tienshans in terms of r5mm r10mm and r20mm in the tmca the trends essentially remained the same the west tienshan mountains mainly showed a decreasing trend while all of the north and east tienshan mountains and most of the middle tienshan mountains showed an increasing trend fig 4d g h over the past 64 years r5mm r10mm and r20mm ranged from 0 93 to 0 97 d decade 0 52 to 0 20 d decade and 0 12 to 0 01 d decade respectively table s3 the r95pwet r95pall series indices with the threshold determined based on the wet all period from 1961 to 1990 also revealed the same spatial distribution characteristics this is characterized by a decreasing trend in the west tienshan mountains and western regions of the middle tienshan mountains and an increasing trend in the north and east tienshans as well as in the northern and eastern regions of the middle tienshans fig 5 additionally the trend change of the r95pall series indices is stronger than that of the r95pwet as presented in table s3 the change trend intensity for the r95pall series indices is approximately 1 86 6 67 times that of the r95pwet series indices more specifically all days demonstrate a less strict selection threshold compared to wet days 3 3 changes in extreme precipitation indices at different altitudes as mentioned previously the terrain in the tmca is highly complex most of the region is located at middle altitudes 1500 3500 m while about 20 is located at low altitudes 1500 m and 16 at high altitudes 3500 m li et al 2020c to reflect the changes in ep at different altitudes we calculated the changes in ep indices for low middle and high altitude areas the results show that ep indices have good dependency with altitude fig 6 for example the mean value of cdd in 1951 2014 decreases according to elevation with 95 84 88 86 d and 79 58 d at low middle and high altitudes meanwhile rx1day increases from 10 42 mm to 11 86 mm and 12 43 mm and the r95pfwet also rises from 1 72 d at low altitudes to 2 01 d and 2 22 d at middle and high altitudes respectively fig 6a b f series indices for areas of different altitudes an interesting phenomenon is noticed where the rate of frequency intensity change of ep events in middle altitude areas is stronger than that in high and low altitude areas we also noted that the rarer the extreme precipitation events were the greater the change rate of frequency intensity became fig 7 a b for example the increasing rate of r95pall ep events occurring once every 20 days at middle altitudes was 21 62 whereas it was in high and low altitude area it was 15 81 and 12 02 respectively additionally the changing rates of r99 95pall events ep events occurring once every 2000 days were 112 21 72 19 and 5 61 in middle high and low altitude regions respectively fig 7a 3 4 analysis of large scale climatic teleconnections affecting extreme precipitation 3 4 1 quantitative assessment of large scale climatic teleconnections contribution rate the above analysis shows that the increase in ep in the tmca is the result of the comprehensive effect of intensity frequency and duration of precipitation however there is a strong correlation among the selected 25 ep indices fig s1 for that 8 ep indices cdd prcptot r10mm rx1day r95pwet r95pall r99 95pfwet and r99 95pfall taking into account the type and independence of indices used for exploring the influence of large scale climatic teleconnections by the gdm this study quantified the magnitude of the effect of each factor on ep by calculating the q values which is a kind of detector in gdm table s4 based on these values the order of influence of all the large scale climatic teleconnections is shown in fig 8 although there are differences in the influence of large scale climatic teleconnections factors on ep indices sam amo ninob nsi sf ao and 30zw are the most important ones sam has the largest impact on ep with an average contribution rate of 23 while the average contribution of amo nino b nsi sf ao and 30zw is 22 21 19 11 10 and 9 respectively fig 8 the contribution of all factors to ep also showed differences in sub regions for cdd the largest driving factor in the middle north and east tienshan mountains is nino b with contribution rates of 35 40 and 34 respectively while the largest driving factor in the west tienshan mountains is sam with a contribution rate of 24 meanwhile for r10mm ao and sam are the main driving factors in the west and middle tienshan mountains with contribution rates of 38 and 37 respectively the main driving factors in the north tienshans are amo and nsi 3 4 2 influence of interactions between large scale climatic teleconnections shi et al 2017 found that the occurrence of ep is often the result of comprehensive effects of multiple factors to analyze the influence of interaction between various climatic teleconnections factors on the occurrence of ep we used an interaction detector a kind of detector in gdm to quantitatively evaluate the explanatory power when two factors simultaneously act on ep as shown in fig 9 and fig s2 the factors of all sub regions had an interactive effect on ep the interaction of various factors was divided into two types bivariate enhancement q x1 x2 q x1 and q x2 and nonlinear enhancement q x1 x2 q x1 q x2 it is worth noting that in bivariate enhancement the explanatory power of the interaction of the two proxy variables is greater than that of any variable prior to the interaction and that different manifestations highlighting cdd as an example all interactions are nonlinear enhancement except tsn sf in the west tienshan mountains while the interactions of tsn sf denote nonlinear enhancement in the middle north and east tienshan mountains fig 9a d from a spatial perspective there are differences in large scale climatic teleconnections factors associated with ep in different regions for r10mm the interaction of sf azi has the strongest explanatory power in the west and middle tienshan mountains while sam nsi sam 30zw have the strongest in the north and east tienshans respectively fig 9i l moreover the same two factors can have different interaction results in different sub regions taking r95pwet as an example the interaction of sam nsi has the strongest explanatory power in the middle and north tienshan mountains at 65 and 92 respectively while the interaction result in the west and east tienshan mountains is only 59 and 61 respectively fig s2a d 4 discussion 4 1 obvious spatial heterogeneity of extreme precipitation indices the current investigations on the changes of ep indicate a wet tendency in the tmca especially in recent years these results are strongly supported by previous studies chen et al 2016 chen et al 2020 ma et al 2020 ning et al 2021 yao et al 2021 zhang 2018 zhang et al 2012a zhang et al 2012c zhang et al 2013 zou et al 2021 for example we concluded that the consecutive wet days show a significant increase trend with a multi year average of 4 18 days from 1951 to 2014 in tmca and extended to 4 56 days in 1998 2014 based on aphrodite data table 1 the results are consistent with those results in xinjiang of china zhang et al 2012a and central asia ca ma et al 2020 according to meteorological observations the annual maximum consecutive wet days are mostly 2 4 days and are lengthened after 1987 in xinjiang zhang et al 2012a in ca maximum number of consecutive wet days in summer are 0 6 days during 1979 2018 increasing at rate of 0 02d a during 1978 2018 and 2 66 days a in 1996 2018 ma et al 2020 according to the changes of 25 ep indices we found that ep in the tmca toward humidification is mainly caused by less frequent dry days and intensified extremely strong precipitation fig 2 fig 3 and table 1 a similar phenomenon is also identified in xinjiang china zhang et al 2012c and ca yao et al 2021 that a wetting tendency was mainly attributed to increasing high precipitation there behaviors indicate the wettest days become more frequent at the expense of days with light or no precipitation fischer and knutti 2016 moreover changes in ep across the tmca seem to be inherent with the climate change around the world an increasing trend of ep is also identified in the world s dry and wet regions donat et al 2016 europe and the us fischer and knutti 2016 southeast asia ge et al 2019 irannezhad et al 2021 central asia ma et al 2020 yao et al 2021 zou et al 2021 eastern china zhang et al 2017 arid northwest china ning et al 2021 zhang et al 2012c etc the trend of ep indices shows strong spatial heterogeneity in the tmca fig 4 fig 5 for instance cwd in the north and east tienshan mountains shows an increasing trend but a decreasing trend appears in the eastern part of the west tienshan mountains and the western part of the middle tienshan mountains besides r5mm r10mm and r20mm tend to decrease mainly in the west tienshan mountains but increasing in the north tienshan mountains and most areas of the east and middle tienshan mountains in fact the obvious heterogeneity of ep in spatial pattern changes exists in many studies showing the opposite trend in different regions donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2016 ipcc 2021 zhang et al 2012c zhang et al 2018b even in the same geographical area the characteristics of different sub regions may be different deng et al 2014 ding et al 2019 irannezhad et al 2021 zhang et al 2012b zhang et al 2012c zhang et al 2013 for example zhang et al 2012c claimed that the strong extreme precipitation was more obvious in northern xinjiang and western region which weak extreme precipitation was more obvious in southern xinjiang and eastern region indicating that north xinjiang was getting wetter compared with south xinjiang in the tmca we found that the spatial changes of temperature precipitation snowfall snow area glacier deceleration rate and water storage also exhibit obvious heterogeneity besides extreme precipitation specifically from 1961 to 2014 the temperature in most areas of the tmca increased 0 0 4 c 10a however the temperature in the west and middle tienshan mountains dropped about 0 2 0 5 c 10a deng et al 2018 during the same period precipitation in the middle and east tienshan mountains showed an increasing trend at a rate between 0 and 15 mm 10a while precipitation in the west tienshan mountains showed a decreasing trend with a maximum decreasing rate of about 20 60 mm 10a deng et al 2018 from associated large scale climate teleconnections we found that the factors affecting ep also vary across different sub regions table s5 as for the absolute threshold indices of ep sf azi is the most critical factor in the west tienshan mountains in addition to sf azi sam nsi is important to ep in the middle tienshan mountains while sam amo sam nsi and sam 30zw are the main factors affecting ep in the north and east tienshan mountains regarding relative threshold indices ep is mostly affected by sam amo and sam nsi in the middle north and east tienshan mountains while amo nino3 4 is important in the west tienshan mountains moreover chen et al 2020 noted two key water vapor sources in arid central asia one is the westerly water vapor transport from the north atlantic and the other is the monsoon water vapor transport from the tropical indian ocean and the south china sea via the eastern and northern periphery of the tibetan plateau however the contribution of the monsoon water vapor transport was increasing with the continued weakening of the east asian monsoon since 1958 it has become the dominant source for the lower troposphere in arid central asia in our study ep is more strongly influenced by azi westerly wind circulation in the west tienshan mountains while for sam monsoon water vapor nsi contributes more to ep in the north and east tienshan mountains these climatic teleconnections explain why there is such a large difference in ep between western and eastern tmca we also noticed an interesting phenomenon in that the rate of frequency intensity change in ep events in the middle altitude areas is stronger than that in the high and low altitude areas thus the most sensitive change in the middle altitude may be related to the anti edw anti elevation dependent warming in this region li et al 2020a snow ice albedo feedback is a key physical mechanism that leads to this phenomenon because mountains have warmed at a higher rate than the rest of the land surface rangwala and miller 2012 however li et al 2020b found a general reduction in snow cover fraction from the high mountains to the low mountains from 2002 to 2017 snow melts in middle altitude areas decreases the surface albedo and thus the surface absorbs more solar radiation and strengthens atmospheric surface feedback therefore in our study the middle altitude areas are the most sensitive to the extreme precipitation variations 4 2 possible forcing factors of extreme precipitation variation we first quantified the magnitude of effect on ep of each associated large scale climatic teleconnections and then analyzed the explanatory power of interaction of the above factors on ep events using the gdm our results unveiled that sam amo ninob nsi sf ao and 30zw are the most important factors impacting ep and that the interaction of multiple factors is more likely to cause an ep event in general sam nsi sam 30zw sf azi and amo nino 3 4 have the strongest explanatory power on ep el niño southern oscillation enso is an important factor driving the internal variability of climate it also has a significant impact on global dry and wet change through ocean atmosphere interactions trenberth et al 2014 over the past 60 years el niño has charted an increasing trend fig 10 b and when it occurs most of the low latitudes south of 40 n in central asia are dominated by significant abnormal high pressure while areas north of 40 n experience abnormal low pressure the low pressure anomalies induced by enso strengthen the westerly and southwesterly winds from the north atlantic and the indian ocean and further facilitate the transport of large amounts of water vapor to central asia hu et al 2019 ma et al 2020 studying wind speeds and geopotential heights at the 500hpa altitude also found that there were negative geopotential highs and abnormal cyclones over northern central asia after 1998 as well as positive geopotential highs and abnormal anticyclones over mongolia in this situation the westerly wind was strengthened bringing a humid climate which provided favorable precipitation conditions to northern kazakhstan and the tienshan mountains in central asia the westerly index azi is an indicator of the westerly wind component of the average geostrophic wind speed which can quantitatively describe the strength of the zonal circulation shi et al 2011 from fig 11 a we can see that an increasing trend was detected in general when the azi increases the zonal circulation from west to east strengthens and the movement of 45 60 n airflow on the 500 hpa isobaric surface speeds up at the same time the meridional circulation from north to south weakens and the movement of 60 150 e airflow on 500 hpa isobaric surface slows down ning et al 2021 concluded that summer extreme precipitation events in xinjiang are characterized by zonal wave patterns which strongly supported our results it is generally believed that north atlantic moisture carried by mid latitude westerlies dominates precipitation changes in arid central asia where monsoon moisture is beyond their reach chen et al 2020 however many studies have confirmed that monsoonal water vapour transport is affecting precipitation variations not only in arid central asia but also in non monsoon regions including the northwest arid area of china chen et al 2020 chen et al 2021 ding et al 2019 monsoonal transport is related to the weakening of the eam which is accompanied by the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the increase in mongolian anticyclone activity chen et al 2020 in recent decades the eam has the greatest influence on interannual variation of the first corresponding time coefficient pc1s of r95p r10mm and r20mm through the lancang mekong river basin where climate variability is strongly affected by monsoons irannezhad et al 2021 we can see an obvious increasing trend in the nsi and a decreasing trend in the sam and eam for the past 60 years fig 11b c d the increase in nsi is beneficial to the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high that promotes the westward transport of water vapor from the indian and pacific oceans and enhances summer precipitation in arid central asia chen et al 2020 the amo shift in the warm and cold phases possibly had a profound impact on changes in extreme precipitation not only in and around the atlantic ocean but also in china we can see that the amo entered a warm phase at the end of the 1990s fig 11e ding et al 2019 found that the change trend for all extreme precipitation indices is significantly greater when the amo enters a warm phase in non monsoon regions of china irannezhad et al 2021 concluded that the strongest teleconnection associated wet dry spells was amo in the lancang mekong river basin in our study amo is another climatic teleconnection factor which has the greatest influence on ep besides sam the contribution rate of amo to the number of consecutive dry days in the west middle north and east tienshan mountains is 13 30 36 30 respectively meanwhile an increasing trend was detected in the ao with most of these trends in recent years being a positive phase fig 11f the positive phase of ao brings low pressure to the arctic surface along with enhanced zonal circulation and weakened meridional circulation which increases the surface temperature in the middle latitudes generally the zonal circulation at the 500 hpa and 1000 hpa potential height increases while the meridional circulation weakens accelerating the movement of air flow from west to east and bringing sufficient exogenous water vapor from the north atlantic the weakening of the eam is accompanied by the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and an increase in mongolian anticyclone activity which benefits monsoonal water vapour transport from the tropical indian ocean and south china sea on the other hand rising temperatures lead to greater evaporation resulting in an increase in water vapor molecules in the air which undoubtedly provides favorable conditions for the formation of regional precipitation 4 3 uncertainty analysis and future prospects there are two main uncertainties or limitations encountered in this study the first is the selection of the dataset due to the sparsity of in situ stations and limitations in time series we had to choose precipitation data sets in the tmca despite major variations in topography altitude and glacial distribution therefore to make the results more convincing we also referred to the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa climate prediction center cpc precipitation dataset which has good agreement with gpcp and trmm 3b42 v7 in depicting the precipitation in central asia during 1997 8 2018 with the correlation coefficients of 0 89 and 0 91 respectively ma et al 2020 the selected aphrodite data shows a coincident trend and the correlation coefficient achieves 0 85 p 0 001 with the cpc during 1979 2014 fig s3 we chose the aphrodite dataset to depict ep in the tmca with its advantage in high spatial resolution and long spatial extension secondly the driving mechanism of ep change is highly complex owing to numerous factors affecting regional precipitation variability these include climate system variability large scale atmospheric circulation patterns regional environment characteristics human activities and so on ding et al 2019 irannezhad et al 2021 in this investigation we only analyzed the influence of associated large scale climatic teleconnections therefore further research could involve a comprehensive physical mechanisms analysis as the climate warms the water cycle accelerates and the intensity of precipitation and risk of flooding increases posing serious threats to arid regions donat et al 2016 yet heavy precipitation events do not occur frequently in arid areas most flood control projects and water conservancy infrastructure are designed according to the intensity time frequency idf curve of ep in historical periods however under increasingly erratic climate change conditions the frequency and intensity of ep events have significantly altered if no corresponding measures are taken even small changes in ep will have a sizeable impact on society donat et al 2016 pfahl et al 2017 parisa et al 2020 there is no doubt that human activities warm the atmosphere oceans and land and this warming is unprecedented over many centuries to thousands of years ipcc 2021 global climate models project that global surface temperatures will continue to rise and the global average surface temperature over 2081 2100 is very likely to be 3 3 to 5 7 higher than in the pre industrial period taking into account the very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario ipcc 2021 under this background changes in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation become larger at the global scale extreme daily precipitation events are projected to intensify by about 7 for every 1 c of global warming ipcc 2021 in central asia rx1day and rx5day are expected to increase robustly at a rate of 6 30 and 5 71 for each 1 c of global warming peng et al 2020 additional 0 5 c warmer from 1 5 c to 2 0 c global warming targets can double increase of extreme precipitation in china wang et al 2020 r20mm is also projected to increase by 8 6 in southeast asia ge et al 2019 what s more the vulnerability or exposures of human society and natural ecosystems to climate extreme change will be greatly increased in the future in the global monsoon region the areal and population exposures of dangerous extreme precipitation would increase consistently with warming zhang et al 2018c most regions of china will have a higher occurrence rate of extreme precipitation in a warmer climate and exposures of land and population to rx5day in the western arid semi arid region and the qinghai tibet plateau are the most sensitive to climate warming wang et al 2020 therefore in the next work we should not only consider the credibility of the data but also pay attention to the changes and risk prediction of extreme precipitation under different warming levels and different emission scenarios 5 conclusion this paper assessed the temporal and spatial changes of ep in the tienshan mountains region of central asia from 1951 to 2014 it also determined the climate system factors affecting ep based on gmd in our investigations we found the following 1 from 1951 to 2014 the cdd in the tmca decreased at a rate of 3 70 d 10a p 0 001 and the cwd increased at a rate of 0 15 d 10a p 0 001 further r5mm r10mm and r20 mm showed a slight decrease 2 the rarer that extreme precipitation events are the greater the change rate of frequency intensity becomes across different altitude areas ep indices show good elevation dependence meanwhile the increasing trend of ep in the eastern part of the tmca was stronger than that in the western region 3 finally gmd found that sam amo ninob nsi sf ao and 30zw were the most important factors affecting ep during the study period overall the joint contribution of multi factors to ep events was larger than the contribution of single factors and the enhancement of zonal circulation at 500 hpa and 1000 hpa accelerated the airflow from west to east finally the weakening of the eam accompanied by the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the increase in mongolian anticyclone activity were shown to bring sufficient exogenous water vapor from the north atlantic and indian
