24195,tillage practices have a substantial impact on the production and consumption of greenhouse gasses ghg which are the primary contributors to global warming co2 and ch4 emissions were stimulated in cotton wheat rotations using the denitrification decomposition dndc model under various tillage techniques the dndc model was parameterized using experimental data collected at darab agricultural research station over the course of five years 2013 2017 wheat and cotton were grown with zero tillage direct seeding minimum tillage and conventional tillage the model was then utilized to simulate co2 and ch4 emissions from cotton fields in rotation with wheat in the fourth and fifth years the model validation results indicate that the model was effective at simulating soil factors and emitting gasses the simulation results indicated that the average annual co2 emissions for conventional tillage minimum tillage and zero tillage treatments were 1858 0 2116 0 and 2359 50 kg ha respectively and the average annual ch4 emissions were 4 75 4 00 and 3 45 kg ha respectively in the fourth and fifth years of the experiment based on the results of this study it can be recommended that zero tillage is preferable to other cultivation treatments in wheat cotton rotations under similar conditions to those used in this study keywords no tillage farm management modeling cotton wheat rotation

to our country s dry and semi arid climate conserving plant residues in the soil appears to be one solution kassam et al 2018 land management practices have the potential to alter the soil s ability to regulate biochemical reactions while also reducing carbon losses wang et al 2008 tillage and residue management can significantly alter carbon c and nitrogen n dynamics affecting ghg emissions and crop yields liu et al 2014 experiments conducted in china over the last 50 years have demonstrated that increasing on farm residues reduces ghg emissions during the growing season song et al 2019 tillage and crop residue management have a large impact on crop yield and ghg emissions liu et al 2014 ma et al 2009 conservation tillage is expected to reduce co2 emissions in agriculture chatskikh et al 2008 because soil organic carbon soc is relatively stable for decades net co2 emissions can modify soc stability in an annual vegetation ecosystem if the value δsoc the difference between the soc at the beginning and end of the study is negative the soil is a source of atmospheric co2 and if the δsoc value is positive it is a reservoir cui et al 2014 irrigation and plow management have been linked to significant co2 flux differences temperature has been shown to affect co2 release from soils jabro et al 2007 to study climate change and field applications on ghg emissions and changes in soil relationships estimative models are used li et al 2010 when simulating carbon and nitrogen cycles and ghg emissions from agricultural land the dndc denitrification decomposition model delivers reliable results to determine the parameters of soil plant biogeochemical processes this model employs classical physics chemistry and biology laws in conjunction with experimental findings derived from laboratory studies giltrap et al 2010 li defined the structure of the model as well as its equations and parameters in the year 2000 this model is capable of simulating at both the farm and regional level the model s output values can also be compared to field observations and measurements at the farm level along with daily simulations dndc produces an annual output of crop performance carbon nitrogen and water flows c li 2000 the dndc model links ecological climate soil vegetation and human environmental variables to soil environmental variables such as temperature and humidity these variables control the carbon and nitrogen deformation processes which are used to simulate a variety of target variables cui et al 2014 dndc has been widely used on farms and in rural areas under a variety of different conditions brown et al 2002 cai et al 2003 kesik et al 2005 babu et al 2006 wang et al 2012 however no simulation studies utilizing dndc for iranian agricultural systems have been conducted to predict soc dynamics the dndc model has been used to simulate soc dynamics and ghg emissions from farms aerobic cultivation and wetlands anaerobic cultivation in china li et al 2003 tang et al 2006 wang and wang 2003 dndc is typically used to simulate expected changes in soc as a result of co2 and ch4 emissions from a variety of farm management practices numerous other studies have conducted short or long term simulations of som content or co2 and ch4 emissions using experimental data zhang et al 2006 li 2007 wang et al 2008 qiu et al 2009 li et al 2010 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2021 chen et al 2021 inconsistent results from research conducted in various regions and on various crops prompted this study in hot climates of fars province winter wheat and cotton are often rotated together wheat and cotton yields are currently high due to high input use and tillage given the decreased efficiency of inputs like nitrogen and the scarcity of available water this single objective management is clearly not environmentally sustainable wheat and cotton farming in fars province must evolve from single objective to multi objective to determine optimal soil management practices and their effectiveness in retaining atmospheric carbon and reducing ghg emissions proven simulation models are a cost effective method due to the high cost of direct measurements and high error associated with point measurements this issue is vital for determining agricultural soil carbon content role in ghg production and emission and development of sustainable agriculture this study aimed to determine using the dndc model the effect of various tillage systems on greenhouse gas emissions in a cotton wheat rotation field 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental layout the study was carried out at the hassanabad darab agricultural research station of the fars agricultural and natural resources research center about 230 kms south of shiraz 57 54 e 29 28 n 1107 m a s l the climate in the region is hot and dry with an average annual rainfall of 285 mm the soil texture was loamy and three years prior to the experiment the land had been fallow five consecutive cropping years of experiments were conducted to determine the effects of various tillage methods on ghg emissions in cotton cultivation a randomized complete block design with three treatments in four replications was used to determine the effects of various tillage methods on ghg emissions in cotton cultivation 2013 2017 two composite samples were taken from the field at the experimental site to determine the physical and chemical properties of soil and the desired characteristics were determined according to the soil and water research institute s instructions table 1 the treatments used in the study were as follows v1 zero tillage zt direct drill of wheat and cotton throughout the experiment v2 minimum tillage mt one time compound tillage with a combined tillage machine 15 20 cm followed by sowing wheat and cotton with an automatic cereal planter machine and a semiautomatic planter respectively v3 conventional tillage ct moldboard plow 20 25 cm disk harrow 8 10 cm and followd by sowing wheat and cotton with pneumatic seeders adapted for wheat and semiautomatic planter respectively the wheat cultivar used in this experiment was mehregan which was resistant to yellow brown and black rust the cotton cultivar used was golestan the treatments were distributed across 180 m2 plots 30 m long and 6 m wide wheat crops were sown every five years in the final week of october at a spacing of 0 15 m between rows and 0 02 m within rows wheat crops was harvested using a specialized combine and 30 of wheat residues were distributed in the field under conservation cultivation treatments zt and mt cotton crops were sown in the final week of may at a spacing of 0 70 m between rows and 0 20 m between rows except for the soil tillage system all other agricultural operation for cotton were done according to the instructions of the iranian cotton research institute the experimental field was irrigated with a siphon to maintain a constant water level in all plots irrigation time was assumed to be identical across all study treatments irrigation was used every 14 days throughout the experiment to eliminate the effects of moisture every five years the amount of fertilizer used was determined by a soil test in wheat and cotton fields fertilizer application was similar all superphosphate fertilizer equivalent to 30 kg ha p2o5 and potassium nitrate equivalent to 44 kg ha k2o and one third of urea fertilizer equivalent to 60 kg ha of pure nitrogen at planting time was given to the plots by the sower the remaining urea fertilizer was applied by hand in two stages one after sowing and another after flowering terflan was applied at a rate of 4 l ha to control weeds in the cotton field and manual weeding was performed twice once during the 4 leaf stage with thinning 40 days after planting and once during the pre flowering stage 2 2 measurement 2 2 1 soil moisture the moisture content of samples with known weight and volume was determined the samples used for volumetric measurement were extracted using a specific volume container by placing the sample in an oven at 105 c until its weight is stabilized moisture is extracted from the sample the soil moisture was then calculated by subtracting the weight of the initial soil from the weight of the dried soil the weight percentage of moisture was multiplied by the apparent specific gravity of the soil to convert weight units to volume the percentage of water filled pore space wfps was also calculated using the paul method to determine the amount of soil moisture paul 2007 wfps was determined utilizing eq 1 1 wfps vwc 1 bd pd 100 where vwc is the soil s volumetric water content m3 m3 using eq 2 the bulk density bd at a soil depth of 5 cm was determined and the bulk density pd of 2 65 g cm3 was taken into account 2 b d w d v where bd denotes the bulk density of soil gr cm3 wd denotes the mass of dry soil g and v denotes the total volume of soil cm3 2 2 2 temperature of the soil throughout the experiment the average soil temperature was determined using a maximum minimum tfa rod thermometer model ip 67 germany this measurement was performed daily at 11 am to coincide with the time of gas emission sampling 2 2 3 soil organic matter content at the end of the experiment soil was sampled from two depths of 0 10 and 10 20 cm in each plot to determine the amount of soil organic matter following drying samples were sieved using a 2 mm mesh the percentage of organic carbon in soil samples was determined in the laboratory using the nelson and sommer method nelson and sommer 1982 2 2 4 cotton yield and yield components at the end of the season after removing one meter from the top and bottom of each plot as well as two border lines the crop was harvested from a 10 m2 area in each plot and the cotton yield and average weight of 20 bolls were determined cotton biomass was determined during harvest by cutting the plants from the soil surface and drying them in an oven at 70 c for 48 h 2 2 5 measurement of co2 and ch4 emissions the amount of co2 and ch4 emitted by the soil surface was determined using the closed chamber method melling et al 2005 toma and hatano 2007 the chambers were made of p v c and the length and diameter of the chambers were 50 and 30 cm respectively the edges of which were sunk 3 cm into the soil during sampling daily co2 and ch4 emissions were determined throughout the growing season to minimize the effect of daily temperature variations measurements were made between 9 and 12 a m shimizu et al 2009 these measurements were conducted with a portable pvc flow through non steady state chamber coupled to a portable co2 and ch4 infrared gas analyzer model 535 germany during each measurement the chamber 150 mm internal diameter and 5 50 10 3m3 internal volume was attached to a pvc collar 150 mm internal diameter and 50 mm height that had been inserted 25 mm into the soil to prevent soil disturbance and the resulting undesirable emissions a pump system regulating the chamber s mixing fan circulated air from the chamber to the irga and back at a flow rate of 1 l min 1 over a sampling period a data logger connected to the irga recorded the co2 and ch4 concentrations every second and the efflux was calculated from the concentration increase over time before each flow measurement the chamber was shaken for a few seconds until the co2 concentration reached the ambient level to ensure the device s accuracy it was calibrated using laboratory methods at planting time and three times randomly throughout the growth period at the beginning and two hours after placing the chamber 25 ml of the chamber gas was extracted with a vacuum syringe german brand push vacuum blood collection vial gas samples were collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis the amount of co2 and ch4 was determined in the laboratory using a gas chromatography gc device manufactured by agilent technologies model gc msd usa finally co2 and ch4 emissions per unit area were calculated using eq 3 and matched to the numbers of devices used in the field bingrui and zhou 2009 3 s r δ c δ t ν a where sr is the rate of gas emission mg of co2 h m2 c is the increase in gas concentration mg m3 over time h v is the volume of the air chamber m3 and a is the area of the ground covered by the chamber m2 the relationship between soil temperature and co2 and ch4 emissions was determined using eq 4 shimizu et al 2009 4 f α e x p b t where f denotes gas emissions t denotes soil temperature and a and b denote the equation s coefficients to improve accuracy the soil temperature was measured during the sampling process and the emissions were measured adjacent to the chamber to calculate annual co2 and ch4 emissions based on daily soil temperature measurements throughout the entire year soil gas emissions were calculated using eqs 3 and 4 shimizu et al 2009 the dndc 9 5 model was used to simulate gas emissions in this study c li 2000 describes in detail the structures equations and parameters associated with agricultural management practices in the dndc model the dndc model requires the following input parameters 1 local meteorological data such as maximum daily air temperature c minimum daily air temperature c and daily rainfall mm 2 initial soil physical and chemical characteristics such as soil texture bulk density soil ph wfps in field capacity and wilting point and 3 agricultural management information such as tilling method tilling date irrigation input mode input irrigation date and amount for each irrigation event and amount of water applied daily rainfall data as well as daily maximum and minimum temperatures were obtained from the hassanabad darab meteorological station 2 3 statistical analysis of the results of model simulations the model s predictive ability was evaluated using the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the regression coefficient of real valued error against predicted values the nrmse was calculated using eq 6 rinaldi et al 2003 6 n r m s e 100 i 1 n p i o i 2 n o m e a n where pi and oi denote the predicted and observed values respectively n denotes the number of actual plant component measurements and omean denotes the average of the observed values the nrmse is expressed as a percentage of the relative difference between the predicted and observed values by definition the model s predictive power is considered to be excellent if the nrmse value is less than 10 good if it is between 10 and 20 moderate if it is between 20 and 30 and poor if it is greater than 30 several studies have been conducted on this topic rinaldi et al 2001 miehle et al 2006 in linear regression the correlation coefficient r2 indicates how closely the simulated data matches the observed data the equations were fitted and statistical calculations were performed using excel software 2 4 calibration of the model typically there is a clear relationship between the model s general shape and the physical system under study via the model s parameters this relationship establishes the accuracy of parameter values required for the dndc model to produce a specific fit between the model output and the measured output farahbakhshazad et al 2008 the model was calibrated in this study through trial and error manual method this method incorporates measurable parameters such as soil temperature and moisture as well as the biological and economic performance of cotton into the model while performing preliminary estimates on unknown parameters the model was then implemented and its output compared to that observed in the initial sample the model was calibrated using data from the first three years of research in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation validating crop simulation models is a critical step before using them in simulation studies huang et al 2009 the nrmse and regression coefficient of the measured values against the predicted values model output were used to predict the model s robustness the model s values for soil temperature and humidity aboveground biomass yield and annual co2 emissions were compared to field and laboratory measurements following calibration and verification of performance accuracy the model was used for simulation in 2016 and 2017 3 1 1 validation of soil temperature and humidity from october 2013 to october 2015 fig 1 a depicts the simulated vs observed values of the average daily soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm in three treatments the time pattern and simulated values were consistent with those obtained from field measurements co2 and ch4 emissions from 2016 to 2017 no till treatments are depicted in fig 2 the linear correlation coefficient r2 between the simulated soil s average monthly temperatures and the observed values was 0 98 the slope was 1 07 p 0 01 and the nrmse was 10 18 fig 3 a from october 2013 to october 2015 fig 1b depicts the water filled pore space in all three treatments in most cases the model prediction included temporal variations and the measured amount of water filled pore space at depths of 0 to 5 cm although some values were different between the simulated values and the average monthly observed humidity the linear correlation coefficient r2 was 0 97 the slope was 0 97 p 0 01 and the nrmse was 17 47 fig 3b 3 1 2 validation of plant aerial biomass simulated plant aerial biomass changes for wheat and cotton were consistent with field observations wheat aerial biomass was extremely low during the winter and increased significantly in the spring whereas cotton aerial biomass increased proportionately with plant growth fig 4 this dynamic was successfully simulated by this model linear regression of cotton aerial biomass simulation values vs observed values from 2013 to 2015 reveals an r2 of 0 97 and a slope of 0 92 p 0 01 indicating a high degree of agreement fig 5 a the simulation s nrmse was 12 52 3 1 3 validation of economic yield between 2013 and 2015 fig 5b compares the simulated vs observed yields of cotton in three treatments the first three years of experiement as linear regression demonstrates there is a high degree of agreement between simulations vs observations in economic yield with r2 equal to 0 73 and slope equal to 0 73 p 0 01 the nrmse was 18 51 table 2 three year yield simulations for the studied treatments indicate that the mean yield was 2 81 2 68 and 2 78 mg ha 1 for mt zt and ct treatments respectively fig 6 3 1 4 validation of co2 emissions from soil annual co2 emissions in the field for the three tillage treatments ranged between 1 73 and 2 63 mg ha 1 with an average of 2 138 mg ha 1 according to observed values the simulation values model output for annual co2 emissions from various tillage treatments ranged from 1 80 to 2 83 mg ha 1 with an average of 2 228 mg ha 1 fig 7 r2 was equal to 0 81 with a significant slope p 0 01 of 0 94 for linear regression comparing simulated and observed co2 emissions in different treatments the nrmse for simulating co2 emissions was 17 23 these findings demonstrate that despite a wide variety of farm management practices annual co2 emissions are consistent between simulations vs observations this demonstrates that the model was capable of simulating and estimating the effects of various co2 emission management strategies 3 2 co2 emission from soil in the years 2016 17 because tillage methods had a significant effect on the amount of soil organic carbon it was predictable that they would have a significant effect on the amount of co2 emitted from the soil surface the highest co2 emissions in zt treatment were simulated in 2016 and 2017 at 2 608 and 2 111 mg ha yr respectively both conservation tillage treatments zt and mt produced significantly more co2 than ct treatments fig 8 the presence of crop residues on the soil surface increased microbial activity which increased co2 emissions from the soil in conservation tillage managements bolinder et al 2007 despite high soil co2 emissions conservation tillage increased soil organic matter at the end of the growing season thus conservation tillage methods increase soil organic carbon which reduces negative environmental effects the lowest co2 emissions were associated with ct treatment 1 858 mg ha year on average fig 8 despite the higher soil temperature without residues the low organic matter content of this soil reduced co2 emissions the researchers discovered an 86 correlation between crop residues and co2 emissions huanga et al 2004 due to the occurrence of temperatures above 30 c in june july and august of both 2016 and 2017 these three months saw the highest co2 emissions additionally the lowest co2 emissions occurred in november the month during which the air and soil temperatures were at their lowest during the cotton growing season in both years according to a study co2 emissions are directly related to soil temperature and as temperature rises ghg emissions increase a portion of the increased co2 emissions during the warmer months of the year could be attributed to root respiration as the plant grew larger during those months almaraz et al 2009 aditionollay as soil temperature rises soil microorganism activity increases carbonell bojollo et al 2011 resulting in increased respiration and co2 emissions during the warmer months the study of co2 emissions from various crops revealed that the amount of co2 emitted by all studied crops increases as the temperature rises the highest co2 emissions 2 7 g of c m2 day were recorded in wheat on may 10 corn 4 3 g of c m2 day and sugar beet 5 2 g of c m2 day on 11 august that these dates coincided with the highest temperature in the vegetative period of the plant alizadeh et al 2017 in this investigation the maximum co2 emissions in all crops were seen in the presence of residues which is consistent with the current experiment s findings another study examined the effect of zero plowing and residue retention on soil co2 emissions and discovered that soils with residues emit less co2 in the early spring due to cooler temperatures duiker and lal 2000 when organic matter is present the highest co2 emissions occur in the spring not at the highest temperature and this is due to the season s increased humidity which is necessary for organic matter decomposition and microorganism activity thelen et al 2010 however other researchers studying co2 emissions from soil found that the highest co2 emissions occur during the summer and under high temperature conditions and that the highest correlation between co2 emissions and temperature exists among the various factors affecting soil respiration la scala et al 2006 co2 emissions are reported to increase following field tillage but this increase subsides after 24 h and returns to pre tillage levels reicosky et al 2005 additionally other studies have found a positive correlation between rising temperatures and increased co2 emissions brar et al 2013 chen et al 2011 west and marland 2002 shimizu et al 2009 these studies reported extremely low soil respiration at low temperatures as a result of low plant root respiration and slow microorganism activity which agrees with the findings of this study 3 3 ch4 emission from soil in 2016 17 by examining the model s simulation results it was discovered that the amount of ch4 emission varied between tillage treatments annual average ch4 emissions were 3 45 4 00 and 4 75 kg ha yr for zt mt and ct respectively fig 9 the presence of residues and the cooler soil temperature in the zt and mt treatments appear to have contributed to the reduction in ch4 emission in these two treatments due to the complete anaerobic nature of ch4 producing bacteria soil moisture conditions have a direct effect on the production and growth of ch4 in the soil in february and march 2016 when we experienced heavy rainfall the rate of increase of methane was faster than in 2017 owing to the persistence of flooding conditions in the soil and increased activity of anaerobic bacteria producing methane fig 9 water management practices on farms have a variety of implications for methane emissions proper irrigation management practices such as reduced flooding and intermittent aeration are recommended to help reduce this ghg s emission roy et al 2009 3 4 soil organic matter at the end of the experiment as a result of the preservation of residues at the soil surface and manipulation of the topsoil tillage methods particularly conservation tillage affect only the organic matter of the topsoil comparing the amount of simulated organic matter at 0 10 cm depth in different soil tillage treatments revealed that the zt treatment produced the most 0 79 and the ct treatment the least 0 56 soil organic matter in the 0 10 cm layer increased by 41 when wheat and cotton were grown without tillage also the nt treatment had more organic matter than the ct treatment but less than the zt treatment at 0 10 cm depth the soil is completely submerged in the ct treatment which accelerates the oxidation of soil organic matter and increases loss climate temperature water and light all impact an ecosystem s carbon content alizadeh et al 2017 the simulation results indicated that preservation residues in conservation tillage results in an annual increase in carbon emissions from the soil under darab climatic conditions fig 3b however because this increase is less than the rate of carbon return to the soil the preservation of residues at the end of this five year experiment led to a positive carbon content of the soil the researchers reported that increasing the amount of residues in the soil increased co2 emissions from the soil but that if crop residues are stored annually in the agroecosystem this results in an increase in the soil s carbon content ciais et al 2010 alluvione et al 2013 this study found that the average amount of simulated organic matter in the soil at 10 20 cm depth was statistically equivalent for each tillage treatment it is obvious that conservation tillage has little effect on organic matter in the top 10 20 cm of soil because it only treats the topsoil conserving tillage methods mt and zt have the greatest impact on increasing organic matter and improving soil structure conversely conventional tillage accelerates soil organic matter oxidation by disrupting the soil releasing nutrients and increasing soil carbon sequestration increased soil temperature appears to be a factor in this waste the use of conservation plows alone increases soil carbon storage by one ton per hectare per year uri 2001 other research has shown that using zero tillage cropping systems increases soil carbon storage globally west and morland 2002 smith et al 2008 leite et al 2004 4 conclusion the dndc model was validated in a wheat cotton crop rotation in darab fars province using measurements of soil temperature and moisture crop growth and yield as well as co2 and ch4 emissions despite the differences in daily simulations validation results demonstrated that the model is capable of accurately simulating the soil environment and gas emissions during the cotton growing season in the field the zt treatment maintained an average soil temperature of 1 3 c lower than other tillage treatments additionally the zt treatment had an average of 1 4 more daily moisture than ct or mt in all measurements the results of this study indicated that conservation tillage methods outperformed conventional tillage in terms of co2 emissions from the soil in the field owing to residue preservation increased soil organic matter in the long run and soil moisture storage all of which can improve soil structure and reduce water consumption the absence of significant differences in cotton yields across tillage treatments in 2016 and 2017 demonstrated that conservation tillage methods can be used in place of conventional tillage in wheat cotton rotations in climates similar to those studied the experimental results indicated that the tillage systems had a significant effect on the emission of carbon containing gasses from the cotton field with the zt treatment significantly reducing this characteristic the preservation of wheat residues in conservation cropping treatments in cotton fields appears to have an effect on the release of ch4 and co2 from the soil resulting in changes in their emission flows by influencing the relationships within the soil soil moisture had a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions and changes in soil moisture altered the co2 and ch4 emissions from the soil by and large this study s findings indicated that conservation farming operations can help mitigate the negative effects of global warming and climate change by preserving soil carbon content credit authorship contribution statement aboalghasem gheisari conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation resources

single objective management is clearly not environmentally sustainable wheat and cotton farming in fars province must evolve from single objective to multi objective to determine optimal soil management practices and their effectiveness in retaining atmospheric carbon and reducing ghg emissions proven simulation models are a cost effective method due to the high cost of direct measurements and high error associated with point measurements this issue is vital for determining agricultural soil carbon content role in ghg production and emission and development of sustainable agriculture this study aimed to determine using the dndc model the effect of various tillage systems on greenhouse gas emissions in a cotton wheat rotation field 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental layout the study was carried out at the hassanabad darab agricultural research station of the fars agricultural and natural resources research center about 230 kms south of shiraz 57 54 e 29 28 n 1107 m a s l the climate in the region is hot and dry with an average annual rainfall of 285 mm the soil texture was loamy and three years prior to the experiment the land had been fallow five consecutive cropping years of experiments were conducted to determine the effects of various tillage methods on ghg emissions in cotton cultivation a randomized complete block design with three treatments in four replications was used to determine the effects of various tillage methods on ghg emissions in cotton cultivation 2013 2017 two composite samples were taken from the field at the experimental site to determine the physical and chemical properties of soil and the desired characteristics were determined according to the soil and water research institute s instructions table 1 the treatments used in the study were as follows v1 zero tillage zt direct drill of wheat and cotton throughout the experiment v2 minimum tillage mt one time compound tillage with a combined tillage machine 15 20 cm followed by sowing wheat and cotton with an automatic cereal planter machine and a semiautomatic planter respectively v3 conventional tillage ct moldboard plow 20 25 cm disk harrow 8 10 cm and followd by sowing wheat and cotton with pneumatic seeders adapted for wheat and semiautomatic planter respectively the wheat cultivar used in this experiment was mehregan which was resistant to yellow brown and black rust the cotton cultivar used was golestan the treatments were distributed across 180 m2 plots 30 m long and 6 m wide wheat crops were sown every five years in the final week of october at a spacing of 0 15 m between rows and 0 02 m within rows wheat crops was harvested using a specialized combine and 30 of wheat residues were distributed in the field under conservation cultivation treatments zt and mt cotton crops were sown in the final week of may at a spacing of 0 70 m between rows and 0 20 m between rows except for the soil tillage system all other agricultural operation for cotton were done according to the instructions of the iranian cotton research institute the experimental field was irrigated with a siphon to maintain a constant water level in all plots irrigation time was assumed to be identical across all study treatments irrigation was used every 14 days throughout the experiment to eliminate the effects of moisture every five years the amount of fertilizer used was determined by a soil test in wheat and cotton fields fertilizer application was similar all superphosphate fertilizer equivalent to 30 kg ha p2o5 and potassium nitrate equivalent to 44 kg ha k2o and one third of urea fertilizer equivalent to 60 kg ha of pure nitrogen at planting time was given to the plots by the sower the remaining urea fertilizer was applied by hand in two stages one after sowing and another after flowering terflan was applied at a rate of 4 l ha to control weeds in the cotton field and manual weeding was performed twice once during the 4 leaf stage with thinning 40 days after planting and once during the pre flowering stage 2 2 measurement 2 2 1 soil moisture the moisture content of samples with known weight and volume was determined the samples used for volumetric measurement were extracted using a specific volume container by placing the sample in an oven at 105 c until its weight is stabilized moisture is extracted from the sample the soil moisture was then calculated by subtracting the weight of the initial soil from the weight of the dried soil the weight percentage of moisture was multiplied by the apparent specific gravity of the soil to convert weight units to volume the percentage of water filled pore space wfps was also calculated using the paul method to determine the amount of soil moisture paul 2007 wfps was determined utilizing eq 1 1 wfps vwc 1 bd pd 100 where vwc is the soil s volumetric water content m3 m3 using eq 2 the bulk density bd at a soil depth of 5 cm was determined and the bulk density pd of 2 65 g cm3 was taken into account 2 b d w d v where bd denotes the bulk density of soil gr cm3 wd denotes the mass of dry soil g and v denotes the total volume of soil cm3 2 2 2 temperature of the soil throughout the experiment the average soil temperature was determined using a maximum minimum tfa rod thermometer model ip 67 germany this measurement was performed daily at 11 am to coincide with the time of gas emission sampling 2 2 3 soil organic matter content at the end of the experiment soil was sampled from two depths of 0 10 and 10 20 cm in each plot to determine the amount of soil organic matter following drying samples were sieved using a 2 mm mesh the percentage of organic carbon in soil samples was determined in the laboratory using the nelson and sommer method nelson and sommer 1982 2 2 4 cotton yield and yield components at the end of the season after removing one meter from the top and bottom of each plot as well as two border lines the crop was harvested from a 10 m2 area in each plot and the cotton yield and average weight of 20 bolls were determined cotton biomass was determined during harvest by cutting the plants from the soil surface and drying them in an oven at 70 c for 48 h 2 2 5 measurement of co2 and ch4 emissions the amount of co2 and ch4 emitted by the soil surface was determined using the closed chamber method melling et al 2005 toma and hatano 2007 the chambers were made of p v c and the length and diameter of the chambers were 50 and 30 cm respectively the edges of which were sunk 3 cm into the soil during sampling daily co2 and ch4 emissions were determined throughout the growing season to minimize the effect of daily temperature variations measurements were made between 9 and 12 a m shimizu et al 2009 these measurements were conducted with a portable pvc flow through non steady state chamber coupled to a portable co2 and ch4 infrared gas analyzer model 535 germany during each measurement the chamber 150 mm internal diameter and 5 50 10 3m3 internal volume was attached to a pvc collar 150 mm internal diameter and 50 mm height that had been inserted 25 mm into the soil to prevent soil disturbance and the resulting undesirable emissions a pump system regulating the chamber s mixing fan circulated air from the chamber to the irga and back at a flow rate of 1 l min 1 over a sampling period a data logger connected to the irga recorded the co2 and ch4 concentrations every second and the efflux was calculated from the concentration increase over time before each flow measurement the chamber was shaken for a few seconds until the co2 concentration reached the ambient level to ensure the device s accuracy it was calibrated using laboratory methods at planting time and three times randomly throughout the growth period at the beginning and two hours after placing the chamber 25 ml of the chamber gas was extracted with a vacuum syringe german brand push vacuum blood collection vial gas samples were collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis the amount of co2 and ch4 was determined in the laboratory using a gas chromatography gc device manufactured by agilent technologies model gc msd usa finally co2 and ch4 emissions per unit area were calculated using eq 3 and matched to the numbers of devices used in the field bingrui and zhou 2009 3 s r δ c δ t ν a where sr is the rate of gas emission mg of co2 h m2 c is the increase in gas concentration mg m3 over time h v is the volume of the air chamber m3 and a is the area of the ground covered by the chamber m2 the relationship between soil temperature and co2 and ch4 emissions was determined using eq 4 shimizu et al 2009 4 f α e x p b t where f denotes gas emissions t denotes soil temperature and a and b denote the equation s coefficients to improve accuracy the soil temperature was measured during the sampling process and the emissions were measured adjacent to the chamber to calculate annual co2 and ch4 emissions based on daily soil temperature measurements throughout the entire year soil gas emissions were calculated using eqs 3 and 4 shimizu et al 2009 the dndc 9 5 model was used to simulate gas emissions in this study c li 2000 describes in detail the structures equations and parameters associated with agricultural management practices in the dndc model the dndc model requires the following input parameters 1 local meteorological data such as maximum daily air temperature c minimum daily air temperature c and daily rainfall mm 2 initial soil physical and chemical characteristics such as soil texture bulk density soil ph wfps in field capacity and wilting point and 3 agricultural management information such as tilling method tilling date irrigation input mode input irrigation date and amount for each irrigation event and amount of water applied daily rainfall data as well as daily maximum and minimum temperatures were obtained from the hassanabad darab meteorological station 2 3 statistical analysis of the results of model simulations the model s predictive ability was evaluated using the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the regression coefficient of real valued error against predicted values the nrmse was calculated using eq 6 rinaldi et al 2003 6 n r m s e 100 i 1 n p i o i 2 n o m e a n where pi and oi denote the predicted and observed values respectively n denotes the number of actual plant component measurements and omean denotes the average of the observed values the nrmse is expressed as a percentage of the relative difference between the predicted and observed values by definition the model s predictive power is considered to be excellent if the nrmse value is less than 10 good if it is between 10 and 20 moderate if it is between 20 and 30 and poor if it is greater than 30 several studies have been conducted on this topic rinaldi et al 2001 miehle et al 2006 in linear regression the correlation coefficient r2 indicates how closely the simulated data matches the observed data the equations were fitted and statistical calculations were performed using excel software 2 4 calibration of the model typically there is a clear relationship between the model s general shape and the physical system under study via the model s parameters this relationship establishes the accuracy of parameter values required for the dndc model to produce a specific fit between the model output and the measured output farahbakhshazad et al 2008 the model was calibrated in this study through trial and error manual method this method incorporates measurable parameters such as soil temperature and moisture as well as the biological and economic performance of cotton into the model while performing preliminary estimates on unknown parameters the model was then implemented and its output compared to that observed in the initial sample the model was calibrated using data from the first three years of research in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation validating crop simulation models is a critical step before using them in simulation studies huang et al 2009 the nrmse and regression coefficient of the measured values against the predicted values model output were used to predict the model s robustness the model s values for soil temperature and humidity aboveground biomass yield and annual co2 emissions were compared to field and laboratory measurements following calibration and verification of performance accuracy the model was used for simulation in 2016 and 2017 3 1 1 validation of soil temperature and humidity from october 2013 to october 2015 fig 1 a depicts the simulated vs observed values of the average daily soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm in three treatments the time pattern and simulated values were consistent with those obtained from field measurements co2 and ch4 emissions from 2016 to 2017 no till treatments are depicted in fig 2 the linear correlation coefficient r2 between the simulated soil s average monthly temperatures and the observed values was 0 98 the slope was 1 07 p 0 01 and the nrmse was 10 18 fig 3 a from october 2013 to october 2015 fig 1b depicts the water filled pore space in all three treatments in most cases the model prediction included temporal variations and the measured amount of water filled pore space at depths of 0 to 5 cm although some values were different between the simulated values and the average monthly observed humidity the linear correlation coefficient r2 was 0 97 the slope was 0 97 p 0 01 and the nrmse was 17 47 fig 3b 3 1 2 validation of plant aerial biomass simulated plant aerial biomass changes for wheat and cotton were consistent with field observations wheat aerial biomass was extremely low during the winter and increased significantly in the spring whereas cotton aerial biomass increased proportionately with plant growth fig 4 this dynamic was successfully simulated by this model linear regression of cotton aerial biomass simulation values vs observed values from 2013 to 2015 reveals an r2 of 0 97 and a slope of 0 92 p 0 01 indicating a high degree of agreement fig 5 a the simulation s nrmse was 12 52 3 1 3 validation of economic yield between 2013 and 2015 fig 5b compares the simulated vs observed yields of cotton in three treatments the first three years of experiement as linear regression demonstrates there is a high degree of agreement between simulations vs observations in economic yield with r2 equal to 0 73 and slope equal to 0 73 p 0 01 the nrmse was 18 51 table 2 three year yield simulations for the studied treatments indicate that the mean yield was 2 81 2 68 and 2 78 mg ha 1 for mt zt and ct treatments respectively fig 6 3 1 4 validation of co2 emissions from soil annual co2 emissions in the field for the three tillage treatments ranged between 1 73 and 2 63 mg ha 1 with an average of 2 138 mg ha 1 according to observed values the simulation values model output for annual co2 emissions from various tillage treatments ranged from 1 80 to 2 83 mg ha 1 with an average of 2 228 mg ha 1 fig 7 r2 was equal to 0 81 with a significant slope p 0 01 of 0 94 for linear regression comparing simulated and observed co2 emissions in different treatments the nrmse for simulating co2 emissions was 17 23 these findings demonstrate that despite a wide variety of farm management practices annual co2 emissions are consistent between simulations vs observations this demonstrates that the model was capable of simulating and estimating the effects of various co2 emission management strategies 3 2 co2 emission from soil in the years 2016 17 because tillage methods had a significant effect on the amount of soil organic carbon it was predictable that they would have a significant effect on the amount of co2 emitted from the soil surface the highest co2 emissions in zt treatment were simulated in 2016 and 2017 at 2 608 and 2 111 mg ha yr respectively both conservation tillage treatments zt and mt produced significantly more co2 than ct treatments fig 8 the presence of crop residues on the soil surface increased microbial activity which increased co2 emissions from the soil in conservation tillage managements bolinder et al 2007 despite high soil co2 emissions conservation tillage increased soil organic matter at the end of the growing season thus conservation tillage methods increase soil organic carbon which reduces negative environmental effects the lowest co2 emissions were associated with ct treatment 1 858 mg ha year on average fig 8 despite the higher soil temperature without residues the low organic matter content of this soil reduced co2 emissions the researchers discovered an 86 correlation between crop residues and co2 emissions huanga et al 2004 due to the occurrence of temperatures above 30 c in june july and august of both 2016 and 2017 these three months saw the highest co2 emissions additionally the lowest co2 emissions occurred in november the month during which the air and soil temperatures were at their lowest during the cotton growing season in both years according to a study co2 emissions are directly related to soil temperature and as temperature rises ghg emissions increase a portion of the increased co2 emissions during the warmer months of the year could be attributed to root respiration as the plant grew larger during those months almaraz et al 2009 aditionollay as soil temperature rises soil microorganism activity increases carbonell bojollo et al 2011 resulting in increased respiration and co2 emissions during the warmer months the study of co2 emissions from various crops revealed that the amount of co2 emitted by all studied crops increases as the temperature rises the highest co2 emissions 2 7 g of c m2 day were recorded in wheat on may 10 corn 4 3 g of c m2 day and sugar beet 5 2 g of c m2 day on 11 august that these dates coincided with the highest temperature in the vegetative period of the plant alizadeh et al 2017 in this investigation the maximum co2 emissions in all crops were seen in the presence of residues which is consistent with the current experiment s findings another study examined the effect of zero plowing and residue retention on soil co2 emissions and discovered that soils with residues emit less co2 in the early spring due to cooler temperatures duiker and lal 2000 when organic matter is present the highest co2 emissions occur in the spring not at the highest temperature and this is due to the season s increased humidity which is necessary for organic matter decomposition and microorganism activity thelen et al 2010 however other researchers studying co2 emissions from soil found that the highest co2 emissions occur during the summer and under high temperature conditions and that the highest correlation between co2 emissions and temperature exists among the various factors affecting soil respiration la scala et al 2006 co2 emissions are reported to increase following field tillage but this increase subsides after 24 h and returns to pre tillage levels reicosky et al 2005 additionally other studies have found a positive correlation between rising temperatures and increased co2 emissions brar et al 2013 chen et al 2011 west and marland 2002 shimizu et al 2009 these studies reported extremely low soil respiration at low temperatures as a result of low plant root respiration and slow microorganism activity which agrees with the findings of this study 3 3 ch4 emission from soil in 2016 17 by examining the model s simulation results it was discovered that the amount of ch4 emission varied between tillage treatments annual average ch4 emissions were 3 45 4 00 and 4 75 kg ha yr for zt mt and ct respectively fig 9 the presence of residues and the cooler soil temperature in the zt and mt treatments appear to have contributed to the reduction in ch4 emission in these two treatments due to the complete anaerobic nature of ch4 producing bacteria soil moisture conditions have a direct effect on the production and growth of ch4 in the soil in february and march 2016 when we experienced heavy rainfall the rate of increase of methane was faster than in 2017 owing to the persistence of flooding conditions in the soil and increased activity of anaerobic bacteria producing methane fig 9 water management practices on farms have a variety of implications for methane emissions proper irrigation management practices such as reduced flooding and intermittent aeration are recommended to help reduce this ghg s emission roy et al 2009 3 4 soil organic matter at the end of the experiment as a result of the preservation of residues at the soil surface and manipulation of the topsoil tillage methods particularly conservation tillage affect only the organic matter of the topsoil comparing the amount of simulated organic matter at 0 10 cm depth in different soil tillage treatments revealed that the zt treatment produced the most 0 79 and the ct treatment the least 0 56 soil organic matter in the 0 10 cm layer increased by 41 when wheat and cotton were grown without tillage also the nt treatment had more organic matter than the ct treatment but less than the zt treatment at 0 10 cm depth the soil is completely submerged in the ct treatment which accelerates the oxidation of soil organic matter and increases loss climate temperature water and light all impact an ecosystem s carbon content alizadeh et al 2017 the simulation results indicated that preservation residues in conservation tillage results in an annual increase in carbon emissions from the soil under darab climatic conditions fig 3b however because this increase is less than the rate of carbon return to the soil the preservation of residues at the end of this five year experiment led to a positive carbon content of the soil the researchers reported that increasing the amount of residues in the soil increased co2 emissions from the soil but that if crop residues are stored annually in the agroecosystem this results in an increase in the soil s carbon content ciais et al 2010 alluvione et al 2013 this study found that the average amount of simulated organic matter in the soil at 10 20 cm depth was statistically equivalent for each tillage treatment it is obvious that conservation tillage has little effect on organic matter in the top 10 20 cm of soil because it only treats the topsoil conserving tillage methods mt and zt have the greatest impact on increasing organic matter and improving soil structure conversely conventional tillage accelerates soil organic matter oxidation by disrupting the soil releasing nutrients and increasing soil carbon sequestration increased soil temperature appears to be a factor in this waste the use of conservation plows alone increases soil carbon storage by one ton per hectare per year uri 2001 other research has shown that using zero tillage cropping systems increases soil carbon storage globally west and morland 2002 smith et al 2008 leite et al 2004 4 conclusion the dndc model was validated in a wheat cotton crop rotation in darab fars province using measurements of soil temperature and moisture crop growth and yield as well as co2 and ch4 emissions despite the differences in daily simulations validation results demonstrated that the model is capable of accurately simulating the soil environment and gas emissions during the cotton growing season in the field the zt treatment maintained an average soil temperature of 1 3 c lower than other tillage treatments additionally the zt treatment had an average of 1 4 more daily moisture than ct or mt in all measurements the results of this study indicated that conservation tillage methods outperformed conventional tillage in terms of co2 emissions from the soil in the field owing to residue preservation increased soil organic matter in the long run and soil moisture storage all of which can improve soil structure and reduce water consumption the absence of significant differences in cotton yields across tillage treatments in 2016 and 2017 demonstrated that conservation tillage methods can be used in place of conventional tillage in wheat cotton rotations in climates similar to those studied the experimental results indicated that the tillage systems had a significant effect on the emission of carbon containing gasses from the cotton field with the zt treatment significantly reducing this characteristic the preservation of wheat residues in conservation cropping treatments in cotton fields appears to have an effect on the release of ch4 and co2 from the soil resulting in changes in their emission flows by influencing the relationships within the soil soil moisture had a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions and changes in soil moisture altered the co2 and ch4 emissions from the soil by and large this study s findings indicated that conservation farming operations can help mitigate the negative effects of global warming and climate change by preserving soil carbon content credit authorship contribution statement aboalghasem gheisari conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation resources

24196,animals are known to use information such as spatial memory in order to search for or relocate their goals some animals show self avoiding walks to present straight movements interesting animals alter their migratory and diffusive behaviors in response to their own experiences or independently in a similar environment to tackle this problem by focusing on the decision making of the random walker we developed an artificial agent based model in which the agent considers the time series of its memorized locations in our proposed model the agent sometimes regards part of its memorized cells as past information and changes its directional rule in order to not to revisit those locations experimental results demonstrated that the agent succeeded in producing both super diffusive walks and sub diffusive walks importantly these various characteristic movements emerge without any adjustments of parameters keywords movement pattern memory diffusion random walk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to study the issues with optimum foraging theoretical and empirical research has been conducted charnov 1976 hengeveld et al 2009 jha and kremen 2013 there are various movement strategies that exhibit diffusive characteristics bartumeus et al 2005 animals with very diffuse movements are capable of extensive searching on the other hand normal or sub diffusive movements may significantly aid in the local area search since returning to a location offers animals the chance to completely investigate the region surrounding that position moorcroft et al 1999 moorcroft and lewis 2006 börger et al 2008 in fact animals seem to produce various types of movement and change their diffusive properties based on the environmental conditions sims et al 2012 lópez lópez et al 2013 humphries et al 2016 numerous random walk models have been created to address this aspect of foraging animals and these models simulate foragers changing their movement patterns in response to resource items they come across benhamou 2014 benhamou and collet 2015 fagan 2017 however several research using insects have shown that animals alter their migratory and diffusive behaviors in response to their own experiences or even independently in a similar environment petrovskii et al 2011 sakiyama et al 2021 small models have been created to provide a variety of movements for walkers in a same environment in contrast to environment dependent models to this end developing models for producing various types of walkers movements in a similar environment is an important issue one way to tackle this problem is by parameter tuning of the algorithm followed by walkers viswanathan et al 2008 bartumeus et al 2014 using simulation experiments an experimenter can identify optimal parameter values to produce a certain movement pattern however this provision does not apply to the decision making processes of walkers since they cannot consider entire trajectories especially when they do not have highly developed cognitive abilities which inhibits them from modifying their actions and getting closer to ideal conditions sakiyama and gunji 2013 2016 2018 in fact certain organisms such as insects lack higher order cognitive capacities and map like navigation ability instead they are known to remember certain positions in order to return to previously visited sites or to accomplish exploration by avoiding memorized locations hurly and healy 1996 wehner and müller 2010 baddeley et al 2012 cheng 2012 collett et al 2014 as a result we created an agent based model for walkers that recall visited locations and utilize their memory to guide their exploration the actual trajectories of walkers do not always match the subjective estimation of walkers of their own trajectories sakiyama and gunji 2013 2016 2018 walkers might return to a certain position even when attempting to produce a straight movement such an inconsistency may give walkers the opportunity to demonstrate various types of movements since walkers sometimes produce their trajectories as expected and sometimes not in this study we investigate the movement dynamics of a single walker which trying to achieve a wide area search by avoiding places that it had completed searching the walker remembers some cells that it recently visited based on the distribution of those memorized cells the walker calculates the direction of places it has finished searching the agent in our model scans surrounding cells and calculates the direction from which it has come then the agent compares that direction with that of the entire distribution of memorized cells the agent refers to the time continuity of its recent trajectories based on the inconsistency between these two types of information it sometimes considers that some memorized cells are not recent memories but memories obtained a long time ago based on these comparisons the agent alters its directional rule 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and methods model description the models were coded in the c programming language the model description follows the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 and 2020 here we allowed the agent to memorize recent visited cells 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of the model was to examine how different types of movements emerged without any adjustments of parameters in our model we included the walker s memory based rule modification and assessed whether or not this process led to the creation of different types of movements while the walker always began its investigation in the same situation we examined three patterns for system performance trajectory diffusion and movement entropy analysis the diffusive and entropy analyses performed on trajectory data might be beneficial for categorizing movement 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the proposed model included two types of entities an agent and cells during a time step the agent reaches one nearby cell the agent has a state variable defined as memory the value represents a set of memorized cells whose maximum size is n representing the agent s memory capacity the agent also has the state variables defined as navigational state brownian biased recent direction d r t 0 r i g h t l e f t u p p e r l o w e r and direction memory d m 0 r i g h t l e f t u p p e r l o w e r a cell has the state variable memorized this value represents whether the agent memorizes that cell we assumed that an artificial agent moves in a two dimensional discrete lattice of 5000 5000 grid squares periodic boundary conditions are utilized to enable the walker to travel freely without constraint the simulation time duration was set to 10 000 time steps please also see table 1 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the agent updates its position by selecting a cell among the nearest cells every time see sub model entitled position updating the agent can recall recent visited cells by stacking the current cell into its memory see sub model entitled memory stacking at each time step if some of the adjacent cells are loaded into its memory the agent checks them and estimates the direction in which it has most recently remained see sub model entitled local pattern scanning fig 1 in addition to the local pattern scanning the agent calculates the distribution of memorized cells at every time step see sub model entitled memory scanning based on these two sub models the replacement of a default rule with a new one follows see sub model entitled rule change when an agent follows a nondefault rule it will sometimes revert to the default rule see sub model entitled rule resetting 2 1 4 design concepts this model addresses the issue of creating different types of movements in a similar environment and focuses on the memory use of a single walker with limited cognitive ability since some organisms seem to use the spatial memory for their navigation hurly and healy 1996 wehner and müller 2010 the movement patterns diffusive properties are the emergent properties of the model sensing is used for sub models entitled local pattern scanning and memory scanning learning is used when the agent remembers positions of visited cell stochasticity is also important to determine in which direction the agent moved 2 1 5 initialization the agent is located at x y 0 0 at the center of the simulation field at the beginning of each trial at the beginning of each trial the agent selects one cell from these four cells with an equal probability navigational state brownian since the agent with no spatial memory is uncommitted to any particular direction also direction memory d m is set to 0 at the beginning of each trial 2 2 sub models 2 2 1 memory stacking at each time step the agent stacks the current cell into its memory by doing so the agent can recall recent visited cells a variable memory represents a set of stacked cells the set memory is an empty cell at the start of each trial before exiting the current cell the current cell is stacked into the set memory on each time step when the set s size reaches the maximum n the oldest memorized cell is removed from its memory since the current cell is added to its memory as the latest memorized cell here the default value of the parameter n is shown in table 1 2 2 2 local pattern scanning at each time step the agent located at coordinates x y scans the nearest four cells x 1 y x 1 y x y 1 and x y 1 by doing so the agent attempts to estimate the way it has recently stayed we named this term the recent direction d r t the recent direction can be right left upper and lower only if three cells among the nearest four cells are memorized cells sakiyama 2022 for example the agent located at coordinates x y calculates that the recent direction is located in the right direction if all three cells x 1 y x y 1 and x y 1 are memorized cells fig 1 in this case the parameter d r t is replaced with right if another parameter d m is 0 at that time that parameter is also replaced with d r t the latter parameter is initially set to 0 at the beginning of each trial the above scenario is described as follows initially d r t 0 then d r t r i g h t i f x 1 y x y 1 x y 1 are memorized cells d r t l e f t i f x 1 y x y 1 x y 1 are memorized cells d r t u p p e r i f x 1 y x 1 y x y 1 are memorized cells d r t l o w e r i f x 1 y x 1 y x y 1 are memorized cells furthermore if d m is 0 then d m d r t 2 2 3 memory scanning in addition to local pattern scanning the distribution of all memorized cells is also used for the rule change to this end the agent calculates the distribution of memorized cells as follows when d r t 0 regardless of its n a v i g a t i o n a l s t a t e initially c r i g h t t 0 c l e f t t 0 c u p p e r t 0 c l o w e r t 0 c r i g h t t c r i g h t t 1 i f x x 0 c l e f t t c l e f t t 1 i f x x 0 c u p p e r t c u p p e r t 1 i f y y 0 c l o w e r t c l o w e r t 1 i f y y 0 here x y presents

memory the agent appears to be moving in the direction dm with p d m the probability p d m can be increased as c d m t is decreased this is because the agent believes it has not yet thoroughly examined the dm direction if c d m t is quite small the agent moves in the direction dm with a high probability and tends to move away from the current area which may result in super diffusive movements on the other hand if c d m t is not so small the agent moves in the direction dm with a certain probability which is not a high probability in this case a rule reset is likely to occur afterwards since the agent does not produce ballistic motions then the agent is likely to coordinate the directional rule with a new c d m t which is not so small as these events repeat the agent may move back and forth within a certain area which resulting in sub diffusive movements 2 2 5 rule resetting the agent returns its directional rule to the default rule brownian as follows whenever n a v i g a t i o n a l s t a t e b i a s e d and d r t 0 if d r t r i g h t and c r i g h t t c l e f t t a n d c r i g h t t c u p p e r t a n d c r i g h t t c l o w e r t then p r i g h t 0 p l e f t 0

agent returns to the default rule brownian when the directional matches between the two types of information the local pattern and the entire distribution of memorized cells are relatively high this is because the agent tends to produce ballistic movements when the two types of information is small whenever it replaces the default rule brownian with a new rule see the sub model rule change 2 2 6

since d m is reset to 0 if n a v i g a t i o n a l s t a t e is reset to brownian in step 3 please see fig 2 for an illustration of time flow for the proposed model 3 results first we checked the diffusion property of our proposed model in random walk analysis the relationship between the mean squared distance msd r 2 and time step t can be represented as follows viswanathan et al 2008 r 2 t 2 h here the slope value h determines the diffusiveness of the agent walk h 0 5 for super diffusive movements h 0 5 for normal diffusive movements h 0 5 for sub diffusive movements as shown in fig 3 the agent in the proposed model exhibited super diffusive movements h 0 85 r squared 0 98 however the standard deviation of msd seemed to depend on the number of time steps figure s1 the standard deviation of msd was larger for bigger times which was expected for distributions with infinite variance in fact the movement properties varied in each trial in some trials the agent tended not to produce straight movements fig 4 a while the agent sometimes maintained a biased movement for a long time fig 4b at other times the agent tended to produce both area restricted searching and biased movements at different intervals fig 4c in fact individuals in the above three cases presented different diffusive properties figure s2 therefore our model produced different types of trajectories even though individual walkers started their movements under the same initial conditions next we categorized the individual movements trials of three movement groups according to the diffusive properties average distance and the last distance value here the distance means r that is used for the calculation of the mean squared distance r 2 if both the average distance over one trial and the last distance value of that trial were smaller than 500 0 then that trial was categorized into the attract group however if both the average distance over one trial and the last distance of that trial were bigger than 1000 0 then that trial was categorized into the avoid group if neither of these conditions applied that trial was categorized into the middle group for example the individual trials shown in fig 4 are categorized into the attract fig 4a the avoid fig 4b and the middle fig 4c respectively fig 5 presents the number of trials categorized into each group obtained from 100 trials the middle group is dominant while the agent sometimes produces sub diffusive movements and occasionally presents super diffusive movements over a long period to verify the effectiveness of this categorization the shannon entropy calculation was applied to trajectories shannon 1948 shannon and weaver 1949 given a random variable x with possible outcomes x 1 x 2 x n the entropy is defined as h x n i 1 p x i l o g 2 p x i where p x i represents the occurrence probability for x i here the agent selects one direction from four directions therefore possible outcomes can be x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 each p x i was calculated every 100 time steps by counting how many times the agent produced each directional movement out of 100 time steps fig 6 presents the average entropy h for each categorized group obtained from 100 trials we found that the entropy h in the attract group was higher than those in the other two groups attract vs middle 1 61 0 071 vs 1 45 0 14 mann whitney u test p 0 001 attract vs avoid 1 61 0 071 vs 1 31 0 10 mann whitney u test p 0 001 furthermore the entropy h in the middle group was higher than that in the avoid group middle vs avoid mann whitney u test p 0 001 these results suggest that the agent in the avoid group tends to produce ballistic movements resulting in producing low h values in fact we found that the average h tended to be lower as the last distance value increased figure s3 which confirmed that the entropy h was related to the diffusiveness these groupings are arbitrarily defined therefore we changed the thresholds regarding the group category from 500 0 1000 0 with 300 0 800 0 and 700 0 1200 0 figure s4 shows the fraction of trials categorized into each group and the average entropy h for each categorized group obtained from 100 trials although the fraction of trials categorized into each group could be affected by the thresholds tendencies of entropy h between these three groups were same as those in the default thresholds 300 0 800 0 attract vs middle 1 65 0 035 vs 1 49 0 13 mann whitney u test p 0 001 attract vs avoid 1 65 0 035 vs 1 32 0 12 mann whitney u test p 0 001 middle vs avoid mann whitney u test p 0 001 700 0 1200 0 attract vs middle 1 59 0 081 vs 1 42 0 13 mann whitney u test p 0 001 attract vs avoid 1 59 0 081 vs 1 32 0 11 mann whitney u test p 0 001 middle vs avoid mann whitney u test p 0 01 finally the effects of the number of trials were investigated here we replaced the number of trials from 100 with 200 trials according to figure s5 the agent in the proposed model exhibited super diffusive movements and showed the similar slope value h with the h value obtained from 100 trials h 0 89 r squared 0 98 moreover the fraction of the number of trials categorized into each group appeared to be similar with that obtained from 100trials figure s6a here the thresholds were set to 500 0 1000 0 the average entropy h for individual groups was also similar with that obtained from 100 trials figure s6b attract vs middle 1 61 0 064 vs 1 44 0 14 mann whitney u test p 0 001 attract vs avoid 1 61 0 064 vs 1 29 0 14 mann whitney u test p 0 001 middle vs avoid mann whitney u test p 0 001 these results suggest that conducting simulations with 100 trials is sufficient to verify some features of the model we conducted some additional studies the relationship between the diffusive analysis and the categorization of movement groups we also studied a random process the death process in which the walker dies randomly throughout a trial the supplementary file contains more information about those additional studies 4 discussion in our model the agent scans the cells around it and calculates the direction from which it has stayed recently then the agent compares the directional matching between the calculated direction and the entire distribution of memorized cells based on this consistency the agent refers to the time series of its recent trajectories and modifies its directional rule as a result our findings reveal that the agent produces both super diffusive and sub diffusive movements if the directional agreement between the two types of information the local distribution of memorized cells and the entire distribution of memorized cells is high the agent considers that the three cells used for the recent direction are included in the continuous trajectory composed of the other memorized cells however if the directional agreement between the two types of information is low the agent considers that the three cells used for the recent direction are not included in the continuous trajectory composed of the other memorized cells rather this case emphasizes the time discontinuity for the agent in the latter case therefore the agent tends to move in the recent direction by changing its directional rule because it estimates that it once moved in the direction where the other memorized cells were distributed and has already finished searching those areas in most simulation models of animal movements parameter tuning seems to be essential to produce different types of movements bartumeus et al 2005 viswanathan et al 2008 ferreira et al 2012 bartumeus et al 2014 however this method may not be biologically plausible since animals cannot select an optimal parameter value to adapt themselves to the circumstances in this study we adopted a completely different approach to this issue the agent in our model refers to the temporal continuity of its memory and sometimes subjectively regards memorized cells as not part of its sequential trajectory using this estimation the agent modifies the weighed function of its directional rule individual walkers make decisions in different manners even though they are in similar circumstances which may result in different types of movements cressoni et al 2007 has reported that the hurst exponent depended on the fraction of the time remembered by non markovian random walkers and showed that non markovian random walkers with significant memory loss exhibited the persistent walk cressoni et al 2007 similarly the agent in our model also presents different types of movements which is related to the different hurst exponent at the same time however the previous study appears to focus on the loss of memory of the recent rather than of the distant past on the contrary the agent in our model can memorize recent visited cells by stacking the past n cells into its memory several empirical research have shown differences in individual movement patterns lópez lópez et al 2013 sakiyama et al 2021 van de kerk et al 2021 environmental factors like resource availability or seasons may affect animal migration lópez lópez et al 2013 van de kerk et al 2021 internal signals such as spatial memory seem to explain movement variation patterns as well sakiyama et al 2021 insects such like ants use spatial memory for their navigations even though they do not have high cognitive spatial abilities cheng 2012 zeil 2012 collett et al 2014 because the agent in our model has limited memory capacity our model can explain the various forms of movements for such organisms at first sight the sub diffusive movements in our model appear to be odd since a walker tends to move in a certain direction using the weighted function of its rule this observation suggests that the objective results may be different from the aim of a walker sakiyama and gunji 2013 sakiyama 2017 sakiyama 2020 tuning of parameter by experimenters cannot reproduce these situations in which the outcome is somewhat different from that intended by the agent 5 conclusions 1 in our model the agent uses its spatial memory and scans the cells around it to calculate the direction from which it has stayed recently 2 the agent compares the directional matching between the calculated direction and the entire distribution of memorized cells based on this consistency the agent sometimes modifies its directional rule

24196,animals are known to use information such as spatial memory in order to search for or relocate their goals some animals show self avoiding walks to present straight movements interesting animals alter their migratory and diffusive behaviors in response to their own experiences or independently in a similar environment to tackle this problem by focusing on the decision making of the random walker we developed an artificial agent based model in which the agent considers the time series of its memorized locations in our proposed model the agent sometimes regards part of its memorized cells as past information and changes its directional rule in order to not to revisit those locations experimental results demonstrated that the agent succeeded in producing both super diffusive walks and sub diffusive walks importantly these various characteristic movements emerge without any adjustments of parameters keywords movement pattern memory diffusion random walk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to study the issues with optimum foraging theoretical and empirical research has been conducted charnov 1976 hengeveld et al 2009 jha and kremen 2013 there are various movement strategies that exhibit diffusive characteristics bartumeus et al 2005 animals with very diffuse movements are capable of extensive searching on the other hand normal or sub diffusive movements may significantly aid in the local area search since returning to a location offers animals the chance to completely investigate the region surrounding that position moorcroft et al 1999 moorcroft and lewis 2006 börger et al 2008 in fact animals seem to produce various types of movement and change their diffusive properties based on the environmental conditions sims et al 2012 lópez lópez et al 2013 humphries et al 2016 numerous random walk models have been created to address this aspect of foraging animals and these models simulate foragers changing their movement patterns in response to resource items they come across benhamou 2014 benhamou and collet 2015 fagan 2017 however several research using insects have shown that animals alter their migratory and diffusive behaviors in response to their own experiences or even independently in a similar environment petrovskii et al 2011 sakiyama et al 2021 small models have been created to provide a variety of movements for walkers in a same environment in contrast to environment dependent models to this end developing models for producing various types of walkers movements in a similar environment is an important issue one way to tackle this problem is by parameter tuning of the algorithm followed by walkers viswanathan et al 2008 bartumeus et al 2014 using simulation experiments an experimenter can identify optimal parameter values to produce a certain movement pattern however this provision does not apply to the decision making processes of walkers since they cannot consider entire trajectories especially when they do not have highly developed cognitive abilities which inhibits them from modifying their actions and getting closer to ideal conditions sakiyama and gunji 2013 2016 2018 in fact certain organisms such as insects lack higher order cognitive capacities and map like navigation ability instead they are known to remember certain positions in order to return to previously visited sites or to accomplish exploration by avoiding memorized locations hurly and healy 1996 wehner and müller 2010 baddeley et al 2012 cheng 2012 collett et al 2014 as a result we created an agent based model for walkers that recall visited locations and utilize their memory to guide their exploration the actual trajectories of walkers do not always match the subjective estimation of walkers of their own trajectories sakiyama and gunji 2013 2016 2018 walkers might return to a certain position even when attempting to produce a straight movement such an inconsistency may give walkers the opportunity to demonstrate various types of movements since walkers sometimes produce their trajectories as expected and sometimes not in this study we investigate the movement dynamics of a single walker which trying to achieve a wide area search by avoiding places that it had completed searching the walker remembers some cells that it recently visited based on the distribution of those memorized cells the walker calculates the direction of places it has finished searching the agent in our model scans surrounding cells and calculates the direction from which it has come then the agent compares that direction with that of the entire distribution of memorized cells the agent refers to the time continuity of its recent trajectories based on the inconsistency between these two types of information it sometimes considers that some memorized cells are not recent memories but memories obtained a long time ago based on these comparisons the agent alters its directional rule 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and methods model description the models were coded in the c programming language the model description follows the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 and 2020 here we allowed the agent to memorize recent visited cells 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of the model was to examine how different types of movements emerged without any adjustments of parameters in our model we included the walker s memory based rule modification and assessed whether or not this process led to the creation of different types of movements while the walker always began its investigation in the same situation we examined three patterns for system performance trajectory diffusion and movement entropy analysis the diffusive and entropy analyses performed on trajectory data might be beneficial for categorizing movement 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the proposed model included two types of entities an agent and cells during a time step the agent reaches one nearby cell the agent has a state variable defined as memory the value represents a set of memorized cells whose maximum size is n representing the agent s memory capacity the agent also has the state variables defined as navigational state brownian biased recent direction d r t 0 r i g h t l e f t u p p e r l o w e r and direction memory d m 0 r i g h t l e f t u p p e r l o w e r a cell has the state variable memorized this value represents whether the agent memorizes that cell we assumed that an artificial agent moves in a two dimensional discrete lattice of 5000 5000 grid squares periodic boundary conditions are utilized to enable the walker to travel freely without constraint the simulation time duration was set to 10 000 time steps please also see table 1 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the agent updates its position by selecting a cell among the nearest cells every time see sub model entitled position updating the agent can recall recent visited cells by stacking the current cell into its memory see sub model entitled memory stacking at each time step if some of the adjacent cells are loaded into its memory the agent checks them and estimates the direction in which it has most recently remained see sub model entitled local pattern scanning fig 1 in addition to the local pattern scanning the agent calculates the distribution of memorized cells at every time step see sub model entitled memory scanning based on these two sub models the replacement of a default rule with a new one follows see sub model entitled rule change when an agent follows a nondefault rule it will sometimes revert to the default rule see sub model entitled rule resetting 2 1 4 design concepts this model addresses the issue of creating different types of movements in a similar environment and focuses on the memory use of a single walker with limited cognitive ability since some organisms seem to use the spatial memory for their navigation hurly and healy 1996 wehner and müller 2010 the movement patterns diffusive properties are the emergent properties of the model sensing is used for sub models entitled local pattern scanning and memory scanning learning is used when the agent remembers positions of visited cell stochasticity is also important to determine in which direction the agent moved 2 1 5 initialization the agent is located at x y 0 0 at the center of the simulation field at the beginning of each trial at the beginning of each trial the agent selects one cell from these four cells with an equal probability navigational state brownian since the agent with no spatial memory is uncommitted to any particular direction also direction memory d m is set to 0 at the beginning of each trial 2 2 sub models 2 2 1 memory stacking at each time step the agent stacks the current cell into its memory by doing so the agent can recall recent visited cells a variable memory represents a set of stacked cells the set memory is an empty cell at the start of each trial before exiting the current cell the current cell is stacked into the set memory on each time step when the set s size reaches the maximum n the oldest memorized cell is removed from its memory since the current cell is added to its memory as the latest memorized cell here the default value of the parameter n is shown in table 1 2 2 2 local pattern scanning at each time step the agent located at coordinates x y scans the nearest four cells x 1 y x 1 y x y 1 and x y 1 by doing so the agent attempts to estimate the way it has recently stayed we named this term the recent direction d r t the recent direction can be right left upper and lower only if three cells among the nearest four cells are memorized cells sakiyama 2022 for example the agent located at coordinates x y calculates that the recent direction is located in the right direction if all three cells x 1 y x y 1 and x y 1 are memorized cells fig 1 in this case the parameter d r t is replaced with right if another parameter d m is 0 at that time that parameter is also replaced with d r t the latter parameter is initially set to 0 at the beginning of each trial the above scenario is described as follows initially d r t 0 then d r t r i g h t i f x 1 y x y 1 x y 1 are memorized cells d r t l e f t i f x 1 y x y 1 x y 1 are memorized cells d r t u p p e r i f x 1 y x 1 y x y 1 are memorized cells d r t l o w e r i f x 1 y x 1 y x y 1 are memorized cells furthermore if d m is 0 then d m d r t 2 2 3 memory scanning in addition to local pattern scanning the distribution of all memorized cells is also used for the rule change to this end the agent calculates the distribution of memorized cells as follows when d r t 0 regardless of its n a v i g a t i o n a l s t a t e initially c r i g h t t 0 c l e f t t 0 c u p p e r t 0 c l o w e r t 0 c r i g h t t c r i g h t t 1 i f x x 0 c l e f t t c l e f t t 1 i f x x 0 c u p p e r t c u p p e r t 1 i f y y 0 c l o w e r t c l o w e r t 1 i f y y 0 here x y presents the position of a memorized cell the four c variables represent the number of memorized cells in any direction 2 2 4 rule change the agent compares d r t with the entire distribution of memorized cells and modifies one of four directional rules p r i g h t p l e f t p u p p e r and p l o w e r as follows if d m 0 and n a v i g a t i o n a l s t a t e b r o w n i a n then n a v i g a t i o n a

threshold is set to 0 80 the parameter rn is a uniformly distributed random number satisfying r n 0 0 1 0 p r i g h t p l e f t p u p p e r and p l o w e r which determine the stochastic tendency for the agent to move in a certain direction are initially set to 0 on each trial navigational state biased indicates that the agent attempts to go in a certain direction dm depending on its spatial memory the agent appears to be moving in the direction dm with p d m the probability p d m can be increased as c d m t is decreased this is because the agent believes it has not yet thoroughly examined the dm direction if c d m t is quite small the agent moves in the direction dm with a high probability and tends to move away from the current area which may result in super diffusive movements on the other hand if c d m t is not so small the agent moves in the direction dm with a certain probability which is not a high probability in this case a rule reset is likely to occur afterwards since the agent does not produce ballistic motions then the agent is likely to coordinate the directional rule with a new c d m t which is not so small as these events repeat the agent may move back and forth within a certain area which resulting in sub diffusive movements 2 2 5 rule resetting the agent returns its directional rule to the default rule brownian as follows whenever n a v i g a t i o n a l s t a t e b i a s e d and d r t 0 if d r t r i g h t and c r i g h t t c l e f t t a n d c r i g h t t c u p p e r t a n d c r i g h t t c l o w e r t then p r i g h t 0 p l e f t 0 p u p p e r 0 p l o w e r 0 d m 0 n a v i g a t i o n a l s t a t e b r o w n i a n else if d r t l e f t and c l e f t t c r i g h t t a n d c l e f t t c u p p e r t a n d c l e f t t c l o w e r t then p r i g h t 0 p l e f t 0 p u p p e r 0 p l o w e r 0 d m 0 n a v i g a t i o n a l s t a t e b r o w n i a n else if d r t u p p e r and c u p p e r t c l e f t t a n d c u p p e r t c r i g h t

agent returns to the default rule brownian when the directional matches between the two types of information the local pattern and the entire distribution of memorized cells are relatively high this is because the agent tends to produce ballistic movements when the two types of information is small whenever it replaces the default rule brownian with a new rule see the sub model rule change 2 2 6

since d m is reset to 0 if n a v i g a t i o n a l s t a t e is reset to brownian in step 3 please see fig 2 for an illustration of time flow for the proposed model 3 results first we checked the diffusion property of our proposed model in random walk analysis the relationship between the mean squared distance msd r 2 and time step t can be represented as follows viswanathan et al 2008 r 2 t 2

deviation of msd was larger for bigger times which was expected for distributions with infinite variance in fact the movement properties varied in each trial in some trials the agent tended not to produce straight movements fig 4 a while the agent sometimes maintained a biased movement for a long time fig 4b at other times the agent tended to produce both area restricted searching and biased movements at different intervals fig 4c in fact individuals in the above three cases presented different diffusive properties figure s2 therefore our model produced different types of trajectories even though individual walkers started their movements under the same initial conditions next we categorized the individual movements trials of three movement groups according to the diffusive properties average distance and the last distance value here the distance means r that is used for the calculation of the mean squared distance r 2 if both the average distance over one trial and the last distance value of that trial were smaller than 500 0 then that trial was categorized into the attract group however if both the average distance over one trial and the last distance of that trial were bigger than 1000 0 then that trial was categorized into the avoid group if neither of these conditions applied that trial was categorized into the middle group for example the individual trials shown in fig 4 are categorized into the attract fig 4a the avoid fig 4b and the middle fig 4c respectively fig 5 presents the number of trials categorized into each group obtained from 100 trials the middle group is dominant while the agent sometimes produces sub diffusive movements and occasionally presents super diffusive movements over a long period to verify the effectiveness of this categorization the shannon entropy calculation was applied to trajectories shannon 1948 shannon and weaver 1949 given a random variable x with possible outcomes x 1 x 2 x n the entropy is defined as h x n i 1 p x i l o g 2 p x i where p x i represents the occurrence probability for x i here the agent selects one direction from four directions therefore possible outcomes can be x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 each p x i was calculated every 100 time steps by counting how many times the agent produced each directional movement out of 100 time steps fig 6 presents the average entropy h for each categorized group obtained from 100 trials we found that the entropy h in the attract group was higher than those in the other two groups attract vs middle 1 61 0 071 vs 1 45 0 14 mann whitney u test p 0 001 attract vs avoid 1 61 0 071 vs 1 31 0 10 mann whitney u test p 0 001 furthermore the entropy h in the middle group was higher than that in the avoid group middle vs avoid mann whitney u test p 0 001 these results suggest that the agent in the avoid group tends to produce ballistic movements resulting in producing low h values in fact we found that the average h tended to be lower as the last distance value increased figure s3 which confirmed that the entropy h was related to the diffusiveness these groupings are arbitrarily defined therefore we changed the thresholds regarding the group category from 500 0 1000 0 with 300 0 800 0 and 700 0 1200 0 figure s4 shows the fraction of trials categorized into each group and the average entropy h for each categorized group obtained from 100 trials although the fraction of trials categorized into each group could be affected by the thresholds tendencies of entropy h between these three groups were same as those in the default thresholds 300 0 800 0 attract vs middle 1 65 0 035 vs 1 49 0 13 mann whitney u test p 0 001 attract vs avoid 1 65 0 035 vs 1 32 0 12 mann whitney u test p 0 001 middle vs avoid mann whitney u test p 0 001 700 0 1200 0 attract vs middle 1 59 0 081 vs 1 42 0 13 mann whitney u test p 0 001 attract vs avoid 1 59 0 081 vs 1 32 0 11 mann whitney u test p 0 001 middle vs avoid mann whitney u test p 0 01 finally the effects of the number of trials were investigated here we replaced the number of trials from 100 with 200 trials according to figure s5 the agent in the proposed model exhibited super diffusive movements and showed the similar slope value h with the h value obtained from 100 trials h 0 89 r squared 0 98 moreover the fraction of the number of trials categorized into each group appeared to be similar with that obtained from 100trials figure s6a here the thresholds were set to 500 0 1000 0 the average entropy h for individual groups was also similar with that obtained from 100 trials figure s6b attract vs middle 1 61 0 064 vs 1 44 0 14 mann whitney u test p 0 001 attract vs avoid 1 61 0 064 vs 1 29 0 14 mann whitney u test p 0 001 middle vs avoid mann whitney u test p 0 001 these results suggest that conducting simulations with 100 trials is sufficient to verify some features of the model we conducted some additional studies the relationship between the diffusive analysis and the categorization of movement groups we also studied a random process the death process in which the walker dies randomly throughout a trial the supplementary file contains more information about those additional studies 4 discussion in our model the agent scans the cells around it and calculates the direction from which it has stayed recently then the agent compares the directional matching between the calculated direction and the entire distribution of memorized cells based on this consistency the agent refers to the time series of its recent trajectories and modifies its directional rule as a result our findings reveal that the agent produces both super diffusive and sub diffusive movements if the directional agreement between the two types of information the local distribution of memorized cells and the entire distribution of memorized cells is high the agent considers that the three cells used for the recent direction are included in the continuous trajectory composed of the other memorized cells however if the directional agreement between the two types of information is low the agent considers that the three cells used for the recent direction are not included in the continuous trajectory composed of the other memorized cells rather this case emphasizes the time discontinuity for the agent in the latter case therefore the agent tends to move in the recent direction by changing its directional rule because it estimates that it once moved in the direction where the other memorized cells were distributed and has already finished searching those areas in most simulation models of animal movements parameter tuning seems to be essential to produce different types of movements bartumeus et al 2005 viswanathan et al 2008 ferreira et al 2012 bartumeus et al 2014 however this method may not be biologically plausible since animals cannot select an optimal parameter value to adapt themselves to the circumstances in this study we adopted a completely different approach to this issue the agent in our model refers to the temporal continuity of its memory and sometimes subjectively regards memorized cells as not part of its sequential trajectory using this estimation the agent modifies the weighed function of its directional rule individual walkers make decisions in different manners even though they are in similar circumstances which may result in different types of movements cressoni et al 2007 has reported that the hurst exponent depended on the fraction of the time remembered by non markovian random walkers and showed that non markovian random walkers with significant memory loss exhibited the persistent walk cressoni et al 2007 similarly the agent in our model also presents different types of movements which is related to the different hurst exponent at the same time however the previous study appears to focus on the loss of memory of the recent rather than of the distant past on the contrary the agent in our model can memorize recent visited cells by stacking the past n cells into its memory several empirical research have shown differences in individual movement patterns lópez lópez et al 2013 sakiyama et al 2021 van de kerk et al 2021 environmental factors like resource availability or seasons may affect animal migration lópez lópez et al 2013 van de kerk et al 2021 internal signals such as spatial memory seem to explain movement variation patterns as well sakiyama et al 2021 insects such like ants use spatial memory for their navigations even though they do not have high cognitive spatial abilities cheng 2012 zeil 2012 collett et al 2014 because the agent in our model has limited memory capacity our model can explain the various forms of movements for such organisms at first sight the sub diffusive movements in our model appear to be odd since a walker tends to move in a certain direction using the weighted function of its rule this observation suggests that the objective results may be different from the aim of a walker sakiyama and gunji 2013 sakiyama 2017 sakiyama 2020 tuning of parameter by experimenters cannot reproduce these situations in which the outcome is somewhat different from that intended by the agent 5 conclusions 1 in our model the agent uses its spatial memory and scans the cells around it to calculate the direction from which it has stayed recently 2 the agent compares the directional matching between the calculated direction and the entire distribution of memorized cells based on this consistency the agent sometimes modifies its directional rule

24197,the advanced development of industrial structure is the inevitable way to alleviate a regional water quality crisis however the adaptability between water pollution and advanced industrial structure ais remains unrevealed analyzing the adaptability between the two can provide important enlightenment for regional differentiated policy making taking jiangsu province as a case study this study firstly assessed the status of water pollution during the years 2013 2019 through quantitatively analyzing the grey water footprint gwf and grey water footprint intensity gwfi secondly the level of ais was measured to identify the characteristics and evolution of the industrial structure finally the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficient was introduced to reflect the adaptability between gwf and ais and between gwfi and ais the main results showed that 1 from 2013 to 2019 the gwf in jiangsu province showed a fluctuating decline with an overall decrease of 27 while the gwfi continuously declined agriculture was the largest sector of gwf in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2016 and domesticity replaced it as the largest water pollution source from 2017 to 2019 2 the overall industrial structure of jiangsu province achieved a certain degree of advanced development however the level of ais in jiangsu province was not significantly improved and the secondary industry was still in a leading position 3 in terms of the total amount and intensity water pollution in jiangsu province was well adapted to the ais among them the strong decoupling adaptation sda ideal adaptation state was achieved between the gwf and the ais in 75 of the year while there has always been sda between the gwfi and the ais in jiangsu province therefore targeted policies based on industrial optimization should be rationally formulated aimed at achieving effective water pollution control the findings of adaptability analysis can be applied to regional zoning management and is conducive to promoting sustainable support of the water environment for industrial development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords grey water footprint adaptability analysis water sustainability economic growth optimization of industrial structure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction frequent anthropogenic activities are usually accompanied by the high intensity of water consumption and massive water pollutants discharge kong et al 2022b yuan et al 2022b it has significantly impacted the hydrological process rodell et al 2018 vorosmarty et al 2010 and restricted the natural water system to effectively play the functions of water resources supply water pollution containment and water ecological service under climate change degefu et al 2018 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 ostad ali askar et al 2018 under tremendous external pressure the water environment carrying capacity provided by natural water systems in many regions or river basins is overloaded dai et al 2022 jia et al 2018 kong et al 2022a consequently many basins around the world are facing huge water sustainability challenges eliasson 2015 yuan et al 2020 such as the heihe river basin lu et al 2015 taihu bain wu et al 2018 colorado river basin christensen et al 2004 and murray darling river basin qureshi et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge when human activities seriously disturb normal circulation processes in a water system the water system responds spontaneously with floods droughts water environment damage and water ecological degradation hung et al 2022 sivapalan et al 2014 these adverse responses are extremely destructive once they occur taking the problems of flooding as an example rentschler et al 2022 showed that at least 1 81 billion people from 188 countries were under the threat of once in a century flood disasters among the threatened population 1 24 billion people lived in eastern and southern asia the country most at risk is china where 395 million people were exposed to flooding rentschler et al 2022 on july 20 2021 a rare torrential rain and severe flooding occurred in zhengzhou city henan province of china causing 14 786 million people to be negatively affected and had a direct economic loss of 120 06 billion chinese yuan cny the disharmonious relationship of human water systems could profoundly affect the socioeconomic activities restrict the natural water systems from providing sustainable support for human development and hinder the process of ecological civilization construction jiang et al 2021 luo and zuo 2019 from the long history of water control although the relationship between humans and water is not harmonious harmony between the two can be achieved to this end the first document of the cpc central committee officially proposed the principle of upholding harmony between humans and water in february 2011 the concept of harmonious development between human and water was emphasized in a number of government documents such as the 2020 national conference on water conservancy work under the current requirements of integrated water resources management it is extremely challenging and urgent to ensure the coordinated and sustainable development of regional economic society and water resources jiang et al 2021 kong et al 2019 in order to promote the harmonious development of the human water system the key lies in optimizing the industrial structure to ensure compatibility with water consumption and water pollutants discharge in essence environmental pollution is caused by the lack of high quality economic development the advanced development of industrial structure is a necessary guarantee of high quality economic development and water sustainability zhang et al 2021 the level of advanced industrial structure ais can reflect the degree to which the industry develops towards the direction of service that is economic development is led by the primary industry and gradually evolves to secondary and tertiary industries the higher the value the less water resources consumed and water pollution discharged in the process of industrial development which is a prerequisite for realizing the sustainable production and consumption of water resources fu 2010 zhang et al 2021 meanwhile water pollution is closely related to industrial transition and industrial structure adjustment hu and cheng 2013 yuan et al 2022a different industrial structures not only determine the regional displacement and discharge process but also affects the water quality su et al 2009 under the background of an increasingly prominent water quality crisis the disharmony between water pollution and industrial structure has become the main factor restricting regional sustainable development un water 2018 showed that adaptive management is a key component in promoting the coordinated development of ais and water pollution reduction adapting to the changes of nature is the right way to deal with the relationship between humans and water hence it is pivotal to conduct the adaptability analysis of water pollution and industrial structure however there are very few studies that have placed emphasis on the adaptation of water pollution and industrial structure relevant studies mainly focus on the assessment of matching adaptability and correlation between industrial structure economic growth and water consumption in terms of the studies of correlation and matching zhang et al 2015 used the panel error correction model to test the correlation between different types of water consumption structure and industrial structure in china s provinces from the overall and grouping levels liu et al 2014 adopted the structural deviation coefficient to measure the correlation between industrial structure and water resource consumption in beijing han et al 2020 combined the lorentz curve and gini coefficient model to analyze the spatiotemporal matching characteristics of water resources and socioeconomic development factors in zhangjiakou city from 2004 to 2015 zuo et al 2014 constructed a matching degree model based on sequence to study the matching relationship between water consumption and economic growth the models mentioned above can only reflect the matching relationship between any two correlation variables that change in the same direction the synchronous change relationships between water pollution reduction and advanced development of industrial structure are regarded as mismatch while it is the ideal state identified by this study with the advantages of multiple subdivision states and reflecting the changing direction between any two variables the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficient tapio 2005 has been applied to conduct adaptability analysis for example zhang et al 2021 constructed the tapio adaptation model that could reflect the degree and direction of changes and applied it to explore the adaptability between water consumption structure and ais in the yangtze river economic belt zuo et al 2021 applied the tapio decoupling states to distinguish and analyze the adaption state of water utilization efficiency and economic growth in the yellow river basin in summation the existing studies mainly analyze the adaptability or matching degree of water resource utilization and industrial structure although these studies can provide some insights for exploring the adaptation between water pollution and ais there are still several research shortcomings 1 there is a lack of research on the adaptability between water pollution and ais meanwhile in quantifying water pollution the characteristics of total amount and intensity are not considered simultaneously 2 the measurement of ais is not accurate enough because it is quantified by the ratio of the added value of the tertiary industry to that of the secondary industry while ignoring the influence of the primary industry therefore on the basis of defining the connotation of adaptation this paper combined the gwf theory the ais degree model and the tapio decoupling model to construct an adaptive analysis model of water pollution and ais then jiangsu province was taken as an example to analyze the adaptability between water pollution at the total volume and intensity levels and ais aiming to provide important implications for decision makers to formulate targeted policies the specific logical roadmap of this research is shown in fig 1 the rest of this study is organized as follows section 2 presents the three main methods applied in the research and introduces the data sources as well as research area section 3 describes the main research results from three aspects the in depth analysis and discussion of important results as well as the future research are presented in section 4 the main conclusions are shown in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area jiangsu province is located in latitude 30 45 35 08 n and longitude 116 21 121 56 e with a total land area of 107 200 km2 it borders zhejiang anhui and shandong provinces and shanghai municipality fig 2 meanwhile jiangsu province straddles the yangtze river and huai river and borders the yellow sea in the east with many lakes the local water resources in jiangsu province are insufficient its average per capita water resources was only 539 7 m3 from 2011 to 2019 close to the poverty line of water resources 500 m3 per capita falkenmark 1989 rapid economic development and urbanization have led to problems such as over utilization of water resources and deterioration of water quality according to the 2019 water resources bulletin of jiangsu province the total amount of water resources in the province is 23 17 billion m3 but its water consumption is 49 34 billion m3 which is in a state of excessive consumption meanwhile the structure of water consumption is in urgent need of optimization the primary industry with the lowest output value accounts for 61 4 of water consumption about twice that of the sum of the secondary and tertiary industries 25 4 and 4 2 respectively the level of economic development in jiangsu province is well developed but the problem of water pollution is very prominent the gwf of jiangsu province is twice that of zhejiang province during 2003 2018 ranking third in the yangtze river economic belt he et al 2022 furthermore the ecological environment water use in jiangsu province was overstretched its proportion has decreased 4 51 from 2010 to 2018 and accounts for only 0 8 in 2019 well below the national level of 4 1 during the same year therefore jiangsu province is facing enormous pressure with the water environment which has seriously restricted its water sustainability and high quality economic growth in the near future in 2016 the chinese government put forward the yangtze river protection peng et al 2022 and the three lines one permit tlop policy wang et al 2020 aiming to promote the adaptability of regional resources and environmental carrying capacity to industrial development as one of the first 12 pilot provinces of tlop jiangsu province has made certain efforts to coordinate industrial development with water use and water pollution while there is still much room for improvement under the strict water environment constraints how to realize the adaptability of water pollution and industrial development in jiangsu province has become an urgent problem to be solved 2 2 methods 2 2 1 grey water footprint grey water footprint gwf measures the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate a load of pollutants into a freshwater body based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 based on the water footprint evaluation manual hoekstra et al 2011 and han et al 2016 the regional grey water footprint g w f t o t a l is obtained from agricultural grey water footprint g w f a g r industrial grey water footprint g w f i n d and domestic grey water footprint g w f d o m due to the variety and concentration difference of water pollutants only the major pollutants are considered in the calculation of gwf and the specific formula is as follows 1 g w f t o t a l g w f a g r g w f i n d g w f d o m 1 agricultural grey water footprint g w f a g r is divided into planting grey water footprint g w f p l a and breeding grey water footprint g w f b r e nitrogen fertilizer is the main source of water pollution in the planting industry and chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn in poultry feces and urine are the main sources of water pollution in the farming industry when calculating the g w f a g r the gwf generated by the same type of pollutants should be summed up and that of different types of pollutants takes the maximum the specific formulas are as follows kong et al 2022b 2 g w f a g r max g w f bre c o d g w f p l a t n g w f b r e t n 3 g w f p l a α n a p p l c t n max c t n n a t 4 g w f b r e max g w f b r e c o d g w f b r e t n 5 g w f b r e i l b r e i c i max c i n a t 6 l b r e i h 1 4 n h d h f h p h f β h f u h p h u β h u where α represents the leaching rate of nitrogen fertilizer a p p l indicates the total amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied c max indicates the water quality standard concentration of the pollutant c n a t is the background concentration of water pollutants under natural conditions g w f b r e i represents the gwf of i cod or tn pollutant in the livestock breeding industry l b r e i stands for the pollution emissions of i pollutant in the livestock breeding industry h indicates the main livestock and poultry production including pigs cattle sheep and poultry n h is the number of h d h represents the feeding period of h f h and u h are the daily excretion quantity and urine output of h respectively p h f is the pollutant content of feces per unit of h p h u is the contaminant content per unit of urine of h β h f represents the pollutant loss rate of h in unit feces β h u denotes the pollutant loss rate per unit urine of h 2 industrial grey water footprint in terms of g w f i n d cod and nh3 n are the main pollutants in industrial wastewater therefore the industrial sector adopts the emission of cod and nh3 n as the measurement index the calculation formula is as follows 7 g w f i n d max g w f i n d c o d g w f i n d n h 3 n 8 g w f i n d k l i n d k c k max c k n a t where g w f i n d k and l i n d k refer to the grey water footprint and discharge load of k pollutants in industrial sewage respectively k refers to the emission of cod or nh3 n 3 domestic grey water footprint in terms of g w f d o m domestic sewage belongs to point source pollution and cod and nh3 n are the main pollutants in sewage discharge the calculation formula is as follows 9 g w f d o m max g w f d o m c o d g w f d o m n h 3 n 10 g w f d o m k l d o m k c k max c k n a t where g w f d o m k and l d o m k represent the domestic grey water footprint and discharge of k pollutants in domestic sewage respectively 4 grey water footprint intensity grey water footprint intensity gwfi is measured by the ratio between gwf and regional gross domestic product gdp which represents the gwf generated by unit gdp output the smaller the value is the more positive the result is the specific calculation formula is as follows 11 g w f i g w f g d p 2 2 2 advanced industrial structure model the advanced industrial structure ais refers to the development of the industry towards the direction of service with continuous economic growth fu 2010 liu and ling 2020 the traditional advanced industrial structure is mainly measured by the ratio of the added value of the tertiary industry to the added value of the secondary industry zhang et al 2021 however this method ignores the influence from the change in added value of the primary industry when the added value of the secondary industry and the added value of the tertiary industry increase or decrease by the same extent the value of ais measured is the same in this case the level of ais fails to be distinguished therefore fu 2010 proposed a kind of ais that can reflect the development level of the three industries towards service orientation the larger the value the higher the advanced level of industrial structure its specific calculation steps of are as follows firstly gdp is divided into three parts according to the three industries the proportion of the added value of the three industries in gdp is taken as one component of the spatial vector to form a group of 3 dimensional vectors x 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 secondly the angles θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 between x 0 and vectors x 1 1 0 0 x 2 0 1 0 x 3 0 0 1 are calculated respectively 12 θ j arccos i 1 3 x i j x i 0 i 1 3 x i j 2 1 2 i 1 3 x i 0 2 1 2 j 1 2 3 the expansion formula of θ j is as follows 13 θ j arccos x 1 j x 1 0 x 2 j x 2 0 x 3 j x 3 0 x 1 j 2 x 2 j 2 x 3 j 2 x 1 0 2 x 2 0 2 x 3 0 2 j 1 2 3 according to vector x 1 1 0 0 x 2 0 1 0 x 3 0 0 1 it can be obtained that x 1 1 1 x 2 1 0 x 3 1 0 x 1 2 0 x 2 2 1 x 3 2 0 x 1 3 0 x 2 3 0 x 3 3 1 substitute the above values into the above equation for simplification expressions of θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 14 θ 1 arccos x 1 0 x 1 1 2 x 2 1 2 x 3 1 2 x 1 0 2 x 2 0 2 x 3 0 2 15 θ 2 arccos x 2 0 x 1 1 2 x 2 1 2 x 3 1 2 x 1 0 2 x 2 0 2 x 3 0 2 16 θ 3 arccos x 3 0 x 1 1 2 x 2 1 2 x 3 1 2 x 1 0 2 x 2 0 2 x 3 0 2 finally the degree of advanced industrial structure w is measured as follows 17 w k 1 3 j 1 k θ j j 1 2 3 2 2 3 tapio decoupling adaptation model as shown in formula 18 the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficient tapio 2005 can be used to reflect the asynchronous change relationship between water pollution w p and advanced industrial structure w 18 e w p w w p t 1 w p t 0 w p t 0 w t 1 w t 0 w t 0 where e refers to the decoupling elasticity coefficient w p indicates water pollution and w represents the advanced degree of industrial structure the adaptation of water pollution and advanced industrial structure refers to the reduction of water pollution in the process of advanced development of industrial structure the specific classification of tapio decoupling adaptation states is shown in table 1 among them strong decoupling adaptation sda is the ideal state indicating that water pollution can be reduced during the advanced development of regional industrial structure to some extent but not completely this reflects the green development level of the industry and the improvement of water pollution treatment technology weak decoupling adaptation wda is a relatively ideal adaptation state which indicates that water pollution increases at a lower rate with the advanced development of industrial structure in contrast expansive negative decoupling end is a non ideal adaptation state expansive coupling adaptation eca is an uncertain state because a relatively ideal state may occur with the change of the elastic coefficient meanwhile this study considers that the advanced development of industrial structure is the basic condition no matter whether water pollution is reduced or not accordingly the adaptabilities of recessive decoupling recessive coupling weak negative decoupling and strong weak decoupling are all regarded as nonideal adaptation states it is worth noting that strong weak decoupling swd is the least ideal adaptation because water pollution is aggravated with low level development of the industrial structure 2 3 data sources the data of pollutant discharge standard concentration and natural background concentration needed for the calculation of gwf were obtained from hoekstra et al 2011 and liu et al 2019 specifically the standard limits of cod ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen are 60 mg l 15 mg l and 15 mg l respectively the natural background concentration is assumed to be 0 mg l the reference values of fecal excretion fecal pollutant content and feeding period of different livestock and poultry were taken from han et al 2016 and the investigation and countermeasures on pollution of large scale livestock and poultry industry in china cepa 2002 the nitrogen leaching rate is selected as the national average of 7 zhu 2000 the data of sewage discharge livestock and poultry production fertilizer application surface water resources added value of the three industries gdp and other indicators came from the statistical yearbook of jiangsu province nbsc 2011 2020 the gdp and the added values of three industries were the actual values calculated at constant prices in the year 2000 3 results 3 1 analysis of water pollution assessment the calculation results of regional grey water footprint gwf and its three components as well as grey water footprint intensity gwfi in jiangsu province during 2003 2019 are shown in table 2 the variation trends of gwf and gwfi in jiangsu province during 2003 2019 are presented in fig 3 as shown in table 2 the gwf of jiangsu province showed an overall trend of rising first and then declining with fluctuations during the 2003 2019 period compared with 24 927 billion m3 in 2003 the gwf in 2019 has decreased to 19 509 billion m3 with a total decrease of 27 77 comparing the various components of the regional gwf it can be found that agriculture was the largest source of gwf in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2016 during this period both agricultural gwf and industrial gwf showed a slight downward trend while the proportion of domestic gwf increased significantly from 32 5 in 2003 to 43 06 in 2016 since 2017 domesticity has replaced agriculture as the biggest source of gwf by 2019 agricultural gwf was 8 582 billion m3 43 99 industrial gwf was only 1 463 billion m3 7 50 and domestic gwf was not 9 463 billion m3 48 51 throughout the study period due to the continuous improvement of industrial structure agricultural gwf and industrial gwf in the region continued to decrease decreasing by 2 127 billion m3 19 86 and 2 023 billion m3 58 respectively since domestic gwf is closely related to the long term water use habits of residents so it is difficult to achieve gwf reduction in a short period of time as shown in table 2 and fig 3 the gwfi in jiangsu province showed a strict decreasing trend decreasing from 0 0208 m3 cny in 2003 to 0 0032 m3 cny in 2019 only 2 13 of that in 2003 since the gwfi is obtained by the ratio of gwf to regional gdp it represents the gwf generated by unit gdp output therefore the continuous decline of the gwfi in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2019 indicated that the technical level of water pollution reduction and treatment in the region was improving the production activities with high water pollution discharge were continuously decreasing and the industrial economy was developing towards a greener and high quality direction 3 2 analysis of advanced industrial structure the development of the three industries and the variation trend of the ais in jiangsu province from 2013 to 2019 are shown in table 3 it showed that the real gdp of jiangsu province presented a strict upward trend during 2003 2019 increasing from 1200 191 billion cny in 2003 to 6107 277 billion cny in year 2019 about 5 09 times of that in year 2003 meanwhile the added value of the three industries in jiangsu province showed a steady rising trend during this period specifically the added value of the primary industry increased from 100 922 billion cny in 2003 to 182 49 billion cny in 2019 the added value of the secondary industry increased from 655 615 billion cny in 2003 to 3485 608 billion cny in 2019 the added value of the tertiary industry increased from 435 554 billion cny in 2003 to 2439 179 billion cny in 2019 in comparison it is found that the added value of the three industries in jiangsu province in 2019 was 1 67 5 32 and 5 60 times of that in 2003 respectively among them the primary industry had the lowest growth rate while the tertiary industry had the most significant growth rate in terms of the proportion of the three industries the industrial development of jiangsu province showed a positive trend as a whole that is the proportion of the primary and secondary industries decreased while that of the tertiary industry increased among them the proportion of the primary industry in jiangsu province showed a continuous downward trend decreasing from 9 08 in 2003 to 2 99 in 2019 which was already at a very low level the proportion of the secondary industry in jiangsu province showed a trend of rising first and then falling during the whole study period from 2003 to 2013 it increased strictly from 54 63 minimum value in 2003 to 58 73 maximum value in 2013 from 2014 to 2019 it decreased from 58 49 in 2014 to 57 07 in 2019 in addition the proportion of the secondary industry was always more than 50 and the added value of the secondary industry was always the largest among the three industries it indicated that the secondary industry was still the leading industry in jiangsu province whether in terms of the output value or the proportion of output value however the proportion of the tertiary industry showed a fluctuating upward trend which indicates a strict rising from year 2012 to 2019 and reached a maximum of 39 94 in 2019 to sum up although the industrial structure of jiangsu province was developing towards service oriented in accordance with the law of economic development during 2003 2019 the secondary industry was still in the leading position thus there was a long way to go before the tertiary industry was the leading industry the advanced development of industrial structure in jiangsu province still needs to be accelerated the value of ais in jiangsu province increased from the minimum value of 6 49 in 2003 to the maximum value of 6 77 in 2019 with an overall growth rate of only 4 31 table 3 it could be found that the level of ais in jiangsu province was strictly increasing from 2003 to 2019 but the growth trend was not significant 3 3 adaptability assessment of water pollution and advanced industrial structure the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficients e between gwf as well as gwfi and advanced industrial structure ais in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2019 were calculated based on the formula 18 the results of adaptability assessment are shown in table 4 in general the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficient of gwf and ais in jiangsu province was 5 09 during the whole study period indicating that strong decoupling adaptation sda has been achieved according to the analysis of the annual results there were only expansionary negative decoupling adaptation enda and sda between gwf and ais in jiangsu province and there were irregular alternation changes specifically sda was observed in the periods of 2005 2010 2011 2016 and 2017 2019 while enda was observed in the rest periods generally jiangsu province has achieved an ideal adaptation between gwf and ais in most years during the study period considering the continuous growth of ais we could figure out that the gwf in this region has achieved reduction in general but the effect was not stable in a certain period by contrast the gwfi and ais in jiangsu province always showed sda this indicates that the intensity of water pollution in jiangsu province continued to decrease with the development of ais compared with 2003 the gwfi in the region decreased by 84 62 in 2019 with an annual average decrease of 10 99 4 discussions 4 1 comparative analysis of water pollution considering the total amount and intensity of water pollution simultaneously this study found that water pollution in jiangsu province decreased from 2003 to 2019 on the whole among them the gwf showed a trend of rising first and then declining with fluctuation while the gwfi continued to decrease by comparison the gwf measured in this study was very similar to the results of he et al 2022 and liu et al 2019 in the same year comparing with the provincial areas in the yangtze river economic belt it could be seen that the gwf of jiangsu province in the same period ranked third from 2003 to 2018 in terms of the mean and total amount he et al 2022 concerning gwfi jiangsu province ranked second only to shanghai municipality or zhejiang province among the 11 provincial areas in the yangtze river economic belt from 2003 to 2018 the reason for the continuous decline of gwfi in jiangsu province might be that water pollution treatment technology in the region had vigorously developed promoting gwf reduction in most years with strict growth of the economy the ratio between gwf and gdp represented by gwfi maintained a downward trend when the quantity and intensity of water pollution are known it is pivotal to determine whether the water pollution in this region exceeds the local water environmental capacity for this purpose we introduced the water pollution level wpl index feng et al 2021 to conduct a quantitative analysis the wpl was measured by the ratio of regional gwf to the actual amount of surface water resources and could accurately reflect the surface water quality mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 as shown in fig 4 we found that the wpl in jiangsu province exceeded 1 in 2004 2013 and 2019 indicating that water pollution levels in the region were overloaded meanwhile the wpl was close to 0 9 during the periods of 2008 2010 and 2012 the reason may well be that both the gwf and surface water resources in jiangsu province fluctuated greatly from 2003 to 2019 among them the gwf of jiangsu province decreased by 5 418 billion m3 27 77 on the whole while the surface water resources fluctuated from 49 981 billion m3 in 2003 to 16 3 billion m3 in 2019 with more obvious fluctuation as a result the wpl fluctuated significantly and water pollution exceeded the load in some years in conclusion although the gwf and gwfi in jiangsu province have decreased water pollution still has a great risk of exceeding water environmental capacity 4 2 analysis of the development quality of industrial structure earlier it was mentioned that the industrial structure of jiangsu province has achieved a certain degree of advanced development table 3 this was due to the fact that jiangsu province relied on the scale effect and spillover effect of coordinated development of urban agglomeration in the yangtze river delta during the process of rapid urbanization which greatly reduced internal transaction costs and steadily improved the efficiency of market resource allocation while vigorously developing an industrial economy jiangsu province has always adhered to the optimization and adjustment of industrial structure focusing on supporting development of the high tech industry and modern service industry as a result it allows the industrial structure to present a positive changing trend with the proportion of primary and secondary industries decreasing while that of the tertiary industry increased overall specifically the added value of the three industries in jiangsu province was strictly increasing and the overall industrial structure showed a trend of optimization but the tertiary industry could not replace the secondary industry to become the present leading industry this was because jiangsu province had a solid industrial base and its scale continued to increase and the effect of industrial structure adjustment was not prominent the proportion of the secondary industry continued to rise during 2003 2013 but it had steadily declined since 2013 in the end the secondary industry in this region was still dominant in jiangsu province the level of ais reflected the evolution process of the three industries where the primary industry leading changed to the secondary industry leading and then the tertiary industry taking over the lead position however its increase over the past 16 years was just 4 31 percent this showed that the three industries were in the direction of advanced development but it was hard to determine whether there had been any qualitative change to the level of ais in jiangsu province in order to further explore whether the industrial structure has undergone significant changes the moore index with the advantage of having a relatively flat fluctuation range to avoid overestimating the change of industrial structure was introduced to measure the industrial structure transformation degree moore 1978 the industrial structure transformation refers to the process of qualitative change of the entire industrial structure of a country or region which is considered to be an important goal of economic development to a certain stage liu and ling 2020 the degree of industrial structure transformation is measured based on the percentage of the added value of the three industries in gdp to reflect the intensity of the three industrial structure changes the formula of moore index is as follows 19 m t i 1 3 x i t x i t 1 i 1 3 x i t 2 1 2 i 1 3 x i t 1 2 1 2 where m t represents the degree of industrial structure transformation in the period of t x i t and x i t 1 refer to the proportion of industrial added of i in the period of t and t 1 respectively the calculation results of industrial structure transformation degree in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2019 are shown in fig 5 it showed that the industrial structure of three industries in jiangsu province had not changed therefore this verified that the development level of ais in jiangsu province was not significant since the scale of the three industries in jiangsu province developed rapidly and the structure of the three industries continued to optimize slowly during this period it implied that there was still great potential for the advanced development of industrial structure in this region 4 3 analysis of differences in adaptability as shown in table 4 the adaption state between the gwf and the ais in jiangsu province was ideal in 75 of the years while the adaptation state between the gwfi and the ais was always ideal the difference between the gwf adaptability and the gwfi adaptability in this study needs to be further analyzed table 3 showed that ais increased strictly during the research period and the three industries all presented a steady growth trend hence it could be found that the adaptation state mainly depended on the change trend of water pollution considering the total amount and intensity due to rapid economic growth and the decline of gwf with fluctuation the gwfi in jiangsu province was always decreasing so its adaptation state was always ideal because the ais kept increasing in contrast we believe that gwf showed a downward trend from 2005 to 2019 except for the rebound of gwf in 2009 and 2010 which was consistent with the change direction of gwfi the growth rate of gwf in 2017 was about 0 29 which could be ignored the reason was closely related to the fact that the chinese government invested 4 trillion cny to deal with the global financial crisis in 2008 and most of the investment flowed into industries related to real estate such as the cement and metal smelting industries it is worth noting that many of these industries had high water consumption levels and discharged a high level of water pollution emissions as a result water pollution in china began to rise in 2009 and industry led jiangsu province was no exception in order to deal with this potential water crisis the no 1 document of the cpc central committee launched in february 2011 and the central water conservancy conference launched in july 2011 clearly required the implementation of the strictest water resource management system aiming to alleviate the current situation of high consumption and pollution emission of water therefore the gwf in jiangsu province began to decline again in 2011 although we could find that the main reason for the difference between gwf and gwfi adaptation is due to gwf achieving reduction on the whole it fails to maintain strict decrement throughout the study period 4 4 policy implications for the quantification of relevant water pollution indicators some enlightenment can be obtained specifically gwf and gwfi can be used as the dual control targets of regional water pollution treatment to evaluate the pollution control performance in different regions the dual objective assessment is more rigorous and takes into account the total amount and intensity simultaneously in addition the wpl index could be used for regional water sustainability assessment considering the actual water pollution and available fresh water resources for zoning control we can obtain several implications specifically different regions could be divided according to the adaptation results between water pollution and ais for sda type areas the current industrial development mode should be maintained for wda type areas they should be encouraged to slow down economic growth and continue to strengthen water pollution treatment so as to promote the transformation of wda to sda for other regions efforts should be made to develop water pollution treatment technologies and improve production efficiency on the basis of ensuring industrial structure upgrading in addition the adaptability assessment between water pollution and industrial development can be carried out for major regional departments and managers 4 5 limitations and future study although this study analyzed the adaptability of water pollution and ais it focused on the synchronous change relationship between the two ignoring their causal relationship and non linear influence mechanism accordingly future studies need to further identify possible mediating variables based on the causal relationship between the two and explore the internal influencing mechanism by constructing appropriate econometric models 5 conclusions combining with the gwf theory this study firstly revealed the water pollution situation in jiangsu province considering its total amount and intensity and then analyzed the industrial development status from three aspects including added value proportion of the three industries and ais finally the adaptability analysis of water pollution and ais was conducted the main conclusions are as follows 1 combined with the total amount and intensity the water pollution in jiangsu province showed a positive trend 2 the industrial structure of jiangsu province has achieved a certain degree of advanced development during the period from 2003 to 2019 but the effect was not significant 3 overall both the total amount and the intensity of water pollution were well adapted to ais in jiangsu province this study provides a new analytical framework for the adaptability assessment of water pollution and ais the adaptation results of water pollution and ais could be used as a basis for regional zoning which is conducive to formulate differentiation policy credit authorship contribution

24197,the advanced development of industrial structure is the inevitable way to alleviate a regional water quality crisis however the adaptability between water pollution and advanced industrial structure ais remains unrevealed analyzing the adaptability between the two can provide important enlightenment for regional differentiated policy making taking jiangsu province as a case study this study firstly assessed the status of water pollution during the years 2013 2019 through quantitatively analyzing the grey water footprint gwf and grey water footprint intensity gwfi secondly the level of ais was measured to identify the characteristics and evolution of the industrial structure finally the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficient was introduced to reflect the adaptability between gwf and ais and between gwfi and ais the main results showed that 1 from 2013 to 2019 the gwf in jiangsu province showed a fluctuating decline with an overall decrease of 27 while the gwfi continuously declined agriculture was the largest sector of gwf in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2016 and domesticity replaced it as the largest water pollution source from 2017 to 2019 2 the overall industrial structure of jiangsu province achieved a certain degree of advanced development however the level of ais in jiangsu province was not significantly improved and the secondary industry was still in a leading position 3 in terms of the total amount and intensity water pollution in jiangsu province was well adapted to the ais among them the strong decoupling adaptation sda ideal adaptation state was achieved between the gwf and the ais in 75 of the year while there has always been sda between the gwfi and the ais in jiangsu province therefore targeted policies based on industrial optimization should be rationally formulated aimed at achieving effective water pollution control the findings of adaptability analysis can be applied to regional zoning management and is conducive to promoting

water consumption and massive water pollutants discharge kong et al 2022b yuan et al 2022b it has significantly impacted the hydrological process rodell et al 2018 vorosmarty et al 2010 and restricted the natural water system to effectively play the functions of water resources supply water pollution containment and water ecological service under climate change degefu et al 2018 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 ostad ali askar et al 2018 under tremendous external pressure the water environment carrying capacity provided by natural water systems in many regions or river basins is overloaded dai et al 2022 jia et al 2018 kong et al 2022a consequently many basins around the world are facing huge water sustainability challenges eliasson 2015 yuan et al 2020 such as the heihe river basin lu et al 2015 taihu bain wu et al 2018 colorado river basin christensen et al 2004 and murray darling river basin qureshi et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge when human activities seriously disturb normal circulation processes in a water system the water system responds spontaneously with floods droughts water environment damage and water ecological degradation hung et al 2022 sivapalan et al 2014 these adverse responses are extremely destructive once they occur taking the problems of flooding as an example rentschler et al 2022 showed that at least 1 81 billion people from 188 countries were under the threat of once in a century flood disasters among the threatened population 1 24 billion people lived in eastern and southern asia the country most at risk is china where 395 million people were exposed to flooding rentschler et al 2022 on july 20 2021 a rare torrential rain and severe flooding occurred in zhengzhou city henan province of china causing 14 786 million people to be negatively affected and had a direct economic loss of 120 06 billion chinese yuan cny the disharmonious relationship of human water systems could profoundly affect the socioeconomic activities restrict the natural water systems from providing sustainable support for human development and hinder the process of ecological civilization construction jiang et al 2021 luo and zuo 2019 from the long history of water control although the relationship between humans and water is not harmonious harmony between the two can be achieved to this end the first document of the cpc central committee officially proposed the principle of upholding harmony between humans and water in february 2011 the concept of harmonious development between human and water was emphasized in a number of government documents such as the 2020 national conference on water conservancy work under the current requirements of integrated water resources management it is extremely challenging and urgent to ensure the coordinated and sustainable development of regional economic society and water resources jiang et al 2021 kong et al 2019 in order to promote the harmonious development of the human water system the key lies in optimizing the industrial structure to ensure compatibility with water consumption and water pollutants discharge in essence environmental pollution is caused by the lack of high quality economic development the advanced development of industrial structure is a necessary guarantee of high quality economic development and water sustainability zhang et al 2021 the level of advanced industrial structure ais can reflect the degree to which the industry develops towards the direction of service that is economic development is led by the primary industry and gradually evolves to secondary and tertiary industries the higher the value the less water resources consumed and water pollution discharged in the process of industrial development which is a prerequisite for realizing the sustainable production and consumption of water resources fu 2010 zhang et al 2021 meanwhile water pollution is closely related to industrial transition and industrial structure adjustment hu and cheng 2013 yuan et al 2022a different industrial structures not only determine the regional displacement and discharge process but also affects the water quality su et al 2009 under the background of an increasingly prominent water quality crisis the disharmony between water pollution and industrial structure has become the main factor restricting regional sustainable development un water 2018 showed that adaptive management is a key component in promoting the coordinated development of ais and water pollution reduction adapting to the changes of nature is the right way to deal with the relationship between humans and water hence it is pivotal to conduct the adaptability analysis of water pollution and industrial structure however there are very few studies that have placed emphasis on the adaptation of water pollution and industrial structure relevant studies mainly focus on the assessment of matching adaptability and correlation between industrial structure economic growth and water consumption in terms of the studies of correlation and matching zhang et al 2015 used the panel error correction model to test the correlation between different types of water consumption structure and industrial structure in china s provinces from the overall and grouping levels liu et al 2014 adopted the structural deviation coefficient to measure the correlation between industrial structure and water resource consumption in beijing han et al 2020 combined the lorentz curve and gini coefficient model to analyze the spatiotemporal matching characteristics of water resources and socioeconomic development factors in zhangjiakou city from 2004 to 2015 zuo et al 2014 constructed a matching degree model based on sequence to study the matching relationship between water consumption and economic growth the models mentioned above can only reflect the matching relationship between any two correlation variables that change in the same direction the synchronous change relationships between water pollution reduction and advanced development of industrial structure are regarded as mismatch while it is the ideal state identified by this study with the advantages of multiple subdivision states and reflecting the changing direction between any two variables the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficient tapio 2005 has been applied to conduct adaptability analysis for example zhang et al 2021 constructed the tapio adaptation model that could reflect the degree and direction of changes and applied it to explore the adaptability between water consumption structure and ais in the yangtze river economic belt zuo et al 2021 applied the tapio decoupling states to distinguish and analyze the adaption state of water utilization efficiency and economic growth in the yellow river basin in summation the existing studies mainly analyze the adaptability or matching degree of water resource utilization and industrial structure although these studies can provide some insights for exploring the adaptation between water pollution and ais there are still several research shortcomings 1 there is a lack of research on the adaptability between water pollution and ais meanwhile in quantifying water pollution the characteristics of total amount and intensity are not considered simultaneously 2 the measurement of ais is not accurate enough because it is quantified by the ratio of the added value of the tertiary industry to that of the secondary industry while ignoring the influence of the primary industry therefore on the basis of defining the connotation of adaptation this paper combined the gwf theory the ais degree model and the tapio decoupling model to construct an adaptive analysis model of water pollution and ais then jiangsu province was taken as an example to analyze the adaptability between water pollution at the total volume and intensity levels and ais aiming to provide important implications for decision makers to formulate targeted policies the specific logical roadmap of this research is shown in fig 1 the rest of this study is organized as follows section 2 presents the three main methods applied in the research and introduces the data sources as well as research area section 3 describes the main research results from three aspects the in depth analysis and discussion of important results as well as the future research are presented in section 4 the main conclusions are shown in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area jiangsu province is located in latitude 30 45 35 08 n and longitude 116 21 121 56 e with a total land area of 107 200 km2 it borders zhejiang anhui and shandong provinces and shanghai municipality fig 2 meanwhile jiangsu province straddles the yangtze river and huai river and borders the yellow sea in the east with many lakes the local water resources in jiangsu province are insufficient its average per capita water resources was only 539 7 m3 from 2011 to 2019 close to the poverty line of water resources 500 m3 per capita falkenmark 1989 rapid economic development and urbanization have led to problems such as over utilization of water resources and deterioration of water quality according to the 2019 water resources bulletin of jiangsu province the total amount of water resources in the province is 23 17 billion m3 but its water consumption is 49 34 billion m3 which is in a state of excessive consumption meanwhile the structure of water consumption is in urgent need of optimization the primary industry with the lowest output value accounts for 61 4 of water consumption about twice that of the sum of the secondary and tertiary industries 25 4 and 4 2 respectively the level of economic development in jiangsu province is well developed but the problem of water pollution is very prominent the gwf of jiangsu province is twice that of zhejiang province during 2003 2018 ranking third in the yangtze river economic belt he et al 2022 furthermore the ecological environment water use in jiangsu province was overstretched its proportion has decreased 4 51 from 2010 to 2018 and accounts for only 0 8 in 2019 well below the national level of 4 1 during the same year therefore jiangsu province is facing enormous pressure with the water environment which has seriously restricted its water sustainability and high quality economic growth in the near future in 2016 the chinese government put forward the yangtze river protection peng et al 2022 and the three lines one permit tlop policy wang et al 2020 aiming to promote the adaptability of regional resources and environmental carrying capacity to industrial development as one of the first 12 pilot provinces of tlop jiangsu province has made certain efforts to coordinate industrial development with water use and water pollution while there is still much room for improvement under the strict water environment constraints how to realize the adaptability of water pollution and industrial development in jiangsu province has become an urgent problem to be solved 2 2 methods 2 2 1 grey water footprint grey water footprint gwf measures the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate a load of pollutants into a freshwater body based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 based on the water footprint evaluation manual hoekstra et al 2011 and han et al 2016 the regional grey water footprint g w f t o t a l is obtained from agricultural grey water footprint g w f a g r industrial grey water footprint g w f i n d and domestic grey water footprint g w f d o m due to the variety and concentration difference of water pollutants only the major pollutants are considered in the calculation of gwf and the specific formula is as follows 1 g w f t o t a l g w f a g r g w f i n d g w f d o m 1 agricultural grey water footprint g w f a g r is divided into planting grey water footprint g w f p l a and breeding grey water footprint g w f b r e nitrogen fertilizer is the main source of water pollution in the planting industry and chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn in poultry feces and urine are the main sources of water pollution in the farming industry when calculating the g w f a g r the gwf generated by the same type of pollutants should be summed up and that of different types of pollutants takes the maximum the specific formulas are as follows kong et al 2022b 2 g w f a g r max g w f bre c o d g w f p l a t n g w f b r e t n 3 g w f p l a α n a p p l c t n max c t n n a t 4 g w f b r e max g w f b r e c o d g w f b r e t n 5 g w f b r e i l b r e i c i max c i n a t 6 l b r e i h 1 4 n h d h f h p h f β h f u h p h u β h u where α represents the leaching rate of nitrogen fertilizer a p p l indicates the total amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied c max indicates the water quality standard concentration of the pollutant c n a t is the background concentration of water pollutants under natural conditions g w f b r e i represents the gwf of i cod or tn pollutant in the livestock breeding industry l b r e i stands for the pollution emissions of i pollutant in the livestock breeding industry h indicates the main livestock and poultry production including pigs cattle sheep and poultry n h is the number of h d h represents the feeding period of h f h and u h are the daily excretion quantity and urine output of h respectively p h f is the pollutant content of feces per unit of h p h u is the contaminant content per unit of urine of h β h f represents the pollutant loss rate of h in unit feces β h u denotes the pollutant loss rate per unit urine of h 2 industrial grey water footprint in terms of g w f i n d cod and nh3 n are the main pollutants in industrial wastewater therefore the industrial sector adopts the emission of cod and nh3 n as the measurement index the calculation formula is as follows 7 g w f i n d max g w f i n d c o d g w f i n d n h 3 n 8 g w f i n d k l i n d k c k max c k n a t where g w f i n d k and l i n d k refer to the grey water footprint and discharge load of k pollutants in industrial sewage respectively k refers to the emission of cod or nh3 n 3 domestic grey water footprint in terms of g w f d o m domestic sewage belongs to point source pollution and cod and nh3 n are the main pollutants in sewage discharge the calculation formula is as follows 9 g w f d o m max g w f d o m c o d g w f d o m n h 3 n 10 g w f d o m k l d o m k c k max c k n a t where g w f d o m k and l d o m k represent the domestic grey water footprint and discharge of k pollutants in domestic sewage respectively 4 grey water footprint intensity grey water footprint intensity gwfi is measured by the ratio between gwf and regional gross domestic product gdp which represents the gwf generated by unit gdp output the smaller the value is the more positive the result is the specific calculation formula is as follows 11 g w f i g w f g d p 2 2 2 advanced industrial structure model the advanced industrial structure ais refers to the development of the industry towards the direction of service with continuous economic growth fu 2010 liu and ling 2020 the traditional advanced industrial structure is mainly measured by the ratio of the added value of the tertiary industry to the added value of the secondary industry zhang et al 2021 however this method ignores the influence from the change in added value of the primary industry when the added value of the secondary industry and the added value of the tertiary industry increase or decrease by the same extent the value of ais measured is the same in this case the level of ais fails to be distinguished therefore fu 2010 proposed a kind of ais that can reflect the development level of the three industries towards service orientation the larger the value the higher the advanced level of industrial structure its specific calculation steps of are as follows firstly gdp is divided into three parts according to the three industries the proportion of the added value of the three industries in gdp is taken as one component of the spatial vector to form a group of 3 dimensional vectors x 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 secondly the angles θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 between x 0 and vectors x 1 1 0 0 x 2 0 1 0 x 3 0 0 1 are calculated respectively 12 θ j arccos i 1 3 x i j x i 0 i

in formula 18 the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficient tapio 2005 can be used to reflect the asynchronous change relationship between water pollution w p and advanced industrial structure w 18 e w p w w p t 1 w p t 0 w p t 0 w t 1 w t 0 w t 0 where e refers to the decoupling elasticity coefficient w p indicates water pollution and w represents the advanced degree of industrial structure the adaptation of water pollution and advanced industrial structure refers to the reduction of water pollution in the process of advanced development of industrial structure the specific classification of tapio decoupling adaptation states is shown in table 1 among them strong decoupling adaptation sda is the ideal state indicating that water pollution can be reduced during the advanced development of regional industrial structure to some extent but not completely this reflects the green development level of the industry and the improvement of water pollution treatment technology weak decoupling adaptation wda is a relatively ideal adaptation state which indicates that water pollution increases at a lower rate with the advanced development of industrial structure in contrast expansive negative decoupling end is a non ideal adaptation state expansive coupling adaptation eca is an uncertain state because a relatively ideal state may occur with the change of the elastic coefficient meanwhile this study considers that the advanced development of industrial structure is the basic condition no matter whether water pollution is reduced or not accordingly the adaptabilities of recessive decoupling recessive coupling weak negative decoupling and strong weak decoupling are all regarded as nonideal adaptation states it is worth noting that strong weak decoupling swd is the least ideal adaptation because water pollution is aggravated with low level development of the industrial structure 2 3 data sources the data of pollutant discharge standard concentration and natural background concentration needed for the calculation of gwf were obtained from hoekstra et al 2011 and liu et al 2019 specifically the standard limits of cod ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen are 60 mg l 15 mg l and 15 mg l respectively the natural background concentration is assumed to be 0 mg l the reference values of fecal excretion fecal pollutant content and feeding period of different livestock and poultry were taken from han et al 2016 and the investigation and countermeasures on pollution of large scale livestock and poultry industry in china cepa 2002 the nitrogen leaching rate is selected as the national average of 7 zhu 2000 the data of sewage discharge livestock and poultry production fertilizer application surface water resources added value of the three industries gdp and other indicators came from the statistical yearbook of jiangsu province nbsc 2011 2020 the gdp and the added values of three industries were the actual values calculated at constant prices in the year 2000 3 results 3 1 analysis of water pollution assessment the calculation results of regional grey water footprint gwf and its three components as well as grey water footprint intensity gwfi in jiangsu province during 2003 2019 are shown in table 2 the variation trends of gwf and gwfi in jiangsu province during 2003 2019 are presented in fig 3 as shown in table 2 the gwf of jiangsu province showed an overall trend of rising first and then declining with fluctuations during the 2003 2019 period compared with 24 927 billion m3 in 2003 the gwf in 2019 has decreased to 19 509 billion m3 with a total decrease of 27 77 comparing the various components of the regional gwf it can be found that agriculture was the largest source of gwf in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2016 during this period both agricultural gwf and industrial gwf showed a slight downward trend while the proportion of domestic gwf increased significantly from 32 5 in 2003 to 43 06 in 2016 since 2017 domesticity has replaced agriculture as the biggest source of gwf by 2019 agricultural gwf was 8 582 billion m3 43 99 industrial gwf was only 1 463 billion m3 7 50 and domestic gwf was not 9 463 billion m3 48 51 throughout the study period due to the continuous improvement of industrial structure agricultural gwf and industrial gwf in the region continued to decrease decreasing by 2 127 billion m3 19 86 and 2 023 billion m3 58 respectively since domestic gwf is closely related to the long term water use habits of residents so it is difficult to achieve gwf reduction in a short period of time as shown in table 2 and fig 3 the gwfi in jiangsu province showed a strict decreasing trend decreasing from 0 0208 m3 cny in 2003 to 0 0032 m3 cny in 2019 only 2 13 of that in 2003 since the gwfi is obtained by the ratio of gwf to regional gdp it represents the gwf generated by unit gdp output therefore the continuous decline of the gwfi in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2019 indicated that the technical level of water pollution reduction and treatment in the region was improving the production activities with high water pollution discharge were continuously decreasing and the industrial economy was developing towards a greener and high quality direction 3 2 analysis of advanced industrial structure the development of the three industries and the variation trend of the ais in jiangsu province from 2013 to 2019 are shown in table 3 it showed that the real gdp of jiangsu province presented a strict upward trend during 2003 2019 increasing from 1200 191 billion cny in 2003 to 6107 277 billion cny in year 2019 about 5 09 times of that in year 2003 meanwhile the added value of the three industries in jiangsu province showed a steady rising trend during this period specifically the added value of the primary industry increased from 100 922 billion cny in 2003 to 182 49 billion cny in 2019 the added value of the secondary industry increased from 655 615 billion cny in 2003 to 3485 608 billion cny in 2019 the added value of the tertiary industry increased from 435 554 billion cny in 2003 to 2439 179 billion cny in 2019 in comparison it is found that the added value of the three industries in jiangsu province in 2019 was 1 67 5 32 and 5 60 times of that in 2003 respectively among them the primary industry had the lowest growth rate while the tertiary industry had the most significant growth rate in terms of the proportion of the three industries the industrial development of jiangsu province showed a positive trend as a whole that is the proportion of the primary and secondary industries decreased while that of the tertiary industry increased among them the proportion of the primary industry in jiangsu province showed a continuous downward trend decreasing from 9 08 in 2003 to 2 99 in 2019 which was already at a very low level the proportion of the secondary industry in jiangsu province showed a trend of rising first and then falling during the whole study period from 2003 to 2013 it increased strictly from 54 63 minimum value in 2003 to 58 73 maximum value in 2013 from 2014 to 2019 it decreased from 58 49 in 2014 to 57 07 in 2019 in addition the proportion of the secondary industry was always more than 50 and the added value of the secondary industry was always the largest among the three industries it indicated that the secondary industry was still the leading industry in jiangsu province whether in terms of the output value or the proportion of output value however the proportion of the tertiary industry showed a fluctuating upward trend which indicates a strict rising from year 2012 to 2019 and reached a maximum of 39 94 in 2019 to sum up although the industrial structure of jiangsu province was developing towards service oriented in accordance with the law of economic development during 2003 2019 the secondary industry was still in the leading position thus there was a long way to go before the tertiary industry was the leading industry the advanced development of industrial structure in jiangsu province still needs to be accelerated the value of ais in jiangsu province increased from the minimum value of 6 49 in 2003 to the maximum value of 6 77 in 2019 with an overall growth rate of only 4 31 table 3 it could be found that the level of ais in jiangsu province was strictly increasing from 2003 to 2019 but the growth trend was not significant 3 3 adaptability assessment of water pollution and advanced industrial structure the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficients e between gwf as well as gwfi and advanced industrial structure ais in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2019 were calculated based on the formula 18 the results of adaptability assessment are shown in table 4 in general the tapio decoupling elasticity coefficient of gwf and ais in jiangsu province was 5 09 during the whole study period indicating that strong decoupling adaptation sda has been achieved according to the analysis of the annual results there were only expansionary negative decoupling adaptation enda and sda between gwf and ais in jiangsu province and there were irregular alternation changes specifically sda was observed in the periods of 2005 2010 2011 2016 and 2017 2019 while enda was observed in the rest periods generally jiangsu province has achieved an ideal adaptation between gwf and ais in most years during the study period considering the continuous growth of ais we could figure out that the gwf in this region has achieved reduction in general but the effect was not stable in a certain period by contrast the gwfi and ais in jiangsu province always showed sda this indicates that the intensity of water pollution in jiangsu province continued to decrease with the development of ais compared with 2003 the gwfi in the region decreased by 84 62 in 2019 with an annual average decrease of 10 99 4 discussions 4 1 comparative analysis of water pollution considering the total amount and intensity of water pollution simultaneously this study found that water pollution in jiangsu province decreased from 2003 to 2019 on the whole among them the gwf showed a trend of rising first and then declining with fluctuation while the gwfi continued to decrease by comparison the gwf measured in this study was very similar to the results of he et al 2022 and liu et al 2019 in the same year comparing with the provincial areas in the yangtze river economic belt it could be seen that the gwf of jiangsu province in the same period ranked third from 2003 to 2018 in terms of the mean and total amount he et al 2022 concerning gwfi jiangsu province ranked second only to shanghai municipality or zhejiang province among the 11 provincial areas in the yangtze river economic belt from 2003 to 2018 the reason for the continuous decline of gwfi in jiangsu province might be that water pollution treatment technology in the region had vigorously developed promoting gwf reduction in most years with strict growth of the economy the ratio between gwf and gdp represented by gwfi maintained a downward trend when the quantity and intensity of water pollution are known it is pivotal to determine whether the water pollution in this region exceeds the local water environmental capacity for this purpose we introduced the water pollution level wpl index feng et al 2021 to conduct a quantitative analysis the wpl was measured by the ratio of regional gwf to the actual amount of surface water resources and could accurately reflect the surface water quality mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 as shown in fig 4 we found that the wpl in jiangsu province exceeded 1 in 2004 2013 and 2019 indicating that water pollution levels in the region were overloaded meanwhile the wpl was close to 0 9 during the periods of 2008 2010 and 2012 the reason may well be that both the gwf and surface water resources in jiangsu province fluctuated greatly from 2003 to 2019 among them the gwf of jiangsu province decreased by 5 418 billion m3 27 77 on the whole while the surface water resources fluctuated from 49 981 billion m3 in 2003 to 16 3 billion m3 in 2019 with more obvious fluctuation as a result the wpl fluctuated significantly and water pollution exceeded the load in some years in conclusion although the gwf and gwfi in jiangsu province have decreased water pollution still has a great risk of exceeding water environmental capacity 4 2 analysis of the development quality of industrial structure earlier it was mentioned that the industrial structure of jiangsu province has achieved a certain degree of advanced development table 3 this was due to the fact that jiangsu province relied on the scale effect and spillover effect of coordinated development of urban agglomeration in the yangtze river delta during the process of rapid urbanization which greatly reduced internal transaction costs and steadily improved the efficiency of market resource allocation while vigorously developing an industrial economy jiangsu province has always adhered to the optimization and adjustment of industrial structure focusing on supporting development of the high tech industry and modern service industry as a result it allows the industrial structure to present a positive changing trend with the proportion of primary and secondary industries decreasing while that of the tertiary industry increased overall specifically the added value of the three industries in jiangsu province was strictly increasing and the overall industrial structure showed a trend of optimization but the tertiary industry could not replace the secondary industry to become the present leading industry this was because jiangsu province had a solid industrial base and its scale continued to increase and the effect of industrial structure adjustment was not prominent the proportion of the secondary industry continued to rise during 2003 2013 but it had steadily declined since 2013 in the end the secondary industry in this region was still dominant in jiangsu province the level of ais reflected the evolution process of the three industries where the primary industry leading changed to the secondary industry leading and then the tertiary industry taking over the lead position however its increase over the past 16 years was just 4 31 percent this showed that the three industries were in the direction of advanced development but it was hard to determine whether there had been any qualitative change to the level of ais in jiangsu province in order to further explore whether the industrial structure has undergone significant changes the moore index with the advantage of having a relatively flat fluctuation range to avoid overestimating the change of industrial structure was introduced to measure the industrial structure transformation degree moore 1978 the industrial structure transformation refers to the process of qualitative change of the entire industrial structure of a country or region which is considered to be an important goal of economic development to a certain stage liu and ling 2020 the degree of industrial structure transformation is measured based on the percentage of the added value of the three industries in gdp to reflect the intensity of the three industrial structure changes the formula of moore index is as follows 19 m t i 1 3 x i t x i t 1 i 1 3 x i t 2 1 2 i 1 3 x i t 1 2 1 2 where m t represents the degree of industrial structure transformation in the period of t x i t and x i t 1 refer to the proportion of industrial added of i in the period of t and t 1 respectively the calculation results of industrial structure transformation degree in jiangsu province from 2003 to 2019 are shown in fig 5 it showed that the industrial structure of three industries in jiangsu province had not changed therefore this verified that the development level of ais in jiangsu province was not significant since the scale of the three industries in jiangsu province developed rapidly and the structure of the three industries continued to optimize slowly during this period it implied that there was still great potential for the advanced development of industrial structure in this region 4 3 analysis of differences in adaptability as shown in table 4 the adaption state between the gwf and the ais in jiangsu province was ideal in 75 of the years while the adaptation state between the gwfi and the ais was always ideal the difference between the gwf adaptability and the gwfi adaptability in this study needs to be further analyzed table 3 showed that ais increased strictly during the research period and the three industries all presented a steady growth trend hence it could be found that the adaptation state mainly depended on the change trend of water pollution considering the total amount and intensity due to rapid economic growth and the decline of gwf with fluctuation the gwfi in jiangsu province was always decreasing so its adaptation state was always ideal because the ais kept increasing in contrast we believe that gwf showed a downward trend from 2005 to 2019 except for the rebound of gwf in 2009 and 2010 which was consistent with the change direction of gwfi the growth rate of gwf in 2017 was about 0 29 which could be ignored the reason was closely related to the fact that the chinese government invested 4 trillion cny to deal with the global financial crisis in 2008 and most of the investment flowed into industries related to real estate such as the cement and metal smelting industries it is worth noting that many of these industries had high water consumption levels and discharged a high level of water pollution emissions as a result water pollution in china began to rise in 2009 and industry led jiangsu province was no exception in order to deal with this potential water crisis the no 1 document of the cpc central committee launched in february 2011 and the central water conservancy conference launched in july 2011 clearly required the implementation of the strictest water resource management system aiming to alleviate the current situation of high consumption and pollution emission of water therefore the gwf in jiangsu province began to decline again in 2011 although we could find that the main reason for the difference between gwf and gwfi adaptation is due to gwf achieving reduction on the whole it fails to maintain strict decrement throughout the study period 4 4 policy implications for the quantification of relevant water pollution indicators some enlightenment can be obtained specifically gwf and gwfi can be used as the dual control targets of regional water pollution treatment to evaluate the pollution control performance in different regions the dual objective assessment is more rigorous and takes into account the total amount and intensity simultaneously in addition the wpl index could be used for regional water sustainability assessment considering the actual water pollution and available fresh water resources for zoning control we can obtain several implications specifically different regions could be divided according to the adaptation results between water pollution and ais for sda type areas the current industrial development mode should be maintained for wda type areas they should be encouraged to slow down economic growth and continue to strengthen water pollution treatment so as to promote the transformation of wda to sda for other regions efforts should be made to develop water pollution treatment technologies and improve production efficiency on the basis of ensuring industrial structure upgrading in addition the adaptability assessment between water pollution and industrial development can be carried out for major regional departments and managers 4 5 limitations and future study although this study analyzed the adaptability of water pollution and ais it focused on the synchronous change relationship between the two ignoring their causal relationship and non linear influence mechanism accordingly future studies need to further identify possible mediating variables based on the causal relationship between the two and explore the internal influencing mechanism by constructing appropriate econometric models 5 conclusions combining with the gwf theory this study firstly revealed the water pollution situation in jiangsu province considering its total amount and intensity and then analyzed the industrial development status from three aspects including added value proportion of the three industries and ais finally the adaptability analysis of water pollution and ais was conducted the main conclusions are as follows 1 combined with the total amount and intensity the water pollution in jiangsu province showed a positive trend 2 the industrial structure of jiangsu province has achieved a certain degree of advanced development during the period from 2003 to 2019 but the effect was not significant 3 overall both the total amount and the intensity of water pollution were well adapted to ais in jiangsu province this study provides a new analytical framework for the adaptability assessment of water pollution and ais the adaptation results of water pollution and ais could be used as a basis for regional zoning which is conducive to formulate differentiation policy credit authorship contribution

24198,we built a dynamic spatial food web model for the barents sea developed with ecospace by including species habitat requirements and ecological interactions the model was used to test the spatial shifts of different functional groups due to warming we compared model predicted and field surveyed biomass of functional groups fgs spatial distributions in relatively cold and warm years the ecospace model included habitat foraging capacities for environmental parameters such as water temperature and bottom depth for 74 fgs out of a total of 108 fgs we created two plausible scenarios one representing a relatively cold year 2004 and another representing a warm year 2013 with differences of ca 0 3 c in bottom temperature 0 6 c in surface temperature and 7 less ice coverage between them comparison of centre of gravity inertia and spatial overlap of the modelled and surveyed spatial distributions in warm and cold years showed that the model represented the past distributions of the functional groups satisfactorily we observed poleward shifts of 41 and 68 km for the modelled and observed distributions respectively in the average centre of gravity position for the 35 fgs with lowest sampling uncertainty the model predicted that the whole community had shifted distribution towards the northeast at an average rate of 4 4 km year 1 and 67 km c 1 between 2004 and 2013 we conclude that our ecospace model represents past observed species distributions in the barents sea satisfactorily and may predict the direction and magnitude of temperature driven changes in spatial distributions this ability may be useful for predicting the impact of climate changes on species and fg distributions in future scenarios keywords ecological modelling ecospace model validation spatial distribution shift data availability data input and all maps are available online in the supplementary material 1 introduction many marine species have changed their spatial distributions over the past few decades due to global climate change poloczanska et al 2016 at high latitudes in the barents sea poleward shifts of marine fish spatial distributions due to warming have been documented based on survey observations fossheim et al 2015 frainer et al 2017 there is however less documentation of spatial shifts for other group of organisms that are less surveyed than fishes in high latitude areas changes in air and water temperature often co occur with changes in ice coverage light availability open water area and primary production dalpadado et al 2020 pedersen et al 2021 reigstad et al 2011 in the barents sea pelagic primary production increased markedly with decreasing ice coverage dalpadado et al 2020 and the associated changes in several environmental factors may complicate the evaluation of warming effects although a species distribution is highly connected to environmental aspects it also depends on the responses of its predators and prey to changes in environmental conditions and the availability of suitable habitats marine species differ significantly in their thermal responses with arctic species preferring low temperature and boreal species preferring higher temperature as well as in the range of thermal tolerance i e narrow stenothermal vs wide eurythermal responses pörtner and gutt 2016 thus spatial distribution responses to temperature changes are expected to depend on the thermal response of the species spatial models for components in marine ecosystems span in complexity from conceptual models nordøy et al 2008 to statistical fall et al 2018 husson et al 2020 species distribution individual based models gonzalez mirelis et al 2021 huse et al 2004 dynamic mass balance slagstad and mcclimans 2005 and spatially resolved end to end models audzijonyte et al 2019 spatial modelling involving functional groups fgs at all trophic levels has been less common though modelling approaches such as atlantis and ecopath with ecosim and ecospace ewe have such capacities audzijonyte et al 2019 fulton et al 2018 walters et al 1999 dynamic spatial models can represent the biological community and include species habitat requirements e g thermal responses and ecological interactions the dynamic spatial model ecospace can incorporate environmental aspects of species habitat foraging capacity and predator prey relationships to drive changes in functional groups this enables the model to reproduce the impact on abiotic conditions spatially according to the strong environmental gradient in the region and temporally on distribution of boreal and arctic species with different habitat preferences the ewe approaches model mass balanced food webs based on the energy flows between fgs christensen et al 2008 in this context an fg may represent species a sub group of species or a group of species that are functionally and ecologically similar based on this principle ecopath provides a static mass balanced snapshot of the system and is the base for the ecosim and ecospace approach christensen and pauly 1992 polovina 1984 walters et al 1997 ecospace is the spatio temporal framework that allows one based on the trophic relationships to answer temporally and spatially explicit ecological questions christensen et al 2014 2008 walters et al 1997 in the barents sea statistical and process based models have been used in studies of how the modelled warming effects change the spatial distributions of some fish and zooplankton species huse and ellingsen 2008 skaret et al 2014 spatial shifts due to warming are also expected in other areas in an ipcc based projection of a 3 7 c increase in surface temperature and a 3 9 c increase in bottom temperature off the north atlantic coast of the usa in the next 60 80 years it is expected that target fishes will shift their distribution northward by about 100 to 200 km kleisner et al 2017 considering the average predicted increase in surface water temperature in the north sea perry et al 2005 estimated that two commercial fishes may retract entirely from the north of the north sea by 2050 and other species may extend their range northward to encompass the entire region the barents sea is strongly influenced by the inflow of warm atlantic water with temperature and flux that vary over time with alternating warm and cold periods gonzález pola et al 2020 schlichtholz 2019 trofimov et al 2019 however over the past two decades the water temperature has increased and ice coverage has decreased more intensely ingvaldsen et al 2021 trofimov et al 2019 in the barents sea much information on the responses of fgs to environmental factors such as depth temperature bottom substrate and ice affinity is available from monitoring surveys e g the integrated ecosystem surveys initiated in 2004 dolgov 2016 eriksen et al 2018 husson et al 2020 wienerroither et al 2011 information on responses of fgs to environmental factors can potentially be integrated into ecospace habitat foraging functions while comparing species using survey based observation and modelled distributions could be helpful to evaluate the model results it is expected that by including information on the responses of fgs to environmental factors such as habitat capacity the model will represent the fgs distributions well due to the particular oceanic dynamics in the barents sea with the influence of the warm atlantic water from the southwest and the arctic s influence from the north and northwest it is expected that all fgs in the barents sea ecosystem will move poleward with an increasing temperature and a reduction in ice coverage testing model predictions by confrontation with field observed data early in the modelling process is essential to enhance model quality and avoid model misspecification jørgensen and fath 2011 however few studies have evaluated marine spatial models output by comparing model predicted to field observed spatial distributions see attempts by huse et al 2004 ecospace uses a spatial grid which may be adapted to the spatial resolution of field sampling to ease comparison of modelled and observed data there are few studies in which ecospace modelled distributions are compared directly to field observed distributions though see coll et al 2019 and romagnoni et al 2015 this work aimed to understand the effect of climate change on the spatial distributions of high latitude marine biota to do so we developed an ecospace model for the barents sea ecosystem from an already published ewe model pedersen et al 2021 its performances were assessed based on the evaluation of its capacity to reproduce field observed spatial distributions of the different fgs under two different climatic scenarios corresponding to a warm year 2013 and a relatively colder one 2004 then the impact of warming was assessed through the measure of the shift in fgs distributions between the two years 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and

ecosystem survey run by the institute of marine research imr and polar research institute of marine fisheries and oceanography pinro eriksen et al 2018 prozorkevich et al 2020 aims to monitor the status of abiotic and biotic factors and changes in these in the barents sea ecosystem it was initiated in 2004 and conducted annually in the autumn until the present day gathering a considerable amount of data about the barents sea ecosystem data for species distribution used in this study came from the campelen 1800 bottom trawl 22 mm mesh size at cod end which captures demersal and bathypelagic species as well as epibenthic megafauna as bycatch at a towing speed of approximately 3 knots only stations from 50 to 500 m depth towed between 15 and 60 min were kept so as to ensure a homogeneous sampling of the offshore barents sea ecosystem an average of 278 stations are sampled yearly in a grid design of 64 8 km mesh size covering south and west of svalbard to franz joseph land and novaya zemlya during the surveys the catch per unit effort cpue is calculated for each taxon and station by standardising species biomass by unit sampling area 2 3 ecospace and ecopath with ecosim

vulnerabilities pedersen et al 2021 and these vulnerabilities have been carried over to the ecospace model the ecopath and ecosim model described in pedersen et al 2021 showed that the basic ecosystem structure was preserved during the periods of overexploitation between 1970 and 1990 and during the recovery after 1990 this resilience is expected to be reflected in the stability of fgs spatial distributions modelled by ecospace another important aspect highlighted by pedersen et al s 2021 model is the increase in productivity at lower trophic levels during warm years leading to higher productivity for most high trophic level fgs which is likely to impact the fgs spatial distributions the ecospace model applies a two dimensional grid basemap the basemap identifies the spatial bounds and grid dimensions and includes the modelled area s environmental characteristics defined habitats and fg environmental limits christensen et al 2014 2008 based on the temporal equations ecospace models the biomass of each fg within each cell in the grid over time by considering trophic interactions fishing and species movement christensen et al 2008 walters et al 1999 the habitat foraging capacity concept included in ecospace aims to increase the model s realism making the food web interact effectively and spatiotemporally with the environmental variability christensen et al 2014 the model ran with monthly time steps and the simulation time was set to 20 years to define the ecospace maps we used the same projection as the joint ecosystem survey with a cell grid of square cells of 64 8 km in length and width the spatial environmental drivers i e a value of the driver for each grid cell included depth bottom and surface temperature days of ice coverage the distance off the coast buhl mortensen et al 2015 lien et al 2013 and primary production reigstad et al 2011 we constructed this model using the ecopath with ecosim and ecospace software version 6 6 6 christensen et al 2008 the model allocated the biomasses of the fgs dynamically across a two dimensional grid map with 32 cells in the longitudinal direction and 28 cells in the latitudinal direction giving a total of 486 active cells fig 3 the model calculated the fgs biomass spatial distributions based on fgs habitat foraging capacities predation regimes dispersal rates and the spatially resolved environmental input christensen et al 2014 walters et al 1999 the dispersal rate parameters needed in ecospace are the average annual movement distances of random movement of the fgs across the ecosystem christensen et al 2008 for this model we specified seven different dispersal rate values representing the mobility of various fgs based on their movement patterns the choices of values for each dispersal rate were based on previous studies mackinson and daskalov 2007 püts et al 2020 romagnoni et al 2015 as were the characteristics of all organisms in each fg and the environmental condition of the barents sea lme we set 1000 km year 1 for fast top predators and highly migratory mammals and birds 600 km year 1 for pelagic and migratory demersal fgs 300 km year 1 for faster moving demersal fishes fgs and pelagic advected fgs 200 km year 1 for snow crabs and coastal cod 100 km year 1 for red king crab which is a mobile crab 30 km year 1 for benthic invertebrates and detritus fgs and 10 km year 1 for offal appendix a 2 4 derivation of habitat capacity functions the ecopath model is run based on a system of linear equations describing the average mass and energy flows between all fgs during a period of time christensen and pauly 1992 in the temporal dynamic framework of ecopath ecosim simulates the ecosystem effects of changes in mortality and environmental forces christensen and walters 2004 the consumption rates are calculated based on the foraging arena concept where biomasses are divided into vulnerable and invulnerable components ahrens et al 2012 the ecospace time spatial model works based on the ecosim set of equations predicting the biomass dynamics in the two dimensional grid map walters et al 1999 each active cell can contain one or more habitat type and environmental driver such as water temperature and bottom depth these habitat types can affect the computed foraging capacity of the fgs implemented via separate environmental preference functions for each environmental parameter calculated for each cell this procedure allows more variation amongst the cells to distribute the fgs over the map where they are most likely to occur christensen et al 2014 the habitat foraging capacity is based on the foraging arena theory ahrens et al 2012 the computed habitat foraging capacity is calculated from fgs affinity for given habitats and functional responses to environmental conditions based on the habitat layers in the basemap each habitat type gets a proportion assigned according to how suitable it is for a certain fg christensen et al 2014 environmental capacity is based on environmental driver maps it enables the model to drive the fgs foraging capacity from the cumulative effects of multiple physical oceanographic environmental and topographic conditions spatially and runs in conjunction with the food web and fisheries dynamics coll et al 2019 we used two approaches to derive habitat capacity functions i the quantile generalised additive model qgam approach for fgs with sufficient survey data from the ecosystem survey with data from 2004 to 2019 and ii literature information on environmental preferences for the habitat capacity based on data from the ecosystem survey we calculated one qgam husson et al 2020 per species habitat variable couple using the qgam package in r fasiolo et al 2017 the qgam is a generalised additive model gam for which the fitted target is a chosen quantile rather than the mean when fitting the 99th quantile we thus estimated the maximum possible biomass for each fg in response to each environmental variable this amounted to calculating a potential niche for each fg cade et al 2005 we used the same methodology as husson et al 2020 the number of degrees of freedom in the qgams was limited to three in order to avoid complex regressions without ecological rationality to evaluate the predictive power of each qgam model all results were fitted using a training dataset consisting of observations for the years 2004 to 2013 they were then evaluated on the testing dataset which included observations for the years 2014 2019 to extract distribution parameters to be used as habitat foraging capacities for each fg in ecospace we fitted alternative classical continuous distribution curves logistic beta log normal exponential and normal using the fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 logspline charles et al 2002 betareg cribari neto and zeileis 2010 and extradistr wolodzko 2019 packages in r on each qgam species environment model in addition we estimated binormal distributions which is one of the possible shapes of habitat capacity function in ecospace it comprises two half normal distribution functions specified by three parameters the mean the left and the right standard deviation halves of normal distributions the left half distribution fits the data below the mean and the right half distribution fits the distribution above the mean the binormal distribution can approximate various function shapes ranging from ordinary normal distribution to sigmoid shaped relationships we adjusted functional relationships between habitat capacity and temperature and depth for some groups based on qgam results to follow the observed distribution fig 4 appendix b habitat capacity functions varied widely between fgs depending on the relationship between the fgs and the environmental drivers fig 4 most habitat capacity functions were entered as binormal distributions for more details see appendices b and c however the ice coverage functions were entered as right shoulder function when the fg was more dependant on the ice and left shoulder when the fg was assumed to avoid the ice a beta function was used for ice coverage for crangonid shrimp the distance off the coast was entered as an exponential function with decreasing habitat capacity with increased distance from the coast to derive literature based habitat capacity relationships for the fgs that were not well represented in the ecosystem survey results we also included habitat capacities derived from published studies on spatial distributions as well as environmental preferences and tolerances the ecosystem survey is conducted in autumn the warmest months of the year and therefore the survey does not cover the entire niche of the species we included habitat capacity for 74 fgs with 29 fgs using habitat capacities based on qgam estimations and 45 fgs using habitat capacities based on literature and personal observations for more details see appendix c the foraging capacity of fgs that were dominant in terms of biomass at its trophic levels were included sequentially one by one followed by a comparison of the observed and modelled distributions of all fgs this process was repeated until all fgs including those with no habitat capacity had a modelled distribution similar to the observed by including as few as possible habitat capacities so as to avoid overfitting the model the qgam calculations for 28 fgs mainly commercial fishes caught by bottom trawl indicate that depth bottom and surface temperature and ice coverage can be good predictors for the distribution of most evaluated fgs fig 4 shows an example of habitat capacities included in ecospace as foraging capacity fig 4 a shows the temperature capacity for arctic polar cod arctic boreal northeast arctic cod and boreal blue whiting fgs fig 4 b shows the depth capacity for shallow large bivalves intermediate pelagic amphipods and deep sperm whale fgs 2 5 scenario set ups for cold and warm years the year 1990 marked the beginning of the most recent warm period in the barents sea region trofimov et al 2019 in the mid 2000s the warming condition amplified schlichtholz 2019 the species and fgs are expected to be affected by these environmental changes and we expected that this model would be able to perform the calculations however to evaluate whether our model could represent the natural variability of the environmental conditions in the barents sea and fgs during the warming conditions of the past two decades we specified two scenarios in ecospace one represented a warm and another a less warm or cold year within the warm period with differences in water temperature and ice coverage between the scenarios described below within the warm period from the beginning of the ecosystem survey onwards the coldest year in the kola section fig 5 water column temperature time series was 2011 and the warmest was 2012 fig 5 gonzález pola et al 2020 however in order to validate the model data from field observations were necessary and the years that combined the best observed data the most extensive geographic coverage and adequate environmental conditions were the cold 2004 and warm 2013 spatial environmental information for this model was taken from the nordic seas 4 km numerical ocean model hindcast svim archive a numerical ocean model hindcast that simulates the nordic and barents seas at a spatial resolution of 4 km lien et al 2013 this model was developed from 1960 to 2011 and represents the barents sea s physical environment well lien et al 2013 however it is annually updated and validated by observed data and provides continuous information about these areas environmental conditions according to the svim archive the average annual surface temperature for the barents sea in 2013 was 0 57 c warmer than in 2004 and the average bottom temperature in 2013 was 0 27 c higher than in 2004 appendix d table d1 we constructed two temperature scenarios one for the relatively cold 2004 fig 3 and another for the warm 2013 year based on svim archive in ecospace functional groups can move to the four adjacent cells through random directional movements mediated by habitat preferences and responses of organisms to depredation risk and feeding conditions christensen et al 2014 in order to define the fg habitat preferences it is necessary to include basemaps that can embrace many environmental aspects the present study included depth bottom temperature surface temperature ice coverage the distance off the coast and sediment type gravel sand and mud pebbles and rocky bottom appendix e the scenarios were constructed based on the annual average values of each cell in the maps for the bottom and surface water temperature and ice coverage the average minimum and maximum values of the scenario basemaps can be seen in appendix d table d1 for phytoplankton primary production we digitised maps based on reigstad et al 2011 for the relatively cold 1998 and warm 2006 years for the distance off the coast basemap we built a map defining the ranges of distances 64 8 km 129 6 km 194 4 km 259 2 km 324 km and 388 8 km from the coast which are the distances of the cells in the grid from the closest to the coast to the more distant in addition to the environmental drivers habitats may be specified in ecospace assets of water cells sharing certain features affecting the movements feeding rate and survival of the ecopath model components occurring therein christensen et al 2008 all habitat maps for the substrate category were derived from mareano the sea in maps and pictures buhl mortensen et al 2015 the mareano seabed map for substrate grain size has a higher resolution than our model grid and we classified it into four discrete categories gravel sand and mud pebbles and rocky bottom appendix e 2 6 comparison of modelled and survey based spatial distributions to evaluate the performance of the ecospace model for the barents sea we compared the modelled and survey observed distributions for a total of 35 fgs with good spatial distribution data available for warm and cold years encompassing the whole lme barents sea appendix f two major sources for spatial distributions were used for 28 fgs we obtained observed spatial distributions of biomass from the ecosystem survey for 2004 cold and 2013 warm for fgs n 7 with spatial data from the ecosystem survey in 2013 but with no information for 2004 we used information from 2010 to represent a colder year than 2013 we also digitised distributions for 20 fgs from published papers appendix d table d2 to the same projection we used for the ecospace basemap projection aea datum based on hayford 1909 and unit m to convert the published distributions of original maps to raster maps at the same projection and scale as the ecospace basemap we used an image of the original map in gif format using the open source quantum geographic information system qgis and its raster tool georeferencer we adjusted the figure with the projection used in the ecospace basemap we transferred the values from the tiff image with a grid generated by the qgis to a raster file with basemap dimensions and then plotted it using r rstudio 2021 see the digitalised maps in appendix e to evaluate the uncertainty in the resulting spatial grid matrices we allocated the spatial distributions into uncertainty categories according to the origin and quality of the spatial distribution data using a score ranging from 1 lowest uncertainty to 5 highest uncertainty table 1 and appendix f to compare the observed distributions from warm and cold years with the modelled distributions for 2004 and 2013 produced by the ecospace model we calculated the centre of gravity and inertia for each fg centre of gravity cg is the mean geographical location of the biomass distribution of the fg and inertia is the spread variance of the distribution of the observed and modelled distributions woillez et al 2007 2009 to evaluate how the fgs spatial distribution overlapped we calculated the global index of collocation gic the gic was calculated by comparing the distance between the cgs of a pair of fgs and their respective inertias woillez et al 2007 2009 the gic ranges from 0 when each distribution is concentrated in a single and different location to 1 when the cgs of the two distributions coincide to evaluate how distant the observed spatial distributions are from the modelled distributions we calculated the distance in km between the observed and the modelled centre of gravities for fgs based on the pythagorean theorem the angular deviation between observed and modelled distributions cgs was calculated using the arctangent of the observed and modelled cg difference it was then converted to degrees on a 360 scale azimuth the same procedure was repeated to analyse the differences in fgs distribution between cold and warm years to assess the main direction of spatial shifts a clockwise circle centred on the modelled cgs was split into four equal quadrants northeastern between 0 and 90 southeastern between 90 and 180 southwestern between 180 and 270 and northwestern between 270 and 360 frequencies of fgs within each quadrant were compared and this compartmentation allowed us to define the main direction of dislocation between modelled and the observed survey based distribution here we set the results as the azimuth an angle between 0 and 360 measured clockwise from the north and bearing that is an angle lower than 90 within a quadrant defined by the cardinal directions to evaluate the main shift of cgs from the cold year to the warm year we calculated the average directional shift of all modelled and observed cgs chi square tests were applied on contingency table data to test if frequencies of directions of cg differed between north and south east and west or between quadrants and a significance level of α 0 05 was applied zar 1998 the kruskal wallis kw test was used to test if distributions of a variable were equal in more than two groups to evaluate if the habitat overlap patterns of predators and prey in the modelled and observed distributions were similar we calculated the gic of all 35 predators fgs and their primary prey fgs with available distributions for cold and warm years the shift rate km year 1 between the cg position from cold to warm years was calculated by dividing the distance between the cg position from cold to warm year by the time interval in years 2 7 evaluation of changes in the barents sea community distribution in the past decade due to warming conditions to evaluate changes in the modelled barents sea biological community due to the observed warming conditions over the past two decades we calculated the average cg position of all modelled fgs in the cold 2004 and warm 2013 years and compared the distance and the bearing between them as described above we then divided the distance from the 2004 to 2013 average cg position by the time interval and the difference in the water temperature bottom and surface from these two years to find the shift rate 2 8 thermal responses and distribution area for each fg we applied aquamaps kaschner et al 2019 parameter of surface temperature and used the 10th quantile as the minimum and 90th quantile at maximum of the trapezoid function as a measure of width of the thermal response this width is expected to be small for stenothermal species with narrow thermal tolerances and large for eurythermal species that have broad thermal flexibility pörtner and gutt 2016 we allocated fgs to biogeographical categories with arctic species as those with a maximum limit 90th of 8 c and the lower limit below 0 c arctic boreal were the species with the minimum 10th around 0 c the maximum 90th around 10 c and the absolute maximum up to 12 c boreal were species with the minimum 10th higher than 4 c and maximum 90th lower than 14 c and broad were the species with the range between the minimum 10th and maximum 90th embracing the arctic and boreal limits and beyond to represent the area of the fgs distribution we calculated the inertia area then divided the inertia of the modelled fgs warm year by the cold year and observed if the area increased decreased or remained stable then we compared the inertia area of all modelled fgs using the paired wilcoxon test comparing cold 2004 and warm 2013 year scenarios to compare the variation of the modelled area amongst the four biogeographical groups and the three thermoplasticity groups from the cold 2004 and the warm 2013 year we calculated the average difference of the inertia area by group and then compared them using the kw test 3 results 3 1 comparison of modelled and observed distributions within cold and warm years the fgs distributions generated by the ecospace model in cold and warm years were generally similar to the available observed distributions modelled and observed centres of gravity and inertia of fgs had similar values for most groups table 2 and appendix g generally the modelled distributions of fgs showed high spatial overlap with the observed distributions with the average values for the global index of collocation gic between modelled and observed distributions of 0 89 in cold and 0 88 in warm

including benthic and pelagic invertebrates for more details see appendix h 3 3 predator prey distribution overlap the spatial overlap index between the main prey for the predators revealed that most

model for the barents sea at the food web level comprising fgs at all trophic levels and with the same spatial resolution as the survey field observed spatial distributions our study shows that the ecospace modelled and observed spatial distributions can easily be compared and evaluated by using cg and inertia it is known that the species distributions in the barents sea are strongly related to the environmental conditions aune et al 2021 dalpadado et al 2003 loeng 1989b nakken and raknes 1987 the ability to predict these distributions in the context of environmental changes and differential natural resource usage can be very beneficial for resource management and species conservation the ecospace model includes multiple spatial drivers that are coupled to the foraging capacity of fgs this enable ecospace to simulate spatial responses to multiple physical oceanographic and environmental drivers christensen et al 2014 coll et al 2019 and contribute to a good representation of the fgs distribution with a high overlap between the observed and modelled distribution during the process of individual inclusion of the habitat capacities and comparison with the survey observed distribution we observed that depth bottom and surface temperatures were crucial to model the species distributions in the barents sea ecospace model this is in line with other studies that identified these environmental drivers as good predictors of species distributions in the barents sea husson et al 2020 as well in other marine ecosystems burgos et al 2020 coll et al 2019 the use of the habitat foraging capacity functions and contrasting warm and relatively colder years allowed us to observe the relevance of the inclusion of temperature depth ice and productivity as forcings to predictive models as they proved to be essential to describe the changes observed between cold and warm years in the barents sea lme the use of habitat capacities based on the qgam method for barents sea data improved the fit of the model to observed distributions however information from literature e g aquamaps fishbase and sealifebase similar to what we used for species with no local information for habitat capacity has been used exclusively or as complementary to distribution descriptor tools in many studies e g adebola and de mutsert 2019 coll et al 2019 2020 coll et al 2019 argued that the modelling tools used to describe species distributions such as qgam can be complemented by either using the response functions derived from statistical analysis in the ecopath calculations or by forcing the niche priors of ecospace foraging capacity directly with the results from the statistical model using the foraging habitat capacity is crucial for more reliable results as we were able to confirm in our model ecospace is a dynamic model that includes predator prey interactions and in our study the use of habitat capacity functions to force distributions leds to more realistic spatial distributions for some fgs that lacked habitat capacities when there was no information available locally e g based on field data for the ecospace model area sources such as fishbase and sealifebase were useful to derive habitat foraging capacity functions trophic models always carry some uncertainties generalisations and different levels of accuracy in the data and the fg in a model as large as the present ecospace model some fgs consist of several species while others represent single species see appendix f however we argue that the model can effectively predict the spatial distributions for all evaluated fgs the fgs with assumed high uncertainty in field sampled distributions were expected to overlap less with the model output than the fgs with assumed low uncertainty this can be observed with greenland halibut fgs categorised as having a high uncertainty of sampling score 4 according to the ecosystem survey report anon 2004 large greenland halibut distribution was primarily outside of the survey area in the ecosystem survey in 2004 this could affect both the small and large greenland halibut observed distribution the same report discusses how adult greenland halibut s main concentrations were in the deeper part of the spitsbergen slope and southeast of a line drawn between bear island and hopen island anon 2004 close to where our model shows the centre of gravity of this species distribution it suggests that despite the lower overlap index value for this species our model may represent the distribution close to the expected natural distribution of this species in the warm year 2013 the observed and modelled distributions of both fgs of greenland halibut overlapped more than in the cold year 2004 this could reflect the enlargement of the sampled area northeast of the original area in 2013 prokhorova 2013 none of the ecosystem surveys covered the extreme northeastern part of the study area eriksen 2014 thus because of incomplete coverage in this area the spatial distributions for some fgs from the ecosystem survey could show more southerly distributions than the real distributions the barents sea is deepest in the southwest where the bottom water is warmest loeng and drinkwater 2007 thus a northward change in the distribution of a species will also affect its depth distribution affecting predator prey relationships and potentially affecting predation mortalities and competition effects fall et al 2018 the generally higher overlap for modelled than observed predator prey may result from the inability of the model to incorporate all the complexity of the natural systems in which fgs can make new and unexpected connections in response to restrictions or lack of resources that the model cannot predict 4 2 changes in modelled and observed distributions between cold and warm years that the observed distributions were positioned more northerly in warm than in cold years was expected for high latitude species in warmer conditions eriksen et al 2017 fossheim et al 2015 frainer et al 2017 poloczanska et al 2016 skaret et al 2014 the model outputs showed a similar northeastward shift from the cold to the warm scenario indicating that our model may be a good predictor tool for the effects of warming on spatial distribution changes of functional groups in the barents sea ecosystem this distribution shift was expected and is in line with other model predictions of changes in species distributions due to global warming showing boreal and arctic species moving their distributions poleward albeit in different ways christiansen et al 2014 fossheim et al 2015 frainer et al 2017 hollowed et al 2013 perry et al 2005 poloczanska et al 2016 pörtner and gutt 2016 the similar average cg position of the modelled and the observed fgs distributions in cold and warm years indicates a similar average distribution pattern in the modelled and observed data the poleward shifts from the cold to warm years in average cg were similar for the modelled 41 km and observed 68 km data and could indicate a similar average response to change in temperature in modelled and observed distributions however some fgs have shown different bearings in the shift between cold and warm years though most displacements were in similar directions to what was observed by field surveys thus we can affirm that our model can effectively and spatially represent the barents sea ecosystem and its past changes due to environmental changes 4 3 effects of warming on distribution of the whole community most 80 of the 104 living fgs of the model shifted distribution poleward in the warm scenario the other groups e g coastal cod saithe and other small gadoids mostly shifted distribution southeastward which may to some extent also be a result of a search for colder conditions this is because the southeastern part of the barents sea lme is colder than the western part mainly due to the contact with the white and kara seas known for being cold seas kohnemann et al 2017 we included distance off the coast as habitat capacity for some fgs that shifted distribution towards the southeast and this restricted the fgs from moving to colder conditions in the northern barents sea forcing these fgs to move to cold conditions in the southeastern barents sea some boreal species associated with the warmer atlantic water such as mackerel atlantic puffin and blue whiting shifted their distribution towards the southwest in these cases when evaluating their natural distributions anker nilssen et al 2000 belikov et al 2011 olafsdottir et al 2019 this shift direction means that they are expanding into the barents sea probably already due to the atlantification of the barents sea with the warming conditions of the past few decades the rate of poleward shift based on average cgs of all the modelled fgs in our study was 4 4 km year 1 between the 2004 and 2013 scenarios this community shift rate seems to be higher than most poleward shifts of organisms due to warming reported in other studies in the north sea six demersal fish species moved north boundaries of the distribution at a rate of 2 2 km year 1 in warmer conditions perry et al 2005 in iceland s coastal waters 82 fish species showed distribution shifts at a mean rate of 0 014 latitude year 1 55 km year 1 most of them poleward during 22 years with warming conditions campana et al 2020 the shift rate of the centre of distribution produced by our model seems to be similar to rates observed in other subpolar and boreal areas in our study the community as a whole shifted on average 67 km c 1 poleward based on the surface temperature although based on the bottom temperature the community as a whole shifted 133 km c 1 poleward campana et al 2020 observed an average shift of 38 km c 1 in the fish community distribution in icelandic waters based on average water column temperature in the north sea dulvy et al 2008 observed a poleward shift of demersal fish species at a rate that ranged between 10 and 70 km c 1 based on temperature from the lower half of the water column and perry et al 2005 observed an average distribution shift of 164 km c 1 for 15 demersal fishes based on bottom temperature the measures for water temperature may be critical for the value of shift rate because surface waters are more susceptible to rises in air temperature while deeper waters are more thermally stable manabe et al 1990 thus the shift rate based on bottom temperature tends to be higher than based on surface or the whole water column temperature our study shows results similar to those which perry et al 2005 found in the north sea the shift rate in our study was based on the average cg position for the whole community including benthic and pelagic species and steno and eurythermal species the rate can vary depending on the fg and their particularities and here our point is to present an overview of the community pattern in the barents sea 4 4 thermal responses to warming boreal and arctic species in the barents sea differ markedly regarding resource use and habitat affinities and how environmental changes impact their distribution and the community as a whole frainer et al 2017 many authors have argued that boreal species have tended to move or increase their distributions poleward during the period of recent warming fossheim et al 2015 perry et al 2005 poloczanska et al 2016 in contrast arctic species have been observed to reduce the area of their distributions by being restricted to high latitudes searching for polar conditions christiansen et al 2014 fossheim et al 2015 frainer et al 2017 hollowed et al 2013 pörtner and gutt 2016 in our study a few fgs reduced their modelled distribution areas under warmer conditions on average even the stenothermal arctic and arctic boreal fgs more frequently increased than reduced distribution areas in warmer conditions campana et al 2020 argued that in iceland the stenothermal species with a distribution close to their thermal limits were the most likely to change their distribution the increase in the water temperature observed in the barents sea in the period of the present study was probably too small to force the water temperature close to the thermal limit of any stenothermal species in the barents sea this may be one possible explanation for the overall increase in the distribution area in warmer conditions in our study 4 5 limitations of the study some of the observed distributions were not from 2004 which represented a cold year or from 2013 which represented a warm year but were from other years with different environmental conditions that may have contributed to less accurate results it is evident that once we were not constantly comparing the same years and consequently not the same environmental conditions we could not include all relevant environmental and physiological possible variables thus we did not expect a complete distribution overlap between observed and modelled functional groups however the generally high spatial overlap between observed and modelled distribution indicates the good representativity of our model even though the barents sea ecospace model has some limitations it seems to effectively model the spatial distributions of fgs in the barents sea lme well 5 conclusions the ecospace model of the barents sea lme simulated similar spatial distributions of fgs as did the survey based observed distributions in cold and warm years most fgs shifted their modelled and observed distributions poleward under warmer conditions the poleward shifts in the average centre of gravity for the 35 fgs with observational data was 41 km for modelled and 68 km for observed distributions the whole modelled community shifted 40 km towards the northeast poleward from the relatively cold 2004 to the warm 2013 corresponding to a shift rate of 67 km c 1 surface temperature and 133 km c 1 bottom temperature the warming conditions led to an average increase of 4 in the modelled fgs distribution area measured as inertia area the ecopspace model for the barents sea can be used to predict future changes in spatial distributions under warming scenarios we are now using the model applying different climatic scenarios and spatio temporal predictions to answer questions regarding the impacts of

24198,we built a dynamic spatial food web model for the barents sea developed with ecospace by including species habitat requirements and ecological interactions the model was used to test the spatial shifts of different functional groups due to warming we compared model predicted and field surveyed biomass of functional groups fgs spatial distributions in relatively cold and warm years the ecospace model included habitat foraging capacities for environmental parameters such as water temperature and bottom depth for 74 fgs out of a total of 108 fgs we created two plausible scenarios one representing a relatively cold year 2004 and another representing a warm year 2013 with differences of ca 0 3 c in bottom temperature 0 6 c in surface temperature and 7 less ice coverage between them comparison of centre of gravity inertia and spatial overlap of the modelled and surveyed spatial distributions in warm and cold years showed that the model represented the past distributions of the functional groups satisfactorily we observed poleward shifts of 41 and 68 km for the modelled and observed distributions respectively in the average centre of gravity position for the 35 fgs with lowest sampling uncertainty the model predicted that the whole community had shifted distribution towards the northeast at an average rate of 4 4 km year 1 and 67 km c 1 between 2004 and 2013 we conclude that our ecospace model represents past observed species distributions in the barents sea satisfactorily and may predict the direction and magnitude of temperature driven changes in spatial distributions this ability may be useful for predicting the impact of climate changes on species and fg distributions in future scenarios keywords ecological modelling ecospace model validation spatial distribution shift data availability data input and all maps are available online in the supplementary material 1 introduction many marine species have changed their spatial distributions over the past few decades due to global climate change poloczanska et al 2016 at high latitudes in the barents sea poleward shifts of marine fish spatial distributions due to warming have been documented based on survey observations fossheim et al 2015 frainer et al 2017 there is however less documentation of spatial shifts for other group of organisms that are less surveyed than fishes in high latitude areas changes in air and water temperature often co occur with changes in ice coverage light availability open water area and primary production dalpadado et al 2020 pedersen et al 2021 reigstad et al 2011 in the barents sea pelagic primary production increased markedly with decreasing ice coverage dalpadado et al 2020 and the associated changes in several environmental factors may complicate the evaluation of warming effects although a species distribution is highly connected to environmental aspects it also depends on the responses of its predators and prey to changes in environmental conditions and the availability of suitable habitats marine species differ significantly in their thermal responses with arctic species preferring low temperature and boreal species preferring higher temperature as well as in the range of thermal tolerance i e narrow stenothermal vs wide eurythermal responses pörtner and gutt 2016 thus spatial distribution responses to temperature changes are expected to depend on the thermal response of the species spatial models for components in marine ecosystems span in complexity from conceptual models nordøy et al 2008 to statistical fall et al 2018 husson et al 2020 species distribution individual based models gonzalez mirelis et al 2021 huse et al 2004 dynamic mass balance slagstad and mcclimans 2005 and spatially resolved end to end models audzijonyte et al 2019 spatial modelling involving functional groups fgs at all trophic levels has been less common though modelling approaches such as atlantis and ecopath with ecosim and ecospace ewe have such capacities audzijonyte et al 2019 fulton et al 2018 walters et al 1999 dynamic spatial models can represent the biological community and include species habitat requirements e g thermal responses and ecological interactions the dynamic spatial model ecospace can incorporate environmental aspects of species habitat foraging capacity and predator prey relationships to drive changes in functional groups this enables the model to reproduce the impact on abiotic conditions spatially according to the strong environmental gradient in the region and temporally on distribution of boreal and arctic species with different habitat preferences the ewe approaches model mass balanced food webs based on the energy flows between fgs christensen et al 2008 in this context an fg may represent species a sub group of species or a group of species that are functionally and ecologically similar based on this principle ecopath provides a static mass balanced snapshot of the system and is the base for the ecosim and ecospace approach christensen and pauly 1992 polovina 1984 walters et al 1997 ecospace is the spatio temporal framework that allows one based on the trophic relationships to answer temporally and spatially explicit ecological questions christensen et al 2014 2008 walters et al 1997 in the barents sea statistical and process based models have been used in studies of how the modelled warming effects change the spatial distributions of some fish and zooplankton species huse and ellingsen 2008 skaret et al 2014 spatial shifts due to warming are also expected in other areas in an ipcc based projection of a 3 7 c increase in surface temperature and a 3 9 c increase in bottom temperature off the north atlantic coast of the usa in the next 60 80 years it is expected that target fishes will shift their distribution northward by about 100 to 200 km kleisner et al 2017 considering the average predicted increase in surface water temperature in the north sea perry et al 2005 estimated that two commercial fishes may retract entirely from the north of the north sea by 2050 and other species may extend their range northward to encompass the entire region the barents sea is strongly influenced by the inflow of warm atlantic water with temperature and flux that vary over time with alternating warm and cold periods gonzález pola et al 2020 schlichtholz 2019 trofimov et al 2019 however over the past two decades the water temperature has increased and ice coverage has decreased more intensely ingvaldsen et al 2021 trofimov et al 2019 in the barents sea much information on the responses of fgs to environmental factors such as depth temperature bottom substrate and ice affinity is available from monitoring surveys e g the integrated ecosystem surveys initiated in 2004 dolgov 2016 eriksen et al 2018 husson et al 2020 wienerroither et al 2011 information on responses of fgs to environmental factors can potentially be integrated into ecospace habitat foraging functions while comparing species using survey based observation and modelled distributions could be helpful to evaluate the model results it is expected that by including information on the responses of fgs to environmental factors such as habitat capacity the model will represent the fgs distributions well due to the particular oceanic dynamics in the barents sea with the influence of the warm atlantic water from the southwest and the arctic s influence from the north and northwest it is expected that all fgs in the barents sea ecosystem will move poleward with an increasing temperature and a reduction in ice coverage testing model predictions by confrontation with field observed data early in the modelling process is essential to enhance model quality and avoid model misspecification jørgensen and fath 2011 however few studies have evaluated marine spatial models output by comparing model predicted to field observed spatial distributions see attempts by huse et al 2004 ecospace uses a spatial grid which may be adapted to the spatial resolution of field sampling to ease comparison of modelled and observed data there are few studies in which ecospace modelled distributions are compared directly to field observed distributions though see coll et al 2019 and romagnoni et al 2015 this work aimed to understand the effect of climate change on the spatial distributions of high latitude marine biota to do so we developed an ecospace model for the barents sea ecosystem from an already published ewe model pedersen et al 2021 its performances were assessed based on the evaluation of its capacity to reproduce field observed spatial distributions of the different fgs under two different climatic scenarios corresponding to a warm year 2013 and a relatively colder one 2004 then the impact of warming was assessed through the measure of the shift in fgs distributions between the two years 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and

at the expense of arctic species fossheim et al 2015 the modelling design uses ecopath included data input from field surveys and literature and is summarised in fig 2 2 2 ecosystem survey the joint ecosystem survey run by the institute of marine research imr and polar research institute of marine fisheries and oceanography pinro eriksen et al 2018 prozorkevich et al 2020 aims to monitor the status of abiotic and biotic factors and changes in these in the barents sea ecosystem it was initiated in 2004 and conducted annually in the autumn until the present day gathering a considerable amount of data about the barents sea ecosystem data for species distribution used in this study came from the campelen 1800 bottom trawl 22 mm mesh size at cod end which captures demersal and bathypelagic species as well as epibenthic megafauna as bycatch at a towing speed of approximately 3 knots only stations from 50 to 500 m depth towed between 15 and 60 min were kept so as to ensure a homogeneous sampling of the offshore barents sea ecosystem an average of 278 stations are sampled yearly in a grid design of 64 8 km mesh size covering south and west of svalbard to franz joseph land and novaya zemlya during the surveys the catch per unit effort cpue is calculated for each taxon and station by standardising species biomass by unit sampling area 2 3 ecospace and ecopath with ecosim base model the model is based on an ecopath with ecosim calibrated model pedersen et al 2021 representing the ecosystem of the barents sea lme in the year 2000 the model comprises 108 fgs representing mainly boreal and arctic species for more details see pedersen et al 2021 the ecosim model has been fitted calibrated to a time series for the period 1950 1996 to estimate predator prey vulnerabilities pedersen et al 2021 and these vulnerabilities have been carried over to the ecospace model the ecopath and ecosim model described in pedersen et al 2021 showed that the basic ecosystem structure was preserved during the periods of overexploitation between 1970 and 1990 and during the recovery after 1990 this resilience is expected to be reflected in the stability of fgs spatial distributions modelled by ecospace another important aspect highlighted by pedersen et al s 2021 model is the increase in productivity at lower trophic levels during warm years leading to higher productivity for most high trophic level fgs which is likely to impact the fgs spatial distributions the ecospace model applies a two dimensional grid basemap the basemap identifies the spatial bounds and grid dimensions and includes the modelled area s environmental characteristics defined habitats and fg environmental limits christensen et al 2014 2008 based on the temporal equations ecospace models the biomass of each fg within each cell in the grid over time by considering trophic interactions fishing and species movement christensen et al 2008 walters et al 1999 the habitat foraging capacity concept included in ecospace aims to increase the model s realism making the food web interact effectively and spatiotemporally with the environmental variability christensen et al 2014 the model ran with monthly time steps and the simulation time was set to 20 years to define the ecospace maps we used the same projection as the joint ecosystem survey with a cell grid of square cells of 64 8 km in length and width the spatial environmental drivers i e a value of the driver for each grid cell included depth bottom and surface temperature days of ice coverage the distance off the coast buhl mortensen et al 2015 lien et al 2013 and primary production reigstad et al 2011 we constructed this model using the ecopath with ecosim and ecospace software version 6 6 6 christensen et al 2008 the model allocated the biomasses of the fgs dynamically across a two dimensional grid map with 32 cells in the longitudinal direction and 28 cells in the latitudinal direction giving a total of 486 active cells fig 3 the model calculated the fgs biomass spatial distributions based on fgs habitat foraging capacities predation regimes dispersal rates and the spatially resolved environmental input christensen et al 2014 walters et al 1999 the dispersal rate parameters needed in ecospace are the average annual movement distances of random movement of the fgs across the ecosystem christensen et al 2008 for this model we specified seven different dispersal rate values representing the mobility of various fgs based on their movement patterns the choices of values for each dispersal rate were based on previous studies mackinson and daskalov 2007 püts et al 2020 romagnoni et al 2015 as were the characteristics of all organisms in each fg and the environmental condition of the barents sea lme we set 1000 km year 1 for fast top predators and highly migratory mammals and birds 600 km year 1 for pelagic and migratory demersal fgs 300 km year 1 for faster moving demersal fishes fgs and pelagic advected fgs 200 km year 1 for snow crabs and coastal cod 100 km year 1 for red king crab which is a mobile crab 30 km year 1 for benthic invertebrates and detritus fgs and 10 km year 1 for offal appendix a 2 4 derivation of habitat capacity functions the ecopath model is run based on a system of linear equations describing the average mass and energy flows between all fgs during a period of time christensen and pauly 1992 in the temporal dynamic framework of ecopath ecosim simulates the ecosystem effects of changes in mortality and environmental forces christensen and walters 2004 the consumption rates are calculated based on the foraging arena concept where biomasses are divided into vulnerable and invulnerable components ahrens et al 2012 the ecospace time spatial model works based on the ecosim set of equations predicting the biomass dynamics in the two dimensional grid map walters et al 1999 each active cell can contain one or more habitat type and environmental driver such as water temperature and bottom depth these habitat types can affect the computed foraging capacity of the fgs implemented via separate environmental preference functions for each environmental parameter calculated for each cell this procedure allows more variation amongst the cells to distribute the fgs over the map where they are most likely to occur christensen et al 2014 the habitat foraging capacity is based on the foraging arena theory ahrens et al 2012 the computed habitat foraging capacity is calculated from fgs affinity for given habitats and functional responses to environmental conditions based on the habitat layers in the basemap each habitat type gets a proportion assigned according to how suitable it is for a certain fg christensen et al 2014 environmental capacity is based on environmental driver maps it enables the model to drive the fgs foraging capacity from the cumulative effects of multiple physical oceanographic environmental and topographic conditions spatially and runs in conjunction with the food web and fisheries dynamics coll et al 2019 we used two approaches to derive habitat capacity functions i the quantile generalised additive model qgam approach for fgs with sufficient survey data from the ecosystem survey with data from 2004 to 2019 and ii literature information on environmental preferences for the habitat capacity based on data from the ecosystem survey we calculated one qgam husson et al 2020 per species habitat variable couple using the qgam package in r fasiolo et al 2017 the qgam is a generalised additive model gam for which the fitted target is a chosen quantile rather than the mean when fitting the 99th quantile we thus estimated the maximum possible biomass for each fg in response to each environmental variable this amounted to calculating a potential niche for each fg cade et al 2005 we used the same methodology as husson et al 2020 the number of degrees of freedom in the qgams was limited to three in order to avoid complex regressions without ecological rationality to evaluate the predictive power of each qgam model all results were fitted using a training dataset consisting of observations for the years 2004 to 2013 they were then evaluated on the testing dataset which included observations for the years 2014 2019 to extract distribution parameters to be used as habitat foraging capacities for each fg in ecospace we fitted alternative classical continuous distribution curves logistic beta log normal exponential and normal using the fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 logspline charles et al 2002 betareg cribari neto and zeileis 2010 and extradistr wolodzko 2019 packages in r on each qgam species environment model in addition we estimated binormal distributions which is one of the possible shapes of habitat capacity function in ecospace it comprises two half normal distribution functions specified by three parameters the mean the left and the right standard deviation halves of normal distributions the left half distribution fits the data below the mean and the right half distribution fits the distribution above the mean the binormal distribution can approximate various function shapes ranging from ordinary normal distribution to sigmoid shaped relationships we adjusted functional relationships between habitat capacity and temperature and depth for some groups based on qgam results to follow the observed distribution fig 4 appendix b habitat capacity functions varied widely between fgs depending on the relationship between the fgs and the environmental drivers fig 4 most habitat capacity functions were entered as binormal distributions for more details see appendices b and c however the ice coverage functions were entered as right shoulder function when the fg was more dependant on the ice and left shoulder when the fg was assumed to avoid the ice a beta function was used for ice coverage for crangonid shrimp the distance off the coast was entered as an exponential function with decreasing habitat capacity with increased distance from the coast to derive literature based habitat capacity relationships for the fgs that were not well represented in the ecosystem survey results we also included habitat capacities derived from published studies on spatial distributions as well as environmental preferences and tolerances the ecosystem survey is conducted in autumn the warmest months of the year and therefore the survey does not cover the entire niche of the species we included habitat capacity for 74 fgs with 29 fgs using habitat capacities based on qgam estimations and 45 fgs using habitat capacities based on literature and personal observations for more details see appendix c the foraging capacity of fgs that were dominant in terms of biomass at its trophic levels were included sequentially one by one followed by a comparison of the observed and modelled distributions of all fgs this process was repeated until all fgs including those with no habitat capacity had a modelled distribution similar to the observed by including as few as possible habitat capacities so as to avoid overfitting the model the qgam calculations for 28 fgs mainly commercial fishes caught by bottom trawl indicate that depth bottom and surface temperature and ice coverage can be good predictors for the distribution of most evaluated fgs fig 4 shows an example of habitat capacities included in ecospace as foraging capacity fig 4 a shows the temperature capacity for arctic polar cod arctic boreal northeast arctic cod and boreal blue whiting fgs fig 4 b shows the depth capacity for shallow large bivalves intermediate pelagic amphipods and deep sperm whale fgs 2 5 scenario set ups for cold and warm years the year 1990 marked the beginning of the most recent warm period in the barents sea region trofimov et al 2019 in the mid 2000s the warming condition amplified schlichtholz 2019 the species and fgs are expected to be affected by these environmental changes and we expected that this model would be able to perform the calculations however to evaluate whether our model could represent the natural variability of the environmental conditions in the barents sea and fgs during the warming conditions of the past two decades we specified two scenarios in ecospace one represented a warm and another a less warm or cold year within the warm period with differences in water temperature and ice coverage between the scenarios described below within the warm period from the beginning of the ecosystem survey onwards the coldest year in the kola section fig 5 water column temperature time series was 2011 and the warmest was 2012 fig 5 gonzález pola et al 2020 however in order to validate the model data from field observations were necessary and the years that combined the best observed data the most extensive geographic coverage and adequate environmental conditions were the cold 2004 and warm 2013 spatial environmental information for this model was taken from the nordic seas 4 km numerical ocean model hindcast svim archive a numerical ocean model hindcast that simulates the nordic and barents seas at a spatial resolution of 4 km lien et al 2013 this model was developed from 1960 to 2011 and represents the barents sea s physical environment well lien et al 2013 however it is annually updated and validated by observed data and provides continuous information about these areas environmental conditions according to the svim archive the average annual surface temperature for the barents sea in 2013 was 0 57 c warmer than in 2004 and the average bottom temperature in 2013 was 0 27 c higher than in 2004 appendix d table d1 we constructed two temperature scenarios one for the relatively cold 2004 fig 3 and another for the warm 2013 year based on svim archive in ecospace functional groups can move to the four adjacent cells through random directional movements mediated by habitat preferences and responses of organisms to depredation risk and feeding conditions christensen et al 2014 in order to define the fg habitat preferences it is necessary to include basemaps that can embrace many environmental aspects the present study included depth bottom temperature surface temperature ice coverage the distance off the coast and sediment type gravel sand and mud pebbles and rocky bottom appendix e the scenarios were constructed based on the annual average values of each cell in the maps for the bottom and surface water temperature and ice coverage the average minimum and maximum values of the scenario basemaps can be seen in appendix d table d1 for phytoplankton primary production we digitised maps based on reigstad et al 2011 for the relatively cold 1998 and warm 2006 years for the distance off the coast basemap we built a map defining the ranges of distances 64 8 km 129 6 km 194 4 km 259 2 km 324 km and 388 8 km from the coast which are the distances of the cells in the grid from the closest to the coast to the more distant in addition to the environmental drivers habitats may be specified in ecospace assets of water cells sharing certain features affecting the movements feeding rate and survival of the ecopath model components occurring therein christensen et al 2008 all habitat maps for the substrate category were derived from mareano the sea in maps and pictures buhl mortensen et al 2015 the mareano seabed map for substrate grain size has a higher resolution than our model grid and we classified it into four discrete categories gravel sand and mud pebbles and rocky bottom appendix e 2 6 comparison of modelled and survey based spatial distributions to evaluate the performance of the ecospace model for the barents sea we compared the modelled and survey observed distributions for a total of 35 fgs with good spatial distribution data available for warm and cold years encompassing the whole lme barents sea appendix f two major sources for spatial distributions were used for 28 fgs we obtained observed spatial distributions of biomass from the ecosystem survey for 2004 cold and 2013 warm for fgs n 7 with spatial data from the ecosystem survey in 2013 but with no information for 2004 we used information from 2010 to represent a colder year than 2013 we also digitised distributions for 20 fgs from published papers appendix d table d2 to the same projection we used for the ecospace basemap projection aea datum based on hayford 1909 and unit m to convert the published distributions of original maps to raster maps at the same projection and scale as the ecospace basemap we used an image of the original map in gif format using the open source quantum geographic information system qgis and its raster tool georeferencer we adjusted the figure with the projection used in the ecospace basemap we transferred the values from the tiff image with a grid generated by the qgis to a raster file with basemap dimensions and then plotted it using r rstudio 2021 see the digitalised maps in appendix e to evaluate the uncertainty in the resulting spatial grid matrices we allocated the spatial distributions into uncertainty categories according to the origin and quality of the spatial distribution data using a score ranging from 1 lowest uncertainty to 5 highest uncertainty table 1 and appendix f to compare the observed distributions from warm and cold years with the modelled distributions for 2004 and 2013 produced by the ecospace model we calculated the centre of gravity and inertia for each fg centre of gravity cg is the mean geographical location of the biomass distribution of the fg and inertia is the spread variance of the distribution of the observed and modelled distributions woillez et al 2007 2009 to evaluate how the fgs spatial distribution overlapped we calculated the global index of collocation gic the gic was calculated by comparing the distance between the cgs of a pair of fgs and their respective inertias woillez et al 2007 2009 the gic ranges from 0 when each distribution is concentrated in a single and different location to 1 when the cgs of the two distributions coincide to evaluate how distant the observed spatial distributions are from the modelled distributions we calculated the distance in km between the observed and the modelled centre of gravities for fgs based on the pythagorean theorem the angular deviation between observed and modelled distributions cgs was calculated using the arctangent of the observed and modelled cg difference it was then converted to degrees on a 360 scale azimuth the same procedure was repeated to analyse the differences in fgs distribution between cold and warm years to assess the main direction of spatial shifts a clockwise circle centred on the modelled cgs was split into four equal quadrants northeastern between 0 and 90 southeastern between 90 and 180 southwestern between 180 and 270 and northwestern between 270 and 360 frequencies of fgs within each quadrant were compared and this compartmentation allowed us to define the main direction of dislocation between modelled and the observed survey based distribution here we set the results as the azimuth an angle between 0 and 360 measured clockwise from the north and bearing that is an angle lower than 90 within a quadrant defined by the cardinal directions to evaluate the main shift of cgs from the cold year to the warm year we calculated the average directional shift of all modelled and observed cgs chi square tests were applied on contingency table data to test if frequencies of directions of cg differed between north and south east and west or between quadrants and a significance level of α 0 05 was applied zar 1998 the kruskal wallis kw test was used to test if distributions of a variable were equal in more than two groups to evaluate if the habitat overlap patterns of predators and prey in the modelled and observed distributions were similar we calculated the gic of all 35 predators fgs and their primary prey fgs with available distributions for cold and warm years the shift rate km year 1 between the cg position from cold to warm years was calculated by dividing the distance between the cg position from cold to warm year by the time interval in years 2 7 evaluation of changes in the barents sea community distribution in the past decade due to warming conditions to evaluate changes in the modelled barents sea biological community due to the observed warming conditions over the past two decades we calculated the average cg position of all modelled fgs in the cold 2004 and warm 2013 years and compared the distance and the bearing between them as described above we then divided the distance from the 2004 to 2013 average cg position by the time interval and the difference in the water temperature bottom and surface from these two years to find the shift rate 2 8 thermal responses and distribution area for each fg we applied aquamaps kaschner et al 2019 parameter of surface temperature and used the 10th quantile as the minimum and 90th quantile at maximum of the trapezoid function as a measure of width of the thermal response this width is expected to be small for stenothermal species with narrow thermal tolerances and large for eurythermal species that have broad thermal flexibility pörtner and gutt 2016 we allocated fgs to biogeographical categories with arctic species as those with a maximum limit 90th of 8 c and the lower limit below 0 c arctic boreal were the species with the minimum 10th around 0 c the maximum 90th around 10 c and the absolute maximum up to 12 c boreal were species with the minimum 10th higher than 4 c and maximum 90th lower than 14 c and broad were the species with the range between the minimum 10th and maximum 90th embracing the arctic and boreal limits and beyond to represent the area of the fgs distribution we calculated the inertia area then divided the inertia of the modelled fgs warm year by the cold year and observed if the area increased decreased or remained stable then we compared the inertia area of all modelled fgs using the paired wilcoxon test comparing cold 2004 and warm 2013 year scenarios to compare the variation of the modelled area amongst the four biogeographical groups and the three thermoplasticity groups from the cold 2004 and the warm 2013 year we calculated the average difference of the inertia area by group and then compared them using the kw test 3 results 3 1 comparison of modelled and observed distributions within cold and warm years the fgs distributions generated by the ecospace model in cold and warm years were generally similar to the available observed distributions modelled and observed centres of gravity and inertia of fgs had similar values for most groups table 2 and appendix g generally the modelled distributions of fgs showed high spatial overlap with the observed distributions with the average values for the global index of collocation gic between modelled and observed distributions of 0 89 in cold and 0 88 in warm

model for the barents sea at the food web level comprising fgs at all trophic levels and with the same spatial resolution as the survey field observed spatial distributions our study shows that the ecospace modelled and observed spatial distributions can easily be compared and evaluated by using cg and inertia it is known that the species distributions in the barents sea are strongly related to the environmental conditions aune et al 2021 dalpadado et al 2003 loeng 1989b nakken and raknes 1987 the ability to predict these distributions in the context of environmental changes and differential natural resource usage can be very beneficial for resource management and species conservation the ecospace model includes multiple spatial drivers that are coupled to the foraging capacity of fgs this enable ecospace to simulate spatial responses to multiple physical oceanographic and environmental drivers christensen et al 2014 coll et al 2019 and contribute to a good representation of the fgs distribution with a high overlap between the observed and modelled distribution during the process of individual inclusion of the habitat capacities and comparison with the survey observed distribution we observed that depth bottom and surface temperatures were crucial to model the species distributions in the barents sea ecospace model this is in line with other studies that identified these environmental drivers as good predictors of species distributions in the barents sea husson et al 2020 as well in other marine ecosystems burgos et al 2020 coll et al 2019 the use of the habitat foraging capacity functions and contrasting warm and relatively colder years allowed us to observe the relevance of the inclusion of temperature depth ice and productivity as forcings to predictive models as they proved to be essential to describe the changes observed between cold and warm years in the barents sea lme the use of habitat capacities based on the qgam method for barents sea data improved the fit of the model to observed distributions however information from literature e g aquamaps fishbase and sealifebase similar to what we used for species with no local information for habitat capacity has been used exclusively or as complementary to distribution descriptor tools in many studies e g adebola and de mutsert 2019 coll et al 2019 2020 coll et al 2019 argued that the modelling tools used to describe species distributions such as qgam can be complemented by either using the response functions derived from statistical analysis in the ecopath calculations or by forcing the niche priors of ecospace foraging capacity directly with the results from the statistical model using the foraging habitat capacity is crucial for more reliable results as we were able to confirm in our model ecospace is a dynamic model that includes predator prey interactions and in our study the use of habitat capacity functions to force distributions leds to more realistic spatial distributions for some fgs that lacked habitat capacities when there was no information available locally e g based on field data for the ecospace model area sources such as fishbase and sealifebase were useful to derive habitat foraging capacity functions trophic models always carry some uncertainties generalisations and different levels of accuracy in the data and the fg in a model as large as the present ecospace model some fgs consist of several species while others represent single species see appendix f however we argue that the model can effectively predict the spatial distributions for all evaluated fgs the fgs with assumed high uncertainty in field sampled distributions were expected to overlap less with the model output than the fgs with assumed low uncertainty this can be observed with greenland halibut fgs categorised as having a high uncertainty of sampling score 4 according to the ecosystem survey report anon 2004 large greenland halibut distribution was primarily outside of the survey area in the ecosystem survey in 2004 this could affect both the small and large greenland halibut observed distribution the same report discusses how adult greenland halibut s main concentrations were in the deeper part of the spitsbergen slope and southeast of a line drawn between bear island and hopen island anon 2004 close to where our model shows the centre of gravity of this species distribution it suggests that despite the lower overlap index value for this species our model may represent the distribution close to the expected natural distribution of this species in the warm year 2013 the observed and modelled distributions of both fgs of greenland halibut overlapped more than in the cold year 2004 this could reflect the enlargement of the sampled area northeast of the original area in 2013 prokhorova 2013 none of the ecosystem surveys covered the extreme northeastern part of the study area eriksen 2014 thus because of incomplete coverage in this area the spatial distributions for some fgs from the ecosystem survey could show more southerly distributions than the real distributions the barents sea is deepest in the southwest where the bottom water is warmest loeng and drinkwater 2007 thus a northward change in the distribution of a species will also affect its depth distribution affecting predator prey relationships and potentially affecting predation mortalities and competition effects fall et al 2018 the generally higher overlap for modelled than observed predator prey may result from the inability of the model to incorporate all the complexity of the natural systems in which fgs can make new and unexpected connections in response to restrictions or lack of resources that the model cannot predict 4 2 changes in modelled and observed distributions between cold and warm years that the observed distributions were positioned more northerly in warm than in cold years was expected for high latitude species in warmer conditions eriksen et al 2017 fossheim et al 2015 frainer et al 2017 poloczanska et al 2016 skaret et al 2014 the model outputs showed a similar northeastward shift from the cold to the warm scenario indicating that our model may be a good predictor tool for the effects of warming on spatial distribution changes of functional groups in the barents sea ecosystem this distribution shift was expected and is in line with other model predictions of changes in species distributions due to global warming showing boreal and arctic species moving their distributions poleward albeit in different ways christiansen et al 2014 fossheim et al 2015 frainer et al 2017 hollowed et al 2013 perry et al 2005 poloczanska et al 2016 pörtner and gutt 2016 the similar average cg position of the modelled and the observed fgs distributions in cold and warm years indicates a similar average distribution pattern in the modelled and observed data the poleward shifts from the cold to warm years in average cg were similar for the modelled 41 km and observed 68 km data and could indicate a similar average response to change in temperature in modelled and observed distributions however some fgs have shown different bearings in the shift between cold and warm years though most displacements were in similar directions to what was observed by field surveys thus we can affirm that our model can effectively and spatially represent the barents sea ecosystem and its past changes due to environmental changes 4 3 effects of warming on distribution of the whole community most 80 of the 104 living fgs of the model shifted distribution poleward in the warm scenario the other groups e g coastal cod saithe and other small gadoids mostly shifted distribution southeastward which may to some extent also be a result of a search for colder conditions this is because the southeastern part of the barents sea lme is colder than the western part mainly due to the contact with the white and kara seas known for being cold seas kohnemann et al 2017 we included distance off the coast as habitat capacity for some fgs that shifted distribution towards the southeast and this restricted the fgs from moving to colder conditions in the northern barents sea forcing these fgs to move to cold conditions in the southeastern barents sea some boreal species associated with the warmer atlantic water such as mackerel atlantic puffin and blue whiting shifted their distribution towards the southwest in these cases when evaluating their natural distributions anker nilssen et al 2000 belikov et al 2011 olafsdottir et al 2019 this shift direction means that they are expanding into the barents sea probably already due to the atlantification of the barents sea with the warming conditions of the past few decades the rate of poleward shift based on average cgs of all the modelled fgs in our study was 4 4 km year 1 between the 2004 and 2013 scenarios this community shift rate seems to be higher than most poleward shifts of organisms due to warming reported in other studies in the north sea six demersal fish species moved north boundaries of the distribution at a rate of 2 2 km year 1 in warmer conditions perry et al 2005 in iceland s coastal waters 82 fish species showed distribution shifts at a mean rate of 0 014 latitude year 1 55 km year 1 most of them poleward during 22 years with warming conditions campana et al 2020 the shift rate of the centre of distribution produced by our model seems to be similar to rates observed in other subpolar and boreal areas in our study the community as a whole shifted on average 67 km c 1 poleward based on the surface temperature although based on the bottom temperature the community as a whole shifted 133 km c 1 poleward campana et al 2020 observed an average shift of 38 km c 1 in the fish community distribution in icelandic waters based on average water column temperature in the north sea dulvy et al 2008 observed a poleward shift of demersal fish species at a rate that ranged between 10 and 70 km c 1 based on temperature from the lower half of the water column and perry et al 2005 observed an average distribution shift of 164 km c 1 for 15 demersal fishes based on bottom temperature the measures for water temperature may be critical for the value of shift rate because surface waters are more susceptible to rises in air temperature while deeper waters are more thermally stable manabe et al 1990 thus the shift rate based on bottom temperature tends to be higher than based on surface or the whole water column temperature our study shows results similar to those which perry et al 2005 found in the north sea the shift rate in our study was based on the average cg position for the whole community including benthic and pelagic species and steno and eurythermal species the rate can vary depending on the fg and their particularities and here our point is to present an overview of the community pattern in the barents sea 4 4 thermal responses to warming boreal and arctic species in the barents sea differ markedly regarding resource use and habitat affinities and how environmental changes impact their distribution and the community as a whole frainer et al 2017 many authors have argued that boreal species have tended to move or increase their distributions poleward during the period of recent warming fossheim et al 2015 perry et al 2005 poloczanska et al 2016 in contrast arctic species have been observed to reduce the area of their distributions by being restricted to high latitudes searching for polar conditions christiansen et al 2014 fossheim et al 2015 frainer et al 2017 hollowed et al 2013 pörtner and gutt 2016 in our study a few fgs reduced their modelled distribution areas under warmer conditions on average even the stenothermal arctic and arctic boreal fgs more frequently increased than reduced distribution areas in warmer conditions campana et al 2020 argued that in iceland the stenothermal species with a distribution close to their thermal limits were the most likely to change their distribution the increase in the water temperature observed in the barents sea in the period of the present study was probably too small to force the water temperature close to the thermal limit of any stenothermal species in the barents sea this may be one possible explanation for the overall increase in the distribution area in warmer conditions in our study 4 5 limitations of the study some of the observed distributions were not from 2004 which represented a cold year or from 2013 which represented a warm year but were from other years with different environmental conditions that may have contributed to less accurate results it is evident that once we were not constantly comparing the same years and consequently not the same environmental conditions we could not include all relevant environmental and physiological possible variables thus we did not expect a complete distribution overlap between observed and modelled functional groups however the generally high spatial overlap between observed and modelled distribution indicates the good representativity of our model even though the barents sea ecospace model has some limitations it seems to effectively model the spatial distributions of fgs in the barents sea lme well 5 conclusions the ecospace model of the barents sea lme simulated similar spatial distributions of fgs as did the survey based observed distributions in cold and warm years most fgs shifted their modelled and observed distributions poleward under warmer conditions the poleward shifts in the average centre of gravity for the 35 fgs with observational data was 41 km for modelled and 68 km for observed distributions the whole modelled community shifted 40 km towards the northeast poleward from the relatively cold 2004 to the warm 2013 corresponding to a shift rate of 67 km c 1 surface temperature and 133 km c 1 bottom temperature the warming conditions led to an average increase of 4 in the modelled fgs distribution area measured as inertia area the ecopspace model for the barents sea can be used to predict future changes in spatial distributions under warming scenarios we are now using the model applying different climatic scenarios and spatio temporal predictions to answer questions regarding the impacts of fishery and global changes on future mid and long term scenarios credit authorship contribution statement marcela c nascimento conceptualization data curation formal analysis writing original draft

24199,fragmented natural habitats such as old growth forests have been often considered island like systems however whereas the isolation of real islands is mostly a function of their spatial arrangement the biodiversity of old growth forest patches is also affected by how well the surrounding suboptimal habitats such as younger forests can support the functional connectivity between the old forest fragments the latter topic remains largely unclear due to the lack of mechanistic knowledge about the processes behind species affinity for old forest although in animal ecology functional connectivity has often been investigated with mechanistic agent based models these have rarely been applied for passively dispersing organism groups we used a pattern oriented modeling approach by combining a spatially explicit agent based model and an empirical biodiversity dataset of estonian old growth nemoral forest sites to study how forests of different ages between the old forest fragments are exploited by different passively or slowly dispersing functional groups we found that the establishment of ground layer vegetation epiphytes ectomycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi is significantly restricted in the younger forests whereas no clear difference between forest age classes emerged for survival our results thus suggest that establishment not survival is the main process behind the species affinity for old forest concurring with studies that have demonstrated the importance of suitable microhabitat availability in older forests we conclude that young secondary forests do not support the connectivity and consequently biodiversity of many old forest specific groups graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords agent based model mechanistic model functional connectivity landscape connectivity old forest affinity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction old growth undisturbed forests have declined in area worldwide are strongly fragmented and often surrounded by anthropogenic landscape riitters et al 2000 fragmented natural habitats like this have been referred to as island like systems in the non habitat landscape matrix haila 2002 therefore dynamic theory of island biogeography macarthur and wilson 1967 first established on oceanic islands was also quickly adopted by landscape ecology however there is a crucial difference between real islands and habitat patches species inhabiting real islands are considered to have zero probability of survival in the ocean but this binary habitat nonhabitat classification which is used by both island biogeography and classical metapopulation models is often insufficient in the context of forest fragments old forests are often surrounded by a variety of habitats including secondary or managed forests but it is unknown how well the connectivity and biodiversity of old forest fragments is supported by these suboptimal habitats of the surrounding landscape here we use modeling to obtain a mechanistic understanding of how the biodiversity of various functional groups in old growth patches is linked to heterogeneous surroundings life in forest fragments in contrast to oceanic islands depends greatly on the matrix surrounding the forest patches in its heterogeneity kupfer et al 2006 over the past decades the view on fragmented habitats has shifted towards connectivity as an overall landscape characteristic landscape connectivity is an important driver of biodiversity taylor et al 1993 as the small isolated populations are more prone to random extinction whereas high connectivity leads to higher immigration rates and consequently to higher species richness taylor et al 1993 rosenberg et al 1997 low connectivity between forest fragments has been shown by many studies to have a negative impact on biodiversity e g honnay et al 2002 douda 2010 sonnier et al 2014 brunet et al 2021 at the same time the importance of suboptimal habitats of the landscape has been also demonstrated by several empirical works for example lõhmus and lõhmus 2019 showed that estonian production forests with biodiversity friendly silviculture hosted a majority of all recorded lichen species among all management stages including old growth forest madžule et al 2012 demonstrated in latvia that non intensively managed forests helped to maintain the connectivity between natural forests for the epiphytes and mikusiński et al 2021 showed that boreal forests in sweden that have not been clear felled for a century complemented the habitat network of less demanding species in animal ecology functional connectivity is often used to account for matrix properties while structural connectivity describes the spatial arrangement of the patches functional connectivity describes how successfully organisms or genes move among the patches tischendorf and fahrig 2000 for more slowly dispersing taxa such as plants fungi or insects it may be necessary to establish a population in the matrix and thus old forest functional connectivity depends on how successful they are not only in crossing but also in establishing and surviving in the landscape between forest patches estonian forests consist of fragments of old stable forest surrounded by areas of younger secondary forest of the same type as well as non forest and anthropogenic habitats two prevailing forest types occur in estonia boreal and nemoral forests nemoral forests characterized by broad leaved deciduous trees grow on neutral to alkaline nutrient rich soils in southern sweden and east of the baltic sea metzger et al 2005 nemoral forests are the most species rich forests of the region making them especially valuable in terms of conservation their species composition differs significantly from boreal forests and they have a significantly higher richness of woody plants and ground layer plants as well as ectomycorrhizal ecm and pathogenic fungi and epiphytes jüriado et al 2003 noreika et al 2019 secondary forests of the same type which in estonia have mainly developed on abandoned agricultural land as a result of socioeconomic changes may be considered as semi suitable matrix or low quality habitats either way their role in supporting biodiversity in their neighboring old forest patches remains unclear forest age has often been associated with habitat quality with older forests demonstrating higher species richness reviewed by nordén et al 2014 but how a forest s age can be translated into its ability to support temporary populations and connectivity between neighboring old forest fragments is less clear that is in part due to the lack of mechanistic knowledge of which process restricts old forest species from exploiting the younger forests several authors have looked for the direct effect of temporal habitat continuity resulting from the slow colonization rates of old forest specific species reviewed by nordén et al 2014 in the case of reforestation of former agricultural land this effect may be especially pronounced as the forest species may not be locally available randlane et al 2017 have shown that bryophyte and lichen diversity in estonian aspen plantations positively correlated to the proximity of historical forest demonstrating the role of dispersal limitation however often the effect of habitat continuity per se is found to be confounded or prevailed by the effect of abundant microhabitats in older forests nordén and appelqvist 2001 runnel and lõhmus 2017 a structurally diverse old forest habitat offers several microhabitats for different species thus favoring establishment as well as protects them from hostile environmental conditions thus inhibiting the extinction of local populations whether establishment or survival is a prevailingly limiting process behind the affinity for older forests is not well known for any old forest specific groups a mechanistic understanding of species affinity for old forest and its effect on forest connectivity may be hard to achieve in field studies as the processes behind patterns are often inseparable here implementing agent based simulations can be beneficial agent based models are a mechanistic bottom up approach which enable us to understand how broad scale ecological patterns emerge from the processes acting at the level of individual organisms or populations and their environment grimm et al 2005 the pattern oriented approach which focuses on reproducing observed patterns of nature has been proposed for agent based modeling grimm et al 2005 pattern oriented agent based models are a useful tool in cases where the processes behind large scale biodiversity patterns are of interest wiegand et al 2003 and are useful for comparing alternative scenarios baguette and van dyck 2007 simpkins et al 2018 day et al 2020 agent based simulations have been extensively used in population and conservation ecology deangelis and mooij 2005 and several agent based models have been used to study forest connectivity but these have mostly considered active animal movements behavior and habitat selection e g revilla et al 2004 hauenstein et al 2019 trapp et al 2019 day et al 2020 zeller et al 2020 rohwäder and jeltsch 2022 the response of passively dispersing species groups to forest fragmentation has mostly been studied using the methods of statistical and species distribution modeling e g sonnier et al 2014 löbel et al 2018 brunet et al 2021 some recent agent based fragmentation simulations have used the virtual or generic species approach where key species characteristics rather than the exact identity are of interest chetcuti et al 2020 bocedi et al 2021 but these studies mostly consider active movement passive dispersal has recently been included by rybicki et al 2020 in a simulation study testing the habitat amount hypothesis there is no reason why passive dispersal could not be studied with agent based models and due to their clearly mechanistic stochastic and spatially explicit nature they are a useful tool for gaining better understanding of forest functional connectivity using a spatially explicit agent based model and an empirical dataset from nemoral forest sites in estonia we mechanistically evaluated how different aged forests as suboptimal habitats support the functional connectivity establishment and survival and consequently the biodiversity of old growth forest patches we specifically looked at passively or slowly dispersing functional groups that are important in shaping forest habitat structure ground layer vegetation epiphytes woody plants ecm and arbuscular mycorrhizal am fungi pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi carabid beetles by comparing simulation scenarios we looked for establishment and survival values that would result in the strongest correlations between the simulated and observed species richness we asked which functional biodiversity groups fit our model in general if different aged forests vary in their ability to support functional connectivity establishment and survival of old forest specific biodiversity whether species affinity for old forest results mainly from the establishment or survival process whether functional biodiversity groups differ in their ability to establish and survive in different aged forests between old forest fragments 2 materials and methods we simulated the immigration dispersal establishment and survival of subpopulations of virtual species in a 5 km radius circle around old growth nemoral forest study sites using empirical landscapes we then compared the simulated species richness of virtual species in the old growth forest sites with the observed species richness of different functional groups to find which establishment and survival values altogether functional connectivity result in the values that are best correlated to the empirical data we used the following functional groups ground layer incl herbaceous plants ground bryophytes and lichens epiphytes incl bryophytes and lichens woody plants trees and shrubs ecm and am fungi pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi carabid beetles we did not parameterize the model separately for each functional group but correlated the simulated species richness of the virtual species to the observed species richness of each group to find parameter values that best fit each group pattern oriented approach 2 1 forest sites and observed data we used empirical biodiversity and environmental data from 32 nemoral forest sites in southern estonia located in mature undisturbed forests in protected areas while the forest in the surrounding landscape differed in its age amount and configuration fig a 1 in appendix a more specific fieldwork and lab work details except the carabid beetle sampling are available in noreika et al 2019 here only a brief description is given fieldwork was conducted in the vegetation periods of 2016 and 2017 all herbaceous vascular plants terricolous and epiphytic bryophytes carabid beetle and lichen species were recorded within a 10 10 m plot at each site the areas including all possible substrates for epiphytes were thoroughly examined fungal diversity was determined from collected soil samples using dna analyses carabid beetles were collected with three plastic pitfall traps per plot dug in at the same level as the soil surface and covered with wooden lids placed at 2 m distance from one another as an even sided triangle traps were visited once a month from april to september 2017 altogether five times the wood volume of tree trunks was estimated by including all trees with 5 cm in diameter at 1 3 m height and using an allometric biomass equation vaus 2005 soil chemistry was analyzed at the laboratory of plant biochemistry estonian university of life sciences tartu estonia standardized measure of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium content npk was calculated by logit transforming scaling and averaging respective nutrient contents mean annual temperature and annual precipitation data were acquired from chelsa high resolution climate data karger et al 2017 2 2 forest maps empirical landscapes surrounding the old growth forest study sites were represented as raster maps in the simulations simulation maps were generated based on four mappings of forested land from the 1900s 1940s 1970s and 2010s first historical maps were digitalized at a resolution of 100 100 m and each new cell which contained at least some forested land was classified as forest then the maps were compared with each other areas that were classified as forested land only on the map of the 2010s were defined as youngest forests age1 forested land that was present on the maps of the 2010s and 1970s age2 2010s and 1940s age3 2010s and 1900s age4 as the species pools differ drastically between the nemoral and boreal forests as demonstrated by noreika et al 2019 we decided to exclude the forest cells from the surrounding landscape that lay on soils that are typical only to boreal forests fisher exact tests based on 100 nemoral and boreal forest sites identified that only podzol soil type kmoch et al 2021 should be omitted which reduced the forest cells by only a small amount 2 3 simulation model 2 3 1 general overview of the simulation by modifying the agent based simulation model developed by jõks and pärtel 2019 written in the r programming language r core team 2019 we simulated the immigration dispersal establishment and survival of subpopulations of virtual species in the empirical landscapes surrounding the old growth forest study sites the operating agent of our simulation was a subpopulation of a virtual species simulating subpopulations of one species at one site at a time we run the simulation for 1000 times for each forest site and for each scenario one simulation ran for 100 time steps and the presence or absence of the subpopulation in the 100 100 m central study site mature forest was recorded for the 10 last time steps we were only interested if the central study cell was inhabited or not and did not record it for the surrounding cells finally to find simulated species richness we added together the results of the 1000 single species simulation runs a more detailed model description follows generally following the odd overview design concepts and details protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2005 a conceptual diagram of the model fig c 1 is presented in appendix c the purpose of the model was to find functional group specific establishment and survival values indicating functional connectivity for the younger forests in the landscape around old growth forest patches which would lead to the most realistic biodiversity patterns in old growth forest patches 2 3 2 state variables and scales the operating agent of the model was a subpopulation of a virtual species agents were characterized by their position otherwise all agents were identical but didn t act identically due to stochastic variation the circular simulation frame consisted of 7843 cells and represented forest configuration in a 5 km radius of the examined forest site each grid cell represented a 100 100 m area in nature and was described either as nemoral forest or uninhabitable matrix each nemoral forest cell was in turn described by two state variables forest age age1 to age4 and whether it was empty or inhabited by a subpopulation habitats other than nemoral forests could not be established while nemoral forest cells were attributed establishment and survival probabilities based on their forest age to keep the experimental design simple global probabilities were not adjusted for different functional groups immigration and dispersal parameters were also kept constant among all scenarios their values were chosen to guarantee simulation stability to avoid total extinction of all subpopulations and based on expected commonness of the ecological processes at the same time immigration value was kept relatively low to ensure that biodiversity patterns would not be overridden by high non directional immigration the same immigration and dispersal values have been used by jõks et al 2021 and jõks and pärtel 2019 the simulation proceeded in distinct time steps each representing approximately a year one simulation run lasted for 100 time steps 2 3 3 process overview and scheduling at each time step a proportion of subpopulations immigrated from outside established a cell reproduced dispersed or were removed did not survive see 2 3 7 submodels 2 3 4 design concepts emergence the probability of the focal cell to be inhabited in each individual run emerged from the processes of immigration dispersal establishment and survival fitness the subpopulations dispersal ability was randomly generated and was described by a negative binomial dispersal kernel see reproduction and dispersal section under 2 3 7 submodels establishment and survival rates were forest age specific specified by the simulation scenario stochasticity all processes were interpreted as probabilities dispersal direction and distance were chosen randomly 2 3 5 initialization each simulation run was initialized with a site map see 2 2 forest maps and started with all forest cells occupied by subpopulations of the same randomly generated species we simulated one species at a time 2 3 6 input the simulation input for each run was a raster map of the site where 0 represented all habitats other than nemoral forest uninhabitable matrix and 1 4 represented different aged nemoral forests fig 1 2 3 7 submodels immigration at each time step 10 of the cells received immigrants see 2 3 2 state variables and scales for justification which simulated the arrival from outside of the 5 km radius area subpopulations immigrated to the forest during the simulation with an equal probability for all cells thus immigration was non directional reproduction and dispersal at each time step 40 of all subpopulations randomly chosen tried to send a descendant to another cell see 2 3 2 state variables and scales for justification dispersal direction and distance were randomly generated dispersal distance was described by a negative binomial dispersal kernel r function rnbinom n 1 size 0 5 prob 0 05 as a result most dispersing events occurred within 10 cells but a few reached up to 100 cells or more establishment a subpopulation established an unoccupied forest cell with the probability determined by the forest age class and simulation scenario this varied between 10 and 100 see 2 4 simulation scenarios survival at each time step some subpopulations were randomly removed the number of removed subpopulations depended on the forest age class and simulation scenario the survival rate varied between 75 and 90 see 2 4 simulation scenarios 2 4 simulation scenarios we used eight establishment indicated as e1 e8 and eight survival indicated as s1 s8 values for each forest age class each survival value was combined with each establishment value and vice versa in full factorial design resulting in 64 scenarios altogether fig 2 based on existing knowledge we generally simulated less favorable conditions for the younger forests and did not include opposite scenarios establishment values varied between 10 and 100 and survival values between 75 and 90 this parameter space was chosen to be as inclusive as possible but avoiding unrealistic extremes which would lead to a very low rate of inhabited cells or to the extinction of all subpopulations in some scenarios species had stronger affinity for older forests greater differences in probabilities between forest age classes while in others they had more equal establishment or survival values in all forest age classes fig 2 2 5 data analyses first we derived simulated species richness for the central study cell using 1000 single species simulation runs for that we assessed the frequency of inhabited cells over those 1000 simulation runs using the last 10 time steps of all single species simulation runs to reduce the stochastic variation in simulated richness next our goal was to correlate the simulated species richness of virtual species to the observed species richness of each functional group we were interested in the effect of study landscapes with forests of various ages but species richness also depends on other environmental variables as climate soil or stand structure moreover study sites close to each other tend to have similar landscapes due to spatial autocorrelation these confounding effects can mask the effect of local landscapes therefore we removed the effects of main environmental gradients and spatial autocorrelation by using residuals from models where species richness was related to possible confounding variables using residuals instead of raw richness is analogous to partial correlation where relationship between two variables is examined while accounting for the effect of other variables first to remove the effects of environmental factors and spatial autocorrelation on observed species richness we calculated residuals for the linear model where observed species richness of a functional group expressed as a log transformed value of the effective number of species i e shannon diversity index calculated by r function diversity in package vegan oksanen et al 2020 was the dependent variable and environmental factors and spatial parameters were independent variables lm shannon diversity index soil npk soil ph mean temperature precipitation wood volume pcnm1 pcnm2 pcnm3 pcnm4 pcnm5 pcnm6 pcnm7 pcnm8 pcnm9 pcnm10 pcnm1 pcnm10 were principal coordinates of the neighborhood matrix borcard and legendre 2002 derived from the geographical distance matrix of empirical study sites r function pcnm in package vegan oksanen et al 2020 with this technique the distance matrix is described by several spatial predictors which have the same length as the study variables allowing them to be included in the model with these spatial predictors unbiased relationships can be detected if forest availability has some spatial autocorrelation closer study sites are more similar to each other due to some unmeasured causes for simulated richness log transformation was used equals to shannon index with presence absence only as we have in simulation since we had not used environmental parameters in the simulations we did not include them in that model however we still used pcnms since the forest availability patterns in the simulation were empirical and thus non random in space lm ln species richness pcnm1 pcnm2 pcnm3 pcnm4 pcnm5 pcnm6 pcnm7 pcnm8 pcnm9 pcnm10 we then correlated the residuals from the simulated species richness models of each scenario to the residuals of the observed species richness models of each functional group residuals show the variation in species richness that is not accounted for by environment or spatial autocorrelation thus more likely linked to variation in landscape structure as a result we now had 64 correlations per functional group those correlations were then fisher z transformed and used as a dependent variable in a common linear model for all functional groups with simulation parameters establishment and survival values and functional group as independent variables lm z functional group establishment functional group survival we used type iii anova and least squares means analyses r function emmeans in package emmeans lenth 2022 to detect the significant differences between the simulation scenarios and functional groups 3 results overall ground layer and epiphytic vegetation as well as ecm saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi showed positive correlations between simulated and observed data in several scenarios see 3 1 establishment and 3 2 survival and fig 3 woody plants and carabid beetles showed only negative correlations and am fungi gave only very few positive correlations in certain scenarios figs a 2 and a 3 in appendix a this implies that these last three groups remain outside of the range of our model and their results cannot be reasonably interpreted thus we did not include them in the further analyses the functional groups significantly differed among each other in correlation strength table 1 and tables b 1 and b 2 in appendix b significantly higher correlations than in other groups were achieved in ecm fungi under all simulation scenarios they were followed by ground layer and epiphytic diversity which in most scenarios did not differ among each other significantly generally the lowest correlations emerged in pathogenic fungi across all functional groups establishment and survival rate both had a significant effect on the correlation strength between the simulated and observed species richness both parameters also had a significant interaction effect with the functional group table 1 3 1 establishment and 3 2 survival 3 1 establishment in ground layer vegetation epiphytes ecm pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi establishment value had a significant effect on correlation strength in groups other than saprotrophs correlation values increased towards the scenarios which had stronger differentiation between younger and older forests culminating in scenarios e5 e8 fig 3a d however in saprotrophs an opposite trend emerged more differentiation between forest age groups resulted in weaker correlations and the strongest correlations were achieved in the e1 scenario which treated all forests equal regardless of their age fig 3e 3 2 survival the survival value had no significant effect on correlation strength in ground layer epiphytes or ecm fungi fig 3f h in pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi weak trends emerged for pathogens the s1 scenario resulted mostly in negative correlations whereas in other scenarios correlations increased slightly fig 3i in saprotrophs survival performed similarly to establishment highest correlations were achieved in the s1 scenario fig 3j 4 discussion simulation models can outline which processes are important for biodiversity variation within heterogeneous landscapes we found positive correlations between simulated richness of virtual species and observed species richness of several forest specific functional biodiversity groups of estonian landscapes ground vegetation epiphytes several groups of soil fungi our simulation assumed younger forests which have developed on former agricultural land to have less favorable conditions for establishment and survival than older forests using several simulation scenarios with contrasting differences between older and younger forests we found most of the studied groups to depend on old forest availability in the landscape species numbers of most functional groups were better emulated the more the scenario favored the oldest forests hence forest maturity in the landscape matters greatly and neighboring young or middle aged nemoral forests do not functionally connect old forest patches enough to support their biodiversity in most functional groups the simulation scenario that did not differentiate between the establishment probabilities in different forest age classes at all had notably lower correlations in intermediate scenarios a gradient towards higher correlations emerged until the correlation strengths culminated in the scenarios e6 e8 for ground layer epiphytes ecm fungi pathogenic fungi derived from the comparison of scenario designs the common strength of the last three scenarios must lie in defining the low establishment probability in the age2 forest class which represents approximately 40 50 year old forests these were first marked as forested land on the maps from the 1970s but not earlier probably resulting from abandonment of small farms fields and grasslands our results therefore suggest that these middle aged forests developed on former agricultural land are not functionally connecting the forest landscape well for ground layer plants and lichens epiphytes ecm or pathogenic fungi and this obstacle has an important effect on their biodiversity in the neighboring old forest patches therefore these functional groups could be more efficiently protected by integrating spatial planning into forest conservation management lõhmus and lõhmus 2011 have demonstrated a distinction between old growth up to 300 years and mature managed 65 95 years estonian forests the former hosted more calicioid lichen species than the latter other studies in europe have found the crucial minimum age of the stand to receive and support specific old growth biodiversity to be approximately 200 years or at least two or three generations graae 2000 fritz et al 2008 dittrich et al 2013 oddly our results didn t reveal any clear pattern for the 70 80 year old forests of age3 despite the contrasting establishment values in that age class scenarios e6 and e8 performed very similarly at least in part this can probably be attributed to their smaller representation in the landscape compared to other forest age classes in addition as we used the age of forested land on the simulation maps those older forested areas might include more areas that have already been cut however we do not estimate the effect of logged areas to be crucial as estonian clear cuts have historically been relatively small ca 1 5 ha estonian university of life sciences 2011 which allows biodiversity to recover relatively fast due to the high proportion of forests in the landscape vellend 2003 douda 2010 our simulation results suggest dominance of establishment limitation over survival in younger forests we found the differences in establishment rate to significantly affect the connectivity and biodiversity patterns whereas survival value rarely had any effect this could mean that finding a suitable microhabitat is the most important limiting factor for the old forest species in exploiting the younger forests whereas the effect of hostile environmental conditions in those forests is less important this is in line with many studies that have demonstrated the crucial importance of suitable substrata in the oldest forests for lichens fungi and bryophytes for example lõhmus and lõhmus 2011 found that the amount of suitable substrata is the main limiting factor for old forest specific calicioid fungi tullus et al 2022 and fenton and bergeron 2008 came to a similar conclusion regarding lichens and bryophytes berg et al al 2002 found that the occurrence of old trees logs and snags was the most important variable in explaining the occurrence of red listed fungi and bryophytes in swedish forests however in our simulations the effect of survival may have also been slightly reduced due to the smaller differences in parameter values between the scenarios whereas most functional groups showed a strong affinity for older forests one functional group saprotrophic fungi followed a contrasting trend the first scenario which did not differentiate between the forest age classes at all resulted in the most realistic biodiversity patterns and this applied for establishment as well as for survival values this result suggests that younger forests are successfully inhabited by saprotrophic fungi and for them old forest patches do not function as habitat islands contrasting diversity trends of saprotrophs compared to ectomycorrhizal or pathogenic fungal groups have been shown before in different ecosystems bai et al 2019 liu et al 2022 and have been explained by several theories including competition between the saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi cairney and meharg 2002 and the role of saprotrophs as ecosystem stabilizers liu et al 2022 we suggest that saprotrophs as a more generalist group take over the former open habitat as there is enough leftover organic material to decompose at the beginning of the forest formation while over the course of forest succession ectomycorrhizal fungi start arriving and providing competition although the differences between the scenarios were evident a simulation model still allows us to implement only a fraction of the complexity of real nature which is why the correlations between the simulated and observed species richness in general were quite moderate for instance some non forest environments e g parks hedgerows landscape elements in the agricultural landscape that were not included in our simulation nor the focus of this study might act as temporary habitats for forest species mony et al 2022 naaf et al 2022 nevertheless our results demonstrate that although mostly used to study active animal movements an agent based model can be successfully applied to gain additional knowledge of the functional connectivity of passively dispersing organisms we achieved the highest correlations between the simulated and observed species numbers and thus the best fit to our model for the ecm fungi followed by epiphytes and ground layer diversity in pathogenic fungi only the most old forest favoring scenarios resulted in positive correlations however we also had some functional groups woody plants am fungi carabid beetles which resulted in no or very rare positive correlations in any scenarios thus showing higher species richness if the forest patch stands in a heterogeneous landscape for them the ecotone or matrix habitats themselves seem to be important and the same distinction between suitable old forest habitat and matrix does not apply therefore the differences between the scenarios did not give us any meaningful insight into these groups observed woody plants species numbers were probably strongly affected by higher species richness of shrubs which have been shown to prefer younger forests due to higher light availability smidt and puettmann 1998 douda 2010 am fungal richness is generally considerably higher in grassland open habitats than in forests moora et al 2014 davison et al 2015 similarly several studies of temperate regions have shown carabid beetles to be more species rich in open habitats and ecotones than in forests heliölä et al 2001 boutaud et al 2022 szyszko podgórska et al 2022 to simulate the dynamics of these groups the simulation should probably have more favorable conditions in the younger forests or even in the habitats between the forests thus these groups stayed out of the scope of our current model 5 conclusions we conclude that for many forest specific groups young or middle aged forests do not sufficiently promote forest landscape connectivity and are thus not supporting the biodiversity of old growth forest patches we have shown that this old forest affinity is mainly caused by the establishment limitation rather than by restricted survival in younger forests our study demonstrates the potential of a simple simulation model to shed light on the relative importance of different processes shaping the biodiversity in fragmented habitats 5 1 funding this study was financed by the estonian research

24199,fragmented natural habitats such as old growth forests have been often considered island like systems however whereas the isolation of real islands is mostly a function of their spatial arrangement the biodiversity of old growth forest patches is also affected by how well the surrounding suboptimal habitats such as younger forests can support the functional connectivity between the old forest fragments the latter topic remains largely unclear due to the lack of mechanistic knowledge about the processes behind species affinity for old forest although in animal ecology functional connectivity has often been investigated with mechanistic agent based models these have rarely been applied for passively dispersing organism groups we used a pattern oriented modeling approach by combining a spatially explicit agent based model and an empirical biodiversity dataset of estonian old growth nemoral forest sites to study how forests of different ages between the old forest fragments are exploited by different passively or slowly dispersing functional groups we found that the establishment of ground layer vegetation epiphytes ectomycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi is significantly restricted in the younger forests whereas no clear difference between forest age classes emerged for survival our results thus suggest that establishment not survival is the main process behind the species affinity for old forest concurring with studies that have demonstrated the importance of suitable microhabitat availability in older forests we conclude that young secondary forests do not support the connectivity and consequently biodiversity of many old forest specific groups graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords agent based model mechanistic model functional connectivity landscape connectivity old forest affinity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction old growth undisturbed forests have declined in area worldwide are strongly fragmented and often surrounded by anthropogenic landscape riitters et al 2000 fragmented natural habitats like this have been referred to as island like systems in the non habitat landscape matrix haila 2002 therefore dynamic theory of island biogeography macarthur and wilson 1967 first established on oceanic islands was also quickly adopted by landscape ecology however there is a crucial difference between real islands and habitat patches species inhabiting real islands are considered to have zero probability of survival in the ocean but this binary habitat nonhabitat classification which is used by both island biogeography and classical metapopulation models is often insufficient in the context of forest fragments old forests are often surrounded by a variety of habitats including secondary or managed forests but it is unknown how well the connectivity and biodiversity of old forest fragments is supported by these suboptimal habitats of the surrounding landscape here we use modeling to obtain a mechanistic understanding of how the biodiversity of various functional groups in old growth patches is linked to heterogeneous surroundings life in forest fragments in contrast to oceanic islands depends greatly on the matrix surrounding the forest patches in its heterogeneity kupfer et al 2006 over the past decades the view on fragmented habitats has shifted towards connectivity as an overall landscape characteristic landscape connectivity is an important driver of biodiversity taylor et al 1993 as the small isolated populations are more prone to random extinction whereas high connectivity leads to higher immigration rates and consequently to higher species richness taylor et al 1993 rosenberg et al 1997 low connectivity between forest fragments has been shown by many studies to have a negative impact on biodiversity e g honnay et al 2002 douda 2010 sonnier et al 2014 brunet et al 2021 at the same time the importance of suboptimal habitats of the landscape has been also demonstrated by several empirical works for example lõhmus and lõhmus 2019 showed that estonian production forests with biodiversity friendly silviculture hosted a majority of all recorded lichen species among all management stages including old growth forest madžule et al 2012 demonstrated in latvia that non intensively managed forests helped to maintain the connectivity between natural forests for the epiphytes and mikusiński et al 2021 showed that boreal forests in sweden that have not been clear felled for a century complemented the habitat network of less demanding species in animal ecology functional connectivity is often used to account for matrix properties while structural connectivity describes the spatial arrangement of the patches functional connectivity describes how successfully organisms or genes move among the patches tischendorf and fahrig 2000 for more slowly dispersing taxa such as plants fungi or insects it may be necessary to establish a population in the matrix and thus old forest functional connectivity depends on how successful they are not only in crossing but also in establishing and surviving in the landscape between forest patches estonian forests consist of fragments of old stable forest surrounded by areas of younger secondary forest of the same type as well as non forest and anthropogenic habitats two prevailing forest types occur in estonia boreal and nemoral forests nemoral forests characterized by broad leaved deciduous trees grow on neutral to alkaline nutrient rich soils in southern sweden and east of the baltic sea metzger et al 2005 nemoral forests are the most species rich forests of the region making them especially valuable in terms of conservation their species composition differs significantly from boreal forests and they have a significantly higher richness of woody plants and ground layer plants as well as ectomycorrhizal ecm and pathogenic fungi and epiphytes jüriado et al 2003 noreika et al 2019 secondary forests of the same type which in estonia have mainly developed on abandoned agricultural land as a result of socioeconomic changes may be considered as semi suitable matrix or low quality habitats either way their role in supporting biodiversity in their neighboring old forest patches remains unclear forest age has often been associated with habitat quality with older forests demonstrating higher species richness reviewed by nordén et al 2014 but how a forest s age can be translated into its ability to support temporary populations and connectivity between neighboring old forest fragments is less clear that is in part due to the lack of mechanistic knowledge of which process restricts old forest species from exploiting the younger forests several authors have looked for the direct effect of temporal habitat continuity resulting from the slow colonization rates of old forest specific species reviewed by nordén et al 2014 in the case of reforestation of former agricultural land this effect may be especially pronounced as the forest species may not be locally available randlane et al 2017 have shown that bryophyte and lichen diversity in estonian aspen plantations positively correlated to the proximity of historical forest demonstrating the role of dispersal limitation however often the effect of habitat continuity per se is found to be confounded or prevailed by the effect of abundant microhabitats in older forests nordén and appelqvist 2001 runnel and lõhmus 2017 a structurally diverse old forest habitat offers several microhabitats for different species thus favoring establishment as well as protects them from hostile environmental conditions thus inhibiting the extinction of local populations whether establishment or survival is a prevailingly limiting process behind the affinity for older forests is not well known for any old forest specific groups a mechanistic understanding of species affinity for old forest and its effect on forest connectivity may be hard to achieve in field studies as the processes behind patterns are often inseparable here implementing agent based simulations can be beneficial agent based models are a mechanistic bottom up approach which enable us to understand how broad scale ecological patterns emerge from the processes acting at the level of individual organisms or populations and their environment grimm et al 2005 the pattern oriented approach which focuses on reproducing observed patterns of nature has been proposed for agent based modeling grimm et al 2005 pattern oriented agent based models are a useful tool in cases where the processes behind large scale biodiversity patterns are of interest wiegand et al 2003 and are useful for comparing alternative scenarios baguette and van dyck 2007 simpkins et al 2018 day et al 2020 agent based simulations have been extensively used in population and conservation ecology deangelis and mooij 2005 and several agent based models have been used to study forest connectivity but these have mostly considered active animal movements behavior and habitat selection e g revilla et al 2004 hauenstein et al 2019 trapp et al 2019 day et al 2020 zeller et al 2020 rohwäder and jeltsch 2022 the response of passively dispersing species groups to forest fragmentation has mostly been studied using the methods of statistical and species distribution modeling e g sonnier et al 2014 löbel et al 2018 brunet et al 2021 some recent agent based fragmentation simulations have used the virtual or generic species approach where key species characteristics rather than the exact identity are of interest chetcuti et al 2020 bocedi et al 2021 but these studies mostly consider active movement passive dispersal has recently been included by rybicki et al 2020 in a simulation study testing the habitat amount hypothesis there is no reason why passive dispersal could not be studied with agent based models and due to their clearly mechanistic stochastic and spatially explicit nature they are a useful tool for gaining better understanding of forest functional connectivity using a spatially explicit agent based model and an empirical dataset from nemoral forest sites in estonia we mechanistically evaluated how different aged forests as suboptimal habitats support the functional connectivity establishment and survival and consequently the biodiversity of old growth forest patches we specifically looked at passively or slowly dispersing functional groups that are important in shaping forest habitat structure ground layer vegetation epiphytes woody plants ecm and arbuscular mycorrhizal am fungi pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi carabid beetles by comparing simulation scenarios we looked for establishment and survival values that would result in the strongest correlations between the simulated and observed species richness we asked which functional biodiversity groups fit our model in general if different aged forests vary in their ability to support functional connectivity establishment and survival of old forest specific biodiversity whether species affinity for old forest results mainly from the establishment or survival process whether functional biodiversity groups differ in their ability to establish and survive in different aged forests between old forest fragments 2 materials and methods we simulated the immigration dispersal establishment and survival of subpopulations of virtual species in a 5 km radius circle around old growth nemoral forest study sites using empirical landscapes we then compared the simulated species richness of virtual species in the old growth forest sites with the observed species richness of different functional groups to find which establishment and survival values altogether functional connectivity result in the values that are best correlated to the empirical data we used the following functional groups ground layer incl herbaceous plants ground bryophytes and lichens epiphytes incl bryophytes and lichens woody plants trees and shrubs ecm and am fungi pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi carabid beetles we did not parameterize the model separately for each functional group but correlated the simulated species richness of the virtual species to the observed species richness of each group to find parameter values that best fit each group pattern oriented approach 2 1 forest sites and observed data we used empirical biodiversity and environmental data from 32 nemoral forest sites in southern estonia located in mature undisturbed forests in protected areas while the forest in the surrounding landscape differed in its age amount and configuration fig a 1 in appendix a more specific fieldwork and lab work details except the carabid beetle sampling are available in noreika et al 2019 here only a brief description is given fieldwork was conducted in the vegetation periods of 2016 and 2017 all herbaceous vascular plants terricolous and epiphytic bryophytes carabid beetle and lichen species were recorded within a 10 10 m plot at each site the areas including all possible substrates for epiphytes were thoroughly examined fungal diversity was determined from collected soil samples using dna analyses carabid beetles were collected with three plastic pitfall traps per plot dug in at the same level as the soil surface and covered with wooden lids placed at 2 m distance from one another as an even sided triangle traps were visited once a month from april to september 2017 altogether five times the wood volume of tree trunks was estimated by including all trees with 5 cm in diameter at 1 3 m height and using an allometric biomass equation vaus 2005 soil chemistry was analyzed at the laboratory of plant biochemistry estonian university of life sciences tartu estonia standardized measure of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium content npk was calculated by logit transforming scaling and averaging respective nutrient contents mean annual temperature and annual precipitation data were acquired from chelsa high resolution climate data karger et al 2017 2 2 forest maps empirical landscapes surrounding the old growth forest study sites were represented as raster maps in the simulations simulation maps were generated based on four mappings of forested land from the 1900s 1940s 1970s and 2010s first historical maps were digitalized at a resolution of 100 100 m and each new cell which contained at least some forested land was classified as forest then the maps were compared with each other areas that were classified as forested land only on the map of the 2010s were defined as youngest forests age1 forested land that was present on the maps of the 2010s and 1970s age2 2010s and 1940s age3 2010s and 1900s age4 as the species pools differ drastically between the nemoral and boreal forests as demonstrated by noreika et al 2019 we decided to exclude the forest cells from the surrounding landscape that lay on soils that are typical only to boreal forests fisher exact tests based on 100 nemoral and boreal forest sites identified that only podzol soil type kmoch et al 2021 should be omitted which reduced the forest cells by only a small amount 2 3 simulation model 2 3 1 general overview of the simulation by modifying the agent based simulation model developed by jõks and pärtel 2019 written in the r programming language r core team 2019 we simulated the immigration dispersal establishment and survival of subpopulations of virtual species in the empirical landscapes surrounding the old growth forest study sites the operating agent of our simulation was a subpopulation of a virtual species simulating subpopulations of one species at one site at a time we run the simulation for 1000 times for each forest site and for each scenario one simulation ran for 100 time steps and the presence or absence of the subpopulation in the 100 100 m central study site mature forest was recorded for the 10 last time steps we were only interested if the central study cell was inhabited or not and did not record it for the surrounding cells finally to find simulated species richness we added together the results of the 1000 single species simulation runs a more detailed model description follows generally following the odd overview design concepts and details protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2005 a conceptual diagram of the model fig c 1 is presented in appendix c the purpose of the model was to find functional group specific establishment and survival values indicating functional connectivity for the younger forests in the landscape around old growth forest patches which would lead to the most realistic biodiversity patterns in old growth forest patches 2 3 2 state variables and scales the operating agent of the model was a subpopulation of a virtual species agents were characterized by their position otherwise all agents were identical but didn t act identically due to stochastic variation the circular simulation frame consisted of 7843 cells and represented forest configuration in a 5 km radius of the examined forest site each grid cell represented a 100 100 m area in nature and was described either as nemoral forest or uninhabitable matrix each nemoral forest cell was in turn described by two state variables forest age age1 to age4 and whether it was empty or inhabited by a subpopulation habitats other than nemoral forests could not be established while nemoral forest cells were attributed establishment and survival probabilities based on their forest age to keep the experimental design simple global probabilities were not adjusted for different functional groups immigration and dispersal parameters were also kept constant among all scenarios their values were chosen to guarantee simulation stability to avoid total extinction of all subpopulations and based on expected commonness of the ecological processes at the same time immigration value was kept relatively low to ensure that biodiversity patterns would not be overridden by high non directional immigration the same immigration and dispersal values have been used by jõks et al 2021 and jõks and pärtel 2019 the simulation proceeded in distinct time steps each representing approximately a year one simulation run lasted for 100 time steps 2 3 3 process overview and scheduling at each time step a proportion of subpopulations immigrated from outside established a cell reproduced dispersed or were removed did not survive see 2 3 7 submodels 2 3 4 design concepts emergence the probability of the focal cell to be inhabited in each individual run emerged from the processes of immigration dispersal establishment and survival fitness the subpopulations dispersal ability was randomly generated and was described by a negative binomial dispersal kernel see reproduction and dispersal section under 2 3 7 submodels establishment and survival rates were forest age specific specified by the simulation scenario stochasticity all processes were interpreted as probabilities dispersal direction and distance were chosen randomly 2 3 5 initialization each simulation run was initialized with a site map see 2 2 forest maps and started with all forest cells occupied by subpopulations of the same randomly generated species we simulated one species at a time 2 3 6 input the simulation input for each run was a raster map of the site where 0 represented all habitats other than nemoral forest uninhabitable matrix and 1 4 represented different aged nemoral forests fig 1 2 3 7 submodels immigration at each time step 10 of the cells received immigrants see 2 3 2 state variables and scales for justification which simulated the arrival from outside of the 5 km radius area subpopulations immigrated to the forest during the simulation with an equal probability for all cells thus immigration was non directional reproduction and dispersal at each time step 40 of all subpopulations randomly chosen tried to send a descendant to another cell see 2 3 2 state variables and scales for justification dispersal direction and distance were randomly generated dispersal distance was described by a negative binomial dispersal kernel r function rnbinom n 1 size 0 5 prob 0 05 as a result most dispersing events occurred within 10 cells but a few reached up to 100 cells or more establishment a subpopulation established an unoccupied forest cell with the probability determined by the forest age class and simulation scenario this varied between 10 and 100 see 2 4 simulation scenarios survival at each time step some subpopulations were randomly removed the number of removed subpopulations depended on the forest age class and simulation scenario the survival rate varied between 75 and 90 see 2 4 simulation scenarios 2 4 simulation scenarios we used eight establishment indicated as e1 e8 and eight survival indicated as s1 s8 values for each forest age class each survival value was combined with each establishment value and vice versa in full factorial design resulting in 64 scenarios altogether fig 2 based on existing knowledge we generally simulated less favorable conditions for the younger forests and did not include opposite scenarios establishment values varied between 10 and 100 and survival values between 75 and 90 this parameter space was chosen to be as inclusive as possible but avoiding unrealistic extremes which would lead to a very low rate of inhabited cells or to the extinction of all subpopulations in some scenarios species had stronger affinity for older forests greater differences in probabilities between forest age classes while in others they had more equal establishment or survival values in all forest age classes fig 2 2 5 data analyses first we derived simulated species richness for the central study cell using 1000 single species simulation runs for that we assessed the frequency of inhabited cells over those 1000 simulation runs using the last 10 time steps of all single species simulation runs to reduce the stochastic variation in simulated richness next our goal was to correlate the simulated species richness of virtual species to the observed species richness of each functional group we were interested in the effect of study landscapes with forests of various ages but species richness also depends on other environmental variables as climate soil or stand structure moreover study sites close to each other tend to have similar landscapes due to spatial autocorrelation these confounding effects can mask the effect of local landscapes therefore we removed the effects of main environmental gradients and spatial autocorrelation by using residuals from models where species richness was related to possible confounding variables using residuals instead of raw richness is analogous to partial correlation where relationship between two variables is examined while accounting for the effect of other variables first to remove the effects of environmental factors and spatial autocorrelation on observed species richness we calculated residuals for the linear model where observed species richness of a functional group expressed as a log transformed value of the effective number of species i e shannon diversity index calculated by r function diversity in package vegan oksanen et al 2020 was the dependent variable and environmental factors and spatial parameters were independent variables lm shannon diversity index soil npk soil ph mean temperature precipitation wood volume pcnm1 pcnm2 pcnm3 pcnm4 pcnm5 pcnm6 pcnm7 pcnm8 pcnm9 pcnm10 pcnm1 pcnm10 were principal coordinates of the neighborhood matrix borcard and legendre 2002 derived from the geographical distance matrix of empirical study sites r function pcnm in package vegan oksanen et al 2020 with this technique the distance matrix is described by several spatial predictors which have the same length as the study variables allowing them to be included in the model with these spatial predictors unbiased relationships can be detected if forest availability has some spatial autocorrelation closer study sites are more similar to each other due to some unmeasured causes for simulated richness log transformation was used equals to shannon index with presence absence only as we have in simulation since we had not used environmental parameters in the simulations we did not include them in that model however we still used pcnms since the forest availability patterns in the simulation were empirical and thus non random in space lm ln species richness pcnm1 pcnm2 pcnm3 pcnm4 pcnm5 pcnm6 pcnm7 pcnm8 pcnm9 pcnm10 we then correlated the residuals from the simulated species richness models of each scenario to the residuals of the observed species richness models of each functional group residuals show the variation in species richness that is not accounted for by environment or spatial autocorrelation thus more likely linked to variation in landscape structure as a result we now had 64 correlations per functional group those correlations were then fisher z transformed and used as a dependent variable in a common linear model for all functional groups with simulation parameters establishment and survival values and functional group as independent variables lm z functional group establishment functional group survival we used type iii anova and least squares means analyses r function emmeans in package emmeans lenth 2022 to detect the significant differences between the simulation scenarios and functional groups 3 results overall ground layer and epiphytic vegetation as well as ecm saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi showed positive correlations between simulated and observed data in several scenarios see 3 1 establishment and 3 2 survival and fig 3 woody plants and carabid beetles showed only negative correlations and am fungi gave only very few positive correlations in certain scenarios figs a 2 and a 3 in appendix a this implies that these last three groups remain outside of the range of our model and their results cannot be reasonably interpreted thus we did not include them in the further analyses the functional groups significantly differed among each other in correlation strength table 1 and tables b 1 and b 2 in appendix b significantly higher correlations than in other groups were achieved in ecm fungi under all simulation scenarios they were followed by ground layer and epiphytic diversity which in most scenarios did not differ among each other significantly generally the lowest correlations emerged in pathogenic fungi across all functional groups establishment and survival rate both had a significant effect on the correlation strength between the simulated and observed species richness both parameters also had a significant interaction effect with the functional group table 1 3 1 establishment and 3 2 survival 3 1 establishment in ground layer vegetation epiphytes ecm pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi establishment value had a significant effect on correlation strength in groups other than saprotrophs correlation values increased towards the scenarios which had stronger differentiation between younger and older forests culminating in scenarios e5 e8 fig 3a d however in saprotrophs an opposite trend emerged more differentiation between forest age groups resulted in weaker correlations and the strongest correlations were achieved in the e1 scenario which treated all forests equal regardless of their age fig 3e 3 2 survival the survival value had no significant effect on correlation strength in ground layer epiphytes or ecm fungi fig 3f h in pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi weak trends emerged for pathogens the s1 scenario resulted mostly in negative correlations whereas in other scenarios correlations increased slightly fig 3i in saprotrophs survival performed similarly to establishment highest correlations were achieved in the s1 scenario fig 3j 4 discussion simulation models can outline which processes are important for biodiversity variation within heterogeneous landscapes we found positive correlations between simulated richness of virtual species and observed species richness of several forest specific functional biodiversity groups of estonian landscapes ground vegetation epiphytes several groups of soil fungi our simulation assumed younger forests which have developed on former agricultural land to have less favorable conditions for establishment and survival than older forests using several simulation scenarios with contrasting differences between older and younger forests we found most of the studied groups to depend on old forest availability in the landscape species numbers of most functional groups were better emulated the more the scenario favored the oldest forests hence forest maturity in the landscape matters greatly and neighboring young or middle aged nemoral forests do not functionally connect old forest patches enough to support their biodiversity in most functional groups the simulation scenario that did not differentiate between the establishment probabilities in different forest age classes at all had notably lower correlations in intermediate scenarios a gradient towards higher correlations emerged until the correlation strengths culminated in the scenarios e6 e8 for ground layer epiphytes ecm fungi pathogenic fungi derived from the comparison of scenario designs the common strength of the last three scenarios must lie in defining the low establishment probability in the age2 forest class which represents approximately 40 50 year old forests these were first marked as forested land on the maps from the 1970s but not earlier probably resulting from abandonment of small farms fields and grasslands our results therefore suggest that these middle aged forests developed on former agricultural land are not functionally connecting the forest landscape well for ground layer plants and lichens epiphytes ecm or pathogenic fungi and this obstacle has an important effect on their biodiversity in the neighboring old forest patches therefore these functional groups could be more efficiently protected by integrating spatial planning into forest conservation management lõhmus and lõhmus 2011 have demonstrated a distinction between old growth up to 300 years and mature managed 65 95 years estonian forests the former hosted more calicioid lichen species than the latter other studies in europe have found the crucial minimum age of the stand to receive and support specific old growth biodiversity to be approximately 200 years or at least two or three generations graae 2000 fritz et al 2008 dittrich et al 2013 oddly our results didn t reveal any clear pattern for the 70 80 year old forests of age3 despite the contrasting establishment values in that age class scenarios e6 and e8 performed very similarly at least in part this can probably be attributed to their smaller representation in the landscape compared to other forest age classes in addition as we used the age of forested land on the simulation maps those older forested areas might include more areas that have already been cut however we do not estimate the effect of logged areas to be crucial as estonian clear cuts have historically been relatively small ca 1 5 ha estonian university of life sciences 2011 which allows biodiversity to recover relatively fast due to the high proportion of forests in the landscape vellend 2003 douda 2010 our simulation results suggest dominance of establishment limitation over survival in younger forests we found the differences in establishment rate to significantly affect the connectivity and biodiversity patterns whereas survival value rarely had any effect this could mean that finding a suitable microhabitat is the most important limiting factor for the old forest species in exploiting the younger forests whereas the effect of hostile environmental conditions in those forests is less important this is in line with many studies that have demonstrated the crucial importance of suitable substrata in the oldest forests for lichens fungi and bryophytes for example lõhmus and lõhmus 2011 found that the amount of suitable substrata is the main limiting factor for old forest specific calicioid fungi tullus et al 2022 and fenton and bergeron 2008 came to a similar conclusion regarding lichens and bryophytes berg et al al 2002 found that the occurrence of old trees logs and snags was the most important variable in explaining the occurrence of red listed fungi and bryophytes in swedish forests however in our simulations the effect of survival may have also been slightly reduced due to the smaller differences in parameter values between the scenarios whereas most functional groups showed a strong affinity for older forests one functional group saprotrophic fungi followed a contrasting trend the first scenario which did not differentiate between the forest age classes at all resulted in the most realistic biodiversity patterns and this applied for establishment as well as for survival values this result suggests that younger forests are successfully inhabited by saprotrophic fungi and for them old forest patches do not function as habitat islands contrasting diversity trends of saprotrophs compared to ectomycorrhizal or pathogenic fungal groups have been shown before in different ecosystems bai et al 2019 liu et al 2022 and have been explained by several theories including competition between the saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi cairney and meharg 2002 and the role of saprotrophs as ecosystem stabilizers liu et al 2022 we suggest that saprotrophs as a more generalist group take over the former open habitat as there is enough leftover organic material to decompose at the beginning of the forest formation while over the course of forest succession ectomycorrhizal fungi start arriving and providing competition although the differences between the scenarios were evident a simulation model still allows us to implement only a fraction of the complexity of real nature which is why the correlations between the simulated and observed species richness in general were quite moderate for instance some non forest environments e g parks hedgerows landscape elements in the agricultural landscape that were not included in our simulation nor the focus of this study might act as temporary habitats for forest species mony et al 2022 naaf et al 2022 nevertheless our results demonstrate that although mostly used to study active animal movements an agent based model can be successfully applied to gain additional knowledge of the functional connectivity of passively dispersing organisms we achieved the highest correlations between the simulated and observed species numbers and thus the best fit to our model for the ecm fungi followed by epiphytes and ground layer diversity in pathogenic fungi only the most old forest favoring scenarios resulted in positive correlations however we also had some functional groups woody plants am fungi carabid beetles which resulted in no or very rare positive correlations in any scenarios thus showing higher species richness if the forest patch stands in a heterogeneous landscape for them the ecotone or matrix habitats themselves seem to be important and the same distinction between suitable old forest habitat and matrix does not apply therefore the differences between the scenarios did not give us any meaningful insight into these groups observed woody plants species numbers were probably strongly affected by higher species richness of shrubs which have been shown to prefer younger forests due to higher light availability smidt and puettmann 1998 douda 2010 am fungal richness is generally considerably higher in grassland open habitats than in forests moora et al 2014 davison et al 2015 similarly several studies of temperate regions have shown carabid beetles to be more species rich in open habitats and ecotones than in forests heliölä et al 2001 boutaud et al 2022 szyszko podgórska et al 2022 to simulate the dynamics of these groups the simulation should probably have more favorable conditions in the younger forests or even in the habitats between the forests thus these groups stayed out of the scope of our current model 5 conclusions we conclude that for many forest specific groups young or middle aged forests do not sufficiently promote forest landscape connectivity and are thus not supporting the biodiversity of old growth forest patches we have shown that this old forest affinity is mainly caused by the establishment limitation rather than by restricted survival in younger forests our study demonstrates the potential of a simple simulation model to shed light on the relative importance of different processes shaping the biodiversity in fragmented habitats 5 1 funding this study was financed by the estonian research
