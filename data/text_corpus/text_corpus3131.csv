15655,the composition of wastewater containing heavy metal mixtures is often complex and poses a serious threat to human and environmental health effective removal of a variety of heavy metal ions with a single technology is challenging and the conventional split integrated technologies require multi step processing and a massive footprint for the first time we achieve hierarchically integrating ion exchange and nanofiltration into all in one inf membranes the inf membrane has a hierarchical structure with an interfacial polymerization layer and an ion exchange layer which can achieve highly efficient indiscriminate heavy metal ion removal overcoming the defect that traditional nanofiltration membranes can only remove single metal cations or oxyanions the ion exchange layer can remove heavy metal ions through sulfonic acid groups and quaternary amine groups in addition the ion exchange layer can be regenerated by electro deionization which is meaningful for sustainable

and economic growth water shortages have become a critical challenge to achieving sustainable development pekel et al 2016 tong and elimelech 2016 van der bruggen 2021 zuo et al 2021 at the same time widespread water pollution threatens human health and the environment hillie and hlophe 2007 mao et al 2021 taking heavy metal wastewater as an example it is discharged mainly from the chemical electroplating and pharmaceutical industries babel and kurniawan 2003 bolisetty et al 2019 fu and wang 2011 peng et al 2021 various methods have been developed to remove heavy metal ions in water bodies including biological oxidation ion exchange chemical precipitation and membrane separation al rashdi et al 2013 boussouga et al 2021 hao et al 2021 jacob et al 2018 mbamba et al 2015 among these ion exchange technology uses resins with the capacity to adsorb heavy metal ions with high removal efficiency low cost and simple operation however when dealing with high concentration heavy metal wastewater ion exchange materials reach adsorption saturation quickly requiring frequent replacement or metal ion desorption cycles peydayesh and mezzenga 2021 recently the term biological ion exchange has been proposed for wastewater treatment by generating biofilms on the surface of ion exchange resins without the need for chemical regeneration edgar and boyer 2021 compared with other processes nanofiltration nf has high energy efficiency ready scalability low production costs and low pollution emissions huang et al 2020 jimenez solomon et al 2016 lu et al 2021 mi 2014 shen et al 2022 tan et al 2018 therefore it is capturing increasing attention as a viable means of removing heavy metal ions peng et al 2018 su et al 2021 the nf membrane achieves high efficiency removal of multivalent ions mainly through the size exclusion and the donnan effect chen et al 2021a lu et al 2022 tang et al 2022 wang et al 2022 due to the donnan effect the conventional negatively charged nf membrane has a high removal rate of heavy metal oxyanions but a low removal rate of metal cations ritt et al 2020 by using nf as a pretreatment step for removing heavy metal ions and then using ion exchange materials to adsorb the leaked ions the removal efficiency of heavy metal ions can be significantly improved and the replacement frequency of ion exchange materials can be reduced bórquez and ferrer 2016 kowalska 2014 however the split integration process will extend the wastewater treatment steps and increase equipment footprint and investment costs for the first time we designed an all in one membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions via a one step co casting and interfacial polymerization ip technology the new generation ion exchange nanofiltration membrane is named as inf membrane due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical structure of the ip layer and the ion exchange layer the inf membrane efficiently removes various types of heavy metal ions in one step firstly the nf layer can reject most heavy metal ions preventing premature saturation of the ion exchange layer fig 1 a secondly the ion exchange layer with sulfonic acid groups and quaternary amine groups can remove heavy metal ions leaking from the nf layer through the ion exchange process fig 1a finally the saturated ion exchange layer can be regenerated by electro deionization edi to achieve sustainable cycling fig 1b the inf membrane has the following advantages 1 the removal rate of heavy metal cations and oxyanions is more than 96 and the water permeability is 12 10 0 87 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which overcomes the deficiency that conventional nf membranes can only remove single metal cations or oxyanions 2 the all in one integration significantly reduces equipment investment costs and footprint compared to conventional split integration this work demonstrates that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has superior potential and universal applicability in heavy metal wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials poly ether sulfone pes was purchased from solvay piperazine pip nacl na2so4 mgso4 were obtained from sinopharm peg 200 peg 400

obtained from macklin strong acid styrene cation exchange resin and strong basic styrene anion exchange resin were obtained from shyuanye 2 2 preparation of the membranes 2 2 1 preparation of dual layer pes ier substrate the anion exchange resin and the cation exchange resin mass ration 2 1 were placed in a freeze dryer scientz 18 n to dry for 8 h to remove moisture then the resins were put into a planetary nano ball mill mitr 260 for pulverization finally the pulverized resin powder was filtered with a 400 mesh screen to obtain the required resin powder a prescribed amount of pes was dissolved in the mixed solution of dmac and peg and vigorously stirred at 56 c for 8 h to prepare a pes solution subsequently the pes solution and the ier powder were mixed and vigorously stirred at 30 c until a uniform pes ier solution was formed the dual layer pes ier substrate was prepared by a one step co casting method using the above solution the detailed preparation method of the dual layer membrane can be found in supporting information fig s1 2 2 2 preparation of the all in one inf membrane the membrane was prepared on the pes ier substrate by interfacial polymerization the detailed preparation steps of the nf membrane can be found in supporting information fig s2 the obtained membrane was marked inf membrane and stored in deionized water for comparison we prepared an nf membrane without incorporating resins as a control membrane the detailed preparation conditions of all membranes are summarized in table s1 2 3 characterization of materials and membranes the membrane morphology was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem hitachi s4800 the membrane was freeze dried for 8 h cracked in liquid nitrogen and coated with gold to visualize morphologies atomic force microscopy afm autoprobe cp research bruker usa was used to observe the membrane surface roughness the chemical composition and structure of the nf and inf membranes were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir thermo scientific nicolet 8700 and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher k alpha respectively all spectra within the wavenumber range from 2000 to 800 cm 1 were recorded for each sample the inf membrane with ion exchange function consists of four layers interfacial polymerization layer pes substrate layer ion exchange layer and non woven fabric to characterize the ion exchange layer the non woven fabric needs to be peeled off then ft ir and xps were used to characterize the bottom of the ion exchange layer the zeta potential on the membrane surface was measured by an electrokinetic analyzer anton paar surpass the mesoporosity and specific surface area of the nf membrane and inf membrane were determined by the pore volume which was determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet method asap2466 specific surface area and pore analyzer 2 4 membrane performance test a cross flow filtration device was used to evaluate the performance of the membrane fig s3 the test pressure is 6 bar the effective membrane area is 3 14 cm2 and the flow rate is 30 l h before each test the membrane was pre stabilized in the test solution for 1 h at 7 bar to obtain stable performance the permeate stream is not recycled under all test conditions the following equation was used to calculate the pure water permeance pwp p w p v a m t δ p where v is the volume of permeate l a m is the effective filtration area m2 t is the testing time h and p is the testing pressure bar the removal rate of heavy metal ions was determined by the concentration of heavy metal ions in the feed side c f and permeate side c p the concentration of heavy metal ions was tested by icp oes perkin elmer optima7000dv the concentration of other salts was measured with a conductivity meter mettler toledo fe30 hence the following equation was used to determine the solute rejection r r 1 c p c f 100 if there is no special instruction the test condition defaults to the transmembrane pressure is 6 bar the solute concentration is 1000 ppm the pre stabilized time is 1 h and the testing time is 1 h 2 5 membrane pore size test 100 ppm polyethylene glycol solution of different molecular weights was used as the feed solution and used to measure the membrane pore size and pore size distribution the total organic carbon analyzer toc elementar vario was used to analyze the solute concentration on the feed and permeate sides the pore size distribution of the membrane can be expressed as follows d r t r p d r p 1 r p ln σ p 2 π exp ln r p ln μ p 2 2 ln σ p 2 where r p is the effective pore radius of the membrane μ p is the molecular radius when r 50 and σ p is the ratio of the molecular radius when r 84 13 to the molecular radius when r 50 the membrane molecular weight cut off mwco is equal to the molecular radius when r 90 more detailed information is described in the previous work chung et al 2022 sun et al 2010 2 6 adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics a certain amount of single layer ier membrane was immersed in 50 ml na2cro4 solution with a concentration range of 5 200 ppm to measure the adsorption capacity of the ion exchange layer then the solution was stirred at 25 c and 160 rpm for several hours until reaching adsorption equilibrium the following formula is used to calculate the ion adsorption capacity of the ion exchange layer q e c 0 c e v m where q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the ion exchange layer c 0 mg l is the na2cro4 concentration of the initial solution c e mg l is the equilibrium na2cro4 concentration v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the mass of the ion exchange layer the maximum adsorption capacity was evaluated by the typical langmuir and freundlich isotherm models garcía zubiri et al 2009 langmuir isotherm model formula q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e linearized expression c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m freundlich isotherm model formula q e k f c e 1 n linearized expression ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q m is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and k l represents an equilibrium constant related to the affinity between ion exchange layer and ions k f refers to freundlich adsorption capacity n represents the difficulty of adsorption the adsorption kinetics of heavy metal ions can be fitted with a pseudo first order kinetic model and a pseudo second order kinetic model yang et al 2022 pseudo first order kinetic model formula q q e 1 e k 1 t linearized expression in q e q t in q e k 1 t pseudo second order kinetic model formula q q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t linearized expression t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t are the amounts of na2cro4 adsorbed at equilibrium and after time t k 1 and k 2 are the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order rate constant respectively 2 7 the electro deionization system as shown in fig s4 the titanium sheets in the filter tank are respectively connected to the positive and negative electrodes of the dc power supply and the inf membrane is placed in the middle of the two titanium sheets the 2wt na2so4 solution is delivered to the filter tank through a pump a voltage of 10 v was applied to regenerate the saturated ion exchange layer the saturated ion exchange layer was regenerated via the edi system the inf membrane was placed between the electrodes in the electric regeneration step the aqueous solution was circulated at a speed of 10 l h 1 and a constant current was applied generally the following reactions mainly occur in the electrode and ion exchange layer h 2 o h o h water electrolysis a h r x r h x a cation resins regeneration bo h r y r oh y b anion resins regeneration the cation exchange and anion exchange resins were regenerated by the h and oh produced by water splitting respectively we divided the regeneration step into two stages to regenerate the anion exchange resin and cation exchange resin to the same degree in the first 15 min the top electrode was used as the anode and the edi system was powered with a rated current of 10 v in the next 15 min the top electrode served as the cathode and the edi system was supplied with a rated current of 10 v 3 results and discussion 3 1 hierarchical construction of all in one inf membranes the all in one inf membrane substrate was prepared by the one step co casting method fig s1 fu et al 2021 a hierarchical dual layer structure was constructed with a top layer consisting of pure pes and a bottom layer containing a blend of pes and ier the ier was a mixture of anion exchange and cation exchange resins with a weight ratio of 2 1 table s2 a typical ip process was performed on the substrate to form a dense polyamide layer fig s2 another two substrates with a single layer of pure pes and a single layer of pes and ier were also prepared respectively for comparison figs 2 a f show the morphology of three membranes from pes ier and pes ier substrates table s1 records their composition when ier is added the membrane surface changes from a smooth state to a wavy structure which is prone to cause defects figs 2 and s5 this may be because the ier and polymer are immiscible which leads to excessive differences in the phase transition rate of each region of the ion exchange layer figs 2g i provide a better understanding of how iers affect the formation of the interfacial polymerization layer after the interfacial polymerization reaction was performed the ier substrate did not show a uniform and dense nodule structure due to the difficulty of forming a continuous and uniform ip layer on a wavy structure surface lu and elimelech 2021 peng et al 2020 song et al 2017 the above results indicate that a single ion exchange layer cannot be directly used as a substrate for the ip layer therefore we prepared a one step co casted dual layer substrate with pes as the top layer while the bottom layer contained pes and ier the dual layer substrate exhibits a smooth surface which is suitable for forming a defect free interfacial polymerization layer fig s6 further demonstrates the successful preparation of inf membranes fig 3 a shows the infrared spectra of the three substrate surfaces after the ier exchange resin was added the ier substrate showed a characteristic absorption band of so3h from the cation exchange resin at 1034 cm 1 ma et al 2021 the vibration of the quaternary amine group of the anion exchange resin is not observed in the infrared spectrum because the characteristic band intensity of the quaternary amine group is weak we did not observe the vibration of the characteristic band of the so3h group on the upper surface of the ier pes substrate which is attributed to the pes layer covering the ier layer in addition the so3h group was detected on the bottom surface of the pes ier substrate indicating that the cation exchange resin was introduced into the dual layer substrate furthermore xps was used to study the element content on the membrane surface figs s7 s8 and table s3 n element was not detected in the pes substrate after adding the ier the n element from the quaternary amine group of the anion exchange resin was detected in the pes ier substrate the above results indicate that the anion exchange resins were successfully introduced into the dual layer substrate the ion exchange layer composed of ier and pes may significantly impact the membrane separation performance 3 2 separation performance of the all in one inf membrane the influence of the ion exchange layer on the separation performance was evaluated with a series of salts featuring various valences fig 3b mgcl2 na2so4 and mgso4 were chosen as the model molecules where mgcl2 and na2so4 are cation and anion dominated asymmetric salts respectively and mgso4 is symmetric salt the nf membrane without the ion exchange layer was used as the control group the inf membrane has a remarkable rejection for salts with different charges in which the rejection rate of na2so4 is 99 13 mgso4 is 98 65 and mgcl2 is 97 19 the nf membrane shows an excellent rejection of na2so4 and mgso4 but the rejection rate of mgcl2 is poor we have also conducted various other salt permeation experiments fig s9 and the inf membrane performance with ion exchange functions is higher than that of the original nf membrane this is because the nf membrane mainly rejects salt solutes through size exclusion and the donnan effect the nf membrane prepared by a typical ip process exhibits a specific negative charge on the membrane surface due to the donnan effect negatively charged membranes tend to show high rejection for negatively charged ions while the rejection of positively charged ions is relatively poor therefore it is difficult for nf membranes to exhibit excellent rejection rates for both positively and negatively charged ions due to the influence of the ion exchange layer the inf membrane exhibits indiscriminately superior rejection of both positively charged and negatively charged ions the above results show that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions can potentially remove ions with different charges in wastewater containing complex metal ion mixtures 3 3 surface pore size and charge of all in one inf membrane to further verify the separation mechanism of the inf membrane for ions the solute transport method was used to characterize the membrane pore size and an electrokinetic analyzer was used to study the surface charge changes of the membrane generally the salt rejection rate difference can be attributed to the membrane pore size and membrane surface charge changes déon et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however figs 3c 3d and s10 s12 show that the addition of ier does not change the membrane pore size and surface charge the unique dual layer structure dramatically reduces the influence of the ion exchange layer on the ip layer so the membrane pore size and surface charge are not altered significantly the above results indicate that the unique separation mechanism of the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions is not due to size exclusion and the donnan effect but is attributable to the adsorption of ions by the ion exchange layer 3 4 adsorption isotherm kinetics to understand the adsorption mechanism of the ion exchange layer we investigated the adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics of the pes ier substrate ou et al 2020 we use na2cro4 as a model molecule because the na2cro4 solution is yellow the pes ier substrate will show evident color changes after adsorbing the na2cro4 fig s13 figs 3e and s15 show the adsorption isotherm of the pes ier substrate for different concentrations of na2cro4 and table s4 shows the fitting results the correlation coefficient of the freundlich model is higher than that of the langmuir model indicating that the freundlich model better describes the equilibrium isotherm it shows that the adsorption of ions is dominated by chemical adsorption chen et al 2021b the value of freundlich constant 1 n is 0 36 which indicates that rapid adsorption occurs in contrast the pes substrate has almost no adsorption capacity for na2cro4 because the membrane surface color and the ion concentration of the solution before and after adsorption do not change figs s13 and s14 similarly the static adsorption experiment is used to study the adsorption kinetics of the ion exchange layer the concentration of the na2cro4 solution is 50 mg l the volume is 100 ml and the mass of the pes ier membrane is 0 1 g fig 3f is the adsorption kinetic curve of the ion pes ier membrane the pseudo first order kinetic model and the pseudo second order kinetic were used to fit the data in fig 3f linearly by observing the fitting curve figs s16 and s17 the adsorption behavior of metal ions by pes ier is more in line with the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 9999 in contrast the fitting correlation coefficient of the pseudo first order dynamics is lower which is 0 67 figs s18 and s19 the above results show that the adsorption rate of metal ions by the inf membrane is controlled by chemical adsorption which is consistent with the result of the adsorption isotherm model the inf membrane has an excellent ability to remove heavy metal ions indiscriminately due to the chemical adsorption effect of the ion exchange layer 3 5 membrane performance optimization we studied the effect of ier content and ion exchange layer thickness on separation performance as shown in fig 4 a as the ier content increases the salt rejection rate increases since a higher loading of ier provides more adsorption sites however when the ratio of ier content to pes content exceeds 0 6 the ion exchange layer has evident particle agglomeration fig s20 which reduces adsorption sites and salt rejection in addition as the thickness of the ion exchange layer increases the salt rejection rate decreases instead fig 4b an excessively thick ion exchange layer leads to a slow phase inversion of pes which gives the ier enough time to adsorb each other and cause severe particle agglomeration fig s21 figs 4c e provide a schematic illustration to assist in understanding the above process based on the above results the optimal ratio of ier content to pes content is 0 6 and the ion layer thickness is 100 μm 3 6 stability to evaluate the stability of the inf membrane in harsh environments we performed filtration experiments with a series of mgcl2 solutions and compared the separation performance of the nf membrane without ier as shown in fig 5 a with the salt concentration increasing the performance of the nf membrane continues to decline when the salt concentration reaches 10 000 ppm the rejection rate of the nf membrane is only 78 95 when the salt concentration is too high the membrane pores swell thereby reducing the separation performance of the membrane ding et al 2020 escoda et al 2010 it is worth noting that the inf membrane still exhibits remarkable performance in high concentration salt solutions and the salt rejection rate only drops from 97 62 to 93 00 which is much higher than the nf membrane we also investigated the effect of na2so4 concentration on membrane performance and the trend was the same as that of mgcl2 fig s22 the superior salt rejection is attributed to the adsorption of the ion exchange layer the above results show that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions can maintain excellent separation performance in high concentration salt containing solutions in addition to stability in harsh environments long term stability is also an important indicator for evaluating membrane performance therefore we conducted a desalination experiment for 64 h the salt rejection rate of the inf membrane drops from 97 86 to 95 36 attributed to the continuous desalination process that causes some ier to reach saturation although the performance is slightly reduced the salt removal rate in the whole process is still higher than that of the nf membrane fig 5b the above results indicate that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has exceptional long term desalination ability 3 7 removal of various heavy metal ions by all in one inf membrane we explored the separation performance of the inf membrane in heavy metal wastewater na2wo4 na2cro4 nicl2 and cdcl2 were used as model molecules respectively where na2wo4 and na2cro4 are heavy metal oxyanions nicl2 and cdcl2 are heavy metal cations by dissolving 1 g na2wo4 na2cro4 nicl2 and cdcl2 in 1 l deionized water respectively we prepared some feed solution with a concentration of 1000 ppm fig 5c shows the removal rates of different heavy metal ions for the two membranes consistent with the expected results the nf membrane has a higher rejection rate of heavy metal oxyanions and a lower rejection rate of heavy metal cations the surface of the nf membrane is negatively charged due to the donnan effect it has better rejection of anions and poor rejection of cations the surface of the inf membrane is also negatively charged and some heavy metal cations will pass through the interfacial polymerization layer when the leaked ions reach the ion exchange layer they will be adsorbed by the exchange groups of the ion exchange resin zhang et al 2022 therefore the inf membrane has excellent removal rates for both heavy metal oxyanions and heavy metal cations due to the synergistic effect of the interfacial polymerization and ion exchange layers the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions exhibits remarkable heavy metal ion removal ability generally the ph and concentration of the heavy metal solution will significantly affect the separation performance of the membrane na2cro4 was used as a model molecule as shown in fig 5d when the ph of the solution is 10 the inf membrane and the nf membrane have the highest rejection rate of heavy metal ions when the ph of the solution is less than 7 the separation performance of the membrane is poor because h destroys the structure of the interfacial polymerization layer park et al 2020 in addition under lower ph conditions the negative charge of the membrane is weakened which will also lead to a decrease in the rejection rate however in the entire ph range the rejection rate of the inf membrane is higher than that of the nf membrane attributed to the ion exchange layer to make up for the performance loss caused by the membrane surface defects the influence of concentration on the removal rate of metal ions is shown in fig 5e as the concentration increases the rejection rate of heavy metal ions of both membranes increases the higher the concentration of chromate the stronger the hydrolysis which increases the ph of the solution and improves the rejection of chromate li et al 2021 at the same time under different feed concentrations the inf membrane all showed better rejection rates which further confirms that the ion exchange layer can significantly improve the removal rate of heavy metal ions 3 8 the sustainable adsorption desorption cycling of all in one inf membrane the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has application value in removing heavy metals and can achieve sustainable application through edi regeneration technology the conventional regeneration technology mainly uses a high concentration acid solution or alkali solution as a backwash solution which requires additional chemical reagents and produces acidic wastewater and alkaline wash wastewater xu et al 2003 in this study a green edi process was used to evaluate the reusability of the membrane the edi process uses the h and oh produced by water electrolysis to regenerate the saturated ion exchange layer palakkal et al 2020 rathi and kumar 2020 this process circumvents the input of chemical reagents and avoids the generation of new polluted wastewater when the adsorption reaches saturation the removal rate of na2cro4 drops from the initial 97 23 to 91 04 when the edi process is used for regeneration the removal rate of na2cro4 returns to 96 47 fig 5f table s3 shows that after testing the na2cro4 solution cr element and na element were detected in the inf membrane the element content of the nf membrane before and after the test did not change after edi regeneration the cr element and na element in the inf membrane disappear proving the effectiveness of edi regeneration technology as the number of saturated regeneration cycles increases the removal rate only slightly decreases after 8 consecutive cycles the removal rate of na2cro4 remained at 95 58 indicating that most of the adsorption sites of the ion exchange layer can still adsorb heavy metal ions as shown in figs 5g and s13 when the inf membrane adsorbs a large amount of na2cro4 the color of the membrane surface changes from white to yellow after edi regeneration the membrane surface returned to white which further supports the reusability of the inf membrane the above results show that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has excellent heavy metal removal ability and can achieve a sustainable membrane separation process through the edi process 3 9 separation performance comparison table s5 compares the heavy metal ion removal capacity of this work and other work the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has good pure water permeability and rejection rate to heavy metal oxyanions and heavy metal cations the above results indicate that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has great potential in treating heavy metal wastewater with complex components 4 conclusion in summary we achieved the hierarchical integration of nanofiltration and ion exchange into inf membranes compared with conventional single membrane separation and split integration processes the all in one integration technology can achieve highly efficient indiscriminate heavy metal ion removal the nanofiltration layer can remove most of the heavy metal oxyanions and part of the heavy metal cations preventing premature saturation of the ion exchange layer the ion exchange layer can remove heavy metal cations and oxyanions that leak from the nanofiltration layer via the ion exchange process when the ion exchange layer reaches adsorption saturation the saturated ier can be regenerated by the edi process to achieve sustainable cycling and regeneration of the membrane significantly the fabricating method of the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions is efficient and straightforward this facile and scalable method may open a pathway for removing

layer pes ier substrate the anion exchange resin and the cation exchange resin mass ration 2 1 were placed in a freeze dryer scientz 18 n to dry for 8 h to remove moisture then the resins were put into a planetary nano ball mill mitr 260 for pulverization finally the pulverized resin powder was filtered with a 400 mesh screen to obtain the required resin powder a prescribed amount of pes was dissolved in the mixed solution of dmac and peg and vigorously stirred at 56 c for 8 h to prepare a pes solution subsequently the pes solution and the ier powder were mixed and vigorously stirred at 30 c until a uniform pes ier solution was formed the dual layer pes ier substrate was prepared by a one step co casting method using the above solution the detailed preparation method of the dual layer membrane can be found in supporting information fig s1 2 2 2 preparation of the all in one inf membrane the membrane was prepared on the pes ier substrate by interfacial polymerization the detailed preparation steps of the nf membrane can be found in supporting information fig s2 the obtained membrane was marked inf membrane and stored in deionized water for comparison we prepared an nf membrane without incorporating resins as a control membrane the detailed preparation conditions of all membranes are summarized in table s1 2 3 characterization of materials and membranes the membrane morphology was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem hitachi s4800 the membrane was freeze dried for 8 h cracked in liquid nitrogen and coated with gold to visualize morphologies atomic force microscopy afm autoprobe cp research bruker usa was used to observe the membrane surface roughness the chemical composition and structure of the nf and inf membranes were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir thermo scientific nicolet 8700 and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher k alpha respectively all spectra within the wavenumber range from 2000 to 800 cm 1 were recorded for each sample the inf membrane with ion exchange function consists of four layers interfacial polymerization layer pes substrate layer ion exchange layer and non woven fabric to characterize the ion exchange layer the non woven fabric needs to be peeled off then ft ir and xps were used to characterize the bottom of the ion exchange layer the zeta potential on the membrane surface was measured by an electrokinetic analyzer anton paar surpass the mesoporosity and specific surface area of the nf membrane and inf membrane were determined by the pore volume which was determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet method asap2466 specific surface area and pore analyzer 2 4 membrane performance test a cross flow filtration device was used to evaluate the performance of the membrane fig s3 the test pressure is 6 bar the effective membrane area is 3 14 cm2 and the flow rate is 30 l h before each test the membrane was pre stabilized in the test solution for 1 h at 7 bar to obtain stable performance the permeate stream is not recycled under all test conditions the following equation was used to calculate the pure water permeance pwp p w p v a m t δ p where v is the volume of permeate l a m is the effective filtration area m2 t is the testing time h and p is the testing pressure bar the removal rate of heavy metal ions was determined by the concentration of heavy metal ions in the feed side c f and permeate side c p the concentration of heavy metal ions was tested by icp oes perkin elmer optima7000dv the concentration of other salts was measured with a conductivity meter mettler toledo fe30 hence the following equation was used to determine the solute rejection r r 1 c p c f 100 if there is no special instruction the test condition defaults to the transmembrane pressure is 6 bar the solute concentration is 1000 ppm the pre stabilized time is 1 h and the testing time is 1 h 2 5 membrane pore size test 100 ppm polyethylene glycol solution of different molecular weights was used as the feed solution and used to measure the membrane pore size and pore size distribution the total organic carbon analyzer toc elementar vario was used to analyze the solute concentration on the feed and permeate sides the pore size distribution of the membrane can be expressed as follows d r t r p d r p 1 r p ln σ p 2 π exp ln r p ln μ p 2 2 ln σ p 2 where r p is the effective pore radius of the membrane μ p is the molecular radius when r 50 and σ p is the ratio of the molecular radius when r 84 13 to the molecular radius when r 50 the membrane molecular weight cut off mwco is equal to the molecular radius when r 90 more detailed information is described in the previous work chung et al 2022 sun et al 2010 2 6 adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics a certain amount of single layer ier membrane was immersed in 50 ml na2cro4 solution with a concentration range of 5 200 ppm to measure the adsorption capacity of the ion exchange layer then the solution was stirred at 25 c and 160 rpm for several hours until reaching adsorption equilibrium the following formula is used to calculate the ion adsorption capacity of the ion exchange layer q e c 0 c e v m where q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the ion exchange layer c 0 mg l is the na2cro4 concentration of the initial solution c e mg l is the equilibrium na2cro4 concentration v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the mass of the ion exchange layer the maximum adsorption capacity was evaluated by the typical langmuir and freundlich isotherm models garcía zubiri et al 2009 langmuir isotherm model formula q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e linearized expression c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m freundlich isotherm model formula q e k f c e 1 n linearized expression ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q m is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and k l represents an equilibrium constant related to the affinity between ion exchange layer and ions k f refers to freundlich adsorption capacity n represents the difficulty of adsorption the adsorption kinetics of heavy metal ions can be fitted with a pseudo first order kinetic model and a pseudo second order kinetic model yang et al 2022 pseudo first order kinetic model formula q q e 1 e k 1 t linearized expression in q e q t in q e k 1 t pseudo second order kinetic model formula q q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t linearized expression t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t are the amounts of na2cro4 adsorbed at equilibrium and after time t k 1 and k 2 are the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order rate constant respectively 2 7 the electro deionization system as shown in fig s4 the titanium sheets in the filter tank are respectively connected to the positive and negative electrodes of the dc power supply and the inf membrane is placed in the middle of the two titanium sheets the 2wt na2so4 solution is delivered to the filter tank through a pump a voltage of 10 v was applied to regenerate the saturated ion exchange layer the saturated ion exchange layer was regenerated via the edi system the inf membrane was placed between the electrodes in the electric regeneration step the aqueous solution was circulated at a speed of 10 l h 1 and a constant current was applied generally the following reactions mainly occur in the electrode and ion exchange layer h 2 o h o h water electrolysis a h r x r h x a cation resins regeneration bo h r y r oh y b anion resins regeneration the cation exchange and anion exchange resins were regenerated by the h and oh produced by water splitting respectively we divided the regeneration step into two stages to regenerate the anion exchange resin and cation exchange resin to the same degree in the first 15 min the top electrode was used as the anode and the edi system was powered with a rated current of 10 v in the next 15 min the top electrode served as the cathode and the edi system was supplied with a rated current of 10 v 3 results and discussion 3 1 hierarchical construction of all in one inf membranes the all in one inf membrane substrate was prepared by the one step co casting method fig s1 fu et al 2021 a hierarchical dual layer structure was constructed with a top layer consisting of pure pes and a bottom layer containing a blend of pes and ier the ier was a mixture of anion exchange and cation exchange resins with a weight ratio of 2 1 table s2 a typical ip process was performed on the substrate to form a dense polyamide layer fig s2 another two substrates with a single layer of pure pes and a single layer of pes and ier were also prepared respectively for comparison figs 2 a f show the morphology of three membranes from pes ier and pes ier substrates table s1 records their composition when ier is added the membrane surface changes from a smooth state to a wavy structure which is prone to cause defects figs 2 and s5 this may be because the ier and polymer are immiscible which leads to excessive differences in the phase transition rate of each region of the ion exchange layer figs 2g i provide a better understanding of how iers affect the formation of the interfacial polymerization layer after the interfacial polymerization reaction was performed the ier substrate did not show a uniform and dense nodule structure due to the difficulty of forming a continuous and uniform ip layer on a wavy structure surface lu and elimelech 2021 peng et al 2020 song et al 2017 the above results indicate that a single ion exchange layer cannot be directly used as a substrate for the ip layer therefore we prepared a one step co casted dual layer substrate with pes as the top layer while the bottom layer contained pes and ier the dual layer substrate exhibits a smooth surface which is suitable for forming a defect free interfacial polymerization layer fig s6 further demonstrates the successful preparation of inf membranes fig 3 a shows the infrared spectra of the three substrate surfaces after the ier exchange resin was added the ier substrate showed a characteristic absorption band of so3h from the cation exchange resin at 1034 cm 1 ma et al 2021 the vibration of the quaternary amine group of the anion exchange resin is not observed in the infrared spectrum because the characteristic band intensity of the quaternary amine group is weak we did not observe the vibration of the characteristic band of the so3h group on the upper surface of the ier pes substrate which is attributed to the pes layer covering the ier layer in addition the so3h group was detected on the bottom surface of the pes ier substrate indicating that the cation exchange resin was introduced into the dual layer substrate furthermore xps was used to study the element content on the membrane surface figs s7 s8 and table s3 n element was not detected in the pes substrate after adding the ier the n element from the quaternary amine group of the anion exchange resin was detected in the pes ier substrate the above results indicate that the anion exchange resins were successfully introduced into the dual layer substrate the ion exchange layer composed of ier and pes may significantly impact the membrane separation performance 3 2 separation performance of the all in one inf membrane the influence of the ion exchange layer on the separation performance was evaluated with a series of salts featuring various valences fig 3b mgcl2 na2so4 and mgso4 were chosen as the model molecules where mgcl2 and na2so4 are cation and anion dominated asymmetric salts respectively and mgso4 is symmetric salt the nf membrane without the ion exchange layer was used as the control group the inf membrane has a remarkable rejection for salts with different charges in which the rejection rate of na2so4 is 99 13 mgso4 is 98 65 and mgcl2 is 97 19 the nf membrane shows an excellent rejection of na2so4 and mgso4 but the rejection rate of mgcl2 is poor we have also conducted various other salt permeation experiments fig s9 and the inf membrane performance with ion exchange functions is higher than that of the original nf membrane this is because the nf membrane mainly rejects salt solutes through size exclusion and the donnan effect the nf membrane prepared by a typical ip process exhibits a specific negative charge on the membrane surface due to the donnan effect negatively charged membranes tend to show high rejection for negatively charged ions while the rejection of positively charged ions is relatively poor therefore it is difficult for nf membranes to exhibit excellent rejection rates for both positively and negatively charged ions due to the influence of the ion exchange layer the inf membrane exhibits indiscriminately superior rejection of both positively charged and negatively charged ions the above results show that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions can potentially remove ions with different charges in wastewater containing complex metal ion mixtures 3 3 surface pore size and charge of all in one inf membrane to further verify the separation mechanism of the inf membrane for ions the solute transport method was used to characterize the membrane pore size and an electrokinetic analyzer was used to study the surface charge changes of the membrane generally the salt rejection rate difference can be attributed to the membrane pore size and membrane surface charge changes déon et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however figs 3c 3d and s10 s12 show that the addition of ier does not change the membrane pore size and surface charge the unique dual layer structure dramatically reduces the influence of the ion exchange layer on the ip layer so the membrane pore size and surface charge are not altered significantly the above results indicate that the unique separation mechanism of the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions is not due to size exclusion and the donnan effect but is attributable to the adsorption of ions by the ion exchange layer 3 4 adsorption isotherm kinetics to understand the adsorption mechanism of the ion exchange layer we investigated the adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics of the pes ier substrate ou et al 2020 we use na2cro4 as a model molecule because the na2cro4 solution is yellow the pes ier substrate will show evident color changes after adsorbing the na2cro4 fig s13 figs 3e and s15 show the adsorption isotherm of the pes ier substrate for different concentrations of na2cro4 and table s4 shows the fitting results the correlation coefficient of the freundlich model is higher than that of the langmuir model indicating that the freundlich model better describes the equilibrium isotherm it shows that the adsorption of ions is dominated by chemical adsorption chen et al 2021b the value of freundlich constant 1 n is 0 36 which indicates that rapid adsorption occurs in contrast the pes substrate has almost no adsorption capacity for na2cro4 because the membrane surface color and the ion concentration of the solution before and after adsorption do not change figs s13 and s14 similarly the static adsorption experiment is used to study the adsorption kinetics of the ion exchange layer the concentration of the na2cro4 solution is 50 mg l the volume is 100 ml and the mass of the pes ier membrane is 0 1 g fig 3f is the adsorption kinetic curve of the ion pes ier membrane the pseudo first order kinetic model and the pseudo second order kinetic were used to fit the data in fig 3f linearly by observing the fitting curve figs s16 and s17 the adsorption behavior of metal ions by pes ier is more in line with the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 9999 in contrast the fitting correlation coefficient of the pseudo first order dynamics is lower which is 0 67 figs s18 and s19 the above results show that the adsorption rate of metal ions by the inf membrane is controlled by chemical adsorption which is consistent with the result of the adsorption isotherm model the inf membrane has an excellent ability to remove heavy metal ions indiscriminately due to the chemical adsorption effect of the ion exchange layer 3 5 membrane performance optimization we studied the effect of ier content and ion exchange layer thickness on separation performance as shown in fig 4 a as the ier content increases the salt rejection rate increases since a higher loading of ier provides more adsorption sites however when the ratio of ier content to pes content exceeds 0 6 the ion exchange layer has evident particle agglomeration fig s20 which reduces adsorption sites and salt rejection in addition as the thickness of the ion exchange layer increases the salt rejection rate decreases instead fig 4b an excessively thick ion exchange layer leads to a slow phase inversion of pes which gives the ier enough time to adsorb each other and cause severe particle agglomeration fig s21 figs 4c e provide a schematic illustration to assist in understanding the above process based on the above results the optimal ratio of ier content to pes content is 0 6 and the ion layer thickness is 100 μm 3 6 stability to evaluate the stability of the inf membrane in harsh environments we performed filtration experiments with a series of mgcl2 solutions and compared the separation performance of the nf membrane without ier as shown in fig 5 a with the salt concentration increasing the performance of the nf membrane continues to decline when the salt concentration reaches 10 000 ppm the rejection rate of the nf membrane is only 78 95 when the salt concentration is too high the membrane pores swell thereby reducing the separation performance of the membrane ding et al 2020 escoda et al 2010 it is worth noting that the inf membrane still exhibits remarkable performance in high concentration salt solutions and the salt rejection rate only drops from 97 62 to 93 00 which is much higher than the nf membrane we also investigated the effect of na2so4 concentration on membrane performance and the trend was the same as that of mgcl2 fig s22 the superior salt rejection is attributed to the adsorption of the ion exchange layer the above results show that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions can maintain excellent separation performance in high concentration salt containing solutions in addition to stability in harsh environments long term stability is also an important indicator for evaluating membrane performance therefore we conducted a desalination experiment for 64 h the salt rejection rate of the inf membrane drops from 97 86 to 95 36 attributed to the continuous desalination process that causes some ier to reach saturation although the performance is slightly reduced the salt removal rate in the whole process is still higher than that of the nf membrane fig 5b the above results indicate that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has exceptional long term desalination ability 3 7 removal of various heavy metal ions by all in one inf membrane we explored the separation performance of the inf membrane in heavy metal wastewater na2wo4 na2cro4 nicl2 and cdcl2 were used as model molecules respectively where na2wo4 and na2cro4 are heavy metal oxyanions nicl2 and cdcl2 are heavy metal cations by dissolving 1 g na2wo4 na2cro4 nicl2 and cdcl2 in 1 l deionized water respectively we prepared some feed solution with a concentration of 1000 ppm fig 5c shows the removal rates of different heavy metal ions for the two membranes consistent with the expected results the nf membrane has a higher rejection rate of heavy metal oxyanions and a lower rejection rate of heavy metal cations the surface of the nf membrane is negatively charged due to the donnan effect it has better rejection of anions and poor rejection of cations the surface of the inf membrane is also negatively charged and some heavy metal cations will pass through the interfacial polymerization layer when the leaked ions reach the ion exchange layer they will be adsorbed by the exchange groups of the ion exchange resin zhang et al 2022 therefore the inf membrane has excellent removal rates for both heavy metal oxyanions and heavy metal cations due to the synergistic effect of the interfacial polymerization and ion exchange layers the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions exhibits remarkable heavy metal ion removal ability generally the ph and concentration of the heavy metal solution will significantly affect the separation performance of the membrane na2cro4 was used as a model molecule as shown in fig 5d when the ph of the solution is 10 the inf membrane and the nf membrane have the highest rejection rate of heavy metal ions when the ph of the solution is less than 7 the separation performance of the membrane is poor because h destroys the structure of the interfacial polymerization layer park et al 2020 in addition under lower ph conditions the negative charge of the membrane is weakened which will also lead to a decrease in the rejection rate however in the entire ph range the rejection rate of the inf membrane is higher than that of the nf membrane attributed to the ion exchange layer to make up for the performance loss caused by the membrane surface defects the influence of concentration on the removal rate of metal ions is shown in fig 5e as the concentration increases the rejection rate of heavy metal ions of both membranes increases the higher the concentration of chromate the stronger the hydrolysis which increases the ph of the solution and improves the rejection of chromate li et al 2021 at the same time under different feed concentrations the inf membrane all showed better rejection rates which further confirms that the ion exchange layer can significantly improve the removal rate of heavy metal ions 3 8 the sustainable adsorption desorption cycling of all in one inf membrane the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has application value in removing heavy metals and can achieve sustainable application through edi regeneration technology the conventional regeneration technology mainly uses a high concentration acid solution or alkali solution as a backwash solution which requires additional chemical reagents and produces acidic wastewater and alkaline wash wastewater xu et al 2003 in this study a green edi process was used to evaluate the reusability of the membrane the edi process uses the h and oh produced by water electrolysis to regenerate the saturated ion exchange layer palakkal et al 2020 rathi and kumar 2020 this process circumvents the input of chemical reagents and avoids the generation of new polluted wastewater when the adsorption reaches saturation the removal rate of na2cro4 drops from the initial 97 23 to 91 04 when the edi process is used for regeneration the removal rate of na2cro4 returns to 96 47 fig 5f table s3 shows that after testing the na2cro4 solution cr element and na element were detected in the inf membrane the element content of the nf membrane before and after the test did not change after edi regeneration the cr element and na element in the inf membrane disappear proving the effectiveness of edi regeneration technology as the number of saturated regeneration cycles increases the removal rate only slightly decreases after 8 consecutive cycles the removal rate of na2cro4 remained at 95 58 indicating that most of the adsorption sites of the ion exchange layer can still adsorb heavy metal ions as shown in figs 5g and s13 when the inf membrane adsorbs a large amount of na2cro4 the color of the membrane surface changes from white to yellow after edi regeneration the membrane surface returned to white which further supports the reusability of the inf membrane the above results show that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has excellent heavy metal removal ability and can achieve a sustainable membrane separation process through the edi process 3 9 separation performance comparison table s5 compares the heavy metal ion removal capacity of this work and other work the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has good pure water permeability and rejection rate to heavy metal oxyanions and heavy metal cations the above results indicate that the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions has great potential in treating heavy metal wastewater with complex components 4 conclusion in summary we achieved the hierarchical integration of nanofiltration and ion exchange into inf membranes compared with conventional single membrane separation and split integration processes the all in one integration technology can achieve highly efficient indiscriminate heavy metal ion removal the nanofiltration layer can remove most of the heavy metal oxyanions and part of the heavy metal cations preventing premature saturation of the ion exchange layer the ion exchange layer can remove heavy metal cations and oxyanions that leak from the nanofiltration layer via the ion exchange process when the ion exchange layer reaches adsorption saturation the saturated ier can be regenerated by the edi process to achieve sustainable cycling and regeneration of the membrane significantly the fabricating method of the inf membrane with nanofiltration and ion exchange functions is efficient and straightforward this facile and scalable method may open a pathway for removing

15656,the impact of nickel ni2 on the performance of anodic electroactive biofilms eabs in the bioelectrochemical system bes was investigated in this study although it has been reported that ni2 influences microorganisms in a number of ways it is unknown how its presence in the anode of a bes affects extracellular electron transfer eet of eabs microbial viability and the bacterial community results revealed that the addition of ni2 decreased power output from 673 24 12 40 mw m2 at 0 mg l to 179 26 9 05 mw m2 at 80 mg l the metal and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies of the microbial fuel cells mfcs declined as ni2 concentration increased which could be attributed to decreased microbial viability as revealed by sem and clsm ftir analysis revealed the involvement of various microbial biofilm functional groups including hydroxyl amides methyl amine and carboxyl in the uptake of ni2 the presence of ni2 on the anodic biofilms was confirmed by sem eds and xps analyses cv demonstrated that the electron transfer performance of the anodic biofilms was negatively correlated with the various ni2 concentrations eis showed that the internal resistance of the mfcs increased with increasing ni2 concentration resulting in a decrease in power output high throughput sequencing results revealed a decrease in geobacter and an increase in desulfovibrio in response to ni2 concentrations of 10 20 40 and 80 mg l furthermore the various ni2 concentrations decreased the expression of eet related genes the ni2 fed mfcs had a higher abundance of the nikr gene than the control group which was important for ni2 resistance this work advances our understanding of ni2 inhibition on eabs as well as the concurrent removal of organic matter and ni2 from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nickel ii anodic electroactive biofilms bioelectrochemical system microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nickel ni2 is a heavy metal that is frequently found in domestic and industrial wastewaters due to its vast range of industrial applications including electroplating metal finishing mineral processing coinage stainless steel and battery production among other applications kumar et al 2019 noman et al 2021 while ni2 is an essential macronutrient for the functioning of living organisms at trace levels it can produce detrimental health effects such as gastrointestinal ache diarrhoea pulmonary fibrosis renal oedema cardiovascular and kidney diseases as well as cancer at excessive doses islam et al 2019 additionally it is non biodegradable and has the ability to permeate organisms cells causing harm to protein structure and function and even inducing dna damage guo et al 2019 parades aguilar et al 2021 numerous approaches for removing ni2 from wastewaters have been developed which include adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange and membrane filtration qasem et al 2021 however the above mentioned treatment techniques are cost prohibitive generate toxic sludge and consumes exorbitant energy and chemical crini and lichtfouse 2019 on the other hand a bioelectrochemical system bes is an efficient and environmentally friendly technique for recovering metallic products and nutrients from wastewater yang et al 2019b currently microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs of bes have both been studied extensively li et al 2015 mfc generally employs microbial metabolism to generate electricity and reduce metals e g hg2 au3 cr6 ag and cu2 with high reduction potential kaushik and singh 2020 in mfc electron transport from the anodic region to the cathodic chamber often becomes thermodynamically unfavorable upon the addition of lower redox potential metals such as ni2 cd2 co2 pb2 and zn2 as a result it is difficult to trigger the movement of electrons in the mfc from the anodic region to the cathode unless an external electrical energy source is applied i e mec nancharaiah et al 2015 therefore it is self evident that a huge quantum of electricity will be required to operate these mec reactors commercially in the future thus increasing operational costs ai et al 2020a the configurations of mfc mainly include single and dual chamber from the economic standpoint the single chamber mfc is preferable because it eliminates the need for additional separate membrane materials thus lowering the operational cost unlike in the dual chamber mfc in previous studies the removal of ni2 from the abiotic cathode of mec was accomplished via the application of voltage whereas organic matter in the anodic region served as electron donors cai et al 2016 luo et al 2014 qin et al 2012 a study by singh and kaushik 2021 also reported 97 ni2 removal in biocathode mfc however in these studies the cathodic medium solutions contained only ni2 whereas most real wastewater from animal farms mining processing printing textile and other industries usually contain both heavy metals and organics pathak et al 2009 due to growing concerns about rising energy demands researchers are becoming more interested in removing ni2 and organics simultaneously liu et al 2019 investigated the effect of ni2 2 93 5 87 8 80 11 7 14 7 17 6 20 5 23 5 and 26 4 mg l low standard electrode potential on the anode including removal efficiency migration and distribution and obtained removal rates which were nearly greater than 96 similarly gai et al 2018 studied the impact of ni2 50 600 μmol l and 600 1000 μmol l on the anode of an mfc and revealed that a low concentration of ni2 50 200 µmol l could improve mfc performance whereas a ni2 concentration greater than 600 µmol l decreases the voltage output however these studies did not comprehensively investigate how the presence of ni2 in the anodes of the mfcs influenced extracellular electron transfer eet of electroactive biofilms eabs the suppression mechanism the microbial viability microbial community and functional genes related to both electricity production and ni2 resistance previous investigations have shown that ni2 200 µg ml 0 4 mm and 0 5 mm is harmful and could inhibit microbial activities including biofilm formation syed et al 2021 vega et al 2014 in contrast other researchers have found that ni2 can boost the activity of microorganisms for example the inclusion of 1 mg l ni2 enhanced pseudomonas putida biodegradation of toluene and trichloroethylene in a sequencing batch reactor yang et al 2019a it was also revealed that 100 µm ni2 increased biofilm development in escherichia coli k 12 as an adaptive mechanism via a transcriptional influence on genes encoding for adhesion structures perrin et al 2009 recently pavlic et al 2021 found that when bacteria were exposed to moderate ni2 concentrations 250 and 500 µg ml they adhered better to archwires and formed a biofilm than the control strain however these studies were not conducted in a bes and therefore it is quite difficult to ascertain the effect of ni2 on eabs attached to the anode moreover the effect of ni2 on microbial biofilms in the preceding investigations differs from eabs which have a more intricate eet and metabolic pathway in a bes eabs degrade organic materials releasing electrons that are eventually transferred via an external circuit to the anode to generate electrical energy hence eabs on the anode of bes are critical for efficient eet and maximization of current output while it is well established that high ni2 concentration has detrimental effects on living organisms its effects on eabs in a bes have not yet been reported it has been reported that heavy metals i e cu2 cd2 and zn2 may inhibit eabs in so many ways including direct inhibition of biofilm development and suppression of outer membrane cytochrome secretion abourached et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a however to our knowledge no comprehensive study has been conducted to determine how the presence of ni2 in the anode of bes affects electron transfer of eabs microbial survival the diversity of microbes and the functional genes related to electricity production and ni2 resistance in the current study we investigated how different ni2 concentrations affect bes anode eabs and current outputs experiments were carried out to assess the bes performance with varied ni2 concentrations including changes in biofilm viability microbial community and functional genes related to eet and ni2 resistance in addition electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were employed to investigate the anodic activity of eabs in the presence of ni2 this study sheds light on the impact of ni2 on eab revealing possible mechanisms involved which provides a basis for the simultaneous removal of organic matter and ni2 from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes reactor configuration and operation in this work single compartment mfcs were employed to investigate the effects of different ni2 concentrations on eabs and current outputs the single compartment mfcs which possessed 28 ml volume were made with polymethyl methacrylate as detailed in our previous research fig s1 amanze et al 2022 in each mfc a carbon brush with a 1 5 cm radius and a length of 3 cm was used as the anode while a carbon cloth with a surface area of 7 07 cm2 served as the cathode these two components i e anode and cathode were connected with a 1000 ω external resistor via a titanium wire the pretreatment of the carbon cloth and carbon brush was described in detail in our previous research ai et al 2020b each mfc was inoculated with 20 ml sludge obtained from the xinkaipu wastewater treatment plant in changsha china the electroactive biofilm in each mfc was enriched with a medium containing lactate 20 mm as a substrate 100 μl l trace element solution and 50 mm phosphate buffer supplemented with 0 5 ml l wolfe s vitamins as reformed from our previous study ai et al 2020b lactate was chosen as an electron donor because among other substrates such as acetate glucose butyrate and propionate it has proven to be effective in enriching microbial communities and enhancing bes power generation flayac et al 2018 jung and regan 2007 moreover it is also a well known substrate for some dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria nielsen et al 2009 the mfcs were subsequently operated in a fed batch mode in a 30 c incubator the energy substrate in each mfc was replenished when the voltage dropped below 20 mv the mfcs acclimation process lasted approximately four weeks and was stopped when the output voltage was stable in general the ni2 concentration in industrial wastewaters derived from ni production exceeds 10 mg l sun et al 2017 when municipal wastewater treatment plants receive these industrial wastewaters the ni2 concentration in the influent will be even higher thus the study considered the effects of high ni2 concentrations 10 20 40 and 80 mg l after the electroactive biofilms were fully acclimated niso4 7h2o was added to the aforementioned substrate medium solution to attain the desired concentrations each mfc was filled with medium solutions containing varying concentrations of ni2 the anolyte had an initial ph of 6 53 which corresponds to the ph of most real ni wastewater moersidik et al 2020 peng et al 2020 sheng et al 2013 the mfcs were operated for at least four batches to assess the impacts of ni2 on electricity generation control experiments were also carried out in which the anodic chamber was fed medium solutions containing no ni2 all laboratory tests and analyses were carried out in duplicate 2 2 analysis and calculations the voltage produced by each mfc was automatically measured and recorded every 50 s with a data acquisition device adam 4017 analog input model advantech co ltd china coupled to a computer following the maturation of the biofilms and the stability of the peak voltage of each mfc polarization electrode potentials and power density were determined by changing the external resistor as previously reported cheng et al 2013 coulombic efficiency ce was computed using a previously reported method logan et al 2006 eis and cv were performed with a potentiostat gamry reference 600 workstation philadelphia pennsylvania usa in order to determine the electrochemical activity of the bioelectroactive anodes the eis and cv experiments were conducted using a three electrode configuration where cathode anode and saturated ag agcl served as counter working and reference electrodes respectively the eis measurement was carried out with an ac amplitude of 5 mv in the frequency range of 1000 khz to 0 01 hz and the data were evaluated using zview software the cv experiment was conducted at a scan rate of 10 mv s from 0 8 v to 0 2 v the ni2 concentration in the anolyte was measured using an inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometer model spectroblue fms386 ametek materials analysis division kleve germany fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy was used to examine changes in the functional groups of the anodic biofilms following ni2 uptake a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6490lv jeol tokyo japan coupled to an energy dispersive x ray spectrometry edx elect super edax ametek kleve germany analysis tool was employed to investigate the morphologies and elemental composition of the biofilms on the anode the valence states of nickel on the biofilm were analyzed using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo scientific waltham ma usa additionally each mfc anode was analyzed using confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm tcs sp8 leica germany to determine the effect of different concentrations of ni2 on the biofilms 2 3 microbial community analysis the mfcs were disassembled and carbon fibers were taken from various areas of the anodes using sterilized scissors to explore the microbial community associated with anodic biofilms enriched with varied ni2 concentrations total dna was extracted from both the biofilms and the original sludge using the dneasy power soil dna isolation kit qiagen chatsworth ca usa the universal primer pair 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 was used to amplify the v4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16s rdna genes in the samples walters et al 2016 sequencing libraries were then prepared and sequenced using the illumina miseq platform with the pe250 sequencing strategy shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china prior to the following analysis process the illumina adapter and other specific sequences were trimmed afterward pair end reads with a minimum of 10 overlap and less than 5 mismatches were merged magoč and salzberg 2011 uparse was used to generate operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 similarity threshold edgar 2013 rdp classifier was used to phylogenetically assign the taxonomy of otu representative sequences to taxonomic classifications with a confidence threshold of 70 wang et al 2007 the microbial community richness ace and shannon indices as well as chao1 richness estimates were all analyzed using the mothur software package schloss et al 2009 principal component analysis pca was employed to determine the similarity of microbial communities based on the distance matrix all obtained sequence reads have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database accession number srp382106 bioproject id prjna848658 the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was conducted to predict functional genes of the electroactive biofilms based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database langille et al 2013 2 4 functional gene expression analysis the expression of eet related genes pila omce omcc omcs omcz and omcb in biofilms fed with varied ni2 concentrations was quantified in triplicate with an rt pcr detection system cfx96 bio rad usa using primers specified in table s1 chin et al 2004 holmes et al 2006 nevin et al 2009 richter lubna et al

2 5 statistical analysis the p value was computed using analysis of variance anova and the student s t test in the statistical package for social sciences spss version 24 0 an asterisk denotes a significant difference p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 the heatmaps were generated with hemi 1 0 all figures were produced using origin 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 the influence of different ni2 concentrations on mfc performance to examine the influence of ni2 on power production different ni2 concentrations i e 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l were introduced into the anodic chamber of mfcs fig 1 a illustrates the changes in output voltages of the mfcs with time in each cycle the output voltages could swiftly increase to a peak value after replenishing the media in the anodic chambers and then gradually decrease due to nutrient depletion this instantaneous increase in output voltage following substrate replacement in each cycle could be attributed to sessile microbes attached to the anode s surface rather than planktonic microbes otherwise the removal of suspended microbes as a result of anolyte replenishment should have resulted in a decrease in output voltage electricity production in each mfc consisted of three stages ascending stationary and declining apparently the period of ascending in each cycle increased with increasing ni2 concentration most probably due to the harmful effects of ni2 on eabs in the first batch mfcs fed with a medium containing no ni2 0 mg l achieved a maximum voltage of 0 557 v in 4 5 h whereas those fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 required 5 7 6 9 11 8 and 22 9 h respectively to achieve maximum voltages it should be mentioned that the mfc fed with the substrate medium without ni2 achieved the highest maximum output voltage of 0 557 v followed by 10 mg l 0 470 v 20 mg l 0 407 40 mg l 0 386 v and 80 mg l 0 340 v from the above results it can be seen that the output voltages of the mfcs decreased as ni2 concentration increased which could be attributed to the heavy metal s inhibitory effects on eabs resulting in decreased viability and a shift in species richness kamika and momba 2011 furthermore heavy metals may cause dna damage and enzyme deactivation which could also result in a decrease in voltage generation of mfcs zhou et al 2008 therefore these findings suggested that ni2 at these concentrations has a toxic effect on eabs and may decrease voltage generation of mfcs the maximum power densities for ni2 concentrations of 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l were 673 24 12 40 424 31 9 85 393 67 6 71 280 09 12 0 and 179 26 9 05 mw m2 and their corresponding current densities were 5 43 0 20 4 90 0 22 4 64 0 30 3 86 0 10 and 3 36 0 10 a m2 respectively fig 1b even though the maximum current density of mfc at ni2 concentration of 10 mg l was about 1 11 fold lower than that without ni2 there was only a slight decrease in current production from 4 90 0 22 to 4 64 0 30 a m2 for ni2 concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 mg l indicating that ni2 concentrations less than 40 mg l had less effect on anodic biofilms similar to the power and current densities the output voltage of the mfcs at different external resistance decreased gradually as the ni2 concentration increased fig 1c these findings imply that certain ni2 concentrations might impair the energy generation of mfc additionally the electrode potential curves of the mfcs were analyzed to ascertain the effect of ni2 on the electrode performance fig 1d the cathode potential curves overlapped whereas the anode potential curves were clearly different as a result the disparities in the electricity produced by the mfcs were primarily due to changes in the anode biofilms it is apparent that ni2 affected the anode s proclivity hence impairing mfc performance the ce which represents the fraction of electrons recovered as current during substrate oxidation was computed to further assess the mfcs electrochemical behavior as illustrated in fig 2 a the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiencies of the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 were 97 2 0 18 96 72 0 20 91 31 0 13 86 86 0 18 and 82 08 0 23 while their ce were 19 55 1 39 16 18 0 77 15 29 0 78 13 09 0 90 and 9 93 0 32 respectively the results suggest that the cod removal efficiency and ce of each reactor decreased as the ni2 concentration increased indicating that the addition of ni2 impeded anodic biofilm activities similar ce values were observed in previously reported studies on air cathode single compartment mfcs feng et al 2008 solomon et al 2022 yang et al 2020 according to ding et al 2021 an electronic loss may occur in mfc as a result of cod degradation by other microbes or other anaerobic reactions involved in organic catabolism furthermore it is worth noting that the duration of the voltage output of 80 mg l ni2 fed mfc drastically shortened in the fourth and fifth batches resulting in a significant decrease in ce therefore the reduction in ce indicates that ni2 primarily influenced mfc anode performance via toxic inhibition of anodic biofilms 3 2 nickel removal and mechanism in mfcs anodes the removal of ni2 reflects the mfcs performance and the viability of microbes attached to the anode fig 2b depicts the changes in ni2 concentration in the reactors the mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l initial ni2 concentrations achieved a removal efficiency of 95 48 0 85 94 68 0 64 94 27 2 50 and 89 68 0 53 respectively with the residue ni2 concentrations of 0 45 0 09 1 06 0 13 2 29 1 0 and 8 25 0 43 mg l at the first batch the ni2 removal efficiency was still over 90 in the second and third batches for the mfcs fed with 10 20 and 40 mg l however it decreased to 82 69 1 85 in the second batch and further declined to 76 66 0 04 in the third batch for the mfc fed with 80 mg l ni2 which could be ascribed to the harmful effect of ni2 on the anode biofilms high ni2 concentrations have a significant impact on removal efficiency with some bacteria unable to function effectively sun et al 2017 it should be mentioned that the ni2 removal efficiency obtained in the anodes of these mfcs was higher than that obtained in the cathode of a mec cai et al 2016 mirzaienia et al 2017 also obtained a lesser removal efficiency of 70 04 in the middle compartment of a microbial desalination cell furthermore the removal efficiency of the mfc fed with 10 mg l ni2 in this study was higher than the 91 7 obtained in a biocathode mfc with the same initial concentration singh and kaushik 2021 therefore the simultaneous removal of ni2 and organic matter in the mfc anodes seems promising for the treatment of real wastewater with lower ni2 concentrations there are various plausible explanations for the ni2 removal mechanism in the anode compartment of bes in previous research cathodic reduction was revealed to be the main removal mechanism in the cathode of mec luo et al 2014 qin et al 2012 in this work the removal of ni2 in the anode of the mfcs is hardly due to reduction since the standard redox potential of ni2 ni0 eq 1 is lower than that of pyruvate lactate half reaction eq 2 hence it cannot be reduced by accepting electrons qin et al 2012 teemu et al 2008 moreover due to oxygen s high cathode potential eq 3 it is quite difficult for ni2 to compete with it on the cathode metal precipitation caused by the existence of various inorganic anions in the anolyte may also aid in metal removal nickel precipitation as ni oh 2 eq 4 occurs in the ph range of 9 0 10 0 coman et al 2013 in this work the ph was kept near neutral for all batches influent ph 6 53 fig 2c hence precipitation of ni as hydroxides should not contribute to the metal removal 1 ni 2 2 e ni 0 e 0 25 v vs she 2 pyruvate 2 e 2 h lactate e 0 185 v vs she 3 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o e 1 234 v vs she 4 n i 2 2 o h ni oh 2 biosorption with microbial cells is another significant heavy metal removal mechanism abourached et al 2014 metals can be removed through biosorption by both living and dead microbial cells using the functional groups hydroxyl amine phosphate carboxylate and sulfate of polysaccharides lipids and proteins on their cell walls fomina and gadd 2014 ftir spectroscopy revealed the participation of various functional groups and components in the biosorption of ni2 provided by the anodic biofilms as shown in fig 3 in comparison to that of mfc containing no ni2 the ftir spectra of the biofilms of mfcs fed with various ni2 concentrations exhibited several peak shifts the band at 3415 17 cm 1 of the mfc fed without ni2 representing hydroxyl oh and amine nh groups in protein chug et al 2016 was shifted to 3304 63 cm 1 3301 07 cm 1 3304 18 cm 1 and 3303 09 cm 1 after interacting with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively this result implies that oh and nh groups were essential sites for ni2 uptake the band at 2926 49 cm 1 observed in the biofilm of ni2 free mfc can be attributed to the stretching vibration of ch in methylene ch2 and methyl ch3 groups amiri et al 2019 the significant shift of this band to 2968 16 cm 1 2964 43 cm 1 2963 10 cm 1 and 2962 92 cm 1 in the mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively indicated the participation of these functional groups in the uptake of ni2 the band at 1742 13 cm 1 could be assigned to the c o stretching of the cooh group murphy et al 2007 this peak shifted to 1743 50 cm 1 1740 57 cm 1 1741 98 cm 1 and 1739 53 cm 1 in mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively in addition the relative intensity of this peak decreased in mfcs fed 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 whiles it increased in mfcs fed 10 mg l ni2 the shift in this peak and the increase or decrease in its relative intensity suggested the efficient interaction of ni2 with this functional group via biosorption the peaks at 1650 91 cm 1 and 1547 21 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of amide i and amide ii in protein respectively masoumi et al 2016 these peaks were shifted in biofilms of mfcs fed with the various ni2 concentrations signifying the binding of ni2 with amides i and ii in the biofilm surfaces furthermore peaks at 1385 91 cm 1 and 1055 92 cm 1 representing bending of the c h group and c o stretching vibrations of polysaccharides respectively kang et al 2014 verma et al 2017 exhibited obvious changes in ni2 fed mfcs indicating that these groups might have played a significant role in ni2 sorption therefore the shifting of bands and the increase or decrease of peak intensities in the ni2 fed mfcs indicates the involvement of various microbial biofilm functional groups such as hydroxyl amides methyl amine and carboxyl in the uptake of ni2 the sem images of the anode biofilms are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that irregular sheets of crystals are present on the biofilms suggesting that the eabs accumulated a significant amount of ni2 after being exposed to ni2 solution edx analysis further revealed that the anode biofilms of the mfcs reactors fed with ni2 were composed of c o p and ni fig 5b e h k and n the valence states of the ni species on the anode biofilms were subsequently confirmed with xps fig 4 the ni 2p spectra of the mfcs anode biofilms were deconvoluted into peaks to attain the desired fitting the anode biofilms of mfc fed with 10 mg l ni2 revealed typical ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 peaks at 856 0 and 873 7 ev respectively conventionally ascribed to ni2 zhang et al 2021 the peaks of ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 obtained at 856 1 and 873 7 ev respectively confirm the existence of ni2 in the anode biofilms of the mfc fed with 20 mg l ni2 kumar et al 2017 moreover peaks of ni2 were clearly observed on the anode biofilms of mfc fed with 40 mg l ni2 at binding energy values of 855 7 and 873 4 ev corresponding to the ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 orbitals respectively saghir and xiao 2021 as for the biofilm of the 80 mg l ni2 fed mfc ni 2p3 2 at 855 4 ev and ni 2p1 2 at 873 3 ev were also attributed to ni2 tarditi et al 2014 furthermore the presence of their corresponding strong shake up satellite peaks at 861 5 ev and 879 5 ev confirms the existence of ni2 in the anode biofilms saghir and xiao 2021 3 3 morphological and electrochemical analyses of anodic biofilms the morphology of anode biofilms in the mfcs fed with varied concentrations of ni2 was studied using sem as illustrated in fig 5 a d and g the anode surface of the mfcs fed with 0 10 and 20 mg l ni2 were densely covered by microorganisms in contrast the biofilms appeared loose and sparse on the anodes of the mfcs fed with 40 and 80 mg l ni2 fig 5j and m confirming an adverse effect of these ni2 concentrations on the replication and growth of the microbes the viability of the anode biofilms in each mfc was further investigated with clsm fig 5 as shown in fig 5c more living cells green adhered to the anode surface of the mfc fed without ni2 however the dead cells red on the bioanode increased with the increase in ni2 concentration at high ni2 concentrations 40 and 80 mg l fig 5l and o more dead cells adhered to the anode surface preventing living cells from contacting the electrode consequently impairing electron flow between the active cells and the electrode and resulting in a decrease in ce the percentage viability of the anodic biofilms was determined by the ratio of green fluorescence to the sum of green and red fluorescence the viability value of the mfc fed without ni2 was 83 74 2 8 indicating that most of the anode biofilms were occupied with living cells in contrast the mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 had viability values of 71 52 4 01 54 80 6 97 46 09 7 05 and 32 17 3 64 respectively revealing a decrease in biofilm viability with ni2 addition the decrease in biofilm viability with increasing ni2 concentration was positively correlated with the decrease in ce this implied that certain ni2 concentrations could substantially inhibit or destroy anodic biofilms based on the above results the clsm findings are consistent with the output voltage the redox activities of the mfcs fed with various ni2 concentrations were analyzed using cv fig 6 a the results revealed that the mfcs fed without ni2 exhibited the highest oxidation peak current at 0 0038 v 22 02 ma in contrast lower oxidation peak currents which were within the potential range of c type cytochromes omcs and omcz okamoto et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 were present in the mfcs fed with 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 at 0 22 v 8 43 ma 0 21 v 7 94 ma and 0 28 v 4 46 ma respectively with no oxidation peak observed for 10 mg l indicating that these mfcs had lesser biocatalytic activity a decrease in the catalytic activity of the ni2 fed mfcs indicated some degree of mass transfer inhibition possibly due to a decrease in the proportion of living cells in the anode biofilm xu et al 2021 the different ni2 concentrations clearly reduced the microbial population which subsequently decreased the relative abundance of redox active proteins e g cytochromes such as omcz and omcs in the biofilm matrix hence inhibiting electron transport between microbes and electrodes it should be mentioned that various redox active proteins present in the outer membrane of most exoelectrogens transport electrons from the microbial cells to the electrode this electron transfer between the exoelectrogens and the electrode results in the formation of the observed oxidation peaks cheng et al 2018 nonetheless a decrease in biofilm microbial activity due to the presence of these ni2 concentrations may have inhibited the synthesis of these redox proteins thereby impeding the formation of the oxidation peaks the enclosed area of the cv curve can be used to characterize mfc s electron transfer ability since it indicates the strength of the charge and discharge performance of the anodic biofilms ding et al 2021 from fig 6a it is obvious that the mfcs fed with the various ni2 concentrations had a smaller enclosed cv area as compared to that without ni2 these results further confirm that the electron transfer performance of the anode biofilms was negatively correlated with these ni2 concentrations it should be noted that the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 exhibited reduction peaks at 0 27 v 0 32 v 0 29 v 0 28 v and 0 29 v respectively these reduction peaks are related to omcz 0 617 to 0 257 vs ag agcl and omcs 0 557 to 0 237 vs ag agcl the main multiheme c cyts found on the om c cyts of geobacter and are essential for electron transfer okamoto et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 in comparison to mfcs fed without ni2 mfcs fed with varying concentrations of ni2 exhibited lower reduction peaks which can also be attributed to a decrease in the abundance of redox proteins in brief the inhibition of redox protein synthesis was responsible for the decrease in both the oxidation and reduction peaks furthermore the abiotic experimental condition was studied in order to determine the involvement of microorganisms in eet there were no oxidation and reduction peaks found in the abiotic system lacking biofilm showing that microorganisms were responsible for electricity production in all electrode systems to further understand the effect of ni2 on the performance of mfcs their total internal resistance was analyzed using eis eis is a beneficial tool for estimating the electron transfer status of anode biofilms umar et al 2021 the impedance spectra obtained from the eis measurement were fitted to an equivalent circuit and the data were analyzed with zview the equivalent circuit and nyquist plots are illustrated in fig 6b the equivalent circuit consists of ohmic resistance r1 charge transfer resistance r2 parallel constant phase element cpe1 and warburg impedance w2 the ohmic and charge transfer resistances are both referred to as internal resistance umar et al 2021 according to sindhuja et al 2018 the ohmic and charge transfer resistances can be determined from the diameter of the semicircle and the intercept at high frequency from the nyquist plots the total internal resistance of the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 was 12 73 ω r1 5 27 ω and r2 7 46 ω 19 77 ω r1 11 56 ω and 8 21 ω 24 91 ω r1 6 38 ω and r2 18 53 ω 32 38 ω r1 8 52 ω and 23 86 ω and 45 66 ω r1 13 49 ω and 32 17 ω respectively the total internal resistance of the mfcs rose with increasing ni2 concentration indicating that the various ni2 concentrations had toxic effects on the anodic biofilms reducing microbial activity and impairing electron transport yang and shen 2019 xu et al 2021 observed a similar phenomenon where the accumulation of dead cells on the anode surface of a lead fed mfc increased internal resistance the inclusion of ni2 in the anode certainly increased the number of dead cells resulting in an increase in the electron transfer distance and charge transfer resistance wang et al 2022 thus the decline in electricity generation of ni2 containing mfcs could be attributed to the decrease in the activity and viability of the electrogenic biofilm which impeded the eet process 3 4 analysis of microbial communities in the anodic biofilms after the mfcs output voltages were stable and biofilms had formed on the anodes high throughput sequencing technology was utilized to investigate the effects of varied ni2 concentrations on the anodic biofilms microbial communities based on the operational taxonomic units otus level the venn diagram analysis was carried out to determine the bacterial diversity and abundance in the anodic biofilms fig 7 a a total of 3042 otus were detected in the inoculated sludge in contrast 1096 1310 1578 1354 and 1585 otus were detected in the anodic biofilms of the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively this indicates that an obvious shift occurred at the otu level during the electroactive biofilm enrichment process there were 22 36 76 47 and 145 unique otus in the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively showing that the main species in these anodes were different this result is in line with a prior work which revealed that differences in unique otus resulted in different microbial community compositions gong et al 2019 hence contributing to varying mfc performance it should be noted that the differences in the otus could be ascribed to the various ni2 concentrations the venn diagram further demonstrates that a total of 448 otus were shared by these five mfcs communities it is possible that the similarity stems from the adoption of similar environmental and growth conditions during domestication as a result of shared otus different mfcs had comparable microbial communities as well as the capacity to oxidize lactate and generate power the results of employing the α diversity index to assess species richness and bacterial community diversity are presented in table 1 based on the coverage index the mfcs samples attained 0 99 demonstrating that the sequence analysis could cover nearly the whole bacterial population and the equivalent number of otus deng et al 2020 xie et al 2020 the sobs and shannon indexes of the anodic biofilms were much lower than those of the inoculum which was consistent with the simpson and chao indexes hence the anodic biofilms had a lower microbial abundance and diversity than the sludge it is worth mentioning that the mfc system and the toxic ni2 may have a selective influence on the anodic microbial community pca was used to explain the diverse clusters of bacterial populations found in various anode biofilms fig 7b pca 1 and 2 revealed 62 81 and 12 59 of the entire community variations respectively the mfcs fed with 10 20 and 40 mg l ni2 were grouped together whereas they were separated from those without ni2 0 mg l the results showed that the microbial community compositions of these mfcs i e 10 20 and 40 mg l were quite similar however the bacterial communities of the mfcs fed with 80 mg l ni2 shifted considerably therefore the pca analysis revealed that ni2 had a substantial effect on the bacterial community compositions fig 8 depicts the variation of bacterial community structure in the various samples at the phylum class and genus levels bacteroidota 22 05 and proteobacteria 16 31 were the most prevalent phyla in the inoculum fig 8a in contrast desulfobacterota proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidota and actinobacteriota dominated the anodic electroactive biofilms of the mfcs which is consistent with a previous study wang et al 2022 it is well known in the literature that desulfobacterota proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidota and actinobacteriota are typically composed of a considerable number of electroactive bacteria cabrera et al 2022 li et al 2021 wei et al 2019 the functions of these electroactive microbes include both pollutant degradation and power production logan et al 2019 these microbes directly transfer electrons from the respiratory chain to the electrode surface via cytochrome c in addition these predominant electroactive microorganisms are commonly found on the mfc s anode biofilm which aids in the generation of electricity a much more abundance of desulfobacterota 44 54 was found in the mfc containing no ni2 0 mg l than those fed with 10 mg l ni2 32 13 20 mg l ni2 30 70 40 mg l ni2 28 14 and 80 mg l ni2 30 19 thus in the absence of ni2 the relative abundance of desulfobacterota was increased whereas the various ni2 concentrations decreased their abundance indicating that these concentrations were toxic to these bacteria proteobacteria on the other hand predominated in the anodes of the mfcs fed with higher concentrations of ni2 accounting for 30 74 40 mg l mfc and 26 66 80 mg l compared to 18 34 23 38 and 14 80 found in those containing 0 10 and 20 mg l ni2 respectively in a previous study proteobacteria were discovered to be abundant in anodic biofilms and increasing heavy metal concentration was found to promote their growth wu et al 2020 hence the abundance of proteobacteria in the anodic biofilms contributed to ni2 removal in all mfcs especially in those fed with 40 and 80 mg l ni2 it should be noted that firmicutes were observed and might also be responsible for ni2 resistance and removal since they are known to be active in metal contaminated environments and their members possess metal resistance genes bauvais et al 2015 gupta et al 2022 the major classes in the inoculum were bacteroidia and gammaproteobacteria while desulfuromonadia gammaproteobacteria desulfovibrionia and clostridia were the major classes in the anodic biofilms fig 8b the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria increased significantly at high ni2 concentrations of 40 and 80 mg l while desulfuromonadia showed the opposite trend gammaproteobacteria have been reported to include many electroactive bacteria and they have the inherent ability to flourish in metal contaminated environments by detoxifying or absorbing toxic metals singh and kaushik 2021 additionally they have the most respiratory systems based on a sophisticated metabolic network which enables them to recycle both organic and inorganic matter lemaire et al 2020 therefore it is possible that gammaproteobacteria played a significant role in electron transfer and ni2 removal from the mfcs the microbes within the class desulfuromonadia have been proposed as potential exoelectrogens in different bess yan et al 2021 their distribution in the various mfcs followed the same pattern as the power density with the highest relative abundance of desulfuromonadia found in the mfcs without ni2 36 05 and the lowest in those fed 80 mg l ni2 12 07 it is obvious that the various ni2 concentrations were detrimental to desulfuromonadia implying that the introduction of these ni2 concentrations into the anode chamber of the mfcs could have inhibited their activity and development the enrichment of clostridia in the anodes appears to have aided in mfcs power generation as these organisms are known to use diverse substrates such as lactate to produce energy singh and kaushik 2021 the function of the microbial community can be inferred further via genus analysis fig 8c and fig s2 results revealed that the most prevalent genus was geobacter accounting for 36 04 in the mfc devoid of ni2 0 mg l in contrast the percentage of geobacter decreased to 20 49 18 90 15 57 and 12 05 while the proportion of desulfovibrio obviously increased to 11 45 11 56 12 39 and 17 75 in mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively geobacter a proteobacteria member is a well known electrochemically active bacteria capable of transporting electrons from organic matter to extracellular electron acceptors such as electrodes kouzuma et al 2018 in addition geobacter possesses several genes annotated as c type cytochromes some of which are required for eet and biofilm electroactivity steidl et al 2016 they also participate in direct interspecies electron transfer and provide electrons to other species via electrically conductive pili zheng et al 2021 the decrease in geobacter correlated with the decline in voltage output caused by the addition of ni2 signifying that the various ni2 concentrations were toxic to geobacter similar results were also observed in previous studies where a decrease in the relative abundance of geobacter resulted in a decrease in the voltage output of a bes following heavy metal addition zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b members of the genus desulfovibrio are typical sulfate reducing bacteria often detected in bes anodes their role in electricity generation has been reported desulfovibrio has the ability to directly transfer electrons from the substrate to the electrode surface zheng et al 2021 in addition desulfovibrio has been reported to be resistant to high heavy metal concentrations due to the hydrogen sulfide it produces hydrogen sulfide released into the extracellular environment induces the precipitation of heavy metal ions and protects live cells from heavy metal toxicity yin et al 2019 moreover they are known to possess ni2 resistance genes that enable them to survive in environments with high ni2 concentrations rodionov et al 2004 a previous study reported that desulfovibrio was resistant to 100 ppm ni2 and could achieve 98 3 ni2 removal from a marine environment joo et al 2015 parades aguilar et al 2021 also discovered that the genus desulfovibrio had a high relative abundance in an anaerobic bioreactor treating actual industrial wastewater containing 250 500 ppm ni2 these results were consistent with our study showing that desulfovibrio is resistant to higher ni2 concentrations therefore it is possible that the various ni2 concentrations promoted the proliferation of desulfovibrio in the mfcs it is worth noting that desulfovibrio may have also played an essential role in ni2 removal from the mfcs the genus dechlorosoma was also detected in the mfcs and was dominant in the reactors fed with 80 mg l ni2 8 30 members of the genus dechlorosoma are classified as degrading bacteria because they have been proven to degrade organic compounds lu et al 2021 interestingly dechlorosoma has also been reported to possess bioremediation capacity for heavy metals lack joseph et al 2002 hence it is likely that it contributed to ni2 resistance and removal in the mfc fig 9 illustrates a heat map of the top 50 genera from the samples the color depth represents the genus s relative abundance the anodic microbial communities of the five groups of mfcs differed significantly from the inoculum but there were also moderate variations among the five groups of anodic microbes geobacter was substantially more abundant in the mfc without ni2 than in those fed with various ni2 concentrations whereas desulfovibrio was dominant in the anodic biofilms of the mfc fed with 80 mg l ni2 which is consistent with the results in fig 8c and further confirms that the various ni2 concentrations stimulated the growth of desulfovibrio while being deleterious to geobacter cells therefore these findings indicate that exposing anodic biofilms to ni2 could have an effect on the microbial community resulting in selective enrichment of resistant bacteria and a decrease in eet related microbes 3 5 effect of ni2 on the cellular metabolic pathway to better comprehend the influence of the various ni2 concentrations on cellular metabolic pathway the functional genes involved in the eet process and ni2 resistance were investigated it is well established that eet between microbes and electrodes can be achieved via c type cytochromes or conductive nanowires wen et al 2022 hence we applied picrust based on 16 s rrna gene data coupled with the kegg database to predict the functional genes related to eet process cytochromes c flagella and pili and ni2 resistance the prediction accuracy of picrust could approach 85 90 chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 as shown in fig 10 a the abundance of cytochromes in the mfc fed without ni2 was higher than that of the other mfcs specifically cytochrome c was more abundant in ni2 free mfcs compared to those fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 indicating that ni2 inhibited the synthesis of cytochrome c fig 10c cytochrome c are membrane proteins responsible for charge storage in anodic biofilms and they play a crucial role in electron transfer of the respiratory chain wang et al 2020 in addition the gene encoding cytochrome c may serve as the electron shuttle facilitating the transfer of electrons wang et al 2022 geobacter is known to possess a high abundance of cytochrome c steidl et al 2016 thus the decline of cytochrome c in the biofilms were attributed to the decrease in the relative abundance of geobacter in mfcs fed with various ni2 concentrations furthermore genes encoding type iv pilus assembly proteins were more abundant in ni2 free mfc than in those fed varying ni2 concentrations fig 10a for example type iv pilus assembly protein pilb type iv pilus assembly protein pilc and twitching motility protein pilt which have been shown to be electrically conductive li et al 2022 were highly abundant in the mfc fed without ni2 fig 10c in contrast mfcs fed with 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 had the lowest abundance of these proteins suggesting that these concentrations had a more drastic effect on genes encoding pili proteins of note pili which are cytochrome coated could act as electrical conduits for long distance electron transport across multilayer biofilms as well as a scaffold for microbial attachment and electroactive biofilm formation zhou et al 2017 moreover genes encoding flagellar components were significantly higher in ni2 free mfcs than in those fed with varying ni2 concentrations fig 10a in particular the flagellum encoded by flic gene which is related to biofilm development and bacterial swimming activity ansari et al 2021 wen et al 2022 was much more abundant in the ni2 free mfcs than in those fed with varied ni2 concentrations indicating that the various ni2 concentrations may have impeded flagella synthesis fig 10c as shown in fig 10a less activity appeared to be associated with ni2 homeostasis and resistance as evidenced by the lower abundance of genes related to ni2 uptake and resistance compared to those eet genes within the community however their abundance differed among the anodic biofilms with mfcs fed with ni2 having a higher abundance of copg family transcriptional regulator nickel responsive regulator nikr than the control group fig 10d the higher abundance of the nikr gene in the electroactive biofilms of nickel fed mfcs corresponds with the higher relative abundance of desulfovibrio in these mfcs desulfovibrio is known to possess the nikr gene which contributed to the enrichment of biofilms with this gene rodionov et al 2004 most microorganisms import ni2 through an atp dependent nickel specific permease encoded by the nikabcde operon kumar et al 2021 when intracellular ni2 concentrations are high nikr represses this operon contreras et al 2003 a previous study found that nikr was required for helicobacter pylori survival in the presence of high ni2 and co2 concentrations contreras et al 2003 therefore nikr played an important role in ni2 resistance in the mfcs the effect of the various ni2 concentrations on the expression of eet related genes such as pila and c type cytochromes omcs omcz omcc omcb and omce was evaluated fig 10b the expression levels of the genes decreased significantly in response to ni2 exposure which was consistent with the decline in electricity production the mfc fed with 80 mg l ni2 had the least expression level 0 80 0 17 log copies ng dna of the pila gene further confirming that this concentration had a greater effect on this gene in contrast the ni2 free mfc showed the highest expression 1 96 0 18 log copies ng dna of pila gene in addition the expression of omcs omcz omcc omcb and omce genes decreased significantly in the presence of various ni2 concentrations compared to the other c type cytochromes the expression level of omcz was significantly higher several reports have previously confirmed that numerous c type cytochromes participate in eet in mfc but only omcz is required for biofilm electroactivity nevin et al 2009 steidl et al 2016 the high expression of omcz in the ni2 free mfc corresponds to the highest output voltage observed in this mfc confirming that this gene influences electrogenic performance more directly in our mfcs when the electroactive biofilms were exposed to the various ni2 concentrations the expression of omcz decreased from 5 20 0 36 log copies ng dna at 0 mg l to 2 17 0 22 log copies ng dna at 80 mg l ni2 therefore the decrease in the expression levels of eet associated genes with ni2 exposure resulted from the decrease in the relative abundance of geobacter overall these findings show that the presence of various ni2 concentrations inhibited protein synthesis and the expression of eet related genes resulting in decreased eab electroactivity 4 conclusion this study investigated the impact of ni2 on bes anode eabs and current output mfcs lactate degradation electricity generation and metal removal efficiency declined as ni2 concentration increased which could be attributed to decreased viability and shifts in the microbial community as revealed by clsm sem and microbial community analysis ftir spectroscopy revealed the involvement of several microbial biofilms functional groups including hydroxyl amides methyl amine and carboxyl in the uptake of ni2 cv analysis demonstrated that the various ni2 concentrations reduced the biocatalytic activity and current output of the mfcs additionally the total internal resistance of the mfcs increased with an increase in ni2 concentration the existence of ni2 in the mfcs anodic chambers had a selective effect on the microbial community resulting in the evolution of resistant species and a decrease in eet related bacteria the percentage of geobacter decreased as the ni2 concentration increased whereas the proportion of desulfovibrio increased the decrease of the classic exoelectrogens geobacter was associated with the decline of current production while the increase of desulfovibrio improved the bess ability to tolerate high ni2 stress the impact of ni2 on eet related genes was also assessed for the first time and the results show that the various ni2 concentrations decreased the expression of eet associated genes the nikr gene was observed to have a pivotal role in ni2 resistance in the mfcs the results of this work would contribute to the advancement of knowledge regarding ni2 inhibition on eabs as well as the treatment of real wastewater containing ni2 in the anode of bes the concurrent removal of organic matter and ni2 seems promising for practical wastewater treatment additionally it will significantly reduce ni2 removal operation costs in the future the microbial anodic biofilms should be developed with inoculum obtained from a heavy metal polluted site to improve toxicity resistance expedite mass transfer reduce internal resistance and enhance ce lastly mfcs with different operating conditions should be investigated in order to achieve more efficient ni2 removal and higher energy output declaration of

15656,the impact of nickel ni2 on the performance of anodic electroactive biofilms eabs in the bioelectrochemical system bes was investigated in this study although it has been reported that ni2 influences microorganisms in a number of ways it is unknown how its presence in the anode of a bes affects extracellular electron transfer eet of eabs microbial viability and the bacterial community results revealed that the addition of ni2 decreased power output from 673 24 12 40 mw m2 at 0 mg l to 179 26 9 05 mw m2 at 80 mg l the metal and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies of the microbial fuel cells mfcs declined as ni2 concentration increased which could be attributed to decreased microbial viability as revealed by sem and clsm ftir analysis revealed the involvement of various microbial biofilm functional groups including hydroxyl amides methyl amine and carboxyl in the uptake of ni2 the presence of ni2 on the anodic biofilms was confirmed by sem eds and xps analyses cv demonstrated that the electron transfer performance of the anodic biofilms was negatively correlated with the various ni2 concentrations eis showed that the internal resistance of the mfcs increased with increasing ni2 concentration resulting in a decrease in power output high throughput sequencing results revealed a decrease in geobacter and an increase in desulfovibrio in response to ni2 concentrations of 10 20 40 and 80 mg l furthermore the various ni2 concentrations decreased the expression of eet related genes the ni2 fed mfcs had a higher abundance of the nikr gene than the control group which was important for ni2 resistance this work advances our understanding of ni2 inhibition on eabs as well as the concurrent removal of organic matter and ni2 from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nickel ii anodic electroactive biofilms bioelectrochemical system microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nickel ni2 is a heavy metal that is frequently found in domestic and industrial wastewaters due to its vast range of industrial applications including electroplating metal finishing mineral processing coinage stainless steel and battery production among other applications kumar et al 2019 noman et al 2021 while ni2 is an essential macronutrient for the functioning of living organisms at trace levels it can produce detrimental health effects such as gastrointestinal ache diarrhoea pulmonary fibrosis renal oedema cardiovascular and kidney diseases as well as cancer at excessive doses islam et al 2019 additionally it is non biodegradable and has the ability to permeate organisms cells causing harm to protein structure and function and even inducing dna damage guo et al 2019 parades aguilar et al 2021 numerous approaches for removing ni2 from wastewaters have been developed which include adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange and membrane filtration qasem et al 2021 however the above mentioned treatment techniques are cost prohibitive generate toxic sludge and consumes exorbitant energy and chemical crini and lichtfouse 2019 on the other hand a bioelectrochemical system bes is an efficient and environmentally friendly technique for recovering metallic products and nutrients from wastewater yang et al 2019b currently microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs of bes have both been studied extensively li et al 2015 mfc generally employs microbial metabolism to generate electricity and reduce metals e g hg2 au3 cr6 ag and cu2 with high reduction potential kaushik and singh 2020 in mfc electron transport from the anodic region to the cathodic chamber often becomes thermodynamically unfavorable upon the addition of lower redox potential metals such as ni2 cd2 co2 pb2 and zn2 as a result it is difficult to trigger the movement of electrons in the mfc from the anodic region to the cathode unless an external electrical energy source is applied i e mec nancharaiah et al 2015 therefore it is self evident that a huge quantum of electricity will be required to operate these mec reactors commercially in the future thus increasing operational costs ai et al 2020a the configurations of mfc mainly include single and dual chamber from the economic standpoint the single chamber mfc is preferable because it eliminates the need for additional separate membrane materials thus lowering the operational cost unlike in the dual chamber mfc in previous studies the removal of ni2 from the abiotic cathode of mec was accomplished via the application of voltage whereas organic matter in the anodic region served as electron donors cai et al 2016 luo et al 2014 qin et al 2012 a study by singh and kaushik 2021 also reported 97 ni2 removal in biocathode mfc however in these studies the cathodic medium solutions contained only ni2 whereas most real wastewater from animal farms mining processing printing textile and other industries usually contain both heavy metals and organics pathak et al 2009 due to growing concerns about rising energy demands researchers are becoming more interested in removing ni2 and organics simultaneously liu et al 2019 investigated the effect of ni2 2 93 5 87 8 80 11 7 14 7 17 6 20 5 23 5 and 26 4 mg l low standard electrode potential on the anode including removal efficiency migration and distribution and obtained removal rates which were nearly greater than 96 similarly gai et al 2018 studied the impact of ni2 50 600 μmol l and 600 1000 μmol l on the anode of an mfc and revealed that a low concentration of ni2 50 200 µmol l could improve mfc performance whereas a ni2 concentration greater than 600 µmol l decreases the voltage output however these studies did not comprehensively investigate how the presence of ni2 in the anodes of the mfcs influenced extracellular electron transfer eet of electroactive biofilms eabs the suppression mechanism the microbial viability microbial community and functional genes related to both electricity production and ni2 resistance previous investigations have shown that ni2 200 µg ml 0 4 mm and 0 5 mm is harmful and could inhibit microbial activities including biofilm formation syed et al 2021 vega et al 2014 in contrast other researchers have found that ni2 can boost the activity of microorganisms for example the inclusion of 1 mg l ni2 enhanced pseudomonas putida biodegradation of toluene and trichloroethylene in a sequencing batch reactor yang et al 2019a it was also revealed that 100 µm ni2 increased biofilm development in escherichia coli k 12 as an adaptive mechanism via a transcriptional influence on genes encoding for adhesion structures perrin et al 2009 recently pavlic et al 2021 found that when bacteria were exposed to moderate ni2 concentrations 250 and 500 µg ml they adhered better to archwires and formed a biofilm than the control strain however these studies were not conducted in a bes and therefore it is quite difficult to ascertain the effect of ni2 on eabs attached to the anode moreover the effect of ni2 on microbial biofilms in the preceding investigations differs from eabs which have a more intricate eet and metabolic pathway in a bes eabs degrade organic materials releasing electrons that are eventually transferred via an external circuit to the anode to generate electrical energy hence eabs on the anode of bes are critical for efficient eet and maximization of current output while it is well established that high ni2 concentration has detrimental effects on living organisms its effects on eabs in a bes have not yet been reported it has been reported that heavy metals i e cu2 cd2 and zn2 may inhibit eabs in so many ways including direct inhibition of biofilm development and suppression of outer membrane cytochrome secretion abourached et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a however to our knowledge no comprehensive study has been conducted to determine how the presence of ni2 in the anode of bes affects electron transfer of eabs microbial survival the diversity of microbes and the functional genes related to electricity production and ni2 resistance in the current study we investigated how different ni2 concentrations affect bes anode eabs and current outputs experiments were carried out to assess the bes performance with varied ni2 concentrations including changes in biofilm viability microbial community and functional genes related to eet and ni2 resistance in addition electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were employed to investigate the anodic activity of eabs in the presence of ni2 this study sheds light on the impact of ni2 on eab revealing possible mechanisms involved which provides a basis for the simultaneous removal of organic matter and ni2 from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes reactor configuration and operation in this work single compartment mfcs were employed to investigate the effects of different ni2 concentrations on eabs and current outputs the single compartment mfcs which possessed 28 ml volume were made with polymethyl methacrylate as detailed in our previous research fig s1 amanze et al 2022 in each mfc a carbon brush with a 1 5 cm radius and a length of 3 cm was used as the anode while a carbon cloth with a surface area of 7 07 cm2 served as the cathode these two components i e anode and cathode were connected with a 1000 ω external resistor via a titanium wire the pretreatment of the carbon cloth and carbon brush was described in detail in our previous research ai et al 2020b each mfc was inoculated with 20 ml sludge obtained from the xinkaipu wastewater treatment plant in changsha china the electroactive biofilm in each mfc was enriched with a medium containing lactate 20 mm as a substrate 100 μl l trace element solution and 50 mm phosphate buffer supplemented with 0 5 ml l wolfe s vitamins as reformed from our previous study ai et al 2020b lactate was chosen as an electron donor because among other substrates such as acetate glucose butyrate and propionate it has proven to be effective in enriching microbial communities and enhancing bes power generation flayac et al 2018 jung and regan 2007 moreover it is also a well known substrate for some dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria nielsen et al 2009 the mfcs were subsequently operated in a fed batch mode in a 30 c incubator the energy substrate in each mfc was replenished when the voltage dropped below 20 mv the mfcs acclimation process lasted approximately four weeks and was stopped when the output voltage was stable in general the ni2 concentration in industrial wastewaters derived from ni production exceeds 10 mg l sun et al 2017 when municipal wastewater treatment plants receive these industrial wastewaters the ni2 concentration in the influent will be even higher thus the study considered the effects of high ni2 concentrations 10 20 40 and 80 mg l after the electroactive biofilms were fully acclimated niso4 7h2o was added to the aforementioned substrate medium solution to attain the desired concentrations each mfc was filled with medium solutions containing varying concentrations of ni2 the anolyte had an initial ph of 6 53 which corresponds to the ph of most real ni wastewater moersidik et al 2020 peng et al 2020 sheng et al 2013 the mfcs were operated for at least four batches to assess the impacts of ni2 on electricity generation control experiments were also carried out in which the anodic chamber was fed medium solutions containing no ni2 all laboratory tests and analyses were carried out in duplicate 2 2 analysis and calculations the voltage produced by each mfc was automatically measured and recorded every 50 s with a data acquisition device adam 4017 analog input model advantech co ltd china coupled to a computer following the maturation of the biofilms and the stability of the peak voltage of each mfc polarization electrode potentials and power density were determined by changing the external resistor as previously reported cheng et al 2013 coulombic efficiency ce was computed using a previously reported method logan et al 2006 eis and cv were performed with a potentiostat gamry reference 600 workstation philadelphia pennsylvania usa in order to determine the electrochemical activity of the bioelectroactive anodes the eis and cv experiments were conducted using a three electrode configuration where cathode anode and saturated ag agcl served as counter working and reference electrodes respectively the eis measurement was carried out with an ac amplitude of 5 mv in the frequency range of 1000 khz to 0 01 hz and the data were evaluated using zview software the cv experiment was conducted at a scan rate of 10 mv s from 0 8 v to 0 2 v the ni2 concentration in the anolyte was measured using an inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometer model spectroblue fms386 ametek materials analysis division kleve germany fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy was used to examine changes in the functional groups of the anodic biofilms following ni2 uptake a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6490lv jeol tokyo japan coupled to an energy dispersive x ray spectrometry edx elect super edax ametek kleve germany analysis tool was employed to investigate the morphologies and elemental composition of the biofilms on the anode the valence states of nickel on the biofilm were analyzed using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo scientific waltham ma usa additionally each mfc anode was analyzed using confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm tcs sp8 leica germany to determine the effect of different concentrations of ni2 on the biofilms 2 3 microbial community analysis the mfcs were disassembled and carbon fibers were taken from various areas of the anodes using sterilized scissors to explore the microbial community associated with anodic biofilms enriched with varied ni2 concentrations total dna was extracted from both the biofilms and the original sludge using the dneasy power soil dna isolation kit qiagen chatsworth ca usa the universal primer pair 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 was used to amplify the v4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16s rdna genes in the samples walters et al 2016 sequencing libraries were then prepared and sequenced using the illumina miseq platform with the pe250 sequencing strategy shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china prior to the following analysis process the illumina adapter and other specific sequences were trimmed afterward pair end reads with a minimum of 10 overlap and less than 5 mismatches were merged magoč and salzberg 2011 uparse was used to generate operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 similarity threshold edgar 2013 rdp classifier was used to phylogenetically assign the taxonomy of otu representative sequences to taxonomic classifications with a confidence threshold of 70 wang et al 2007 the microbial community richness ace and shannon indices as well as chao1 richness estimates were all analyzed using the mothur software package schloss et al 2009 principal component analysis pca was employed to determine the similarity of microbial communities based on the distance matrix all obtained sequence reads have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database accession number srp382106 bioproject id prjna848658 the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was conducted to predict functional genes of the electroactive biofilms based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database langille et al 2013 2 4 functional gene expression analysis the expression of eet related genes pila omce omcc omcs omcz and omcb in biofilms fed with varied ni2 concentrations was quantified in triplicate with an rt pcr detection system cfx96 bio rad usa using primers specified in table s1 chin et al 2004 holmes et al 2006 nevin et al 2009 richter lubna et al 2012 the housekeeping gene reca was used as a reference gene zakaria et al 2022 the detailed procedure for rna extraction reverse transcription and qpcr analytical approaches are available in text s1 2 5 statistical analysis the p value was computed using analysis of variance anova and the student s t test in the statistical package for social sciences spss version 24 0 an asterisk denotes a significant difference p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 the heatmaps were generated with hemi 1 0 all figures were produced using origin 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 the influence of different ni2 concentrations on mfc performance to examine the influence of ni2 on power production different ni2 concentrations i e 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l were introduced into the anodic chamber of mfcs fig 1 a illustrates the changes in output voltages of the mfcs with time in each cycle the output voltages could swiftly increase to a peak value after replenishing the media in the anodic chambers and then gradually decrease due to nutrient depletion this instantaneous increase in output voltage following substrate replacement in each cycle could be attributed to sessile microbes attached to the anode s surface rather than planktonic microbes otherwise the removal of suspended microbes as a result of anolyte replenishment should have resulted in a decrease in output voltage electricity production in each mfc consisted of three stages ascending stationary and declining apparently the period of ascending in each cycle increased with increasing ni2 concentration most probably due to the harmful effects of ni2 on eabs in the first batch mfcs fed with a medium containing no ni2 0 mg l achieved a maximum voltage of 0 557 v in 4 5 h whereas those fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 required 5 7 6 9 11 8 and 22 9 h respectively to achieve maximum voltages it should be mentioned that the mfc fed with the substrate medium without ni2 achieved the highest maximum output voltage of 0 557 v followed by 10 mg l 0 470 v 20 mg l 0 407 40 mg l 0 386 v and 80 mg l 0 340 v from the above results it can be seen that the output voltages of the mfcs decreased as ni2 concentration increased which could be attributed to the heavy metal s inhibitory effects on eabs resulting in decreased viability and a shift in species richness kamika and momba 2011 furthermore heavy metals may cause dna damage and enzyme deactivation which could also result in a decrease in voltage generation of mfcs zhou et al 2008 therefore these findings suggested that ni2 at these concentrations has a toxic effect on eabs and may decrease voltage generation of mfcs the maximum power densities for ni2 concentrations of 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l were 673 24 12 40 424 31 9 85 393 67 6 71 280 09 12 0 and 179 26 9 05 mw m2 and their corresponding current densities were 5 43 0 20 4 90 0 22 4 64 0 30 3 86 0 10 and 3 36 0 10 a m2 respectively fig 1b even though the maximum current density of mfc at ni2 concentration of 10 mg l was about 1 11 fold lower than that without ni2 there was only a slight decrease in current production from 4 90 0 22 to 4 64 0 30 a m2 for ni2 concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 mg l indicating that ni2 concentrations less than 40 mg l had less effect on anodic biofilms similar to the power and current densities the output voltage of the mfcs at different external resistance decreased gradually as the ni2 concentration increased fig 1c these findings imply that certain ni2 concentrations might impair the energy generation of mfc additionally the electrode potential curves of the mfcs were analyzed to ascertain the effect of ni2 on the electrode performance fig 1d the cathode potential curves overlapped whereas the anode potential curves were clearly different as a result the disparities in the electricity produced by the mfcs were primarily due to changes in the anode biofilms it is apparent that ni2 affected the anode s proclivity hence impairing mfc performance the ce which represents the fraction of electrons recovered as current during substrate oxidation was computed to further assess the mfcs electrochemical behavior as illustrated in fig 2 a the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiencies of the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 were 97 2 0 18 96 72 0 20 91 31 0 13 86 86 0 18 and 82 08 0 23 while their ce were 19 55 1 39 16 18 0 77 15 29 0 78 13 09 0 90 and 9 93 0 32 respectively the results suggest that the cod removal efficiency and ce of each reactor decreased as the ni2 concentration increased indicating that the addition of ni2 impeded anodic biofilm activities similar ce values were observed in previously reported studies on air cathode single compartment mfcs feng et al 2008 solomon et al 2022 yang et al 2020 according to ding et al 2021 an electronic loss may occur in mfc as a result of cod degradation by other microbes or other anaerobic reactions involved in organic catabolism furthermore it is worth noting that the duration of the voltage output of 80 mg l ni2 fed mfc drastically shortened in the fourth and fifth batches resulting in a significant decrease in ce therefore the reduction in ce indicates that ni2 primarily influenced mfc anode performance via toxic inhibition of anodic biofilms 3 2 nickel removal and mechanism in mfcs anodes the removal of ni2 reflects the mfcs performance and the viability of microbes attached to the anode fig 2b depicts the changes in ni2 concentration in the reactors the mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l initial ni2 concentrations achieved a removal efficiency of 95 48 0 85 94 68 0 64 94 27 2 50 and 89 68 0 53 respectively with the residue ni2 concentrations of 0 45 0 09 1 06 0 13 2 29 1 0 and 8 25 0 43 mg l at the first batch the ni2 removal efficiency was still over 90 in the second and third batches for the mfcs fed with 10 20 and 40 mg l however it decreased to 82 69 1 85 in the second batch and further declined to 76 66 0 04 in the third batch for the mfc fed with 80 mg l ni2 which could be ascribed to the harmful effect of ni2 on the anode biofilms high ni2 concentrations have a significant impact on removal efficiency with some bacteria unable to function effectively sun et al 2017 it should be mentioned that the ni2 removal efficiency obtained in the anodes of these mfcs was higher than that obtained in the cathode of a mec cai et al 2016 mirzaienia et al 2017 also obtained a lesser removal efficiency of 70 04 in the middle compartment of a microbial desalination cell furthermore the removal efficiency of the mfc fed with 10 mg l ni2 in this study was higher than the 91 7 obtained in a biocathode mfc with the same initial concentration singh and kaushik 2021 therefore the simultaneous removal of ni2 and organic matter in the mfc anodes seems promising for the treatment of real wastewater with lower ni2 concentrations there are various plausible explanations for the ni2 removal mechanism in the anode compartment of bes in previous research cathodic reduction was revealed to be the main removal mechanism in the cathode of mec luo et al 2014 qin et al 2012 in this work the removal of ni2 in the anode of the mfcs is hardly due to reduction since the standard redox potential of ni2 ni0 eq 1 is lower than that of pyruvate lactate half reaction eq 2 hence it cannot be reduced by accepting electrons qin et al 2012 teemu et al 2008 moreover due to oxygen s high cathode potential eq 3 it is quite difficult for ni2 to compete with it on the cathode metal precipitation caused by the existence of various inorganic anions in the anolyte may also aid in metal removal nickel precipitation as ni oh 2 eq 4 occurs in the ph range of 9 0 10 0 coman et al 2013 in this work the ph was kept near neutral for all batches influent ph 6 53 fig 2c hence precipitation of ni as hydroxides should not contribute to the metal removal 1 ni 2 2 e ni 0 e 0 25 v vs she 2 pyruvate 2 e 2 h lactate e 0 185 v vs she 3 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o e 1 234 v vs she 4 n i 2 2 o h ni oh 2 biosorption with microbial cells is another significant heavy metal removal mechanism abourached et al 2014 metals can be removed through biosorption by both living and dead microbial cells using the functional groups hydroxyl amine phosphate carboxylate and sulfate of polysaccharides lipids and proteins on their cell walls fomina and gadd 2014 ftir spectroscopy revealed the participation of various functional groups and components in the biosorption of ni2 provided by the anodic biofilms as shown in fig 3 in comparison to that of mfc containing no ni2 the ftir spectra of the biofilms of mfcs fed with various ni2 concentrations exhibited several peak shifts the band at 3415 17 cm 1 of the mfc fed without ni2 representing hydroxyl oh and amine nh groups in protein chug et al 2016 was shifted to 3304 63 cm 1 3301 07 cm 1 3304 18 cm 1 and 3303 09 cm 1 after interacting with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively this result implies that oh and nh groups were essential sites for ni2 uptake the band at 2926 49 cm 1 observed in the biofilm of ni2 free mfc can be attributed to the stretching vibration of ch in methylene ch2 and methyl ch3 groups amiri et al 2019 the significant shift of this band to 2968 16 cm 1 2964 43 cm 1 2963 10 cm 1 and 2962 92 cm 1 in the mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively indicated the participation of these functional groups in the uptake of ni2 the band at 1742 13 cm 1 could be assigned to the c o stretching of the cooh group murphy et al 2007 this peak shifted to 1743 50 cm 1 1740 57 cm 1 1741 98 cm 1 and 1739 53 cm 1 in mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively in addition the relative intensity of this peak decreased in mfcs fed 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 whiles it increased in mfcs fed 10 mg l ni2 the shift in this peak and the increase or decrease in its relative intensity suggested the efficient interaction of ni2 with this functional group via biosorption the peaks at 1650 91 cm 1 and 1547 21 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of amide i and amide ii in protein respectively masoumi et al 2016 these peaks were shifted in biofilms of mfcs fed with the various ni2 concentrations signifying the binding of ni2 with amides i and ii in the biofilm surfaces furthermore peaks at 1385 91 cm 1 and 1055 92 cm 1 representing bending of the c h group and c o stretching vibrations of polysaccharides respectively kang et al 2014 verma et al 2017 exhibited obvious changes in ni2 fed mfcs indicating that these groups might have played a significant role in ni2 sorption therefore the shifting of bands and the increase or decrease of peak intensities in the ni2 fed mfcs indicates the involvement of various microbial biofilm functional groups such as hydroxyl amides methyl amine and carboxyl in the uptake of ni2 the sem images of the anode biofilms are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that irregular sheets of crystals are present on the biofilms suggesting that the eabs accumulated a significant amount of ni2 after being exposed to ni2 solution edx analysis further revealed that the anode biofilms of the mfcs reactors fed with ni2 were composed of c o p and ni fig 5b e h k and n the valence states of the ni species on the anode biofilms were subsequently confirmed with xps fig 4 the ni 2p spectra of the mfcs anode biofilms were deconvoluted into peaks to attain the desired fitting the anode biofilms of mfc fed with 10 mg l ni2 revealed typical ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 peaks at 856 0 and 873 7 ev respectively conventionally ascribed to ni2 zhang et al 2021 the peaks of ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 obtained at 856 1 and 873 7 ev respectively confirm the existence of ni2 in the anode biofilms of the mfc fed with 20 mg l ni2 kumar et al 2017 moreover peaks of ni2 were clearly observed on the anode biofilms of mfc fed with 40 mg l ni2 at binding energy values of 855 7 and 873 4 ev corresponding to the ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 orbitals respectively saghir and xiao 2021 as for the biofilm of the 80 mg l ni2 fed mfc ni 2p3 2 at 855 4 ev and ni 2p1 2 at 873 3 ev were also attributed to ni2 tarditi et al 2014 furthermore the presence of their corresponding strong shake up satellite peaks at 861 5 ev and 879 5 ev confirms the existence of ni2 in the anode biofilms saghir and xiao 2021 3 3 morphological and electrochemical analyses of anodic biofilms the morphology of anode biofilms in the mfcs fed with varied concentrations of ni2 was studied using sem as illustrated in fig 5 a d and g the anode surface of the mfcs fed with 0 10 and 20 mg l ni2 were densely covered by microorganisms in contrast the biofilms appeared loose and sparse on the anodes of the mfcs fed with 40 and 80 mg l ni2 fig 5j and m confirming an adverse effect of these ni2 concentrations on the replication and growth of the microbes the viability of the anode biofilms in each mfc was further investigated with clsm fig 5 as shown in fig 5c more living cells green adhered to the anode surface of the mfc fed without ni2 however the dead cells red on the bioanode increased with the increase in ni2 concentration at high ni2 concentrations 40 and 80 mg l fig 5l and o more dead cells adhered to the anode surface preventing living cells from contacting the electrode consequently impairing electron flow between the active cells and the electrode and resulting in a decrease in ce the percentage viability of the anodic biofilms was determined by the ratio of green fluorescence to the sum of green and red fluorescence the viability value of the mfc fed without ni2 was 83 74 2 8 indicating that most of the anode biofilms were occupied with living cells in contrast the mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 had viability values of 71 52 4 01 54 80 6 97 46 09 7 05 and 32 17 3 64 respectively revealing a decrease in biofilm viability with ni2 addition the decrease in biofilm viability with increasing ni2 concentration was positively correlated with the decrease in ce this implied that certain ni2 concentrations could substantially inhibit or destroy anodic biofilms based on the above results the clsm findings are consistent with the output voltage the redox activities of the mfcs fed with various ni2 concentrations were analyzed using cv fig 6 a the results revealed that the mfcs fed without ni2 exhibited the highest oxidation peak current at 0 0038 v 22 02 ma in contrast lower oxidation peak currents which were within the potential range of c type cytochromes omcs and omcz okamoto et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 were present in the mfcs fed with 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 at 0 22 v 8 43 ma 0 21 v 7 94 ma and 0 28 v 4 46 ma respectively with no oxidation peak observed for 10 mg l indicating that these mfcs had lesser biocatalytic activity a decrease in the catalytic activity of the ni2 fed mfcs indicated some degree of mass transfer inhibition possibly due to a decrease in the proportion of living cells in the anode biofilm xu et al 2021 the different ni2 concentrations clearly reduced the microbial population which subsequently decreased the relative abundance of redox active proteins e g cytochromes such as omcz and omcs in the biofilm matrix hence inhibiting electron transport between microbes and electrodes it should be mentioned that various redox active proteins present in the outer membrane of most exoelectrogens transport electrons from the microbial cells to the electrode this electron transfer between the exoelectrogens and the electrode results in the formation of the observed oxidation peaks cheng et al 2018 nonetheless a decrease in biofilm microbial activity due to the presence of these ni2 concentrations may have inhibited the synthesis of these redox proteins thereby impeding the formation of the oxidation peaks the enclosed area of the cv curve can be used to characterize mfc s electron transfer ability since it indicates the strength of the charge and discharge performance of the anodic biofilms ding et al 2021 from fig 6a it is obvious that the mfcs fed with the various ni2 concentrations had a smaller enclosed cv area as compared to that without ni2 these results further confirm that the electron transfer performance of the anode biofilms was negatively correlated with these ni2 concentrations it should be noted that the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 exhibited reduction peaks at 0 27 v 0 32 v 0 29 v 0 28 v and 0 29 v respectively these reduction peaks are related to omcz 0 617 to 0 257 vs ag agcl and omcs 0 557 to 0 237 vs ag agcl the main multiheme c cyts found on the om c cyts of geobacter and are essential for electron transfer okamoto et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 in comparison to mfcs fed without ni2 mfcs fed with varying concentrations of ni2 exhibited lower reduction peaks which can also be attributed to a decrease in the abundance of redox proteins in brief the inhibition of redox protein synthesis was responsible for the decrease in both the oxidation and reduction peaks furthermore the abiotic experimental condition was studied in order to determine the involvement of microorganisms in eet there were no oxidation and reduction peaks found in the abiotic system lacking biofilm showing that microorganisms were responsible for electricity production in all electrode systems to further understand the effect of ni2 on the performance of mfcs their total internal resistance was analyzed using eis eis is a beneficial tool for estimating the electron transfer status of anode biofilms umar et al 2021 the impedance spectra obtained from the eis measurement were fitted to an equivalent circuit and the data were analyzed with zview the equivalent circuit and nyquist plots are illustrated in fig 6b the equivalent circuit consists of ohmic resistance r1 charge transfer resistance r2 parallel constant phase element cpe1 and warburg impedance w2 the ohmic and charge transfer resistances are both referred to as internal resistance umar et al 2021 according to sindhuja et al 2018 the ohmic and charge transfer resistances can be determined from the diameter of the semicircle and the intercept at high frequency from the nyquist plots the total internal resistance of the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 was 12 73 ω r1 5 27 ω and r2 7 46 ω 19 77 ω r1 11 56 ω and 8 21 ω 24 91 ω r1 6 38 ω and r2 18 53 ω 32 38 ω r1 8 52 ω and 23 86 ω and 45 66 ω r1 13 49 ω and 32 17 ω respectively the total internal resistance of the mfcs rose with increasing ni2 concentration indicating that the various ni2 concentrations had toxic effects on the anodic biofilms reducing microbial activity and impairing electron transport yang and shen 2019 xu et al 2021 observed a similar phenomenon where the accumulation of dead cells on the anode surface of a lead fed mfc increased internal resistance the inclusion of ni2 in the anode certainly increased the number of dead cells resulting in an increase in the electron transfer distance and charge transfer resistance wang et al 2022 thus the decline in electricity generation of ni2 containing mfcs could be attributed to the decrease in the activity and viability of the electrogenic biofilm which impeded the eet process 3 4 analysis of microbial communities in the anodic biofilms after the mfcs output voltages were stable and biofilms had formed on the anodes high throughput sequencing technology was utilized to investigate the effects of varied ni2 concentrations on the anodic biofilms microbial communities based on the operational taxonomic units otus level the venn diagram analysis was carried out to determine the bacterial diversity and abundance in the anodic biofilms fig 7 a a total of 3042 otus were detected in the inoculated sludge in contrast 1096 1310 1578 1354 and 1585 otus were detected in the anodic biofilms of the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively this indicates that an obvious shift occurred at the otu level during the electroactive biofilm enrichment process there were 22 36 76 47 and 145 unique otus in the mfcs fed with 0 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively showing that the main species in these anodes were different this result is in line with a prior work which revealed that differences in unique otus resulted in different microbial community compositions gong et al 2019 hence contributing to varying mfc performance it should be noted that the differences in the otus could be ascribed to the various ni2 concentrations the venn diagram further demonstrates that a total of 448 otus were shared by these five mfcs communities it is possible that the similarity stems from the adoption of similar environmental and growth conditions during domestication as a result of shared otus different mfcs had comparable microbial communities as well as the capacity to oxidize lactate and generate power the results of employing the α diversity index to assess species richness and bacterial community diversity are presented in table 1 based on the coverage index the mfcs samples attained 0 99 demonstrating that the sequence analysis could cover nearly the whole bacterial population and the equivalent number of otus deng et al 2020 xie et al 2020 the sobs and shannon indexes of the anodic biofilms were much lower than those of the inoculum which was consistent with the simpson and chao indexes hence the anodic biofilms had a lower microbial abundance and diversity than the sludge it is worth mentioning that the mfc system and the toxic ni2 may have a selective influence on the anodic microbial community pca was used to explain the diverse clusters of bacterial populations found in various anode biofilms fig 7b pca 1 and 2 revealed 62 81 and 12 59 of the entire community variations respectively the mfcs fed with 10 20 and 40 mg l ni2 were grouped together whereas they were separated from those without ni2 0 mg l the results showed that the microbial community compositions of these mfcs i e 10 20 and 40 mg l were quite similar however the bacterial communities of the mfcs fed with 80 mg l ni2 shifted considerably therefore the pca analysis revealed that ni2 had a substantial effect on the bacterial community compositions fig 8 depicts the variation of bacterial community structure in the various samples at the phylum class and genus levels bacteroidota 22 05 and proteobacteria 16 31 were the most prevalent phyla in the inoculum fig 8a in contrast desulfobacterota proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidota and actinobacteriota dominated the anodic electroactive biofilms of the mfcs which is consistent with a previous study wang et al 2022 it is well known in the literature that desulfobacterota proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidota and actinobacteriota are typically composed of a considerable number of electroactive bacteria cabrera et al 2022 li et al 2021 wei et al 2019 the functions of these electroactive microbes include both pollutant degradation and power production logan et al 2019 these microbes directly transfer electrons from the respiratory chain to the electrode surface via cytochrome c in addition these predominant electroactive microorganisms are commonly found on the mfc s anode biofilm which aids in the generation of electricity a much more abundance of desulfobacterota 44 54 was found in the mfc containing no ni2 0 mg l than those fed with 10 mg l ni2 32 13 20 mg l ni2 30 70 40 mg l ni2 28 14 and 80 mg l ni2 30 19 thus in the absence of ni2 the relative abundance of desulfobacterota was increased whereas the various ni2 concentrations decreased their abundance indicating that these concentrations were toxic to these bacteria proteobacteria on the other hand predominated in the anodes of the mfcs fed with higher concentrations of ni2 accounting for 30 74 40 mg l mfc and 26 66 80 mg l compared to 18 34 23 38 and 14 80 found in those containing 0 10 and 20 mg l ni2 respectively in a previous study proteobacteria were discovered to be abundant in anodic biofilms and increasing heavy metal concentration was found to promote their growth wu et al 2020 hence the abundance of proteobacteria in the anodic biofilms contributed to ni2 removal in all mfcs especially in those fed with 40 and 80 mg l ni2 it should be noted that firmicutes were observed and might also be responsible for ni2 resistance and removal since they are known to be active in metal contaminated environments and their members possess metal resistance genes bauvais et al 2015 gupta et al 2022 the major classes in the inoculum were bacteroidia and gammaproteobacteria while desulfuromonadia gammaproteobacteria desulfovibrionia and clostridia were the major classes in the anodic biofilms fig 8b the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria increased significantly at high ni2 concentrations of 40 and 80 mg l while desulfuromonadia showed the opposite trend gammaproteobacteria have been reported to include many electroactive bacteria and they have the inherent ability to flourish in metal contaminated environments by detoxifying or absorbing toxic metals singh and kaushik 2021 additionally they have the most respiratory systems based on a sophisticated metabolic network which enables them to recycle both organic and inorganic matter lemaire et al 2020 therefore it is possible that gammaproteobacteria played a significant role in electron transfer and ni2 removal from the mfcs the microbes within the class desulfuromonadia have been proposed as potential exoelectrogens in different bess yan et al 2021 their distribution in the various mfcs followed the same pattern as the power density with the highest relative abundance of desulfuromonadia found in the mfcs without ni2 36 05 and the lowest in those fed 80 mg l ni2 12 07 it is obvious that the various ni2 concentrations were detrimental to desulfuromonadia implying that the introduction of these ni2 concentrations into the anode chamber of the mfcs could have inhibited their activity and development the enrichment of clostridia in the anodes appears to have aided in mfcs power generation as these organisms are known to use diverse substrates such as lactate to produce energy singh and kaushik 2021 the function of the microbial community can be inferred further via genus analysis fig 8c and fig s2 results revealed that the most prevalent genus was geobacter accounting for 36 04 in the mfc devoid of ni2 0 mg l in contrast the percentage of geobacter decreased to 20 49 18 90 15 57 and 12 05 while the proportion of desulfovibrio obviously increased to 11 45 11 56 12 39 and 17 75 in mfcs fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 respectively geobacter a proteobacteria member is a well known electrochemically active bacteria capable of transporting electrons from organic matter to extracellular electron acceptors such as electrodes kouzuma et al 2018 in addition geobacter possesses several genes annotated as c type cytochromes some of which are required for eet and biofilm electroactivity steidl et al 2016 they also participate in direct interspecies electron transfer and provide electrons to other species via electrically conductive pili zheng et al 2021 the decrease in geobacter correlated with the decline in voltage output caused by the addition of ni2 signifying that the various ni2 concentrations were toxic to geobacter similar results were also observed in previous studies where a decrease in the relative abundance of geobacter resulted in a decrease in the voltage output of a bes following heavy metal addition zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b members of the genus desulfovibrio are typical sulfate reducing bacteria often detected in bes anodes their role in electricity generation has been reported desulfovibrio has the ability to directly transfer electrons from the substrate to the electrode surface zheng et al 2021 in addition desulfovibrio has been reported to be resistant to high heavy metal concentrations due to the hydrogen sulfide it produces hydrogen sulfide released into the extracellular environment induces the precipitation of heavy metal ions and protects live cells from heavy metal toxicity yin et al 2019 moreover they are known to possess ni2 resistance genes that enable them to survive in environments with high ni2 concentrations rodionov et al 2004 a previous study reported that desulfovibrio was resistant to 100 ppm ni2 and could achieve 98 3 ni2 removal from a marine environment joo et al 2015 parades aguilar et al 2021 also discovered that the genus desulfovibrio had a high relative abundance in an anaerobic bioreactor treating actual industrial wastewater containing 250 500 ppm ni2 these results were consistent with our study showing that desulfovibrio is resistant to higher ni2 concentrations therefore it is possible that the various ni2 concentrations promoted the proliferation of desulfovibrio in the mfcs it is worth noting that desulfovibrio may have also played an essential role in ni2 removal from the mfcs the genus dechlorosoma was also detected in the mfcs and was dominant in the reactors fed with 80 mg l ni2 8 30 members of the genus dechlorosoma are classified as degrading bacteria because they have been proven to degrade organic compounds lu et al 2021 interestingly dechlorosoma has also been reported to possess bioremediation capacity for heavy metals lack joseph et al 2002 hence it is likely that it contributed to ni2 resistance and removal in the mfc fig 9 illustrates a heat map of the top 50 genera from the samples the color depth represents the genus s relative abundance the anodic microbial communities of the five groups of mfcs differed significantly from the inoculum but there were also moderate variations among the five groups of anodic microbes geobacter was substantially more abundant in the mfc without ni2 than in those fed with various ni2 concentrations whereas desulfovibrio was dominant in the anodic biofilms of the mfc fed with 80 mg l ni2 which is consistent with the results in fig 8c and further confirms that the various ni2 concentrations stimulated the growth of desulfovibrio while being deleterious to geobacter cells therefore these findings indicate that exposing anodic biofilms to ni2 could have an effect on the microbial community resulting in selective enrichment of resistant bacteria and a decrease in eet related microbes 3 5 effect of ni2 on the cellular metabolic pathway to better comprehend the influence of the various ni2 concentrations on cellular metabolic pathway the functional genes involved in the eet process and ni2 resistance were investigated it is well established that eet between microbes and electrodes can be achieved via c type cytochromes or conductive nanowires wen et al 2022 hence we applied picrust based on 16 s rrna gene data coupled with the kegg database to predict the functional genes related to eet process cytochromes c flagella and pili and ni2 resistance the prediction accuracy of picrust could approach 85 90 chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 as shown in fig 10 a the abundance of cytochromes in the mfc fed without ni2 was higher than that of the other mfcs specifically cytochrome c was more abundant in ni2 free mfcs compared to those fed with 10 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 indicating that ni2 inhibited the synthesis of cytochrome c fig 10c cytochrome c are membrane proteins responsible for charge storage in anodic biofilms and they play a crucial role in electron transfer of the respiratory chain wang et al 2020 in addition the gene encoding cytochrome c may serve as the electron shuttle facilitating the transfer of electrons wang et al 2022 geobacter is known to possess a high abundance of cytochrome c steidl et al 2016 thus the decline of cytochrome c in the biofilms were attributed to the decrease in the relative abundance of geobacter in mfcs fed with various ni2 concentrations furthermore genes encoding type iv pilus assembly proteins were more abundant in ni2 free mfc than in those fed varying ni2 concentrations fig 10a for example type iv pilus assembly protein pilb type iv pilus assembly protein pilc and twitching motility protein pilt which have been shown to be electrically conductive li et al 2022 were highly abundant in the mfc fed without ni2 fig 10c in contrast mfcs fed with 20 40 and 80 mg l ni2 had the lowest abundance of these proteins suggesting that these concentrations had a more drastic effect on genes encoding pili proteins of note pili which are cytochrome coated could act as electrical conduits for long distance electron transport across multilayer biofilms as well as a scaffold for microbial attachment and electroactive biofilm formation zhou et al 2017 moreover genes encoding flagellar components were significantly higher in ni2 free mfcs than in those fed with varying ni2 concentrations fig 10a in particular the flagellum encoded by flic gene which is related to biofilm development and bacterial swimming activity ansari et al 2021 wen et al 2022 was much more abundant in the ni2 free mfcs than in those fed with varied ni2 concentrations indicating that the various ni2 concentrations may have impeded flagella synthesis fig 10c as shown in fig 10a less activity appeared to be associated with ni2 homeostasis and resistance as evidenced by the lower abundance of genes related to ni2 uptake and resistance compared to those eet genes within the community however their abundance differed among the anodic biofilms with mfcs fed with ni2 having a higher abundance of copg family transcriptional regulator nickel responsive regulator nikr than the control group fig 10d the higher abundance of the nikr gene in the electroactive biofilms of nickel fed mfcs corresponds with the higher relative abundance of desulfovibrio in these mfcs desulfovibrio is known to possess the nikr gene which contributed to the enrichment of biofilms with this gene rodionov et al 2004 most microorganisms import ni2 through an atp dependent nickel specific permease encoded by the nikabcde operon kumar et al 2021 when intracellular ni2 concentrations are high nikr represses this operon contreras et al 2003 a previous study found that nikr was required for helicobacter pylori survival in the presence of high ni2 and co2 concentrations contreras et al 2003 therefore nikr played an important role in ni2 resistance in the mfcs the effect of the various ni2 concentrations on the expression of eet related genes such as pila and c type cytochromes omcs omcz omcc omcb and omce was evaluated fig 10b the expression levels of the genes decreased significantly in response to ni2 exposure which was consistent with the decline in electricity production the mfc fed with 80 mg l ni2 had the least expression level 0 80 0 17 log copies ng dna of the pila gene further confirming that this concentration had a greater effect on this gene in contrast the ni2 free mfc showed the highest expression 1 96 0 18 log copies ng dna of pila gene in addition the expression of omcs omcz omcc omcb and omce genes decreased significantly in the presence of various ni2 concentrations compared to the other c type cytochromes the expression level of omcz was significantly higher several reports have previously confirmed that numerous c type cytochromes participate in eet in mfc but only omcz is required for biofilm electroactivity nevin et al 2009 steidl et al 2016 the high expression of omcz in the ni2 free mfc corresponds to the highest output voltage observed in this mfc confirming that this gene influences electrogenic performance more directly in our mfcs when the electroactive biofilms were exposed to the various ni2 concentrations the expression of omcz decreased from 5 20 0 36 log copies ng dna at 0 mg l to 2 17 0 22 log copies ng dna at 80 mg l ni2 therefore the decrease in the expression levels of eet associated genes with ni2 exposure resulted from the decrease in the relative abundance of geobacter overall these findings show that the presence of various ni2 concentrations inhibited protein synthesis and the expression of eet related genes resulting in decreased eab electroactivity 4 conclusion this study investigated the impact of ni2 on bes anode eabs and current output mfcs lactate degradation electricity generation and metal removal efficiency declined as ni2 concentration increased which could be attributed to decreased viability and shifts in the microbial community as revealed by clsm sem and microbial community analysis ftir spectroscopy revealed the involvement of several microbial biofilms functional groups including hydroxyl amides methyl amine and carboxyl in the uptake of ni2 cv analysis demonstrated that the various ni2 concentrations reduced the biocatalytic activity and current output of the mfcs additionally the total internal resistance of the mfcs increased with an increase in ni2 concentration the existence of ni2 in the mfcs anodic chambers had a selective effect on the microbial community resulting in the evolution of resistant species and a decrease in eet related bacteria the percentage of geobacter decreased as the ni2 concentration increased whereas the proportion of desulfovibrio increased the decrease of the classic exoelectrogens geobacter was associated with the decline of current production while the increase of desulfovibrio improved the bess ability to tolerate high ni2 stress the impact of ni2 on eet related genes was also assessed for the first time and the results show that the various ni2 concentrations decreased the expression of eet associated genes the nikr gene was observed to have a pivotal role in ni2 resistance in the mfcs the results of this work would contribute to the advancement of knowledge regarding ni2 inhibition on eabs as well as the treatment of real wastewater containing ni2 in the anode of bes the concurrent removal of organic matter and ni2 seems promising for practical wastewater treatment additionally it will significantly reduce ni2 removal operation costs in the future the microbial anodic biofilms should be developed with inoculum obtained from a heavy metal polluted site to improve toxicity resistance expedite mass transfer reduce internal resistance and enhance ce lastly mfcs with different operating conditions should be investigated in order to achieve more efficient ni2 removal and higher energy output declaration of

derived from wastewater and human animal feces based on sourcetracker analysis and args indicators notably watershed restoration could significantly mitigate the args pollution status and improve biodiversity in the aquatic environment network analysis identified several hub args and bacterial genera which helped to infer potential bacterial hosts carrying args furthermore args indicators provided insights to trace args sources sems indicated that bioavailable heavy metals and nutrients can greatly shape args dynamics in regions with high intensity human activities while the microbial community and mges dominate the fate of args in less human impacted regions more attention should be given to control heavy metals and nutrients to curb the spread of args overall this study highlights the environmental fate of args and provides novel strategies to mitigate args pollution in the human intensive watershed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes bacterial community watershed structural equation model indicator data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are ancient and inherent in the natural environment d costa et al 2011 however human activities have accelerated their prevalence and dissemination in various environments around the world and hence they are characterized as emerging contaminants pruden et al 2006 the potential pathways of args carried by mobile genetic elements mges and transferred from environmental bacteria to human pathogens pose threats to modern medicine and public health martínez josé 2008 qiao et al 2018 as estimated by the uk government the damaging effects of antimicrobial resistance may lead to 10 million deaths and 100 trillion total gdp loss in 2050 o neill 2014 at present the acceleration of urbanization has greatly promoted the agglomeration of population to large cities in 2020 china s urbanization rate reached 63 89 national bureau of statistics of china 2021 due to the input of wastewater from various sources such as households hospitals wastewater treatment plants wwtps aquaculture ponds and livestock farms human intensive watersheds are prone to become important reservoirs of args and their bacterial hosts pazda et al 2019 singh et al 2019 in general a watershed consists of urban rivers canals and lakes with different functions and playing important roles in various ecological and economic services hou et al 2021 therefore revealing the dynamic distribution and dissemination of args in a watershed composed of interconnected rivers and lakes is of great significance args and microbial communities in aquatic environments are subject to strong seasonal and regional variations in conditions chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2021a for a watershed with distinct seasons temperature changes and rainfall intensity are two obvious climatic features temperature changes may result in different antibiotic usages in humans and animals related to seasonal bacterial infections caucci et al 2016 while rainfall intensity can affect agriculture and aquaculture modes runoff and wastewater discharge loads su et al 2017 these factors contribute to the occurrence of args and microbial communities exhibiting seasonal variations in addition functional division of the watershed forms distinct regional pollution characteristics typically urban rivers and canals are utilized for receiving wastewater effluent surface runoff and shipping while lakes are designed for recreational activities drinking water supply and aquaculture our previous study indicated that environmental gradients can greatly affect the distribution patterns of args and bacteria communities in a drinking water river reservoir system chen et al 2019b however less attention has been paid to decipher the spatiotemporal patterns and environmental behavior of args in such complex human intensive watersheds since a variety of args co exists in the watershed disentangling specific args in varied aquatic systems is of great significance hou et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b some generalist and specialist args indicators in different ecotypes have been identified previously providing a way to reveal source sink relationships for widespread args pollution li et al 2018 this may facilitate a more targeted focus on the pollution patterns and behaviors of args within the watershed the propagation of args are co driven by various environmental factors including abiotic e g antibiotics heavy metals and nutrients and biotic factors e g mges and microbial communities zhang et al 2018 previous studies suggested that the key factors shaping args dynamics in different environments are contradictory to some extent chen et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 for instance antibiotics were considered to play foremost roles in the propagation of args in rivers singh et al 2019 while other evidence showed that heavy metals can pose co selection pressures on args by impacting bacterial communities and mges dickinson et al 2019 likewise mges greatly shaped args dynamics via horizontal gene transfer hgt chen et al 2019b zheng et al 2018 however bacterial communities are supposed to contribute most to the antibiotic resistome in soil and drinking water environments forsberg et al 2014 jia et al 2015 therefore it is crucial to elucidate the underlying driving mechanisms of how environmental factors affect the distribution of args in aquatic systems under multi polluted states this has important implications for understanding and designing mitigation strategies to manage the spread of args in human intensive watersheds to address these knowledge gaps this study selected a human intensive watershed consisting of major city rivers canals and lakes in the east taihu lake basin china according to the differences in regional functions the watershed was divided into three systems the river system ris city system cis and lake system las overall the goals were to 1 demonstrate the impacts of seasonal changes and regional functions on the occurrence of args in sediments and surface water throughout the watershed 2 reveal the distribution and co occurrence patterns between args and bacterial communities 3 identify the args indicators and potential bacterial hosts in different aquatic systems and 4 decipher the driving mechanisms and key factors in shaping args dynamics 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the temperate human intensive watershed was located in suzhou city one of the most developed cities in china thirteen representative sampling sites were selected fig 1 ris consisting of four sites in jinghang canal wusong river and taipu river plays significant roles in shipping receiving wastewater effluents and surface runoffs the widths of these rivers range from 50 to 200 m and the flows are fast due to high water volumes and shipping disturbances cis is composed of seven sites in urban rivers surrounded by numerous residential communities hospitals factories and scenic spots urban rivers are narrow and meandering with widths of 5 to 30 m and their main functions are drainage and landscaping las including yangcheng lake and cao lake are famous vacation resorts and aquaculture bases which are less disturbed by human activities than city system and river system table s1 generally the human impacted level and hydrological conditions varied substantially among the three systems all sampling events were conducted on sunny days and ensured that no rainfall occurred five days prior to sampling sediment samples were collected using a grab dredger from the top 15 cm layer over different seasons january 2018 winter april 2018 spring and july 2018 summer table s2 with the promulgation of suzhou ecological river and lake action plan 2018 2020 by suzhou government a series of engineering and management actions were carried out from 2018 to 2020 to protect the watershed ecology such as river dredging wwtps upgrading ecological restoration pollution source controlling etc table s3 since relevant projects were basically completed in october 2020 another sampling campaign was conducted to evaluate the restoration effects sediments and surface water samples 0 5 m below surface were collected at the corresponding 13

pcr ht qpcr was performed on the smartchip real time pcr system wafergen biosystems inc usa a total of 296 primer sets were quantified targeting 283 args 8 transposases 4 integrases and one 16s rrna gene table s5 zhu et al 2013 detailed method description of ht qpcr was in accordance with previous study wang et al 2014 melting curves were automatically generated by wafergen software all qpcrs were performed in technical triplicates with negative controls amplification efficiencies beyond the range of 90 110 were discarded gene copy number 10 31 c t 10 3 where ct refers to threshold cycle and the limit value is 31 the relative abundance of args was obtained by dividing the args copy number by the 16s rrna gene copy number while the absolute abundance of args was calculated by multiplying the relative abundance of args with the absolute abundance of 16s rrna gene measured by real time qpcr using the roche 480 system ouyang et al 2015 2 3 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing the v4 v5 regions of bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified and sequenced on an illumina miseq platform by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the universal primer sets 515f gtgccagcmgccgcgg and 907r ccgtcaattcmtttragttt were applied the reaction conditions were same with previous study chen et al 2019a raw fastq files were quality filtered by trimmomatic and merged by flash bolger et al 2014 raw sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at the 97 similarity level by uparse version 7 1 the taxonomic information was aligned with the silva database using a confidence threshold of 70 raw sequence datasets were uploaded to the ncbi sequence read archive with the bio project accession number prjna820905 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was applied to explore the statistical significance p 0 05 using spss 24 0 spss inc usa least significant difference was used for homogeneous data analysis while the kruskal wallis test k w test was considered for non homogeneous data the args indicators for each system were filtered out using the indval function in the r software version 3 4 3 with indval value 0 7 and p 0 01 as criteria hou et al 2021 structural equation models sems were employed to estimate the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on args dynamics the dimensionality reduction data of

args mges and bacterial communities relative abundance were visualized using the gephi platform 0 9 2 based on spearman s analysis ρ 0 8 and p 0 01 basic graphics were produced by origin pro 2017 originlab usa while other figures were plotted in r heatmap and circos was used to display the relative and absolute abundance of args and mges with the pheatmap and circlize packages respectively principle coordinates analysis pcoa procrustes analysis and mantle test were conducted using vegan and ggplot2 packages 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal differences in diversity and abundance of args and mges a total of 276 unique genes 264 args and 12 mges and 201 genes 190 args and 11 mges were detected in sediments and surface water respectively conferring resistance to nine major classes of antibiotics among them aminoglycoside beta lactamase and multidrug resistance genes were the most frequently detected categories fig 2 a for sediments the diversity of args ranged from 35 to 190 and classified into four groups according to different resistance mechanism antibiotic deactivation 43 8 efflux pump 32 1 cellular protection 20 7 and others 3 4 fig s1 along the seasonal gradient the diversity of args was highest in winter and obviously higher than in spring and summer kw test p 0 01 fig 2b specifically the number of vancomycin multidrug and mlsb resistance genes detected was significantly higher in winter in addition args diversity 49 97 was at low level after watershed restoration as revealed by the sampling in october 2020 for the regional gradient args were detected in the range of 53 138 57 190 and 35 142 for ris cis and las respectively with 147 args shared among the three systems fig 2c the diversity of args in the cis was markedly richer than that in the las kw test p 0 01 notably the highest args diversity was consistently observed at sites c4 85 178 and c6 97 160 located in the ancient town with dense residential areas and dilapidated drainage systems throughout the sampling period for surface water venn diagram analysis revealed that 195 args which accounted for 69 1 of the total detected args co existed with sediments fig 2d indicating the prevalence and more frequent interactions of these genes in the watershed however 81 args tended to be existed in sediments the dominant categories and resistance mechanisms of args were similar in both phases besides cis also showed higher diversity with 90 args co occurring among the three systems fig s2a similarly obviously more diverse args were detected at sites c4 and c6 fig s2b for ris the highest args diversity occurred at site r1 in the upstream of watershed compared to our previous studies conducted in september 2018 and january 2019 zhang et al 2021b the args diversity in jinghang canal and yangcheng lake showed a remarkable decreasing trend while it increased in taipu river located in the downstream to some extent for sediments the absolute abundances of args and mges ranged from 1 45 108 to 1 40 1011 and 6 37 106 to 3 43 1010 copies g respectively the highest absolute abundances of args and mges both occurred in spring in particular exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher than samples collected in october 2020 anova p 0 05 a spatial order of cis ris las was shown for the absolute abundance of args showing 2 27 and 4 06 times higher than ris and las on average respectively fig 3a notably for ris the relative abundance of args decreased from upstream r1 to downstream r3 while the absolute abundance increased however the relative and absolute abundances of mges showed a continuous increasing trend furthermore the absolute abundance of vancomycin resistance genes in winter was 12 2 75 1 times higher than the other seasons a consistent phenomenon was observed in that the relative abundances of args and mges were both highest in spring fig s3 for water the absolute abundances of args and mges in the cis were 8 89 19 11 and 5 29 10 44 times higher than that in the ris and las respectively kw test p 0 05 fig 3b however higher relative abundance of mges was observed in the ris for both sediment and water phases is613 and tnpa 05 were the two major mges detected in water column while tnpa 04 was the dominant mge in earlier investigation zhang et al 2021b briefly the relative abundance of args decreased approximately 2 5 times compared to previous results while mges remained at the same level 1 5 10 2 1 7 10 1 in addition it should be noted that multidrug resistance genes contributed the most to the total absolute abundance of args in sediments 56 33 while aminoglycoside resistance genes were the most abundant in water 36 06 3 2 distribution patterns of args and indicators for different systems the distribution patterns of args and mges were explored by pcoa an obvious separation was observed between sediments and water phases suggesting distinct args compositions in different phases of the aquatic environment anosim r 0 617 p 0 001 fig 4 a notably regional gradient had significant effect on the distribution patterns of args in sediments fig s4a ris and cis samples tended to cluster together while las samples were clearly separated this was consistent with the previously observed pattern that ris and cis shared a great deal of args for seasonal variation the distribution of args based on relative abundances did not exhibit obvious temporal patterns anosim r 0 031 p 0 174 fig 4b however watershed restoration has significantly altered the args composition pattern in sediments fig s4b in addition the co occurrence patterns between args and mges in the three systems were individually discussed based on network analysis fig s5 aminoglycoside resistance genes had the strongest associations with other args in the ris and cis as indicated by node numbers while multidrug resistance genes were more frequently linked with other genes in the las normally the node which had the most connections in each network was defined as the hub therefore qacedelta1 02 aada 02 and oprj were identified as the hub args in the ris cis and las respectively another interesting finding was that stronger correlations were observed between args and mges in water than that in sediments fig s6 sourcetracker analysis can infer the possible sources of args contamination in different systems indicator args across four ecotypes human feces animal feces wwtps and natural environment were identified from 656 global scale datasets li et al 2018 in this study 24 args representing four potential pollution sources were selected to evaluate their distribution table s6 fecal indicator args had relatively higher contributions in the cis with proportions higher than 80 likewise cis and ris were seriously polluted by wastewater and the proportion of related indicator args accounted for 96 7 as for the indicators of the natural environment the distribution was homogeneous in the three systems fig s7 coincidentally indicator args showed similar source proportions in sediments and water revealing that fecal and wastewater pollution predominated moreover based on the occurrence and abundance of args and mges 10 indicators were identified in sediments table s7 in particular 8 args conferring resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactamase tetracycline and one transposase tnpa 05 were selected as indicators for cis besides one transposase tnpa 04 was identified for ris however no indicator was found for las likewise for surface water 3 bla l1 erm 36 oprd 2 cmx a and flor and 1 ampc 06 indicators were selected for ris cis and las respectively 3 3 composition of bacterial community and co occurrence patterns with args for sediments a total of 2433 651 high quality sequences were obtained and clustered into 10 282 otus at phylum level 72 bacterial phyla were identified and 11 of them were found with average abundance above 1 5 fig 5 a proteobacteria was the dominant phylum with average relative abundance of 29 1 followed by bacteroidota 17 5 and chloroflexi 10 6 pcoa showed that seasonal changes could significantly alter the bacterial communities anosim p 0 001 fig s8a while no distinct regional variation was observed anosim p 0 135 fig s8b in particular the proportion of proteobacteria gradually decreased by 28 from january 2018 to october 2020 and its proportion was much higher in the cis and ris kw test p 0 05 or 0 01 shannon and chao1 indexes suggested that the diversity and richness of bacterial communities in the las and after watershed restoration samples were obviously higher table s8 for surface water the main bacterial phyla were proteobacteria acidobacteriota cyanobacteria and bacteroidota accounting for 90 6 of total bacterial sequences fig 5b which was consistent with previous finding that occupied for 95 0 zhang et al 2021b notably the proportions of acidobacteriota and cyanobacteria were remarkably decreased while proteobacteria was increased the diversity of bacterial communities in the cis was much lower than ris and las moreover bacterial communities tended to be more diverse in sediments than in water table s9 and distinct structures between the two phases were revealed by pcoa fig 5c procrustes analysis and mantel test were applied to investigate the correlations between bacterial genera and args procrustes analysis indicated that args were correlated significantly with bacterial composition m2 0 7574 p 0 001 likewise the mantle test also demonstrated a similar trend r 0 2366 p 0 0005 fig 5d to identify the potential bacterial hosts for args the bacteria args networks were visualized among args mges and bacterial genera based on significant correlations notably the three aquatic systems exhibited unique co occurrence patterns in view of the modularity the network in the ris fig 6 cis fig s9a and las fig s9b was parsed into 9 4 and 7 modules respectively furthermore aada2 01 qacedelta1 02 and qach 02 genes were regarded as hub args while dechloromonas candidatus anammoximicrobium and polaromonas genera were identified as hub bacteria in the ris cis and las respectively in addition the bacteria args network in water was more complex and dense with limnohabitans genus defined as hub bacteria fig s10 3 4 environmental factors driving args dynamics in sediments and surface water since numerous environmental factors may drive args dynamics heavy metals antibiotics and nutrients were monitored in sediments and water a wide range of heavy metals was detected and exhibited obvious spatiotemporal variations figs s11 and s12 in particular the highest total metal content always existed in the cis of which cr cu zn and pb contents were significantly higher than that in the ris and las kw test p 0 05 more severe metal enrichment appeared in winter notably the proportions of bioavailable cd mn and zn exceeded 45 table s10 antibiotic residues were also analyzed fig s13 showing content ranges of 14 52 2040 27 28 2248 and 12 67 271 1 ng g in sediments for ris cis and las respectively a decreasing seasonal trend of winter spring summer was observed for water the mean antibiotic content in the ris cis and las was 337 3 537 8 and 46 41 ng l respectively moreover basic properties such as toc tn tp nh3 n and no3 n were measured and presented in tables s11 and s12 in order to explore the correlations between environmental factors and args pearson correlation and redundancy analysis rda were conducted notably the absolute abundances of total args and mges were significantly correlated regardless of surface water or sediment phases 0 88 r 0 96 p 0 01 fig s14 for sediments the concentrations of tetracycline and vancomycin were positively correlated with the absolute abundance of corresponding args while other antibiotics showed varied correlations with args fig s15a moreover args presented strong correlations with many heavy metals e g cr ni cu zn and as especially for bioavailable heavy metals fig s15b for water antibiotics could strongly impact the bacterial communities in the cis and total phosphorus was found to influence the bacterial communities in the ris and las fig s16 sems were adopted to determine and rank the total effects of multiple biotic and abiotic factors on args dynamics in the watershed for sediments six factors including sediment properties sps antibiotics abs heavy metals hms bioavailable heavy metals bhms mges and microbial communities bcs were selected strikingly the ranking of factors influencing args dynamics in the three systems was conflicting to some extent in general the key controlling factors in shaping args patterns were sps bhms and bcs for ris cis and las respectively fig 7 a b c furthermore four parameters consisting of water properties wps abs bcs and mges were chosen to explore their effects on args dynamics in surface water and their total standardized effects ranked as bcs 0 948 mges 0 710 sps 0 285 abs 0 013 fig 7d 4 discussion high intensity anthropogenic activities have contributed to urban aquatic environments as critical args reservoirs considering urban rivers canals and lakes as a whole provides a novel perspective for macro understanding and management of watershed pollution so far little attention has been paid to the dynamic distribution and driving mechanisms of args in the megacity around taihu lake basin in this study ht qpcr was utilized to present an in depth investigation and outlook on args pollution in a human intensive watershed 4 1 seasonal changes and regional functions affect the occurrence of args highly diverse args 35 190 resistant to almost all major classes of antibiotics were detected in urban rivers canals and lakes fig 2a showing a comparable diversity range to other watersheds zhang et al 2021a 2018 this result coupled with the evidence that up to 195 args 69 1 were shared between sediments and water indicated that the human intensive watershed was ubiquitously contaminated by args as expected the occurrence of args was significantly influenced by seasonal changes and regional functions seasonal changes lead to distinctive temporal characteristics of args pollution higher args abundances were observed in spring and summer fig 3a while more diverse args were detected in winter fig 2b similar findings were reported in southern china such as jiulong river hu et al 2020 and zhangxi river zheng et al 2018 this phenomenon can be explained from two aspects on the one hand higher water temperature in spring 17 2 23 8 and summer 29 5 35 0 and longer sunshine time about 9 h favored the rapid growth of microorganisms which can be confirmed by the higher absolute abundance of the 16s rrna gene as it represents bacterial abundance luo et al 2010 more abundant bacterial biomass provided more opportunities for args and mges to harbor and propagate chen et al 2019b on the other hand spring and summer are the rainy seasons in southern china with heavier precipitation and prone to bursting floodsthis was confirmed by the elevated water levels of rivers table s2 activities such as agriculture and aquaculture become more frequent and surface runoffs containing args are continuously drained into rivers and lakes di cesare et al 2017 for example the higher diversity and abundance of args observed in sediments and water of yangcheng lake in summer was closely related to the large scale net crab aquaculture as it is a world renowned crab farming base nevertheless the args pollution was gradually mitigated in other seasons besides relevant statistics showed that wwtps in this watershed treated 7 0 and 18 9 more wastewater in spring and summer than in winter respectively table s2 however slower flow rate and smaller runoff of rivers in winter created favorable conditions for args and particulate matters to settle into sediments notably the significantly higher diversity and abundance of vancomycin resistance genes detected in winter may be related to the heavy use of vancomycin and the discharge of hospital wastewater vancomycin is considered one of the last resort antibiotics against bacterial infections smith et al 1999 policies such as banning the use of vancomycin and its analogues may be effective in controlling the dissemination of related args and pathogens as revealed by such intervention in taiwan lauderdale et al 2007 moreover the lower diversity and abundance of args detected in october 2020 can be ascribed to the plenty of watershed restoration projects conducted by suzhou government from 2018 to 2020 by the end of 2020 the domestic wastewater treatment rates in urban and rural areas reached 98 and 92 respectively all wwtps effluents were required to further treated such as artificial wetlands or filtration to meet the latest discharge standards for the taihu lake basin db32 1072 2018 besides up to 3000 km of rivers were dredged agricultural activities and net aquaculture were strictly controlled to reduce secondary pollution and point or non point source inputs the mitigation of args pollution in the surface water of yangcheng lake was a positive feedback for aquaculture management according to the suzhou ecological environment status bulletin the proportion of surface water body sections under the provincial monitoring program that met grade ⅰ ⅲ water quality standards rose from 76 to 92 from 2018 to 2020 therefore it is not surprising that args pollution in 2020 has been weakened whether in sediments or surface water compared to 2018 higher water quality may result in lower abundance of args and change their distribution patterns wu et al 2019 in addition the shannon index of bacterial communities was the highest in 2020 implying that ecological restoration of watershed can significantly improve the quality of aquatic environments and promote increased biodiversity similarly regional functions alter the distribution patterns of args pollution cis showed the most serious args contamination compared to ris and las fig 3 previous studies have also reported that cis was the most polluted by antibiotics and heavy metals yang et al 2020 2022 indicating the presence of multiple contamination in general cis is functionally positioned as living and commercial areas it should be noted that two sites c4 and c6 located in the ancient town showed the highest diversity and abundance of args throughout the sampling period although the args pollution has been mitigated in 2020 compared to 2018 both sites still have higher pollution level in water and sediments than the other sites moreover the args composition was highly similar in both phases suggesting the potential of direct args input from water to sediments this can be explained from two aspects first the classical gardens in the ancient town of suzhou are listed as a world heritage site and are visited by tourists from all over the world here the large population generates complex and huge amounts of wastewater and the dilapidated drainage system increases the potential for direct discharge from diverse sources second the narrow and meandering rivers provides favorable conditions for the deposition of pollutants and the coexistence of multiple pollutants can induce and facilitate the propagation and spread of args dickinson et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 ris is mainly composed of canals whose functions are waterway transportation and runoff diversion although ris receives large amounts of effluents from wwtps and surface runoff from farmlands or roads the strong scouring and dilution effects caused by large quantities of runoff results in lower pollution level however it is noted that the continuous discharge of wastewater from cis leads to higher absolute abundance of args and mges downstream the strong material migration microbial movement and gene exchange resulted in similar distribution patterns of args between ris and cis fig 4a las as important aquaculture bases and drinking water sources has received significant attention with respect to its water quality normally the stagnant state of lakes is conducive to becoming sinks for pollutants fortunately the diversity and abundance of args were obviously lower in the lakes due to less anthropogenic influence and strict diffused pollution management taken together seasonal changes and human activities have significant impacts on the args distribution patterns in the watershed 4 2 arg indicators reveal wastewater and feces as the major contamination sources args pollution is a region specific phenomenon and both human activities and natural processes can impact the fate of args substantially in the watershed ma et al 2016 our results suggest that wastewater and feces are the two major contamination sources of args fig s7 to be specific cis was dominated by human and animal fecal pollution while ris was mainly polluted by wastewater dense residential communities and general hospitals surround the cis and domestic sewage from the population and domesticated animals may cause fecal pollution in the rivers due to drainage system overflows and leakages chen et al 2020 several typical fecal indicators such as bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus hu et al 2020 showed significantly higher proportions in sediments which further confirmed that cis was severely contaminated by feces previous study revealed that fecal pollution can explain the abundance of args in anthropogenically impacted environments karkman et al 2019 furthermore wwtps are considered as hotspots for args transmission into environments because conventional treatment processes cannot adequately remove args an et al 2018 yu et al 2020 not surprisingly ris exhibited a larger proportion of wastewater pollution due to its vital role in receiving effluents from wwtps as for the indicators of the natural environment these were homogeneously distributed in the watershed this suggested that in densely populated watersheds args are mainly influenced by human activities instead of natural disturbances several representative args indicators were identified for each aquatic system to help track args sources and dissemination routes the majority of args indicators were screened for cis conferring resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactamase and tetracyclines table s7 these top abundant indicators were found to be prevalent in wwtps and feces ma et al 2016 ng et al 2018 revealing their significant roles in shaping the antibiotic resistome and driving fluctuations in human impacted regions more specifically args resistant to the last resort antibiotics carbapenems blages and blaveb were identified as indicators which are supposed to be persistent in hospital effluents receiving rivers laffite et al 2020 this heightens the need for concern and mitigation actions for these high risk args another three args indicators against tetracyclines tet 32 tetm 01 and tetm 02 were also identified which are frequently observed at high abundance in aquaculture ponds and swine wastewater sui et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 suggesting possible inputs of animal feces into cis in addition one transposon tnpa 04 was identified as an indicator for ris high abundance of tnpa 04 was found in both water and sediments of the ris indicating the strong capacity of horizontal transfer of args in the fast flowing canals zhang et al 2021b based on the identified args indicators high risk sources in the dissemination of args such as hospital wastewater and human animal feces should be prioritized paving the way for mitigating the propagation of args and designing effective control strategies 4 3 potential bacterial hosts of args facilitate their dissemination bacteria transmit genetic information through mges and spread args among environmental bacteria zhu et al 2013 in this study a strong significant positive linear correlation between args and mges was observed in both sediment and water phases fig s15 suggesting the strong influence of mges on the dissemination of args through hgt in particular hgt proved to be the main mechanism for the widespread dissemination of args in aquatic environments zheng et al 2018 however more mges in water exhibited strong associations with args as visualized by the co occurrence networks fig s10 this may be related to the hydrodynamic differences between the two phases as the more turbulent structure of moving water helped to facilitate the interactions among args and mges hence mges could accelerate the dissemination of args throughout the watershed via hgt even to habitats that were in close proximity to human activities leading to higher potential public health risks at the same time bacteria can also impact the proliferation and spread of args via vertical gene transfer vgt the significant correlation between args and bacterial community was confirmed by the mantle test and procrustes analysis fig 5d in addition the bacterial community was the major driver that directly affected mges and further indirectly influenced args fig 7 thus hgt and vgt could together aid the dissemination of args in the bacteria args network of each aquatic system figs 6 and s9 the target args and dominant bacterial genera exhibited high connectivity the network was divided into several modules representing different non random co evolutionary ecological function groups zhang et al 2021a remarkably several bacterial genera served as linking nodes to the targeted args due to their strong correlations and they may be the potential hosts of args exhibiting similar environmental fate for instance dechloromonas was the possible host of aminoglycoside e g aad a1 aad a2 01 03 strb multidrug e g qacedelta1 01 02 tetracycline tetg 02 and sulfonamide sul2 resistance genes in the ris notably dechloromonas has been frequently detected in wwtps petriglieri et al 2021 therefore these args may be carried by dechloromonas during wastewater treatment and discharged in effluents and thus may warrant special attention in wwtps impacted rivers candidatus anammoximicrobium one of the main functional microorganisms for denitrification and anammox processes wang et al 2016 was identified as the hub bacteria in the cis high levels of total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen in this region may have stimulated the ecological activity of this genus furthermore limnohabitans showed the most connections with args and mges in the water phase which have a prominent role in freshwater bacterioplankton communities kasalický et al 2013 thus we speculate that limnohabitans could have acted as a major carrier for various args and mges and accelerated their spread overall network analysis provided potential host bacteria information for args while more precise relationships should be further explored since direct correlations may be biased in complex environments 4 4 key factors shaping args dynamics facilitate targeted args pollution control in natural environments multiple factors can drive selection or co selection of the antibiotic resistome and shape args dynamics chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2021b considering the fact that each aquatic system has unique pollution patterns sems were established individually to evaluate the effects of multiple factors and to identify key factors fig 7 in general bacterial communities and mges positively shaped args dynamics in the whole watershed both for sediments and surface water indicating that the propagation and spread of args were significantly related to their inherent molecular biological processes blair et al 2015 however the ranking of the standardized effects of various factors in different aquatic systems clearly varied and coincided with the catchment contamination characteristics sediment properties e g total carbon nitrogen phosphorus were the dominant factor shaping args in the ris and exhibited strong negative effects a consistent phenomenon of negative influence was noticed for cis and las previous studies have shown that nutrients can promote the growth of arg carrying bacteria su et al 2017 but rich nutrient conditions may also increase the fitness cost of args and reduce the competitiveness of resistant bacteria lin et al 2018 as reservoirs of pollutants from diverse sources sediments in the entire watershed are constantly in high nutrient states and appear to have inhibitory effects on the proliferation of args on the contrary water properties might accelerate the dissemination of args owing to suitable levels of nutrients in surface water interestingly bioavailable heavy metals positively dominated the args patterns in the cis and exhibited stronger effects than total heavy metals while negative effects were found for ris and cis generally heavy metals from pollution sources are more likely to be released in bioavailable fraction and adsorbed to sediment surfaces posing direct stresses to microorganisms sun et al 2019 cis was severely contaminated by heavy metals and highly enriched metals i e ni cu and zn were significantly correlated with almost all categories of args highlighting the strong co selection pressure of metals shaping args certain high levels of toxic metals can act as stressors to stimulate args proliferation by enhancing selective detoxification adaptation of resistant bacteria and conjugative transfer of co resistant and cross resistant plasmids klümper et al 2017 moreover bacterial communities primarily shaped arg dynamics in the las suggesting that natural factors such as microbes have a decisive influence on the fate of args in less human impacted environments moreover previous studies have suggested that antibiotics are one of the key factors to induce args however this study found no strong impacts of antibiotics on args although positive correlations between tetracycline resistance genes and corresponding antibiotics were observed demonstrating that tetracycline may directly regulate the expression of related args other antibiotics did not show such trends similar findings were reported in the yangtze estuary guo et al 2018 and kunming city huang et al 2019 many contributing factors may undermine the direct correlations between antibiotics and args and there is as yet no consensus on these correlations taken together args in the natural aquatic environments were driven by multiple factors and the mechanisms were complex although biological processes may significantly shape args dynamics chemical pollutants such as heavy metals and nutrients are exacerbating the propagation of args through induction and co selection pressure in multi polluted watersheds the occurrence of args was closely linked to the pollution patterns of different aquatic systems generally args were greatly influenced by heavy metals and nutrients in the regions with high intensity anthropogenic activities while natural factors such as microbes may dominate the fate of args in less human impacted regions therefore more attention should be paid to the control of heavy metals and nutrients to curb the spread of args overall identifying the key factors shaping args profiles lead to more targeted management of args pollution strategies including ecological restoration and dredging of rivers upgrading of wwtps processes and management of diffused pollution should be conducted to control args and future research should focus more on the life cycle of args from source to sink in the watershed 5 conclusion this study systematically revealed the dynamic distribution and driving mechanisms of args in a human intensive watershed the main conclusions are as follows args contamination exhibited significant variations in the interconnected city river lake system due to the differences in regional functions and anthropogenic activities a decreasing pollution level of city system river system lake system was observed for args antibiotics and heavy metals in particular wastewater and human animal feces were considered as the dominant pollution sources to the city system seasonal changes and watershed restoration can markedly influence the distribution patterns of args and bacterial communities more diverse args were detected in winter while higher abundances of args and mges were observed in spring and summer args pollution was strongly attenuated due to the ecological restoration and engineering management of the watershed args indicators were identified and co occurrence patterns between args and bacterial genera were visualized providing information for inferring potential sources and bacterial hosts of args high risk sources such as hospital wastewater and domestic sewage should be strictly controlled biological processes may significantly shape args dynamics via bacterial communities and mges however chemical pollutants are exacerbating the propagation of args in multi polluted watersheds the key factors shaping args dynamics in the river city and lake

15657,accelerated urbanization has promoted urban watersheds as important reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes args yet the biogeographical patterns and driving mechanisms of args at the watershed scale remain unclear here we examined the dynamic distribution of args in a human intensive watershed including city river and lake systems over different seasons in a temperate region as well as revealed the key factors shaping args dynamics through structural equation models sems high diversity and abundance of args were detected in sediments and surface water with aminoglycoside beta lactamase and multidrug resistance genes dominating pcoa showed distinct args variations between the two phases seasonal changes and regional functions had significant impacts on the distribution patterns of args more diverse args were detected in winter while higher args abundances were observed in spring and summer the city system showed the highest level of args contamination and was mainly derived from wastewater and human animal feces based on sourcetracker analysis and args indicators notably watershed restoration could significantly mitigate the args pollution status and improve biodiversity in the aquatic environment network analysis identified several hub args and bacterial genera which helped to infer potential bacterial hosts carrying args furthermore args indicators provided insights to trace args sources sems indicated that bioavailable heavy metals and nutrients can greatly shape args dynamics in regions with high intensity human activities while the microbial community and mges dominate the fate of args in less human impacted regions more attention should be given to control heavy metals and nutrients to curb the spread of args overall this study highlights the environmental fate of args and provides novel strategies to mitigate args pollution in the human intensive watershed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes bacterial community watershed structural equation model indicator data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are ancient and inherent in the natural environment d costa et al 2011 however human activities have accelerated their prevalence and dissemination in various environments around the world and hence they are characterized as emerging contaminants pruden et al 2006 the potential pathways of args carried by mobile genetic elements mges and transferred from environmental bacteria to human pathogens pose threats to modern medicine and public health martínez josé 2008 qiao et al 2018 as estimated by the uk government the damaging effects of antimicrobial resistance may lead to 10 million deaths and 100 trillion total gdp loss in 2050 o neill 2014 at present the acceleration of urbanization has greatly promoted the agglomeration of population to large cities in 2020 china s urbanization rate reached 63 89 national bureau of statistics of china 2021 due to the input of wastewater from various sources such as households hospitals wastewater treatment plants wwtps aquaculture ponds and livestock farms human intensive watersheds are prone to become important reservoirs of args and their bacterial hosts pazda et al 2019 singh et al 2019 in general a watershed consists of urban rivers canals and lakes with different functions and playing important roles in various ecological and economic services hou et al 2021 therefore revealing the dynamic distribution and dissemination of args in a watershed composed of interconnected rivers and lakes is of great significance args and microbial communities in aquatic environments are subject to strong seasonal and regional variations in conditions chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2021a for a watershed with distinct seasons temperature changes and rainfall intensity are two obvious climatic features temperature changes may result in different antibiotic usages in humans and animals related to seasonal bacterial infections caucci et al 2016 while rainfall intensity can affect agriculture and aquaculture modes runoff and wastewater discharge loads su et al 2017 these factors contribute to the occurrence of args and microbial communities exhibiting seasonal variations in addition functional division of the watershed forms distinct regional pollution characteristics typically urban rivers and canals are utilized for receiving wastewater effluent surface runoff and shipping while lakes are designed for recreational activities drinking water supply and aquaculture our previous study indicated that environmental gradients can greatly affect the distribution patterns of args and bacteria communities in a drinking water river reservoir system chen et al 2019b however less attention has been paid to decipher the spatiotemporal patterns and environmental behavior of args in such complex human intensive watersheds since a variety of args co exists in the watershed disentangling specific args in varied aquatic systems is of great significance hou et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b some generalist and specialist args indicators in different ecotypes have been identified previously providing a way to reveal source sink relationships for widespread args pollution li et al 2018 this may facilitate a more targeted focus on the pollution patterns and behaviors of args within the watershed the propagation of args are co driven by various environmental factors including abiotic e g antibiotics heavy metals and nutrients and biotic factors e g mges and microbial communities zhang et al 2018 previous studies suggested that the key factors shaping args dynamics in different environments are contradictory to some extent chen et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 for instance antibiotics were considered to play foremost roles in the propagation of args in rivers singh et al 2019 while other evidence showed that heavy metals can pose co selection pressures on args by impacting bacterial communities and mges dickinson et al 2019 likewise mges greatly shaped args dynamics via horizontal gene transfer hgt chen et al 2019b zheng et al 2018 however bacterial communities are supposed to contribute most to the antibiotic resistome in soil and drinking water environments forsberg et al 2014 jia et al 2015 therefore it is crucial to elucidate the underlying driving mechanisms of how environmental factors affect the distribution of args in aquatic systems under multi polluted states this has important implications for understanding and designing mitigation strategies to manage the spread of args in human intensive watersheds to address these knowledge gaps this study selected a human intensive watershed consisting of major city rivers canals and lakes in the east taihu lake basin china according to the differences in regional functions the watershed was divided into three systems the river system ris city system cis and lake system las overall the goals were to 1 demonstrate the impacts of seasonal changes and regional functions on the occurrence of args in sediments and surface water throughout the watershed 2 reveal the distribution and co occurrence patterns between args and bacterial communities 3 identify the args indicators and potential bacterial hosts in different aquatic systems and 4 decipher the driving mechanisms and key factors in shaping args dynamics 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the temperate human intensive watershed was located in suzhou city one of the most developed cities in china thirteen representative sampling sites were selected fig 1 ris consisting of four sites in jinghang canal wusong river and taipu river plays significant roles in shipping receiving wastewater effluents and surface runoffs the widths of these rivers range from 50 to 200 m and the flows are fast due to high water volumes and shipping disturbances cis is composed of seven sites in urban rivers surrounded by numerous residential communities hospitals factories and scenic spots urban rivers are narrow and meandering with widths of 5 to 30 m and their main functions are drainage and landscaping las including yangcheng lake and cao lake are famous vacation resorts and aquaculture bases which are less disturbed by human activities than city system and river system table s1 generally the human impacted level and hydrological conditions varied substantially among the three systems all sampling events were conducted on sunny days and ensured that no rainfall occurred five days prior to sampling sediment samples were collected using a grab dredger from the top 15 cm layer over different seasons january 2018 winter april 2018 spring and july 2018 summer table s2 with the promulgation of suzhou ecological river and lake action plan 2018 2020 by suzhou government a series of engineering and management actions were carried out from 2018 to 2020 to protect the watershed ecology such as river dredging wwtps upgrading ecological restoration pollution source controlling etc table s3 since relevant projects were basically completed in october 2020 another sampling campaign was conducted to evaluate the restoration effects sediments and surface water samples 0 5 m below surface were collected at the corresponding 13 sites all samples were obtained in triplicate and transported to the laboratory within 12 h sediment samples were freeze dried sieved and stored at 20 water samples 1 l were filtered through 0 22 μm

pcr ht qpcr was performed on the smartchip real time pcr system wafergen biosystems inc usa a total of 296 primer sets were quantified targeting 283 args 8 transposases 4 integrases and one 16s rrna gene table s5 zhu et al 2013 detailed method description of ht qpcr was in accordance with previous study wang et al 2014 melting curves were automatically generated by wafergen software all qpcrs were performed in technical triplicates with negative controls amplification efficiencies beyond the range of 90 110 were discarded gene copy number 10 31 c t 10 3 where ct refers to threshold cycle and the limit value is 31 the relative abundance of args was obtained by dividing the args copy number by the 16s rrna gene copy number while the absolute abundance of args was calculated by multiplying the relative abundance of args with the absolute abundance of 16s rrna gene measured by real time qpcr using the roche 480 system ouyang et al 2015 2 3 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing the v4 v5 regions of bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified and sequenced on an illumina miseq platform by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the universal primer sets 515f gtgccagcmgccgcgg and 907r ccgtcaattcmtttragttt were applied the reaction conditions were same with previous study chen et al 2019a raw fastq files were quality filtered by trimmomatic and merged by flash bolger et al 2014 raw sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at the 97 similarity level by uparse version 7 1 the taxonomic information was aligned with the silva database using a confidence threshold of 70 raw sequence datasets were uploaded to the ncbi sequence read archive with the bio project accession number prjna820905 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was applied to explore the statistical significance p 0 05 using spss 24 0 spss inc usa least significant difference was used for homogeneous data analysis while the kruskal wallis test k w test was considered for non homogeneous data the args indicators for each system were filtered out using the indval function in the r software version 3 4 3 with indval value 0 7 and p 0 01 as criteria hou et al 2021 structural equation models sems were employed to estimate the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on args dynamics the dimensionality reduction data of variables were imported to amos 24 spss inc usa for sems construction five goodness of fit criteria were set in this model 1 χ2 3 2 gfi 0 9 3 agfi 0 6 4 rmsea 0 01 5 p 0 5 co occurrence patterns among args mges and bacterial communities relative abundance were visualized using the gephi platform 0 9 2 based on spearman s analysis ρ 0 8 and p 0 01 basic graphics were produced by origin pro 2017 originlab usa while other figures were plotted in r heatmap and circos was used to display the relative and absolute abundance of args and mges with the pheatmap and circlize packages respectively principle coordinates analysis pcoa procrustes analysis and mantle test were conducted using vegan and ggplot2 packages 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal differences in diversity and abundance of args and mges a total of 276 unique genes 264 args and 12 mges and 201 genes 190 args and 11 mges were detected in sediments and surface water respectively conferring resistance to nine major classes of antibiotics among them aminoglycoside beta lactamase and multidrug resistance genes were the most frequently detected categories fig 2 a for sediments the diversity of args ranged from 35 to 190 and classified into four groups according to different resistance mechanism antibiotic deactivation 43 8 efflux pump 32 1 cellular protection 20 7 and others 3 4 fig s1 along the seasonal gradient the diversity of args was highest in winter and obviously higher than in spring and summer kw test p 0 01 fig 2b specifically the number of vancomycin multidrug and mlsb resistance genes detected was significantly higher in winter in addition args diversity 49 97 was at low level after watershed restoration as revealed by the sampling in october 2020 for the regional gradient args were detected in the range of 53 138 57 190 and 35 142 for ris cis and las respectively with 147 args shared among the three systems fig 2c the diversity of args in the cis was markedly richer than that in the las kw test p 0 01 notably the highest args diversity was consistently observed at sites c4 85 178 and c6 97 160 located in the ancient town with dense residential areas and dilapidated drainage systems throughout the sampling period for surface water venn diagram analysis revealed that 195 args which accounted for 69 1 of the total detected args co existed with sediments fig 2d indicating the prevalence and more frequent interactions of these genes in the watershed however 81 args tended to be existed in sediments the dominant categories and resistance mechanisms of args were similar in both phases besides cis also showed higher diversity with 90 args co occurring among the three systems fig s2a similarly obviously more diverse args were detected at sites c4 and c6 fig s2b for ris the highest args diversity occurred at site r1 in the upstream of watershed compared to our previous studies conducted in september 2018 and january 2019 zhang et al 2021b the args diversity in jinghang canal and yangcheng lake showed a remarkable decreasing trend while it increased in taipu river located in the downstream to some extent for sediments the absolute abundances of args and mges ranged from 1 45 108 to 1 40 1011 and 6 37 106 to 3 43 1010 copies g respectively the highest absolute abundances of args and mges both occurred in spring in particular exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher than samples collected in october 2020 anova p 0 05 a spatial order of cis ris las was shown for the absolute abundance of args showing 2 27 and 4 06 times higher than ris and las on average respectively fig 3a notably for ris the relative abundance of args decreased from upstream r1 to downstream r3 while the absolute abundance increased however the relative and absolute abundances of mges showed a continuous increasing trend furthermore the absolute abundance of vancomycin resistance genes in winter was 12 2 75 1 times higher than the other seasons a consistent phenomenon was observed in that the relative abundances of args and mges were both highest in spring fig s3 for water the absolute abundances of args and mges in the cis were 8 89 19 11 and 5 29 10 44 times higher than that in the ris and las respectively kw test p 0 05 fig 3b however higher relative abundance of mges was observed in the ris for both sediment and water phases is613 and tnpa 05 were the two major mges detected in water column while tnpa 04 was the dominant mge in earlier investigation zhang et al 2021b briefly the relative abundance of args decreased approximately 2 5 times compared to previous results while mges remained at the same level 1 5 10 2 1 7 10 1 in addition it should be noted that multidrug resistance genes contributed the most to the total absolute abundance of args in sediments 56 33 while aminoglycoside resistance genes were the most abundant in water 36 06 3 2 distribution patterns of args and indicators for different systems the distribution patterns of args and mges were explored by pcoa an obvious separation was observed between sediments and water phases suggesting distinct args compositions in different phases of the aquatic environment anosim r 0 617 p 0 001 fig 4 a notably regional gradient had significant effect on the distribution patterns of args in sediments fig s4a ris and cis samples tended to cluster together while las samples were clearly separated this was consistent with the previously observed pattern that ris and cis shared a great deal of args for seasonal variation the distribution of args based on relative abundances did not exhibit obvious temporal patterns anosim r 0 031 p 0 174 fig 4b however watershed restoration has significantly altered the args composition pattern in sediments fig s4b in addition the co occurrence patterns between args and mges in the three systems were individually discussed based on network analysis fig s5 aminoglycoside resistance genes had the strongest associations with other args in the ris and cis as indicated by node numbers while multidrug resistance genes were more frequently linked with other genes in the las normally the node which had the most connections in each network was defined as the hub therefore qacedelta1 02 aada 02 and oprj were identified as the hub args in the ris cis and las respectively another interesting finding was that stronger correlations were observed between args and mges in water than that in sediments fig s6 sourcetracker analysis can infer the possible sources of args contamination in different systems indicator args across four ecotypes human feces animal feces wwtps and natural environment were identified from 656 global scale datasets li et al 2018 in this study 24 args representing four potential pollution sources were selected to evaluate their distribution table s6 fecal indicator args had relatively higher contributions in the cis with proportions higher than 80 likewise cis and ris were seriously polluted by wastewater and the proportion of related indicator args accounted for 96 7 as for the indicators of the natural environment the distribution was homogeneous in the three systems fig s7 coincidentally indicator args showed similar source proportions in sediments and water revealing that fecal and wastewater pollution predominated moreover based on the occurrence and abundance of args and mges 10 indicators were identified in sediments table s7 in particular 8 args conferring resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactamase tetracycline and one transposase tnpa 05 were selected as indicators for cis besides one transposase tnpa 04 was identified for ris however no indicator was found for las likewise for surface water 3 bla l1 erm 36 oprd 2 cmx a and flor and 1 ampc 06 indicators were selected for ris cis and las respectively 3 3 composition of bacterial community and co occurrence patterns with args for sediments a total of 2433 651 high quality sequences were obtained and clustered into 10 282 otus at phylum level 72 bacterial phyla were identified and 11 of them were found with average abundance above 1 5 fig 5 a proteobacteria was the dominant phylum with average relative abundance of 29 1 followed by bacteroidota 17 5 and chloroflexi 10 6 pcoa showed that seasonal changes could significantly alter the bacterial communities anosim p 0 001 fig s8a while no distinct regional variation was observed anosim p 0 135 fig s8b in particular the proportion of proteobacteria gradually decreased by 28 from january 2018 to october 2020 and its proportion was much higher in the cis and ris kw test p 0 05 or 0 01 shannon and chao1 indexes suggested that the diversity and richness of bacterial communities in the las and after watershed restoration samples were obviously higher table s8 for surface water the main bacterial phyla were proteobacteria acidobacteriota cyanobacteria and bacteroidota accounting for 90 6 of total bacterial sequences fig 5b which was consistent with previous finding that occupied for 95 0 zhang et al 2021b notably the proportions of acidobacteriota and cyanobacteria were remarkably decreased while proteobacteria was increased the diversity of bacterial communities in the cis was much lower than ris and las moreover bacterial communities tended to be more diverse in sediments than in water table s9 and distinct structures between the two phases were revealed by pcoa fig 5c procrustes analysis and mantel test were applied to investigate the correlations between bacterial genera and args procrustes analysis indicated that args were correlated significantly with bacterial composition m2 0 7574 p 0 001 likewise the mantle test also demonstrated a similar trend r 0 2366 p 0 0005 fig 5d to identify the potential bacterial hosts for args the bacteria args networks were visualized among args mges and bacterial genera based on significant correlations notably the three aquatic systems exhibited unique co occurrence patterns in view of the modularity the network in the ris fig 6 cis fig s9a and las fig s9b was parsed into 9 4 and 7 modules respectively furthermore aada2 01 qacedelta1 02 and qach 02 genes were regarded as hub args while dechloromonas candidatus anammoximicrobium and polaromonas genera were identified as hub bacteria in the ris cis and las respectively in addition the bacteria args network in water was more complex and dense with limnohabitans genus defined as hub bacteria fig s10 3 4 environmental factors driving args dynamics in sediments and surface water since numerous environmental factors may drive args dynamics heavy metals antibiotics and nutrients were monitored in sediments and water a wide range of heavy metals was detected and exhibited obvious spatiotemporal variations figs s11 and s12 in particular the highest total metal content always existed in the cis of which cr cu zn and pb contents were significantly higher than that in the ris and las kw test p 0 05 more severe metal enrichment appeared in winter notably the proportions of bioavailable cd mn and zn exceeded 45 table s10 antibiotic residues were also analyzed fig s13 showing content ranges of 14 52 2040 27 28 2248 and 12 67 271 1 ng g in sediments for ris cis and las respectively a decreasing seasonal trend of winter spring summer was observed for water the mean antibiotic content in the ris cis and las was 337 3 537 8 and 46 41 ng l respectively moreover basic properties such as toc tn tp nh3 n and no3 n were measured and presented in tables s11 and s12 in order to explore the correlations between environmental factors and args pearson correlation and redundancy analysis rda were conducted notably the absolute abundances of total args and mges were significantly correlated regardless of surface water or sediment phases 0 88 r 0 96 p 0 01 fig s14 for sediments the concentrations of tetracycline and vancomycin were positively correlated with the absolute abundance of corresponding args while other antibiotics showed varied correlations with args fig s15a moreover args presented strong correlations with many heavy metals e g cr ni cu zn and as especially for bioavailable heavy metals fig s15b for water antibiotics could strongly impact the bacterial communities in the cis and total phosphorus was found to influence the bacterial communities in the ris and las fig s16 sems were adopted to determine and rank the total effects of multiple biotic and abiotic factors on args dynamics in the watershed for sediments six factors including sediment properties sps antibiotics abs heavy metals hms bioavailable heavy metals bhms mges and microbial communities bcs were selected strikingly the ranking of factors influencing args dynamics in the three systems was conflicting to some extent in general the key controlling factors in shaping args patterns were sps bhms and bcs for ris cis and las respectively fig 7 a b c furthermore four parameters consisting of water properties wps abs bcs and mges were chosen to explore their effects on args dynamics in surface water and their total standardized effects ranked as bcs 0 948 mges 0 710 sps 0 285 abs 0 013 fig 7d 4 discussion high intensity anthropogenic activities have contributed to urban aquatic environments as critical args reservoirs considering urban rivers canals and lakes as a whole provides a novel perspective for macro understanding and management of watershed pollution so far little attention has been paid to the dynamic distribution and driving mechanisms of args in the megacity around taihu lake basin in this study ht qpcr was utilized to present an in depth investigation and outlook on args pollution in a human intensive watershed 4 1 seasonal changes and regional functions affect the occurrence of args highly diverse args 35 190 resistant to almost all major classes of antibiotics were detected in urban rivers canals and lakes fig 2a showing a comparable diversity range to other watersheds zhang et al 2021a 2018 this result coupled with the evidence that up to 195 args 69 1 were shared between sediments and water indicated that the human intensive watershed was ubiquitously contaminated by args as expected the occurrence of args was significantly influenced by seasonal changes and regional functions seasonal changes lead to distinctive temporal characteristics of args pollution higher args abundances were observed in spring and summer fig 3a while more diverse args were detected in winter fig 2b similar findings were reported in southern china such as jiulong river hu et al 2020 and zhangxi river zheng et al 2018 this phenomenon can be explained from two aspects on the one hand higher water temperature in spring 17 2 23 8 and summer 29 5 35 0 and longer sunshine time about 9 h favored the rapid growth of microorganisms which can be confirmed by the higher absolute abundance of the 16s rrna gene as it represents bacterial abundance luo et al 2010 more abundant bacterial biomass provided more opportunities for args and mges to harbor and propagate chen et al 2019b on the other hand spring and summer are the rainy seasons in southern china with heavier precipitation and prone to bursting floodsthis was confirmed by the elevated water levels of rivers table s2 activities such as agriculture and aquaculture become more frequent and surface runoffs containing args are continuously drained into rivers and lakes di cesare et al 2017 for example the higher diversity and abundance of args observed in sediments and water of yangcheng lake in summer was closely related to the large scale net crab aquaculture as it is a world renowned crab farming base nevertheless the args pollution was gradually mitigated in other seasons besides relevant statistics showed that wwtps in this watershed treated 7 0 and 18 9 more wastewater in spring and summer than in winter respectively table s2 however slower flow rate and smaller runoff of rivers in winter created favorable conditions for args and particulate matters to settle into sediments notably the significantly higher diversity and abundance of vancomycin resistance genes detected in winter may be related to the heavy use of vancomycin and the discharge of hospital wastewater vancomycin is considered one of the last resort antibiotics against bacterial infections smith et al 1999 policies such as banning the use of vancomycin and its analogues may be effective in controlling the dissemination of related args and pathogens as revealed by such intervention in taiwan lauderdale et al 2007 moreover the lower diversity and abundance of args detected in october 2020 can be ascribed to the plenty of watershed restoration projects conducted by suzhou government from 2018 to 2020 by the end of 2020 the domestic wastewater treatment rates in urban and rural areas reached 98 and 92 respectively all wwtps effluents were required to further treated such as artificial wetlands or filtration to meet the latest discharge standards for the taihu lake basin db32 1072 2018 besides up to 3000 km of rivers were dredged agricultural activities and net aquaculture were strictly controlled to reduce secondary pollution and point or non point source inputs the mitigation of args pollution in the surface water of yangcheng lake was a positive feedback for aquaculture management according to the suzhou ecological environment status bulletin the proportion of surface water body sections under the provincial monitoring program that met grade ⅰ ⅲ water quality standards rose from 76 to 92 from 2018 to 2020 therefore it is not surprising that args pollution in 2020 has been weakened whether in sediments or surface water compared to 2018 higher water quality may result in lower abundance of args and change their distribution patterns wu et al 2019 in addition the shannon index of bacterial communities was the highest in 2020 implying that ecological restoration of watershed can significantly improve the quality of aquatic environments and promote increased biodiversity similarly regional functions alter the distribution patterns of args pollution cis showed the most serious args contamination compared to ris and las fig 3 previous studies have also reported that cis was the most polluted by antibiotics and heavy metals yang et al 2020 2022 indicating the presence of multiple contamination in general cis is functionally positioned as living and commercial areas it should be noted that two sites c4 and c6 located in the ancient town showed the highest diversity and abundance of args throughout the sampling period although the args pollution has been mitigated in 2020 compared to 2018 both sites still have higher pollution level in water and sediments than the other sites moreover the args composition was highly similar in both phases suggesting the potential of direct args input from water to sediments this can be explained from two aspects first the classical gardens in the ancient town of suzhou are listed as a world heritage site and are visited by tourists from all over the world here the large population generates complex and huge amounts of wastewater and the dilapidated drainage system increases the potential for direct discharge from diverse sources second the narrow and meandering rivers provides favorable conditions for the deposition of pollutants and the coexistence of multiple pollutants can induce and facilitate the propagation and spread of args dickinson et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 ris is mainly composed of canals whose functions are waterway transportation and runoff diversion although ris receives large amounts of effluents from wwtps and surface runoff from farmlands or roads the strong scouring and dilution effects caused by large quantities of runoff results in lower pollution level however it is noted that the continuous discharge of wastewater from cis leads to higher absolute abundance of args and mges downstream the strong material migration microbial movement and gene exchange resulted in similar distribution patterns of args between ris and cis fig 4a las as important aquaculture bases and drinking water sources has received significant attention with respect to its water quality normally the stagnant state of lakes is conducive to becoming sinks for pollutants fortunately the diversity and abundance of args were obviously lower in the lakes due to less anthropogenic influence and strict diffused pollution management taken together seasonal changes and human activities have significant impacts on the args distribution patterns in the watershed 4 2 arg indicators reveal wastewater and feces as the major contamination sources args pollution is a region specific phenomenon and both human activities and natural processes can impact the fate of args substantially in the watershed ma et al 2016 our results suggest that wastewater and feces are the two major contamination sources of args fig s7 to be specific cis was dominated by human and animal fecal pollution while ris was mainly polluted by wastewater dense residential communities and general hospitals surround the cis and domestic sewage from the population and domesticated animals may cause fecal pollution in the rivers due to drainage system overflows and leakages chen et al 2020 several typical fecal indicators such as bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus hu et al 2020 showed significantly higher proportions in sediments which further confirmed that cis was severely contaminated by feces previous study revealed that fecal pollution can explain the abundance of args in anthropogenically impacted environments karkman et al 2019 furthermore wwtps are considered as hotspots for args transmission into environments because conventional treatment processes cannot adequately remove args an et al 2018 yu et al 2020 not surprisingly ris exhibited a larger proportion of wastewater pollution due to its vital role in receiving effluents from wwtps as for the indicators of the natural environment these were homogeneously distributed in the watershed this suggested that in densely populated watersheds args are mainly influenced by human activities instead of natural disturbances several representative args indicators were identified for each aquatic system to help track args sources and dissemination routes the majority of args indicators were screened for cis conferring resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactamase and tetracyclines table s7 these top abundant indicators were found to be prevalent in wwtps and feces ma et al 2016 ng et al 2018 revealing their significant roles in shaping the antibiotic resistome and driving fluctuations in human impacted regions more specifically args resistant to the last resort antibiotics carbapenems blages and blaveb were identified as indicators which are supposed to be persistent in hospital effluents receiving rivers laffite et al 2020 this heightens the need for concern and mitigation actions for these high risk args another three args indicators against tetracyclines tet 32 tetm 01 and tetm 02 were also identified which are frequently observed at high abundance in aquaculture ponds and swine wastewater sui et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 suggesting possible inputs of animal feces into cis in addition one transposon tnpa 04 was identified as an indicator for ris high abundance of tnpa 04 was found in both water and sediments of the ris indicating the strong capacity of horizontal transfer of args in the fast flowing canals zhang et al 2021b based on the identified args indicators high risk sources in the dissemination of args such as hospital wastewater and human animal feces should be prioritized paving the way for mitigating the propagation of args and designing effective control strategies 4 3 potential bacterial hosts of args facilitate their dissemination bacteria transmit genetic information through mges and spread args among environmental bacteria zhu et al 2013 in this study a strong significant positive linear correlation between args and mges was observed in both sediment and water phases fig s15 suggesting the strong influence of mges on the dissemination of args through hgt in particular hgt proved to be the main mechanism for the widespread dissemination of args in aquatic environments zheng et al 2018 however more mges in water exhibited strong associations with args as visualized by the co occurrence networks fig s10 this may be related to the hydrodynamic differences between the two phases as the more turbulent structure of moving water helped to facilitate the interactions among args and mges hence mges could accelerate the dissemination of args throughout the watershed via hgt even to habitats that were in close proximity to human activities leading to higher potential public health risks at the same time bacteria can also impact the proliferation and spread of args via vertical gene transfer vgt the significant correlation between args and bacterial community was confirmed by the mantle test and procrustes analysis fig 5d in addition the bacterial community was the major driver that directly affected mges and further indirectly influenced args fig 7 thus hgt and vgt could together aid the dissemination of args in the bacteria args network of each aquatic system figs 6 and s9 the target args and dominant bacterial genera exhibited high connectivity the network was divided into several modules representing different non random co evolutionary ecological function groups zhang et al 2021a remarkably several bacterial genera served as linking nodes to the targeted args due to their strong correlations and they may be the potential hosts of args exhibiting similar environmental fate for instance dechloromonas was the possible host of aminoglycoside e g aad a1 aad a2 01 03 strb multidrug e g qacedelta1 01 02 tetracycline tetg 02 and sulfonamide sul2 resistance genes in the ris notably dechloromonas has been frequently detected in wwtps petriglieri et al 2021 therefore these args may be carried by dechloromonas during wastewater treatment and discharged in effluents and thus may warrant special attention in wwtps impacted rivers candidatus anammoximicrobium one of the main functional microorganisms for denitrification and anammox processes wang et al 2016 was identified as the hub bacteria in the cis high levels of total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen in this region may have stimulated the ecological activity of this genus furthermore limnohabitans showed the most connections with args and mges in the water phase which have a prominent role in freshwater bacterioplankton communities kasalický et al 2013 thus we speculate that limnohabitans could have acted as a major carrier for various args and mges and accelerated their spread overall network analysis provided potential host bacteria information for args while more precise relationships should be further explored since direct correlations may be biased in complex environments 4 4 key factors shaping args dynamics facilitate targeted args pollution control in natural environments multiple factors can drive selection or co selection of the antibiotic resistome and shape args dynamics chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2021b considering the fact that each aquatic system has unique pollution patterns sems were established individually to evaluate the effects of multiple factors and to identify key factors fig 7 in general bacterial communities and mges positively shaped args dynamics in the whole watershed both for sediments and surface water indicating that the propagation and spread of args were significantly related to their inherent molecular biological processes blair et al 2015 however the ranking of the standardized effects of various factors in different aquatic systems clearly varied and coincided with the catchment contamination characteristics sediment properties e g total carbon nitrogen phosphorus were the dominant factor shaping args in the ris and exhibited strong negative effects a consistent phenomenon of negative influence was noticed for cis and las previous studies have shown that nutrients can promote the growth of arg carrying bacteria su et al 2017 but rich nutrient conditions may also increase the fitness cost of args and reduce the competitiveness of resistant bacteria lin et al 2018 as reservoirs of pollutants from diverse sources sediments in the entire watershed are constantly in high nutrient states and appear to have inhibitory effects on the proliferation of args on the contrary water properties might accelerate the dissemination of args owing to suitable levels of nutrients in surface water interestingly bioavailable heavy metals positively dominated the args patterns in the cis and exhibited stronger effects than total heavy metals while negative effects were found for ris and cis generally heavy metals from pollution sources are more likely to be released in bioavailable fraction and adsorbed to sediment surfaces posing direct stresses to microorganisms sun et al 2019 cis was severely contaminated by heavy metals and highly enriched metals i e ni cu and zn were significantly correlated with almost all categories of args highlighting the strong co selection pressure of metals shaping args certain high levels of toxic metals can act as stressors to stimulate args proliferation by enhancing selective detoxification adaptation of resistant bacteria and conjugative transfer of co resistant and cross resistant plasmids klümper et al 2017 moreover bacterial communities primarily shaped arg dynamics in the las suggesting that natural factors such as microbes have a decisive influence on the fate of args in less human impacted environments moreover previous studies have suggested that antibiotics are one of the key factors to induce args however this study found no strong impacts of antibiotics on args although positive correlations between tetracycline resistance genes and corresponding antibiotics were observed demonstrating that tetracycline may directly regulate the expression of related args other antibiotics did not show such trends similar findings were reported in the yangtze estuary guo et al 2018 and kunming city huang et al 2019 many contributing factors may undermine the direct correlations between antibiotics and args and there is as yet no consensus on these correlations taken together args in the natural aquatic environments were driven by multiple factors and the mechanisms were complex although biological processes may significantly shape args dynamics chemical pollutants such as heavy metals and nutrients are exacerbating the propagation of args through induction and co selection pressure in multi polluted watersheds the occurrence of args was closely linked to the pollution patterns of different aquatic systems generally args were greatly influenced by heavy metals and nutrients in the regions with high intensity anthropogenic activities while natural factors such as microbes may dominate the fate of args in less human impacted regions therefore more attention should be paid to the control of heavy metals and nutrients to curb the spread of args overall identifying the key factors shaping args profiles lead to more targeted management of args pollution strategies including ecological restoration and dredging of rivers upgrading of wwtps processes and management of diffused pollution should be conducted to control args and future research should focus more on the life cycle of args from source to sink in the watershed 5 conclusion this study systematically revealed the dynamic distribution and driving mechanisms of args in a human intensive watershed the main conclusions are as follows args contamination exhibited significant variations in the interconnected city river lake system due to the differences in regional functions and anthropogenic activities a decreasing pollution level of city system river system lake system was observed for args antibiotics and heavy metals in particular wastewater and human animal feces were considered as the dominant pollution sources to the city system seasonal changes and watershed restoration can markedly influence the distribution patterns of args and bacterial communities more diverse args were detected in winter while higher abundances of args and mges were observed in spring and summer args pollution was strongly attenuated due to the ecological restoration and engineering management of the watershed args indicators were identified and co occurrence patterns between args and bacterial genera were visualized providing information for inferring potential sources and bacterial hosts of args high risk sources such as hospital wastewater and domestic sewage should be strictly controlled biological processes may significantly shape args dynamics via bacterial communities and mges however chemical pollutants are exacerbating the propagation of args in multi polluted watersheds the key factors shaping args dynamics in the river city and lake systems were nutrients bioavailable heavy metals and bacterial community respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15658,in this study mechanically sulfidated microscale zero valent iron s zvi was found to effectively activate the peracetic acid paa with a result of almost complete degradation of six micropollutants within 10 min under neutral conditions and 95 sulfamethoxazole smx removal after six cycles reactive oxidized species ros including ho carbon centered radicals and fe iv were generated in the s zvi paa system while ho was the main contributor towards micropollutants degradation this study clearly revealed that enhancement of the electron donating ability of zvi by the formed conductive iron sulfides was crucial for promoted fe ii generation and subsequent paa activation over several cycles rather than the ability of sulfides to reduce fe iii for fe ii regeneration as reported previously interestingly it s discovered that co existence of fe iii would dramatically improve the contaminants removal efficiency of the s zvi paa system transform the surfaced fe ii dominated ros generation process to aqueous fe ii one enhance the tolerance of the proposed system to water matrix the promoting effect of predosed fe iii on paa activation by s zvi should be mainly associated with the greater ability of fe iii than h2o to accept electron from fe0 for obtaining more active sites slower fe0 consumption and solid sulfur species release for elevated electron utilization efficiency and paa activation considering the convenient and cost effective access of fe iii the decrease of acute toxicity of treated smx excellent stability and good removal of various micropollutants fully demonstrate the superiority of s zvi paa system for practical application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid activation sulfide modified zero valent iron electron donating ability sulfamethoxazole degradation application potential data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction owing to the advantages of its high sterilization ability and the limited formation of toxic by products peracetic acid paa has been applied for wastewater disinfection in the u s canada and europe cai et al 2017 caretti and lubello 2003 kitis 2004 indeed paa was found to be more effective in controlling enteric microorganisms compared with naocl suggesting the high potential of paa to disinfect wastewater instead of naocl in the future koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 however paa failed to degrade various micropollutants due to its high selectivity hey et al 2012 sharma et al 2010 while introduction of external energy and metal metal free catalysts is able to promote its oxidation capacity with generation of abundant reactive oxidized radicals ros caretti and lubello 2003 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 rokhina et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 in previously investigated heterogeneous systems it took 120 min to degrade 90 phenol during the ultrasound assisted heterogeneous mno2 paa process rokhina et al 2010 2013 introduction of cofe2o4 obviously enhanced paa decomposition and ros generation with a sulfamethoxazole smx degradation efficiency of 90 over 30 min at neutral condition wang et al 2021b however co leaching is a threat to human health because of its toxic and carcinogenic property although 80 90 sulfonamide antibiotics can be removed after treated by mos2 paa system for 15 min stability of this system is not ideal with the efficiency of the fifth degradation decreased to 20 wang et al 2021a it s found that fes possesses the ability to effectively activate paa for pharmaceuticals degradation within several minutes yang et al 2022 but it s difficult to recycle due to the fast consumption of fes it is necessary to develop high efficiency environmental friendly and cost effective catalyst with good stability for paa activation due to its high reductive capacity the abundant source and environmental friendliness of iron and the generation of nontoxic iron oxides after the treatment zero valent iron zvi has been widely used for heavy metal adsorption refractory pollutants reduction catalyzing o2 h2o2 peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms for micro organic pollutants oxidation wang et al 2020a during aops zvi can release fe ii at a slow rate to avoid the rapid depletion of fe ii and excessive induced ros scavenging dong et al 2019 however limited solid liquid interphase reaction electron transfer blocked by iron oxides passivation layer produced during reaction and difficulty of fe ii regeneration from fe iii have become the limiting factors of zvi based aops to obtain a satisfied degradation efficiency fan et al 2017 xiong et al 2014 sulfidation of zvi s zvi realized by easily operated and cost effective ball milling has been proved as a good strategy to improve the reactivity of zvi the electron transfer can be enhanced by the homogeneously distributed iron sulfides possessing better electron conductivity than iron oxide hydrate fan et al 2016 kim et al 2011 as reported the electron utilization of s zvi is 10 50 times that of non sulfurized micro zvi fan et al 2016 previous study proposed that better iron circulation caused by sulfides plays an important role in the enhanced oxidants like pds activation guo et al 2020 while the capacity of s2 to reduce fe3 would be rapidly exhausted in theory whether s zvi has a better performance to activate oxidants than zvi over cycles has not been well investigated so far and how the sulfur species affect the zvi s reactivity over a long term operation is interesting but also limited notably complex matrix in real waters including carbonate bicarbonate phosphate and natural organic matters like humic acid ha etc would limit the efficiency of radical based aops via scavenging the active radicals chen et al 2019a for instance co3 2 hco3 can react with ho and so4 to form co3 with slower rate constants reacting with organic compounds luo et al 2015 ha would negatively affect the degradation of micropollutants attributed by their radical scavenging ability and possible occupation of the active sites luo et al 2015 shi et al 2018 cl has negative effects on uv hso5 and uv s2o8 2 processes since it can react with radicals e g ho and so4 to form less reactive chlorinated inorganic radicals luo et al 2015 in paa activated system carbon centered radicals ch3c o o ch3c o and ch3 are commonly generated while previous study demonstrated that ha 0 5 mg l had a higher scavenging capacity for carbon centered radicals than ho because ha with naphthyl structure was likely to be attacked by organic radicals chen et al 2019b moreover the strong restraints on smx removal by fes paa system were observed in the presence of 0 2 2 0 mm hco3 and h2po4 yang et al 2022 as such developing simple feasible and cost effective strategies are extremely required to attenuate or even eliminate the suppression of water matrix in contaminated water for extending the applicability of the iron based paa process in this work the performance and mechanism of s zvi for paa activation and micropollutants degradation were comprehensively studied using smx as the typical pollutant the oxidation ability of s zvi paa system under various reaction conditions was evaluated and optimized generation and roles of reactive species were analyzed via electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis and quenching experiments with scavengers the mechanism of sulfidation induced zvi performance in activating paa was carefully discussed from both experimental and computational aspects the degradation pathways of smx were proposed and the acute toxicity of the solution before and after the reaction was determined interestingly it s found that co existence of fe iii would dramatically improve the reactivity of s zvi paa system and its tolerance towards water matix considering the ubiquity of fe iii in wastewater the stability and low cost for storage and transportation of commercial ferric salts optimal utilization of fe iii would be a good strategy to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system accordingly the corresponding performance and mechanism were also explored systematically 2 materials and methods the information of the reagents and s zvi used in this study the experimental procedures and the analytical methods are detailed in texts s1 s10 and table s1 of supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluating and optimizing the performance of s zvi paa system morphology and compositions analysis of zvi and s zvi were detailed in figs s1 s5 tables s2 and s3 and text s10 demonstrating the successful modification of elemental sulfur into zvi and insignificant differences on the sizes between the zvi and s zvi with varied s fe as illustrated in fig s6 it was found that the amount of smx removed by zvi alone s zvi alone and paa alone was very small excluding the contribution of zvi s zvi adsorption effect and the oxidation of paa to removing smx as shown in fig s7 the extra addition of ch3coo and h2o2 resulted in the inhibition of smx degradation probably attributed by their quenching effects for reactive species wang et al 2020d yamauchi et al 1992 implying the dominant role of paa in contaminants degradation the degradation efficiency and k obs of smx in zvi paa and s zvi paa system within 15 min were 39 9 and 99 64 0 0361 min 1 and 0 4045 min 1 respectively fig 1 a manifesting the significantly improved activity of zvi to activate paa by sulfidation treatment residual paa was semi quantified by detecting the sulfoxide mtso product transformed from methylp tolyl sulfide mts using hplc uv as detailed in text s3 zhang and huang 2020 particularly 85 43 μm and 195 1 μm paa were consumed in zvi and s zvi systems within 15 min fig s8 respectively confirming the sulfidation enhanced paa activation otherwise liquid phase prepared s zvilp with a s fe of 0 05 was also applied to activate paa but resulting in an obvious lower kobs and incomplete smx removal fig 1a suggesting the better performance of ball milling the smx degradation efficiency in the s zvi based pms pds paa and h2o2 systems was compared within an observation period of 15 min followed the order paa 99 64 pms 98 33 pds 35 43 h2o2 8 36 and k obs of the four systems were 0 4045 min 1 0 3938 min 1 0 0281 min 1 0 0045 min 1 respectively obviously stating the superiority of paa as an oxidant of aops activated by s zvi at the same time the degradation of different micropollutants by s zvi paa system was investigated as shown in fig 1b abatement of 98 5 diclofenac sodium dcf 99 2 ibuprofen ibp 99 8 carbamazepine cbz 97 5 naproxen nap and 97 4 levofloxacin lvf by the s zvi paa process was observed over the reaction of 15 min respectively confirming the applicability of the proposed system in treating various micropollutants moreover both smx and cbz can be simultaneously and efficiently removed within 15 min fig s9 suggesting the good application potential of s zvi paa system for effective treat wastewater containing various pollutants as can be seen from fig 1c although the degradation rate of smx by s zvi paa system with three different s fe ratios can reach more than 99 within 35 min the kobs exhibited a tendency decreasing from 0 4703 min 1 to 0 2481 min 1 when the s fe molar ratio increased from 0 05 to 0 20 it can be inferred that the degradation efficiency of smx within 15 min at s fe ratio of 0 025 was similar to that at 0 05 however by comparing k obs increased from 0 3771 min 1 to 0 4045 min 1 it can be concluded that s fe ratio of 0 05 exhibited the best performance to activate paa fig 1c as shown in fig 1d s zvi paa exhibited the strongest ability to remove smx and the reaction can reach equilibrium in about 5 min at initial ph of 3 0 when the initial ph was ranged in the neutral values 5 7 9 the degradation rate of smx was slightly slower however smx degradation was strongly inhibited in alkaline conditions ph 11 the variations of solution ph over time were also monitored with results presented in fig s10 particularly lower ph is beneficial for zvi corrosion and fe ii release with a result of stronger ability to activate paa and oxidize smx the k obs of smx removal increased with the enhanced s zvi dosage and paa concentration fig 1e mainly attributed by the accelerated decomposition of paa to generate more free radicals compared with the previously reported heterogeneous paa activation systems summarized in tables s4 and s5 such as mos2 mno2 and cofe2o4 rokhina et al 2013 wang et al 2021a 2021b smx degradation efficiency can achieve nearly 100 in s zvi paa system in a shorter reaction time with the similar paa dosage indicating that s zvi possessed better catalytic ability in paa activation from the perspective of economic applicability 100 mg l 1 s zvi and 0 2 mm paa are chosen for the following experiments for the consideration of both removal performance and economy stability and reusability are important factors in evaluating the feasibility of proposed system for practical application the cycle experiments of both s zvi paa s fe 0 05 and zvi paa were carried out for six consecutive cycles and the results were shown in fig 1f in zvi paa system the removal efficiency of smx in 30 min was stable and basically remained at about 78 which cannot completely degrade the target contaminant smx however in s zvi paa system the removal efficiency of smx could still achieve 95 after six cycles although there s slight decrease in comparison with the removal efficiency of first cycle 99 64 due to the precipitation of iron oxides passivation layer like fe2o3 fe3o4 feooh and the loss of sulfur species on the zvi surface during the reaction furthermore the removal of smx in fe ii paa system was conducted as illustrated in fig s11 smx removal efficiency was enhanced with the increase of fe ii concentration while smx can be completely degraded only when the dosage of fe ⅱ exceeded 25 mg l in comparison satisfied smx degradation can be achieved after seven cycles when using 0 1 g l s zvi while about 0 175 g l fe2 namely 0 879 g l feso4 7h2o will be required for reaching a comparative smx removal efficiency in theory moreover since the price of zvi aladdin china and feso4 7h2o aladdin china was 35 and 34 yuan per 500 g respectively a much higher amounts of feso4 7h2o 0 879 g l than s zvi 0 1 g l demonstrated the low cost and high efficiency characters of s zvi in conclusion the above results confirmed that s zvi is a highly stable and promising catalyst for paa activation and further smx degradation 3 2 reactive oxidized species generated in s zvi paa systems in order to clarify the contribution of ros to pollutants degradation in s zvi paa system the effects of methanol and tert butyl alcohol tba on the removal efficiency of smx were investigated since methanol is a commonly used scavenger for reactive radicals including ho and r o wang et al 2020d while tba can only scavenge ho anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 as shown in fig 2 a the degradation of smx was strongly inhibited in the presence of 100 mm tba while the addition of methanol showed slightly stronger inhibition ability this phenomenon was also occurred in zvi paa system fig 2a which implied that ho rather than r o played an important role in the both zvi paa and s zvi paa systems the conversion ratio of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 in each system was lower than 10 fig 2b which implies that the amount of fe iv generated in s zvi paa system was very small and its contribution was limited pang et al 2011 in the presence of 10 mm furfuryl alcohol ffa the scavenger for 1o2 k2 1 2 108 m 1s 1 the removal efficiency of smx basically remained unchanged indicating negligible influence of 1o2 in s zvi paa system fig 2a moreover quenching and probe experiments were also conducted in s zvi paa systems with different s fe and the results as shown in figs s12 and s13 further confirmed that hydroxyl radical was the dominant radical responsible for smx ibp and cbz degradation in s zvi paa system to determine whether r o was produced in s zvi paa system nap was selected as a target contaminant since carbon centered radicals probably might play a significant role in nap degradation as reported previously cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019b the degradation of nap was partially inhibited by tba but restrained by methanol to a greater extent fig s13d indicating the possible existence of r o in the s zvi paa system it is calculated that ho and r o contributed to 73 16 and 16 25 in nap degradation in s zvi paa system according to eqs 2 4 respectively to further prove the existence of r o in s zvi paa system 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo a stable nitroxide radical was used as a radical probe to identify ch3c o o barton et al 1998 as depicted in figs s14 s15 both ch3c o o tempo and ch3 tempo were successfully detected which was convincible evidence for ch3c o o generation these results indicated that hydroxyl radical was the main radical produced in the s zvi paa system while r o and fe iv was also generated but with a small amount this phenomenon has also been discovered in the fes paa system and was explained by the fast consumption of r o by sulfur species yang et al 2022 2 k s z v i p a a k h o k r o 3 k h o k s z v i p a a k s z v i p a a t b a 4 k r o k s z v i p a a t b a k s z v i p a a m e t h epr experiments were conducted by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the ho trapping agent to explore the yield of ho in zvi paa and s zvi paa systems as depicted in fig 2c the intensity of dmpo ho spin adducts characteristic peaks observed in the s zvi paa system was about five times stronger than that detected in zvi paa system suggesting that sulfidation of zvi could significantly enhance the yield of ho furthermore epr experiments of different s fe and paa systems were also conducted and the results illustrated in fig 2c revealed the signal peak of dmpo ho spin adducts following the order 0 05 0 1 0 20 which is consistent with the degradation effect of different s fe ratio this results were also confirmed by the semi quantitative analysis results fig 2d via measuring the characteristic products of 2 hydroxyl terephthalic acid htpa from the reaction between terephthalic acid tpa and ho zhou et al 2020 3 3 products evaluation and toxicity assays the transformation products tps of smx by s zvi paa system were measured by uplc qtof ms ms seven tps tp 99 tp 156 tp 255 tp 270 tp 348 tp364 tp 519 were observed and shown in figs s16 s21 the structures of smx and its transformation products were presented in table s6 the possible degradation pathways of smx were proposed in fig s22 based on the above tps it is speculated that there are four degradation pathways for smx in pathway i tp 99 and tp 156 can be produced by non selective hydroxyl radical through n s bond breaking yan et al 2021 as for tp 255 it was formed by the substitution of the amino group on the benzene ring and methyl group on the 5 methylisoxazole via hydroxyl du et al 2018 tp 270 was produced through hydroxylation reaction occurring on the aniline ring indicating that ho played a significant role in smx degradation pathway iii furthermore n centered radical can be generated through the reaction between ho and nh2 group yan et al 2019 tp 348 tp 364 and tp 519 were produced via coupling reaction that took place between n centered radicals pathway iv notably the detected transformation products also supporting the above conclusion that ho was the fundamental radical responsible for smx degradation to further assess toxicity changes during treatment of smx in the s zvi paa system bioluminescent inhibition of photobacterium phosphoreum was tested at initial smx dosage of 10 mm as depicted in fig s23a there was almost no change in l l0 during the reaction process implying that no more toxic transformation products were generated during the treatment of s zvi paa process e coli growth experiments were further used to compare microbial growth before and after degradation of smx by s zvi paa systems as seen from fig s23b the treatment of s zvi paa system had no negative effect on the toxicity of smx according to the insignificant differences of the growth of e coli among the control smx and degradation products groups compared with other aops the activated paa process will be more suitable to be associated with the biological treatment 3 4 mechanism of sulfidation in enhancing zvi s ability to activate paa above results indicated that s zvi possessed a better performance in activating paa for smx removal over 7 cycles fig 1f results in fig s24 disclosed that s powder and na2s had no ability for activation of paa to degrade smx according to previous reports fe ii is a good activator and can effectively activate paa to degrade pollutants kim et al 2019 which was verified by the further accelerated smx removal after extra addition of fe ii into the s zvi paa system fig s25 as can be seen from table s2 the relative proportion of surface fe ii in fe 2p spectra increased from 38 19 to 55 67 after reacting with paa while the proportion of surface fe iii decreased from 58 7 to 30 72 suggesting that fe ii was released continuously during the reaction process and probably reduced from fe iii by a hidden way guo et al 2020 it can be seen from fig 3 a that s zvi with different s fe ratios all generated a certain greater amount of fe ii during the reaction process the yield of total fe ii in s zvi s fe 0 05 paa system was almost three times of zvi paa system the increased fe ii release might arise from two aspects enhanced electron transfer from inner fe0 due to the formation of conductive iron sulfides and better iron circulation caused by the reductive ability of sulfides it is well known that zvi is easy to be surrounded by a layer of iron oxide during the reaction and the structurally dense oxide shell would block both mass transfer and electron transfer li et al 2021 ling and zhang 2015 however iron sulfides especially fes are famous metal conductors due to the existence of delocalized electrons in their layers kim et al 2011 therefore the deposition of iron sulfides on the iron surface is conducive to the conduction of electrons from the iron core to the iron surface thus improve the activity of zvi and promote the release of iron ions tafel curve fig 3b indicated that s zvi had a higher corrosion current and a lower corrosion potential than zvi fig 3c exhibited the nyquist diagram of s zvi and zvi with a result of a smaller radius appeared in s zvi the above electrochemical analysis showed that s zvi had a better electron transfer ability than zvi which is beneficial for electron transfer and iron release s zvi with a s fe ratio of 0 05 exhibited the best electron transfer performance in comparison with the other two kinds of s zvi moreover a greater decrease of the fe charasteritic peak intensity over cycles fig 3d and the obvious surface cracking of s zvi fig s2 but insignificant change of zvi after reacting with paa for 15 min further confirmed that sulfidation could enhance the corrosion ability of zvi it is reported that the sulfide layer on the surface of s zvi can reduce fe iii to fe ii fan et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2015 particularly the amount of s species added during the synthesis of s zvi was calculated as 0 09 mm however the energy dispersive spectrometer eds results fig 4 a disclosed that the sulfur species on the zvi surface was not completely consumed but decreased from 8 31 to 3 9 1 49 and 1 47 after reaction for 1 3 and 5 cycles more interestingly xps analysis revealed that although the s2 contents decreased after paa activation the proportions of total conductive iron sulfides including s2 and s2 2 changed to a limited extent after reactions figs 4b and s25 these results implied that not all the sulfides but perhaps the dissolved sulfides released due to zvi corrosion participated in fe3 reduction moreover about 0 05 mm the loss of sulfur species in the first cycle theoretically and 0 02 mm the loss of sulfur species from the 1st to 3rd cycle theoretically s2 were separately added into fe iii solution with fast generation of 4 2 0 19 and 2 2 0 02 mg l fe ii fig s27 this suggests the partial contribution of improved iron circulation by sulfides which would partially contribute to the promoted paa activation in the first cycle fig s11 while which is not convinced from the 1st to 3rd cycle based on the regeneration of small amounts of fe ii fig s27 moreover the limited decrease of surfaced sulfur species but with smx removal kobs 2 4 times higher than that of zvi paa system further confirmed that the enhanced paa activation was not mainly associated with the regenerated fe ii via sulfides it can be speculated that improved iron circulation caused by sulfides is not crucial for the good recycle stability of s zvi in activating paa the above results indicated that the increased paa activation and smx removal mainly resulted from the enhancement of electron donating and transferring ability rather than the ability of sulfides to reduce fe iii in a long term operation wang et al 2020b 2020c this is absolutely different from fes paa system in which s2 and its conversion product h2s aq played a significant role in fe ii regeneration with a result of accelerated paa activation yang et al 2022 furthermore density functional theory dft calculations were performed to provide deep insights into performance change before and after the sulfidation step from a microscopic perspective zvi was constructed via a 3 3 4 supercell composed of fe 100 planes coupling a modified hydroxylated iron oxide icsd 1544 surface layer where vacuum layer was 20 å in the z axis direction li et al 2020 according to the report of ferré et al the sulfidated micronscale zero valent iron model could be realized by different s coverages on the surface curulla ferre et al 2006 as shown in fig s28 the corresponding s fe ratio are 0 0 025 0 05 0 1 and 0 20 respectively when the s coverage is 0 1 9 1 3 5 9 and 9 9 furthermore work function was calculated as a descriptor to evaluate the effect of sulfidation on the electron donating ability of mzvi hölzl j 1979 the results displayed that the value of the work function has a decrease after sulfidation regardless of the s fe ratio which indicates that sulfidation can enhance the electron donating ability of zvi fig 5 a however the work function value increases again when s fe ratio was greater than 0 05 demonstrating that the introduction of excessive sulfur species would hinder the further output of electrons these computational results verified the electrochemical analysis data that sulfidation will improve the electron transfer capacity moreover the linear correlation between the work function and kobs of smx removal was analyzed interestingly there was a negative linear correlation between these two values as indicated by a r2 of 0 96 fig 5b indicating that the increased smx removal mainly resulted from the enhancement of electron donating and transferring ability rather wang et al 2020b 2020c 3 5 strategy to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system 3 5 1 effect of water matrix anions such as chloride bicarbonate dihydrogen phosphate and natural organic compounds are widely existed in water environment the presence of these water constituents could impact compound degradation via scavenging the reactive radicals and or forming complexes with iron cations chen et al 2019b as shown in fig s29a the reaction was only slightly inhibited by adding chloride ions varying from 0 2 to 2 0 mm it was reported that cl can scavenge ho and r o which may play a major role in the s zvi paa system chen et al 2019b fu et al 2015 in addition the formation of cl complex reaction with ferrous and ferric ions on the s zvi surface may reduce the activation ability of s zvi thus reducing the degradation effect of smx fu et al 2017 as common active radical scavengers xie et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the influences of hco3 and h2po4 were investigated in s zvi paa process and results are presented in figs s29b and s29c as the concentration of bicarbonate and phosphate increased the reaction was strongly inhibited for instance the kobs of the reaction decreased from 0 4045 min 1 to 0 0208 min 1 when the concentration of bicarbonate was 0 5 mm this might be explained from the following two aspects 1 both hco3 and h2po4 are capable of scavenging hydroxyl radical which was the main free radical in s zvi paa system xie et al 2015 yang et al 2016 2 addition of hco3 and h2po4 lead to the formation of unreactive fe ii complexes thus blocking the catalysts center wang et al 2020d as shown in fig s29d ha significantly suppressed the degradation efficiency of smx this phenomenon has been frequently discovered in previous study of aops guan et al 2013 including pms and h2o2 activation systems and the ability of ha to quench ho has been proposed as the main factor in addition according to previous reports the decomposition of paa is hindered with the presence of ha which may attribute to the blockage of the catalyst center by ha complex wang et al 2020d meanwhile the effects of water matrix on the performance of s zvi paa and zvi paa system were compared and results demonstrated the significantly poorer resistance of zvi paa system to low concentration of water matrix fig s30 suggesting the better practical application potential of s zvi paa process notably the removal efficiency of smx in tap water and lake water fig s31 by s zvi paa system could still reach 99 and 78 within 15 mins but at a slower removal rate suggesting the requirement of strategy to further promote the applicability of s zvi paa system 3 5 2 strategy to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system during exploring the mechanism of sulfidation in enhancing the activity of zvi for paa activation it s unexpectedly found that the addition of fe iii would obviously accelerate the paa activation fig s8 considering the ubiquity of fe iii in wastewater the stability and low cost for storage and transportation of commercial ferric salts optimal utilization of fe iii would be a good strategy to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system accordingly the corresponding performance and mechanism were explored systematically as shown in fig s32 the addition of fe iii significantly accelerated the degradation of smx and boosted the yield of fe ii it s disclosed that the amount of fe ii produced by s zvi reduction with different s fe ratios followed the order 0 05 0 025 0 1 0 20 zvi which was positively correlated with their ability to activate paa for smx degradation at the same time the control experiment of fe iii paa was carried out and it was found that the degradation of smx was negligible fig s32 the superior performance of fe iii s zvi paa system maintained over 7 cycles as indicated by 100 smx removal and kobs being 2 5 and 4 5 times that of s zvi paa and zvi paa process at the 7th cycle respectively fig 6 a in the co existence of 2 mm cl about 0 2 3 14 times of kobs improvement can be achieved after adding various concentrations of fe iii dosing 25 and 50 mg l fe iii could raise the smx removal in hco3 system efficiency from 55 2 to about 100 with 8 5 and 23 times promotion of kobs in the phosphate system the smx removal efficiency can be elevated from 88 1 to above 99 5 when 25 and 50 mg l fe iii were added similarly the kobs could dosage dependently increase from 0 19 min 1 to 1 32 min 1 with the addition of 5 to 50 mg l fe iii more importantly the addition of fe iii was still effective for boosting smx removal in tap water and lake water as illustrated in fig 6c adding a typical concentration 25 mg l of fe iii finally resulted in 100 smx degradation within 15 min and 3 7 times increase of kobs in the lake system the above results manifested the feasibility of utilizing fe iii to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system 3 5 3 role of fe iii in boosting micropollutant removal it should be noted that the introduction of fe iii would cause coagulation effects while the almost unchangeable smx concentration after its addition into 50 mg l fe iii for 15 min at initial ph of 7 0 and 4 0 suggested the limited role of flocculation for smx removal fig s33 in order to explore the smx removal mechanism after addition of fe iii quenching experiments were conducted with results illustrated in fig 6b it can be seen that addition of 100 mm tba can inhibit 68 0 smx removal while 100 mm methanol displayed a stronger suppression 83 suggesting the dominant role of ho and limited contribution of other active species for smx degradation this demonstrated that oxidation by ros is the mechanism for smx removal and dosing fe iii didn t change the dominated ros since the ph of fe iii solution is acidic the influence of ph variation induced by the introduction of ph should be considered but was excluded by the ph monitoring results in fig s34 because the released fe ii is the main active site for paa activation the concentrations of both surface and aqueous fe ii were detected as presented in fig 7 a the presence of fe iii induced a dosage dependent increase in fe ii generation over the whole process which might contribute to the higher yield of ros moreover the semi quantity analysis results of ho via detecting the 7 hoc transformed from the coumarin verified the dosage dependent enhancement of ho generation after the introduction of fe iii fig 7b it s interesting to notice that the addition of fe iii changed the proportion of surface and aqueous fe ii fig 7a in the absence of fe iii the proportion of surface fe ii decreased from 99 6 to 48 0 over 15 min however in the presence of 5 25 and 50 mg l fe iii the contents of surface fe ii reduced from 78 7 to 44 4 from 54 2 to 4 7 from 41 8 to 7 9 respectively after the reaction of 1 min and 15 min respectively which were totally lower than the control systems because 2 2 bipyridyl bpy can chelate fe ii to hinder electron transfer to the oxidants on the surface of particles but cannot quench oh directly fang et al 2013 bpy was added to test the activation of paa by surface fe ii as expected the degradation efficiency of smx in the two systems separately decreased from 99 6 0 34 to 44 1 3 31 from 100 to 74 7 1 07 after the introduction of 0 5 mm bpy fig 6b suggesting 55 7 and 25 3 contribution of surface fe ii to ros generation in the s zvi paa and fe iii s zvi paa system respectively in theory a higher fe ii production after adding fe iii would cause the fast consumption of fe0 however xrd results illustrated in fig 8 a surprisingly disclosed a much slower fe corrosion rate as indicated by a higher peak intensity than that of s zvi paa system after reaction for 1 3 and 5 cycles fig 3d particularly aqueous fe iii is easier to accept the electron from fe0 than h2o with results of higher fe ii yield and slower zvi corrosion furthermore previous study revealed that predosed iron ions would work as the primary corrosion product of fe0 and to slow the oxidation of fe contained in s zvi by o2 h fan et al 2019 surprisingly eds analysis of s zvi particles in the presence of fe iii after several cycles disclosed that the sulfur species contents decreased from 8 31 to 7 22 6 22 and 4 55 after reaction for 1 3 and 5 cycles respectively suggesting a much slower decrease rate of sulfur species than the absence of fe iii fig 8b as such the introduction of fe iii would avoid the fast consumption of s zvi and release of solid state sulfur species into reaction solution resulting in a better electron transfer ability than the system without addition of fe iii this also confirmed the above conclusion that improvement of electron transfer and donating ability of zvi but not the reduction ability of sulfides plays a crucial role in the sulfidation enhanced paa activation for efficient decontamination 4 conclusion this study found that mechanically obtained s zvi is capable of activating paa at a higher rate with a better micropollutant removal efficiency over 7 cycles in comparison with zvi further analysis revealed that hydroxyl radical was the main radical produced in the s zvi paa system and responsible for micropollutants removal while r o was also generated but with a small amount interestingly via eds and xps analysis it s surprisingly discovered that the surfaced sulfur was not completely consumed initially but decreased gradually over cycles and with the relative proportions of sulfides changed slightly limited fe ii would be regenerated from the reaction between fe iii and sulfides resulting in the small contribution of sulfide induced iron circulation towards enhanced paa activation during long term operation which is different from fes paa system as reported previously further experimental and theory calculation results manifested the dominant role of enhanced electron transfer from inner fe0 due to the formation of conductive iron sulfides in boosting paa activation moreover taking advantage of the combined effect of sulfidation and fe iii dosing this work proposed a new strategy to greatly enhance both the reactivity and capacity of zvi toward oxidants activation the introduction of fe iii would avoid the fast consumption of s zvi and release of solid phase sulfur species from zvi promoting the recycle stability of the proposed s zvi paa system for efficient decontamination of actual wastewater considering the ubiquity of fe iii in wastewater the stability and low cost for storage and transportation of commercial ferric salts this method of enhancing zvi for paa activation is simple efficiency and cost effective which benefits the practical application of paa based technology for wastewater treatment this study also suggests that when evaluating the impacts of water matrix on aops the effect of co existed metal cations should be comprehensively taken into account declaration of competing

15658,in this study mechanically sulfidated microscale zero valent iron s zvi was found to effectively activate the peracetic acid paa with a result of almost complete degradation of six micropollutants within 10 min under neutral conditions and 95 sulfamethoxazole smx removal after six cycles reactive oxidized species ros including ho carbon centered radicals and fe iv were generated in the s zvi paa system while ho was the main contributor towards micropollutants degradation this study clearly revealed that enhancement of the electron donating ability of zvi by the formed conductive iron sulfides was crucial for promoted fe ii generation and subsequent paa activation over several cycles rather than the ability of sulfides to reduce fe iii for fe ii regeneration as reported previously interestingly it s discovered that co existence of fe iii would dramatically improve the contaminants removal efficiency of the s zvi paa system transform the surfaced fe ii dominated ros generation process to aqueous fe ii one enhance the tolerance of the proposed system to water matrix the promoting effect of predosed fe iii on paa activation by s zvi should be mainly associated with the greater ability of fe iii than h2o to accept electron from fe0 for obtaining more active sites slower fe0 consumption and solid sulfur species release for elevated electron utilization efficiency and paa activation considering the convenient and cost effective access of fe iii the decrease of acute toxicity of treated smx excellent stability and good removal of various micropollutants fully demonstrate the superiority of s zvi paa system for practical application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid activation sulfide modified zero valent iron electron donating ability sulfamethoxazole degradation application potential data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction owing to the advantages of its high sterilization ability and the limited formation of toxic by products peracetic acid paa has been applied for wastewater disinfection in the u s canada and europe cai et al 2017 caretti and lubello 2003 kitis 2004 indeed paa was found to be more effective in controlling enteric microorganisms compared with naocl suggesting the high potential of paa to disinfect wastewater instead of naocl in the future koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 however paa failed to degrade various micropollutants due to its high selectivity hey et al 2012 sharma et al 2010 while introduction of external energy and metal metal free catalysts is able to promote its oxidation capacity with generation of abundant reactive oxidized radicals ros caretti and lubello 2003 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 rokhina et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 in previously investigated heterogeneous systems it took 120 min to degrade 90 phenol during the ultrasound assisted heterogeneous mno2 paa process rokhina et al 2010 2013 introduction of cofe2o4 obviously enhanced paa decomposition and ros generation with a sulfamethoxazole smx degradation efficiency of 90 over 30 min at neutral condition wang et al 2021b however co leaching is a threat to human health because of its toxic and carcinogenic property although 80 90 sulfonamide antibiotics can be removed after treated by mos2 paa system for 15 min stability of this system is not ideal with the efficiency of the fifth degradation decreased to 20 wang et al 2021a it s found that fes possesses the ability to effectively activate paa for pharmaceuticals degradation within several minutes yang et al 2022 but it s difficult to recycle due to the fast consumption of fes it is necessary to develop high efficiency environmental friendly and cost effective catalyst with good stability for paa activation due to its high reductive capacity the abundant source and environmental friendliness of iron and the generation of nontoxic iron oxides after the treatment zero valent iron zvi has been widely used for heavy metal adsorption refractory pollutants reduction catalyzing o2 h2o2 peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms for micro organic pollutants oxidation wang et al 2020a during aops zvi can release fe ii at a slow rate to avoid the rapid depletion of fe ii and excessive induced ros scavenging dong et al 2019 however limited solid liquid interphase reaction electron transfer blocked by iron oxides passivation layer produced during reaction and difficulty of fe ii regeneration from fe iii have become the limiting factors of zvi based aops to obtain a satisfied degradation efficiency fan et al 2017 xiong et al 2014 sulfidation of zvi s zvi realized by easily operated and cost effective ball milling has been proved as a good strategy to improve the reactivity of zvi the electron transfer can be enhanced by the homogeneously distributed iron sulfides possessing better electron conductivity than iron oxide hydrate fan et al 2016 kim et al 2011 as reported the electron utilization of s zvi is 10 50 times that of non sulfurized micro zvi fan et al 2016 previous study proposed that better iron circulation caused by sulfides plays an important role in the enhanced oxidants like pds activation guo et al 2020 while the capacity of s2 to reduce fe3 would be rapidly exhausted in theory whether s zvi has a better performance to activate oxidants than zvi over cycles has not been well investigated so far and how the sulfur species affect the zvi s reactivity over a long term operation is interesting but also limited notably complex matrix in real waters including carbonate bicarbonate phosphate and natural organic matters like humic acid ha etc would limit the efficiency of radical based aops via scavenging the active radicals chen et al 2019a for instance co3 2 hco3 can react with ho and so4 to form co3 with slower rate constants reacting with organic compounds luo et al 2015 ha would negatively affect the degradation of micropollutants attributed by their radical scavenging ability and possible occupation of the active sites luo et al 2015 shi et al 2018 cl has negative effects on uv hso5 and uv s2o8 2 processes since it can react with radicals e g ho and so4 to form less reactive chlorinated inorganic radicals luo et al 2015 in paa activated system carbon centered radicals ch3c o o ch3c o and ch3 are commonly generated while previous study demonstrated that ha 0 5 mg l had a higher scavenging capacity for carbon centered radicals than ho because ha with naphthyl structure was likely to be attacked by organic radicals chen et al 2019b moreover the strong restraints on smx removal by fes paa system were observed in the presence of 0 2 2 0 mm hco3 and h2po4 yang et al 2022 as such developing simple feasible and cost effective strategies are extremely required to attenuate or even eliminate the suppression of water matrix in contaminated water for extending the applicability of the iron based paa process in this work the performance and mechanism of s zvi for paa activation and micropollutants degradation were comprehensively studied using smx as the typical pollutant the oxidation ability of s zvi paa system under various reaction conditions was evaluated and optimized generation and roles of reactive species were analyzed via electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis and quenching experiments with scavengers the mechanism of sulfidation induced zvi performance in activating paa was carefully discussed from both experimental and computational aspects the degradation pathways of smx were proposed and the acute toxicity of the solution before and after the reaction was determined interestingly it s found that co existence of fe iii would dramatically improve the reactivity of s zvi paa system and its tolerance towards water matix considering the ubiquity of fe iii in wastewater the stability and low cost for storage and transportation of commercial ferric salts optimal utilization of fe iii would be a good strategy to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system accordingly the corresponding performance and mechanism were also explored systematically 2 materials and methods the information of the reagents and s zvi used in this study the experimental procedures and the analytical methods are detailed in texts s1 s10 and table s1 of supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluating and optimizing the performance of s zvi paa system morphology and compositions analysis of zvi and s zvi were detailed in figs s1 s5 tables s2 and s3 and text s10 demonstrating the successful modification of elemental sulfur into zvi and insignificant differences on the sizes between the zvi and s zvi with varied s fe as illustrated in fig s6 it was found that the amount of smx removed by zvi alone s zvi alone and paa alone was very small excluding the contribution of zvi s zvi adsorption effect and the oxidation of paa to removing smx as shown in fig s7 the extra addition of ch3coo and h2o2 resulted in the inhibition of smx degradation probably attributed by their quenching effects for reactive species wang et al 2020d yamauchi et al 1992 implying the dominant role of paa in contaminants degradation the degradation efficiency and k obs of smx in zvi paa and s zvi paa system within 15 min were 39 9 and 99 64 0 0361 min 1 and 0 4045 min 1 respectively fig 1 a manifesting the significantly improved activity of zvi to activate paa by sulfidation treatment residual paa was semi quantified by detecting the sulfoxide mtso product transformed from methylp tolyl sulfide mts using hplc uv as detailed in text s3 zhang and huang 2020 particularly 85 43 μm and 195 1 μm paa were consumed in zvi and s zvi systems within 15 min fig s8 respectively confirming the sulfidation enhanced paa activation otherwise liquid phase prepared s zvilp with a s fe of 0 05 was also applied to activate paa but resulting in an obvious lower kobs and incomplete smx removal fig 1a suggesting the better performance of ball milling the smx degradation efficiency in the s zvi based pms pds paa and h2o2 systems was compared within an observation period of 15 min followed the order paa 99 64 pms 98 33 pds 35 43 h2o2 8 36 and k obs of the four systems were 0 4045 min 1 0 3938 min 1 0 0281 min 1 0 0045 min 1 respectively obviously stating the superiority of paa as an oxidant of aops activated by s zvi at the same time the degradation of different micropollutants by s zvi paa system was investigated as shown in fig 1b abatement of 98 5 diclofenac sodium dcf 99 2 ibuprofen ibp 99 8 carbamazepine cbz 97 5 naproxen nap and 97 4 levofloxacin lvf by the s zvi paa process was observed over the reaction of 15 min respectively confirming the applicability of the proposed system in treating various micropollutants moreover both smx and cbz can be simultaneously and efficiently removed within 15 min fig s9 suggesting the good application potential of s zvi paa system for effective treat wastewater containing various pollutants as can be seen from fig 1c although the degradation rate of smx by s zvi paa system with three different s fe ratios can reach more than 99 within 35 min the kobs exhibited a tendency decreasing from 0 4703 min 1 to 0 2481 min 1 when the s fe molar ratio increased from 0 05 to 0 20 it can be inferred that the degradation efficiency of smx within 15 min at s fe ratio of 0 025 was similar to that at 0 05 however by comparing k obs increased from 0 3771 min 1 to 0 4045 min 1 it can be concluded that s fe ratio of 0 05 exhibited the best performance to activate paa fig 1c as shown in fig 1d s zvi paa exhibited the strongest ability to remove smx and the reaction can reach equilibrium in about 5 min at initial ph of 3 0 when the initial ph was ranged in the neutral values 5 7 9 the degradation rate of smx was slightly slower however smx degradation was strongly inhibited in alkaline conditions ph 11 the variations of solution ph over time were also monitored with results presented in fig s10 particularly lower ph is beneficial for zvi corrosion and fe ii release with a result of stronger ability to activate paa and oxidize smx the k obs of smx removal increased with the enhanced s zvi dosage and paa concentration fig 1e mainly attributed by the accelerated decomposition of paa to generate more free radicals compared with the previously reported heterogeneous paa activation systems summarized in tables s4 and s5 such as mos2 mno2 and cofe2o4 rokhina et al 2013 wang et al 2021a 2021b smx degradation efficiency can achieve nearly 100 in s zvi paa system in a shorter reaction time with the similar paa dosage indicating that s zvi possessed better catalytic ability in paa activation from the perspective of economic applicability 100 mg l 1 s zvi and 0 2 mm paa are chosen for the following experiments for the consideration of both removal performance and economy stability and reusability are important factors in evaluating the feasibility of proposed system for practical application the cycle experiments of both s zvi paa s fe 0 05 and zvi paa were carried out for six consecutive cycles and the results were shown in fig 1f in zvi paa system the removal efficiency of smx in 30 min was stable and basically remained at about 78 which cannot completely degrade the target contaminant smx however in s zvi paa system the removal efficiency of smx could still achieve 95 after six cycles although there s slight decrease in comparison with the removal efficiency of first cycle 99 64 due to the precipitation of iron oxides passivation layer like fe2o3 fe3o4 feooh and the loss of sulfur species on the zvi surface during the reaction furthermore the removal of smx in fe ii paa system was conducted as illustrated in fig s11 smx removal efficiency was enhanced with the increase of fe ii concentration while smx can be completely degraded only when the dosage of fe ⅱ exceeded 25 mg l in comparison satisfied smx degradation can be achieved after seven cycles when using 0 1 g l s zvi while about 0 175 g l fe2 namely 0 879 g l feso4 7h2o will be required for reaching a comparative smx removal efficiency in theory moreover since the price of zvi aladdin china and feso4 7h2o aladdin china was 35 and 34 yuan per 500 g respectively a much higher amounts of feso4 7h2o 0 879 g l than s zvi 0 1 g l demonstrated the low cost and high efficiency characters of s zvi in conclusion the above results confirmed that s zvi is a highly stable and promising catalyst for paa activation and further smx degradation 3 2 reactive oxidized species generated in s zvi paa systems in order to clarify the contribution of ros to pollutants degradation in s zvi paa system the effects of methanol and tert butyl alcohol tba on the removal efficiency of smx were investigated since methanol is a commonly used scavenger for reactive radicals including ho and r o wang et al 2020d while tba can only scavenge ho anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 as shown in fig 2 a the degradation of smx was strongly inhibited in the presence of 100 mm tba while the addition of methanol showed slightly stronger inhibition ability this phenomenon was also occurred in zvi paa system fig 2a which implied that ho rather than r o played an important role in the both zvi paa and s zvi paa systems the conversion ratio of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 in each system was lower than 10 fig 2b which implies that the amount of fe iv generated in s zvi paa system was very small and its contribution was limited pang et al 2011 in the presence of 10 mm furfuryl alcohol ffa the scavenger for 1o2 k2 1 2 108 m 1s 1 the removal efficiency of smx basically remained unchanged indicating negligible influence of 1o2 in s zvi paa system fig 2a moreover quenching and probe experiments were also conducted in s zvi paa systems with different s fe and the results as shown in figs s12 and s13 further confirmed that hydroxyl radical was the dominant radical responsible for smx ibp and cbz degradation in s zvi paa system to determine whether r o was produced in s zvi paa system nap was selected as a target contaminant since carbon centered radicals probably might play a significant role in nap degradation as reported previously cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019b the degradation of nap was partially inhibited by tba but restrained by methanol to a greater extent fig s13d indicating the possible existence of r o in the s zvi paa system it is calculated that ho and r o contributed to 73 16 and 16 25 in nap degradation in s zvi paa system according to eqs 2 4 respectively to further prove the existence of r o in s zvi paa system 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo a stable nitroxide radical was used as a radical probe to identify ch3c o o barton et al 1998 as depicted in figs s14 s15 both ch3c o o tempo and ch3 tempo were successfully detected which was convincible evidence for ch3c o o generation these results indicated that hydroxyl radical was the main radical produced in the s zvi paa system while r o and fe iv was also generated but with a small amount this phenomenon has also been discovered in the fes paa system and was explained by the fast consumption of r o by sulfur species yang et al 2022 2 k s z v i p a a k h o k r o 3 k h o k s z v i p a a k s z v i p a a t b a 4 k r o k s z v i p a a t b a k s z v i p a a m e t h epr experiments were conducted by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the ho trapping agent to explore the yield of ho in zvi paa and s zvi paa systems as depicted in fig 2c the intensity of dmpo ho spin adducts characteristic peaks observed in the s zvi paa system was about five times stronger than that detected in zvi paa system suggesting that sulfidation of zvi could significantly enhance the yield of ho furthermore epr experiments of different s fe and paa systems were also conducted and the results illustrated in fig 2c revealed the signal peak of dmpo ho spin adducts following the order 0 05 0 1 0 20 which is consistent with the degradation effect of different s fe ratio this results were also confirmed by the semi quantitative analysis results fig 2d via measuring the characteristic products of 2 hydroxyl terephthalic acid htpa from the reaction between terephthalic acid tpa and ho zhou et al 2020 3 3 products evaluation and toxicity assays the transformation products tps of smx by s zvi paa system were measured by uplc qtof ms ms seven tps tp 99 tp 156 tp 255 tp 270 tp 348 tp364 tp 519 were observed and shown in figs s16 s21 the structures of smx and its transformation products were presented in table s6 the possible degradation pathways of smx were proposed in fig s22 based on the above tps it is speculated that there are four degradation pathways for smx in pathway i tp 99 and tp 156 can be produced by non selective hydroxyl radical through n s bond breaking yan et al 2021 as for tp 255 it was formed by the substitution of the amino group on the benzene ring and methyl group on the 5 methylisoxazole via hydroxyl du et al 2018 tp 270 was produced through hydroxylation reaction occurring on the aniline ring indicating that ho played a significant role in smx degradation pathway iii furthermore n centered radical can be generated through the reaction between ho and nh2 group yan et al 2019 tp 348 tp 364 and tp 519 were produced via coupling reaction that took place between n centered radicals pathway iv notably the detected transformation products also supporting the above conclusion that ho was the fundamental radical responsible for smx degradation to further assess toxicity changes during treatment of smx in the s zvi paa system bioluminescent inhibition of photobacterium phosphoreum was tested at initial smx dosage of 10 mm as depicted in fig s23a there was almost no change in l l0 during the reaction process implying that no more toxic transformation products were generated during the treatment of s zvi paa process e coli growth experiments were further used to compare microbial growth before and after degradation of smx by s zvi paa systems as seen from fig s23b the treatment of s zvi paa system had no negative effect on the toxicity of smx according to the insignificant differences of the growth of e coli among the control smx and degradation products groups compared with other aops the activated paa process will be more suitable to be associated with the biological treatment 3 4 mechanism of sulfidation in enhancing zvi s ability to activate paa above results indicated that s zvi possessed a better performance in activating paa for smx removal over 7 cycles fig 1f results in fig s24 disclosed that s powder and na2s had no ability for activation of paa to degrade smx according to previous reports fe ii is a good activator and can effectively activate paa to degrade pollutants kim et al 2019 which was verified by the further accelerated smx removal after extra addition of fe ii into the s zvi paa system fig s25 as can be seen from table s2 the relative proportion of surface fe ii in fe 2p spectra increased from 38 19 to 55 67 after reacting with paa while the proportion of surface fe iii decreased from 58 7 to 30 72 suggesting that fe ii was released continuously during the reaction process and probably reduced from fe iii by a hidden way guo et al 2020 it can be seen from fig 3 a that s zvi with different s fe ratios all generated a certain greater amount of fe ii during the reaction process the yield of total fe ii in s zvi s fe 0 05 paa system was almost three times of zvi paa system the increased fe ii release might arise from two aspects enhanced electron transfer from inner fe0 due to the formation of conductive iron sulfides and better iron circulation caused by the reductive ability of sulfides it is well known that zvi is easy to be surrounded by a layer of iron oxide during the reaction and the structurally dense oxide shell would block both mass transfer and electron transfer li et al 2021 ling and zhang 2015 however iron sulfides especially fes are famous metal conductors due to the existence of delocalized electrons in their layers kim et al 2011 therefore the deposition of iron sulfides on the iron surface is conducive to the conduction of electrons from the iron core to the iron surface thus improve the activity of zvi and promote the release of iron ions tafel curve fig 3b indicated that s zvi had a higher corrosion current and a lower corrosion potential than zvi fig 3c exhibited the nyquist diagram of s zvi and zvi with a result of a smaller radius appeared in s zvi the above electrochemical analysis showed that s zvi had a better electron transfer ability than zvi which is beneficial for electron transfer and iron release s zvi with a s fe ratio of 0 05 exhibited the best electron transfer performance in comparison with the other two kinds of s zvi moreover a greater decrease of the fe charasteritic peak intensity over cycles fig 3d and the obvious surface cracking of s zvi fig s2 but insignificant change of zvi after reacting with paa for 15 min further confirmed that sulfidation could enhance the corrosion ability of zvi it is reported that the sulfide layer on the surface of s zvi can reduce fe iii to fe ii fan et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2015 particularly the amount of s species added during the synthesis of s zvi was calculated as 0 09 mm however the energy dispersive spectrometer eds results fig 4 a disclosed that the sulfur species on the zvi surface was not completely consumed but decreased from 8 31 to 3 9 1 49 and 1 47 after reaction for 1 3 and 5 cycles more interestingly xps analysis revealed that although the s2 contents decreased after paa activation the proportions of total conductive iron sulfides including s2 and s2 2 changed to a limited extent after reactions figs 4b and s25 these results implied that not all the sulfides but perhaps the dissolved sulfides released due to zvi corrosion participated in fe3 reduction moreover about 0 05 mm the loss of sulfur species in the first cycle theoretically and 0 02 mm the loss of sulfur species from the 1st to 3rd cycle theoretically s2 were separately added into fe iii solution with fast generation of 4 2 0 19 and 2 2 0 02 mg l fe ii fig s27 this suggests the partial contribution of improved iron circulation by sulfides which would partially contribute to the promoted paa activation in the first cycle fig s11 while which is not convinced from the 1st to 3rd cycle based on the regeneration of small amounts of fe ii fig s27 moreover the limited decrease of surfaced sulfur species but with smx removal kobs 2 4 times higher than that of zvi paa system further confirmed that the enhanced paa activation was not mainly associated with the regenerated fe ii via sulfides it can be speculated that improved iron circulation caused by sulfides is not crucial for the good recycle stability of s zvi in activating paa the above results indicated that the increased paa activation and smx removal mainly resulted from the enhancement of electron donating and transferring ability rather than the ability of sulfides to reduce fe iii in a long term operation wang et al 2020b 2020c this is absolutely different from fes paa system in which s2 and its conversion product h2s aq played a significant role in fe ii regeneration with a result of accelerated paa activation yang et al 2022 furthermore density functional theory dft calculations were performed to provide deep insights into performance change before and after the sulfidation step from a microscopic perspective zvi was constructed via a 3 3 4 supercell composed of fe 100 planes coupling a modified hydroxylated iron oxide icsd 1544 surface layer where vacuum layer was 20 å in the z axis direction li et al 2020 according to the report of ferré et al the sulfidated micronscale zero valent iron model could be realized by different s coverages on the surface curulla ferre et al 2006 as shown in fig s28 the corresponding s fe ratio are 0 0 025 0 05 0 1 and 0 20 respectively when the s coverage is 0 1 9 1 3 5 9 and 9 9 furthermore work function was calculated as a descriptor to evaluate the effect of sulfidation on the electron donating ability of mzvi hölzl j 1979 the results displayed that the value of the work function has a decrease after sulfidation regardless of the s fe ratio which indicates that sulfidation can enhance the electron donating ability of zvi fig 5 a however the work function value increases again when s fe ratio was greater than 0 05 demonstrating that the introduction of excessive sulfur species would hinder the further output of electrons these computational results verified the electrochemical analysis data that sulfidation will improve the electron transfer capacity moreover the linear correlation between the work function and kobs of smx removal was analyzed interestingly there was a negative linear correlation between these two values as indicated by a r2 of 0 96 fig 5b indicating that the increased smx removal mainly resulted from the enhancement of electron donating and transferring ability rather wang et al 2020b 2020c 3 5 strategy to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system 3 5 1 effect of water matrix anions such as chloride bicarbonate dihydrogen phosphate and natural organic compounds are widely existed in water environment the presence of these water constituents could impact compound degradation via scavenging the reactive radicals and or forming complexes with iron cations chen et al 2019b as shown in fig s29a the reaction was only slightly inhibited by adding chloride ions varying from 0 2 to 2 0 mm it was reported that cl can scavenge ho and r o which may play a major role in the s zvi paa system chen et al 2019b fu et al 2015 in addition the formation of cl complex reaction with ferrous and ferric ions on the s zvi surface may reduce the activation ability of s zvi thus reducing the degradation effect of smx fu et al 2017 as common active radical scavengers xie et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the influences of hco3 and h2po4 were investigated in s zvi paa process and results are presented in figs s29b and s29c as the concentration of bicarbonate and phosphate increased the reaction was strongly inhibited for instance the kobs of the reaction decreased from 0 4045 min 1 to 0 0208 min 1 when the concentration of bicarbonate was 0 5 mm this might be explained from the following two aspects 1 both hco3 and h2po4 are capable of scavenging hydroxyl radical which was the main free radical in s zvi paa system xie et al 2015 yang et al 2016 2 addition of hco3 and h2po4 lead to the formation of unreactive fe ii complexes thus blocking the catalysts center wang et al 2020d as shown in fig s29d ha significantly suppressed the degradation efficiency of smx this phenomenon has been frequently discovered in previous study of aops guan et al 2013 including pms and h2o2 activation systems and the ability of ha to quench ho has been proposed as the main factor in addition according to previous reports the decomposition of paa is hindered with the presence of ha which may attribute to the blockage of the catalyst center by ha complex wang et al 2020d meanwhile the effects of water matrix on the performance of s zvi paa and zvi paa system were compared and results demonstrated the significantly poorer resistance of zvi paa system to low concentration of water matrix fig s30 suggesting the better practical application potential of s zvi paa process notably the removal efficiency of smx in tap water and lake water fig s31 by s zvi paa system could still reach 99 and 78 within 15 mins but at a slower removal rate suggesting the requirement of strategy to further promote the applicability of s zvi paa system 3 5 2 strategy to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system during exploring the mechanism of sulfidation in enhancing the activity of zvi for paa activation it s unexpectedly found that the addition of fe iii would obviously accelerate the paa activation fig s8 considering the ubiquity of fe iii in wastewater the stability and low cost for storage and transportation of commercial ferric salts optimal utilization of fe iii would be a good strategy to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system accordingly the corresponding performance and mechanism were explored systematically as shown in fig s32 the addition of fe iii significantly accelerated the degradation of smx and boosted the yield of fe ii it s disclosed that the amount of fe ii produced by s zvi reduction with different s fe ratios followed the order 0 05 0 025 0 1 0 20 zvi which was positively correlated with their ability to activate paa for smx degradation at the same time the control experiment of fe iii paa was carried out and it was found that the degradation of smx was negligible fig s32 the superior performance of fe iii s zvi paa system maintained over 7 cycles as indicated by 100 smx removal and kobs being 2 5 and 4 5 times that of s zvi paa and zvi paa process at the 7th cycle respectively fig 6 a in the co existence of 2 mm cl about 0 2 3 14 times of kobs improvement can be achieved after adding various concentrations of fe iii dosing 25 and 50 mg l fe iii could raise the smx removal in hco3 system efficiency from 55 2 to about 100 with 8 5 and 23 times promotion of kobs in the phosphate system the smx removal efficiency can be elevated from 88 1 to above 99 5 when 25 and 50 mg l fe iii were added similarly the kobs could dosage dependently increase from 0 19 min 1 to 1 32 min 1 with the addition of 5 to 50 mg l fe iii more importantly the addition of fe iii was still effective for boosting smx removal in tap water and lake water as illustrated in fig 6c adding a typical concentration 25 mg l of fe iii finally resulted in 100 smx degradation within 15 min and 3 7 times increase of kobs in the lake system the above results manifested the feasibility of utilizing fe iii to extend the applicability of s zvi paa system 3 5 3 role of fe iii in boosting micropollutant removal it should be noted that the introduction of fe iii would cause coagulation effects while the almost unchangeable smx concentration after its addition into 50 mg l fe iii for 15 min at initial ph of 7 0 and 4 0 suggested the limited role of flocculation for smx removal fig s33 in order to explore the smx removal mechanism after addition of fe iii quenching experiments were conducted with results illustrated in fig 6b it can be seen that addition of 100 mm tba can inhibit 68 0 smx removal while 100 mm methanol displayed a stronger suppression 83 suggesting the dominant role of ho and limited contribution of other active species for smx degradation this demonstrated that oxidation by ros is the mechanism for smx removal and dosing fe iii didn t change the dominated ros since the ph of fe iii solution is acidic the influence of ph variation induced by the introduction of ph should be considered but was excluded by the ph monitoring results in fig s34 because the released fe ii is the main active site for paa activation the concentrations of both surface and aqueous fe ii were detected as presented in fig 7 a the presence of fe iii induced a dosage dependent increase in fe ii generation over the whole process which might contribute to the higher yield of ros moreover the semi quantity analysis results of ho via detecting the 7 hoc transformed from the coumarin verified the dosage dependent enhancement of ho generation after the introduction of fe iii fig 7b it s interesting to notice that the addition of fe iii changed the proportion of surface and aqueous fe ii fig 7a in the absence of fe iii the proportion of surface fe ii decreased from 99 6 to 48 0 over 15 min however in the presence of 5 25 and 50 mg l fe iii the contents of surface fe ii reduced from 78 7 to 44 4 from 54 2 to 4 7 from 41 8 to 7 9 respectively after the reaction of 1 min and 15 min respectively which were totally lower than the control systems because 2 2 bipyridyl bpy can chelate fe ii to hinder electron transfer to the oxidants on the surface of particles but cannot quench oh directly fang et al 2013 bpy was added to test the activation of paa by surface fe ii as expected the degradation efficiency of smx in the two systems separately decreased from 99 6 0 34 to 44 1 3 31 from 100 to 74 7 1 07 after the introduction of 0 5 mm bpy fig 6b suggesting 55 7 and 25 3 contribution of surface fe ii to ros generation in the s zvi paa and fe iii s zvi paa system respectively in theory a higher fe ii production after adding fe iii would cause the fast consumption of fe0 however xrd results illustrated in fig 8 a surprisingly disclosed a much slower fe corrosion rate as indicated by a higher peak intensity than that of s zvi paa system after reaction for 1 3 and 5 cycles fig 3d particularly aqueous fe iii is easier to accept the electron from fe0 than h2o with results of higher fe ii yield and slower zvi corrosion furthermore previous study revealed that predosed iron ions would work as the primary corrosion product of fe0 and to slow the oxidation of fe contained in s zvi by o2 h fan et al 2019 surprisingly eds analysis of s zvi particles in the presence of fe iii after several cycles disclosed that the sulfur species contents decreased from 8 31 to 7 22 6 22 and 4 55 after reaction for 1 3 and 5 cycles respectively suggesting a much slower decrease rate of sulfur species than the absence of fe iii fig 8b as such the introduction of fe iii would avoid the fast consumption of s zvi and release of solid state sulfur species into reaction solution resulting in a better electron transfer ability than the system without addition of fe iii this also confirmed the above conclusion that improvement of electron transfer and donating ability of zvi but not the reduction ability of sulfides plays a crucial role in the sulfidation enhanced paa activation for efficient decontamination 4 conclusion this study found that mechanically obtained s zvi is capable of activating paa at a higher rate with a better micropollutant removal efficiency over 7 cycles in comparison with zvi further analysis revealed that hydroxyl radical was the main radical produced in the s zvi paa system and responsible for micropollutants removal while r o was also generated but with a small amount interestingly via eds and xps analysis it s surprisingly discovered that the surfaced sulfur was not completely consumed initially but decreased gradually over cycles and with the relative proportions of sulfides changed slightly limited fe ii would be regenerated from the reaction between fe iii and sulfides resulting in the small contribution of sulfide induced iron circulation towards enhanced paa activation during long term operation which is different from fes paa system as reported previously further experimental and theory calculation results manifested the dominant role of enhanced electron transfer from inner fe0 due to the formation of conductive iron sulfides in boosting paa activation moreover taking advantage of the combined effect of sulfidation and fe iii dosing this work proposed a new strategy to greatly enhance both the reactivity and capacity of zvi toward oxidants activation the introduction of fe iii would avoid the fast consumption of s zvi and release of solid phase sulfur species from zvi promoting the recycle stability of the proposed s zvi paa system for efficient decontamination of actual wastewater considering the ubiquity of fe iii in wastewater the stability and low cost for storage and transportation of commercial ferric salts this method of enhancing zvi for paa activation is simple efficiency and cost effective which benefits the practical application of paa based technology for wastewater treatment this study also suggests that when evaluating the impacts of water matrix on aops the effect of co existed metal cations should be comprehensively taken into account declaration of competing

15659,membrane biofouling has been intensively investigated over many years however little attention has been paid to the role of slightly elevated nutrients in the fouling formation especially during drinking water treatment in this study we evaluated the respective contribution of slightly elevated nitrogen ca 0 5 mg l 1 and phosphorus ca 0 1 mg l 1 concentrations to membrane biofouling formation and deciphered the associated mechanisms the results demonstrated that the slight concentration elevation of nitrogen did not substantially decrease the permeate flux but approximately 50 of the permeate flux was reduced by the elevated phosphorus the fouling layer was thickened about 4 fold due to the slight elevation of phosphorus and this resulted in the best removal performance of fluorescent organics in contrast the fouling layer structure was not markedly changed by the elevated nitrogen the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in the fouling layers increased to different degrees with phosphorus playing a more pronounced role than nitrogen the molecular experiments revealed that the filamentous arthronema dominated the nitrogen enriched fouling layer but they decreased to nearly zero in the phosphorus enriched fouling layer and the xanthobacter which was capable of secreting large amounts of eps was enhanced the growth of algae chlorellales was stimulated by the elevated nitrogen while sphaeropleales was dominant with elevated phosphorus and for protozoa vannella was increased by nitrogen whereas members of hartmannella were enhanced by phosphorus our findings indicate that the impact of slight increases in concentration of nutrients especially phosphorus should be taken into account in drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane biofouling nitrogen phosphorus ultrafiltration bacterial community micro eukaryotic community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years membrane filtration has been an increasingly applied technology for water purification especially for drinking water production peng et al 2009 shannon et al 2008 however the fouling layer that forms on the surface of membranes is widely recognized as a major obstacle that limits the performance and cost effectiveness of the process bar zeev et al 2015 desmond et al 2022 flemming 2020 pronk et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a it is readily acknowledged that the fouling layer has been intensively investigated over many years ranging from multifaceted factors of influence to the relationships between the physical structure properties and filtration performance chomiak et al 2014 derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018b jafari et al 2019 nevertheless insufficient attention has been paid to the factors associated with the growth of microorganisms which could influence the severity of membrane biofouling nutrients in the form of bio available nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms dai et al 2022 for the different organisms the utilization efficiency of nutrients differs lauro et al 2009 accordingly regulating the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the feed water is suspected to be an approach for controlling membrane biofouling as reported previously desmond et al 2018 limiting nutrient conditions could produce biofilms with different eps concentrations and compositions showing that biofilms grown under phosphorus limiting conditions were characterized by dense physical structures with high concentrations of polysaccharides and extracellular dna desmond et al 2018a javier and co workers later proposed that p limitation delayed biofilm formation effectively in reverse osmosis membrane systems when combined with low assimilable organic carbon concentration javier et al 2020 however in many practical applications increasing concentrations of nutrients in surface waters is considered inevitable due to anthropogenic activities and it has been reported that structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities were significantly affected by the increase of nutrients in rivers li et al 2018 thus whether an increase of nutrients can induce changes in the communities consortia of the fouling layer is still unknown as relevant investigations of this are absent in the literatures moreover in the fouling layer the bacterial communities constitute social networks in which the members interact with each other in various ways including competition for nutrients cooperation by cross feeding and communication via secretion or detection of eps ghoul and mitri 2016 the excretion of secondary metabolites by actively growing species was reported to change the environmental conditions affecting the growth of other organisms and shifting relative abundance levels ratzke et al 2020 in addition biotic factors i e growth traits and ecological interactions and abiotic factors i e nutrient supply intertwine to impact individual species abundance and thus determine community composition dai et al 2022 therefore deciphering the bacterial community is vitally important for the in depth understanding of the influence of nutrients increase on the fouling layer formation the micro eukaryotic species also play a substantial role which are often neglected in the dissection of the fouling layer also termed as a mini ecosystem inkinen et al 2019 pronk et al 2019 the most important eukaryotic species of interest are those belonging to algae and protozoa algae as the ubiquitous primary producers field et al 1998 are sensitive to the concentration of nutrients schneider et al 2013 which in excess can induce eutrophication in the freshwater conley et al 2009 imposing difficulty to the subsequent membrane filtration process liu et al 2020 qi et al 2016 the extracellular organic matter exuded from the algae has been shown to contribute to severe membrane fouling alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 merle et al 2016 zang et al 2020 hence it is necessary to evaluate the impact on the algal community when facing an increase of nutrients in the feed water and whether the induced shift in algal community exerts pronounced differences in the membrane biofouling to the best of our knowledge no clear exposition of this has been reported to date therefore given the complex interactions between algae and bacteria ramanan et al 2016 the resulting effects on membrane biofouling seems even more attractive to us in addition as important microbial predators protozoa are the main consumers of bacteria and algae xiong et al 2018 and perform key functions in energy flow and element cycling xu et al 2005 previous investigations of protozoa have reported that the protozoa can impact biofilms in various ways for instance protozoan metabolism can re mineralize nutrients and stimulate biofilm growth scherwass et al 2016 owing to the enhanced solute transport by protozoan movement in biofilms the porosity of the biofilm can increase leading to morphological changes bohme et al 2009 derlon et al 2012 also pointed out that protozoa could influence the structure of biofilm developing an open and heterogeneous structure compared to the flat compact and thick structure formed without the presence of protozoa therefore deciphering the protozoan community of the fouling layer is also of crucial significance in this study given that the concentrations of nutrients in the source of drinking water should comply with the environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 the effect of a slight increase of nutrient concentration was investigated specifically 0 5 and 0 1 mg l 1 for ammonium nh4 and ortho phosphate po4 3 respectively in order to elucidate the respective role of nitrogen and phosphorus in membrane biofouling formation in addition a gravity driven membrane gdm filtration arrangement was employed as the preferred filtration system owing to its endowed advantages of extremely low energy consumption no backwashing and quasi steady flux pronk et al 2019 based on the relevant literature there is a dearth of information on the effects of slightly elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in feed waters on membrane biofouling in this paper we report the results of laboratory tests designed to reveal these influences from multifaceted aspects in terms of filtration performance morphological structure fouling layer properties removal efficiency of natural organic matter nom and bacterial and micro eukaryotic communities we hypothesized that the slightly elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus played divergent roles in the fouling layer formation owing to the different nutrient supply the bacterial and micro eukaryotic communities were anticipated to be altered and consequently the morphological structure and properties of the fouling layer would also be changed such changes would also affect the permeate flux of the filtration process and the removal efficiency of nom as such the findings have enabled the interactions among the associated aspects to be disentangled and provide a deeper understanding of roles of slightly elevated feed water nitrogen and phosphorus in membrane biofouling formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental preparation and operation

at the phylum class order and genus levels the bar plots were drawn by origin 2018 and the chord charts were delineated with r packages circlize and statnet the circle graph was plotted using r package ggplot2 to elucidate the commonness and discrepancy of the communities across different fouling layers an upset plot was drawn with r package upsetr to assess whether the communities are distinct under different conditions principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to visualize the differences of the communities in a two dimensional ordination space r package vegan the discrepancies between the communities across different samples were further quantified by bray curtis dissimilarity and the plot was completed with origin 2018 2 7 other analyses the surface roughness of the fouling layers was determined by infinitefocus g5 alicona austria which is a flexible optical 3d measurement instrument that enables simultaneous acquirement of roughness data and microscopic morphology the surface zeta potential of the fouling layers was measured by an electric solid surface analyzer surpass 3 anton paar austria 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect on the long term filtration performance as a function of time the permeate flux presented a decreasing trend and ultimately reached a pseudo steady state for all the filtration systems tested control n enriched and p enriched fig 1 a which was consistent with the expected behavior of gdm filtration system as reported in other studies chomiak et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 desmond et al 2018b peter varbanets et al 2010 the permeate flux was always the highest for the control filtration system followed by the n enriched and p enriched filtration systems fig 1a it was evident that for the first 10 days of operation the disparity between the permeate flux for all the filtration systems was not significant but subsequently the differences became apparent especially between the p enriched and control n enriched filtration systems fig 1a ultimately the permeate flux reached stable values of 2 94 0 22 2 80 0 19 and 1 60 0 16 l m 2 h 1 for the control n enriched and p enriched filtration systems respectively as shown by the ratio of permeate flux fig 1b the value of j n enriched j control always fluctuated around 1 0 during the experiment but j p enriched j control decreased from 1 0 during the operation of the first 19 days and finally stabilized at about 0 5 these ratios indicated that the slight increase of nitrogen in the influent did not have a pronounced impact on the permeate flux in comparison to the control filtration system but the slight increase in phosphorus reduced the flux by about 50 the corresponding hydraulic resistance fig 1c increased as a function of time and ultimately the p enriched filtration system 10 11 0 41 1012 m 1 was approximately twice that of the other two cases 5 47 0 41 1012 and 5 75 0 39 1012 m 1 for the control and n enriched filtration systems respectively in addition it took longer for the p enriched filtration system to reach the pseudo stable state about 19 days than the other two filtration systems about 10 days implying the greater contribution of phosphorus to hydraulic resistance the ratio of biofilm hydraulic resistance further suggested that the accumulated biofouling layer in the p enriched filtration system was responsible for the elevated hydraulic resistance but was much less so for the n enriched filtration system fig 1d 3 2 effect on the fouling layer properties as revealed by infinitefocus g5 the optical micrographs of the fouling layers captured at the end of the experiment were markedly different reflected mainly by the color and aggregation state fig 2 a the color of the control fouling layer was light brown and this changed to green with the increased nitrogen feed and dark green with the increased phosphorus feed it is believed that this is the first time that the direct visualization of the fouling layer color with high resolution has been reported additionally the images suggested that greater amounts of substances aggregated together in the n enriched and p enriched fouling layers than in the control fouling layer the surface roughness data revealed that the p enriched fouling layer had the largest value of s q 11 168 μm followed by the n enriched 5 075 μm and control fouling layers 3 885 μm table s2 indicating that the dosed nitrogen and phosphorus increased the heterogeneity of the fouling layer desmond et al 2018b moreover the slight increase of nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously lowered the zeta potential more negative of the fouling layers kruskal wallis p 0 01 fig 2b reaching 20 8 0 7 and 25 4 1 1 mv respectively as compared to that of control fouling layer 16 6 0 9 mv again phosphorus played a more prominent role than nitrogen in influencing the nature of the organic substances in the fouling layers in terms of the chemical bonds in the fouling layers similar absorption peaks were observed for all the fouling layers but the absorption intensity varied such as for the amide i amide ii and c o c bands fig 2c 3 3 effect on the structure of fouling layers 3 3 1 top view in order to provide detailed information on the structure of the fouling layer sample analysis by sem was performed from the top view the physical structure of the n enriched fouling layer was similar to the control fouling layer but distinguished from that in the p enriched filtration system fig 3 a large quantity of filamentous microbes can be observed clearly in both the control and n enriched fouling layers fig 3a c d f but this was much less apparent in the p enriched fouling layer fig 3g i this was a significant finding which was further investigated using high throughput sequencing technology and is discussed subsequently 3 3 2 side view as demonstrated in cross section discrepancies existed in the thickness and morphology of the fouling layers for the n enriched fouling layer the thickness was 202 4 27 9 μ m fig 4 b which was comparable to that of the control filtration layer being 204 8 48 6 μ m fig 4a but was much less than the p enriched fouling layer which was 967 5 20 0 μ m fig 4c it was also evident visually that the p enriched fouling layer had a much lower structural porosity than the control and n enriched fouling layers the variation of contact angle 200 s further revealed that the structural hydrophilicity was similar for the n enriched and control fouling layers whereas the p enriched fouling layer showed much lower contact angle values than the other two cases fig 4d which also reflected structural differences of the fouling layers according to the results with respect to the structural composition fig 4e the p enriched fouling layer yielded the highest concentrations of polysaccharides 94 473 5 540 μg cm 2 and proteins 15 781 0 698 μg cm 2 in accordance with the observed greater thickness of the fouling layer fig 4c in contrast low concentrations of polysaccharides 53 626 5 569 μg cm 2 and proteins 10 579 1 919 μg cm 2 were included in the n enriched fouling layer which were slightly greater than those in the fouling layer of the control 50 587 5 328 and 8 838 1 138 μg cm 2 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively 3 4 effect on removal efficiency of nom considering the markedly distinct structures of the fouling layers it was speculated that there would be differences in the removal of nom which is also a crucial influence on membrane fouling kimura et al 2016 yu et al 2018 the hpsec results demonstrated that the nom with large mw 100 600 kda corresponding to biopolymers were effectively removed by all the filtration systems even though there was some variation in their presence in the influents fig 5 a d g regarding to the fluorescence properties of the nom the influent samples all displayed eem spectra with two dominant peaks being tyrosine and tryptophan like substances in regions i and iv respectively figs 5b e h in the effluents the fluorescence intensities were substantially reduced fig 5c f i to investigate the variations of the fluorescent nom in more detail the eem spectra were divided and analyzed regionally figs 5j k fig s2 interestingly the n enriched filtration presented a consistent trend of variation with the control filtration showing positive values of removal quantity for regions i ii and iv but negative values for regions iii and v corresponding to fulvic acid and humic acid like substances respectively yet for the p enriched filtration system it always exhibited the positive and highest removal quantity for all the regions fig 5j further the p enriched filtration system still performed the best when evaluated by removal efficiency reaching approximately 59 96 1 10 21 99 2 43 and 33 88 0 60 for regions i ii and iv respectively fig 5k by contrast the values were low for the n enriched and control filtration systems for all the regions that is the thickness of the fouling layer played a non negligible role in the removal of fluorescent noms and thicker fouling layer conducted better removal performance with regard to the negative removal efficiency of fulvic acid and humic acid like substances regions iii and iv especially for the n enriched filtration system the dead microbes particularly the cyanobacteria or eukaryotic algae in the fouling layers were suspected to be predominantly responsible for as they could form or transfer into fulvic acid and humic acid like substances unpublished data in terms of the species of microbes in the fouling layers they will be unraveled and discussed in the following sections 3 5 effect on the bacterial and micro eukaryotic communities 3 5 1 shifts in community composition revealed by molecular bioinformatics for better understanding of the microbes in the fouling layers bacterial algal and protozoan communities were investigated taxonomically as revealed by high throughput sequencing technology the increase of nitrogen and phosphorus in feed waters led to disproportional shifts of lineages belonging to bacteria algae and protozoa fig 6 a with regard to the bacterial community the relative abundance of the dominant phylum proteobacteria was promoted from 37 4 6 0 control fouling layer to 49 1 11 6 and 69 7 1 9 for the n and p enriched fouling layers respectively the phylum verrucomicrobia that is often found in phosphorus enriched environments consistently presented the highest abundance in the p enriched fouling layer sun et al 2020 it was noted that the members of cyanobacteria accounted for 17 9 5 3 and 15 6 5 4 abundance in the control and n enriched fouling layers yet exhibited low abundance in the p enriched fouling layer approximately zero since the majority of the algae were affiliated to the phylum chlorophyta relative abundance 80 for all the fouling layers algal species were delineated at class level the class chlorophyceae occurred in very high members in both the control and p enriched fouling layers 99 7 0 1 and 98 8 0 1 respectively but for the n enriched fouling layer trebouxiophyceae occupied the greatest proportion 89 2 0 8 with respect to the protozoan community the phyla amoebozoa and apusozoa were the most abundant taxa in the control fouling layer while the phylum amoebozoa dominated the protozoan community when nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were slightly increased to provide further insight into the shifts of the communities species at smaller level were focused on it was found that the most abundant taxon was genus arthronema in both the control and n enriched bacterial communities fig 6b which was filamentous cyanobacterium and this coincided well with the sem observations figs 3a and b in contrast few arthronema were included in the p enriched bacterial community which explained the absence of the filamentous microbes in the sem images fig 3c and implied that the slight increase of phosphorus inhibited the growth of such filamentous cyanobacteria however the lineages belonging to xanthobacter were strongly promoted by phosphorus and took a major position in the p enriched fouling layer the genus xanthobacter was revealed to be able to excrete copious amounts of slimes also termed as eps wiegel 2006 and has been reported to be present in high abundance which contributed to the formation of thick fouling layers zhang et al 2021a 2021b therefore the thick fouling layer induced by the slightly increased phosphorus was readily comprehensible by contrast the slight elevation of nitrogen did not alter the relative abundance of xanthobacter interestingly the proportion of prosthecobacter was enhanced by both the nitrogen and phosphorus specifically 6 6 and 10 8 for the n enriched and p enriched fouling layers respectively for the algal community otu 526 order sphaeropleales otu 934 order chlorellales and otu 576 order sphaeropleales presented the highest abundance in the control n enriched and p enriched fouling layers respectively from this it can be inferred that dosed nitrogen altered the algal community more than phosphorus in the fouling layers with regard to the protozoan community the slight increase of nitrogen elevated pronouncedly the abundance of genus vannella leading to 86 6 proportion in the n enriched fouling layer by contrast members of hartmannella regarded as one of the most representative genera of amoebae in drinking water networks ren et al 2018 thomas et al 2008 valster et al 2009 were enhanced by the dosed phosphorus giving a proportion of 84 2 in support of this ren and co workers discovered that the abundance of hartmannella presented positive relationships with phosphorus in rivers ren et al 2018 implying that the slight elevation of phosphorus could stimulate the growth of hartmannella 3 5 2 diversity patterns of the community structures since several algal otus possessed the majority of abundance as shown in fig 6c the diversity analysis regarding to algae was excluded but bacteria and protozoa were included specifically for the bacteria fig 7 a a total of 125 otus presented in all the fouling layers and the number of shared otus was only 21 for the control p enriched fouling layers which was lower than that for the control n enriched filtration systems 121 otus the number of otus unique to the control fouling layer was 143 which was larger than the n enriched 78 and p enriched fouling layers 40 these suggested that bacterial richness was reduced by the slight increase of nitrogen and phosphorus as indicated visually in the pcoa plot based on bray curtis distance matrix fig 7b the bacterial communities were discernibly separated from each other revealing that the slight increase of nitrogen and phosphorus altered the bacterial community moreover the difference between the control and p enriched bacterial communities was the greatest as indicated by the largest bray curtis dissimilarity median 82 2 fig 7c which was consistent with the observation of the remarkably different structures fig 3 in comparison there was comparatively less difference between the control and n enriched bacterial communities as witnessed by the low median of bray curtis dissimilarity 64 9 which was consistent with the apparent similar morphological structures of the fouling layers from the sem images with respect to protozoa only one otu was shared across all the fouling layers and an overlap of 7 otus was observed in the control p enriched fouling layers which was greater than that shared between the control and n enriched fouling layers 4 otus fig 7d moreover it was found that the protozoan communities were distinctly separated by pcoa 1 and pcoa 2 as demonstrated by the pcoa plot drawn on the basis of bray curtis distance matrix fig 7e according to the calculated bray curtis dissimilarity the difference between the control and p enriched protozoan communities was less than that between the control and n enriched communities fig 7f which was in contrast to the case of the bacterial communities fig 7c 3 6 mechanisms underlying the divergent formation of membrane biofouling by nitrogen and phosphorus acting as essential nutrients for the growth of microbes the nitrogen and phosphorus play a crucial role in the membrane fouling as revealed by the results described in the above sections the accumulated fouling layers exhibited distinctly discrepancies in morphological structure compositional constituents microbial consortia and filtration performance when exposed to slightly elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the membrane feed water with regard to the associated mechanisms these are discussed as follows 3 6 1 variation in the concentration of nutrients begat shift in community structure as demonstrated by a previous investigation the changes in the structure of bacterial and protistan communities were mainly due to nutrients rather than other environmental variables li et al 2018 consistent with this it was also discovered in this study through the use of high throughput sequencing technology that the bacteria and micro eukaryotes displayed discrepant communities shift as feeding on different concentrations of nutrients fig 6 with slightly elevated nitrogen and phosphorus the proportion of proteobacteria presented an increased trend however the dosed nitrogen and phosphorus exerted contrasting influences on the cyanobacteria showing no pronounced effect with nitrogen but substantial inhibition with phosphorus fig 6a further analysis revealed that the slight increase in phosphorus decreased the abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria genus arthronema but dramatically increased the proportion of xanthobacter phylum proteobacteria this was attributed to the adaptability of xanthobacter to survive under the elevated phosphorus conditions in contrast to arthronema however when exposed to the increase of nitrogen the filamentous arthronema was predominant which was evident from the sem images fig 3d e collectively the results indicated that the slight elevation of nitrogen and phosphorus selectively promoted or inhibited the growth of bacteria and thus had a direct impact on the bacterial community the slight elevation in nitrogen stimulated the growth of chlorellales while under the p enriched condition the sphaeropleales was dominant in the algal survival and growth the heterotrophic bacteria were reported to play a ubiquitous role and complex communication and nutrient exchange were involved in the algae bacteria interactions ramanan et al 2016 in this sense the induced algal community was correlated to the presence of bacteria in the confined space fouling layer to some extent unfortunately probably because of being embedded by the large amounts of eps in the fouling layer variations in algal community were not directly observed via sem given that published studies focusing on the relationship between algal community and fouling layer formation are scarce further in depth investigation is warranted in the future since protozoa are important predators and main consumers of bacteria and algae xiong et al 2018 the interaction among them was suspected to constrain respective abundance based on the findings the dominant species across all the fouling layers was amoebae which were capable of establishing and stimulating the productivity of biofilms by adhering to surfaces and secreting metabolic substances such as glucopolysaccharides and proteins gomes et al 2020 when exposed to the slight elevation of nutrient concentration the genus vannella was enriched by nitrogen while members of hartmannella were enhanced by phosphorus a previous study also proposed that the protozoan composition was affected by nutrient concentrations and furthermore the algal shift exerted an influence on the protozoan community xu et al 2005 therefore apart from the direct impacts arising from an increase of nutrients the complicated interplay between the algal and protozoan communities were also suspected to influence the formation of divergent fouling layer 3 6 2 induced discrepancy in fouling layers drove disparity in the filtration performance as described previously the morphological structure of the fouling layers changed with the change in nutrient concentration together with the bacterial and micro eukaryotic communities which was indicated by the sem micrographs fig 3 previous studies also discovered that the fouling layers presented different morphologies under varying nutrients conditions and further investigations were performed based on this finding desmond et al 2018a 2018b in this study divergent fouling layers were formed by the slightly elevated nitrogen and phosphorus with the phosphorus having a major impact on the fouling layer structure compared to the control the comparable structures of the n enriched and control fouling layers exhibited similar permeate flux and hydraulic resistance while the divergent morphology of the p enriched fouling layer demonstrated an approximately 2 fold greater hydraulic resistance than the control thus the morphological structure of the fouling layer played an important role in determining the hydraulic resistance in accordance with the statements issued by desmond et al 2018a since all the fouling layers were heterogeneous it is likely that the thickness played a substantial role in the discrepancy of filtration performance desmond et al 2018a clearly the p enriched fouling layer was characterized by the highest thickness and greatest hydraulic resistance with respect to the removal efficiency of nom the heterogeneous p enriched fouling layer performed the best for all the fluorescent regions in contrast the n enriched fouling layer exhibited a poor performance displaying an increase of fulvic acid and humic acid like substances for the filtrate these results further demonstrated that divergent morphology of the fouling layers can lead to differences in the removal of nom components 4 conclusion in this study the respective role of slightly elevated nitrogen ca 0 5 mg l 1 and phosphorus ca 0 1 mg l 1 in membrane biofouling formation for drinking water treatment was investigated via a gdm filtration process the results revealed that the slightly elevated nitrogen did not dramatically decrease the permeate flux but approximately 50 of the permeate flux was reduced by the elevated phosphorus the formed fouling layer was thickened by about 4 fold due to the slight elevation in phosphorus which performed the best in the removal of fluorescent nom by contrast the elevated nitrogen did not markedly change the morphology of the fouling layer as a consequence there was a similar increase of the fulvic acid and humic acid like substances in the filtrate of the n enriched filtration and the control the slightly elevated nitrogen and phosphorus increased the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides and altered the bacterial algal and protozoan communities the filamentous arthronema dominated the n enriched fouling layer but was reduced to nearly zero in the p enriched fouling layer and the genus xanthobacter which was capable of secreting large amounts of eps was enhanced the growth of algae chlorellales was stimulated by the elevated nitrogen while for the p enriched condition the sphaeropleales occupied the dominance for protozoa vannella was enhanced by the elevation in nitrogen whereas members of hartmannella were enhanced by elevated phosphorus eqs 1 3 supporting information the supporting information includes 3 figures and 2 tables which supplement the results in the

15659,membrane biofouling has been intensively investigated over many years however little attention has been paid to the role of slightly elevated nutrients in the fouling formation especially during drinking water treatment in this study we evaluated the respective contribution of slightly elevated nitrogen ca 0 5 mg l 1 and phosphorus ca 0 1 mg l 1 concentrations to membrane biofouling formation and deciphered the associated mechanisms the results demonstrated that the slight concentration elevation of nitrogen did not substantially decrease the permeate flux but approximately 50 of the permeate flux was reduced by the elevated phosphorus the fouling layer was thickened about 4 fold due to the slight elevation of phosphorus and this resulted in the best removal performance of fluorescent organics in contrast the fouling layer structure was not markedly changed by the elevated nitrogen the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in the fouling layers increased to different degrees with phosphorus playing a more pronounced role than nitrogen the molecular experiments revealed that the filamentous arthronema dominated the nitrogen enriched fouling layer but they decreased to nearly zero in the phosphorus enriched fouling layer and the xanthobacter which was capable of secreting large amounts of eps was enhanced the growth of algae chlorellales was stimulated by the elevated nitrogen while sphaeropleales was dominant with elevated phosphorus and for protozoa vannella was increased by nitrogen whereas members of hartmannella were enhanced by phosphorus our findings indicate that the impact of slight increases in concentration of nutrients especially phosphorus should be taken into account in drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane biofouling nitrogen phosphorus ultrafiltration bacterial community micro eukaryotic community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years membrane filtration has been an increasingly applied technology for water purification especially for drinking water production peng et al 2009 shannon et al 2008 however the fouling layer that forms on the surface of membranes is widely recognized as a major obstacle that limits the performance and cost effectiveness of the process bar zeev et al 2015 desmond et al 2022 flemming 2020 pronk et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a it is readily acknowledged that the fouling layer has been intensively investigated over many years ranging from multifaceted factors of influence to the relationships between the physical structure properties and filtration performance chomiak et al 2014 derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018b jafari et al 2019 nevertheless insufficient attention has been paid to the factors associated with the growth of microorganisms which could influence the severity of membrane biofouling nutrients in the form of bio available nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms dai et al 2022 for the different organisms the utilization efficiency of nutrients differs lauro et al 2009 accordingly regulating the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the feed water is suspected to be an approach for controlling membrane biofouling as reported previously desmond et al 2018 limiting nutrient conditions could produce biofilms with different eps concentrations and compositions showing that biofilms grown under phosphorus limiting conditions were characterized by dense physical structures with high concentrations of polysaccharides and extracellular dna desmond et al 2018a javier and co workers later proposed that p limitation delayed biofilm formation effectively in reverse osmosis membrane systems when combined with low assimilable organic carbon concentration javier et al 2020 however in many practical applications increasing concentrations of nutrients in surface waters is considered inevitable due to anthropogenic activities and it has been reported that structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities were significantly affected by the increase of nutrients in rivers li et al 2018 thus whether an increase of nutrients can induce changes in the communities consortia of the fouling layer is still unknown as relevant investigations of this are absent in the literatures moreover in the fouling layer the bacterial communities constitute social networks in which the members interact with each other in various ways including competition for nutrients cooperation by cross feeding and communication via secretion or detection of eps ghoul and mitri 2016 the excretion of secondary metabolites by actively growing species was reported to change the environmental conditions affecting the growth of other organisms and shifting relative abundance levels ratzke et al 2020 in addition biotic factors i e growth traits and ecological interactions and abiotic factors i e nutrient supply intertwine to impact individual species abundance and thus determine community composition dai et al 2022 therefore deciphering the bacterial community is vitally important for the in depth understanding of the influence of nutrients increase on the fouling layer formation the micro eukaryotic species also play a substantial role which are often neglected in the dissection of the fouling layer also termed as a mini ecosystem inkinen et al 2019 pronk et al 2019 the most important eukaryotic species of interest are those belonging to algae and protozoa algae as the ubiquitous primary producers field et al 1998 are sensitive to the concentration of nutrients schneider et al 2013 which in excess can induce eutrophication in the freshwater conley et al 2009 imposing difficulty to the subsequent membrane filtration process liu et al 2020 qi et al 2016 the extracellular organic matter exuded from the algae has been shown to contribute to severe membrane fouling alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 merle et al 2016 zang et al 2020 hence it is necessary to evaluate the impact on the algal community when facing an increase of nutrients in the feed water and whether the induced shift in algal community exerts pronounced differences in the membrane biofouling to the best of our knowledge no clear exposition of this has been reported to date therefore given the complex interactions between algae and bacteria ramanan et al 2016 the resulting effects on membrane biofouling seems even more attractive to us in addition as important microbial predators protozoa are the main consumers of bacteria and algae xiong et al 2018 and perform key functions in energy flow and element cycling xu et al 2005 previous investigations of protozoa have reported that the protozoa can impact biofilms in various ways for instance protozoan metabolism can re mineralize nutrients and stimulate biofilm growth scherwass et al 2016 owing to the enhanced solute transport by protozoan movement in biofilms the porosity of the biofilm can increase leading to morphological changes bohme et al 2009 derlon et al 2012 also pointed out that protozoa could influence the structure of biofilm developing an open and heterogeneous structure compared to the flat compact and thick structure formed without the presence of protozoa therefore deciphering the protozoan community of the fouling layer is also of crucial significance in this study given that the concentrations of nutrients in the source of drinking water should comply with the environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 the effect of a slight increase of nutrient concentration was investigated specifically 0 5 and 0 1 mg l 1 for ammonium nh4 and ortho phosphate po4 3 respectively in order to elucidate the respective role of nitrogen and phosphorus in membrane biofouling formation in addition a gravity driven membrane gdm filtration arrangement was employed as the preferred filtration system owing to its endowed advantages of extremely low energy consumption no backwashing and quasi steady flux pronk et al 2019 based on the relevant literature there is a dearth of information on the effects of slightly elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in feed waters on membrane biofouling in this paper we report the results of laboratory tests designed to reveal these influences from multifaceted aspects in terms of filtration performance morphological structure fouling layer properties removal efficiency of natural organic matter nom and bacterial and micro eukaryotic communities we hypothesized that the slightly elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus played divergent roles in the fouling layer formation owing to the different nutrient supply the bacterial and micro eukaryotic communities were anticipated to be altered and consequently the morphological structure and properties of the fouling layer would also be changed such changes would also affect the permeate flux of the filtration process and the removal efficiency of nom as such the findings have enabled the interactions among the associated aspects to be disentangled and provide a deeper understanding of roles of slightly elevated feed water nitrogen and phosphorus in membrane biofouling formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental preparation and operation surface water was sampled from river jingmi beijing china which serves as the source of drinking water supply for the large majority of the citizens living in beijing detailed information about the surface water quality is provided in the supporting information si table s1 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf ultrafiltration membranes beijing separate equipment co ltd china with a nominal molecular cut off of 100 kda corresponding to a mean pore size of about 7 8 nm were prepared for the experiments they were cut into areas of approximately 78 5 c m 2 and soaked in ultrapure water for 48 h before being used they were further rinsed with ultrapure water for several times a gravity pressure head with a constant transmembrane pressure of 40 mbar 40 cm head was applied to the filtration systems which were operated for approximately 100 days nitrogen n and phosphorus p were added to the surface water in the forms of nh 4 and po 4 3 respectively in concentrations of 0 5 and 0 1 mg l 1 further detailed information concerning the filtration system is given in the si fig s1 since similar findings were found when the experiment was repeated for brevity only one set of data was presented in the manuscript 2 2 permeate flux and hydraulic resistance the permeate flux j l m 2 h 1 of the membrane filtration system was recorded once a day and was calculated using the following equation 1 j δ v a δ t where δ v is the change of permeate volume l a is the filtration area m 2 and δ t is the change of time h the total hydraulic resistance r t m 1 was calculated as 2 r t t m p μ j where μ is the

biofouling layer structure at the end of the experiments the membranes with associated layers of fouling were gently taken out of the filtration apparatus and were then cut into several pieces sections of the membrane samples were directly freeze dried to better present the morphology of the biofouling layer the basal membranes were removed by a tweezer to eliminate possible interference only freeze dried fouling layers were fixed to the sample stage with conductive adhesive before analysis by high resolution field emission gun scanning electron microscope sem s 4800 hitachi japan the fouling layers were gold coated by a sputter and both surface and cross sectional images were captured 2 4 analysis of physico chemical properties of fouling layer 2 4 1 hydrophobic hydrophilic property the hydrophobic hydrophilic property of the fouling layers without freeze drying was indicated by the dynamic contact angle which was measured by a contact angle meter oca15ec dataphysics germany at least five randomized locations were selected and averaged for the measurement and the value was recorded continuously for more than 200 s 2 4 2 chemical structure of fouling material the chemical structure of the freeze dried biofouling layers was explored by identifying the prominent types of chemical bonding using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrum two perkinelmer usa with attenuated total reflectance atr accessory and diamond crystal the samples were placed on the instrument sample area and covered the diamond a slip clutch pressure tower was put on top of the sample to secure it in place which was indicated by a click thus a constant pressure was applied to each sample making the process reproducible the spectral data of the samples were collected in the wavenumber range of 4000 600 cm 1 and 32 scans at a resolution of 2 cm 1 were performed for each analysis all sample analyses were conducted in triplicate and the results averaged 2 4 3 concentrations of total polysaccharides and total proteins total polysaccharides in the fouling layers were quantified using the phenol sulfuric method dubois et al 1956 with glucose sigma aldrich usa as a standard with regard to proteins these were determined by the bradford method bradford 1976 where bovine serum albumin bsa sigma aldrich usa was used as the protein standard and coomassie brilliant blue g 250 sangon biotech china as the dye the absorbance was measured with a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan at wavelengths of 485 and 595 nm for polysaccharides and proteins respectively all results were expressed in units of mass per unit area μg cm 2 2 5 determination of nom properties 2 5 1 fluorescence properties an excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan was used for the analysis of nom fluorescence properties the excitation ex wavelength was in the range of 200 450 nm and the emission em wavelength was between 250 and 550 nm and the bandpass was set to be 5 nm in both cases all samples were pre filtered by a 0 22 μm syringe filter before measurement the eem spectra of the samples were blank subtracted and the intensities were

methods and data processing procedures are provided in the si the raw sequencing reads were deposited to the national center of biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive database under accession number prjna817684 to investigate the relative abundance change of the taxa under different conditions we analyzed the taxonomic composition of the bacterial algal and protozoan communities at the phylum class order and genus levels the bar plots were drawn by origin 2018 and the chord charts were delineated with r packages circlize and statnet the circle graph was plotted using r

distinct under different conditions principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to visualize the differences of the communities in a two dimensional ordination space r package vegan the discrepancies between the communities across different samples were further quantified by bray curtis dissimilarity and the plot was completed with origin 2018 2 7 other analyses the surface roughness of the fouling layers was determined by infinitefocus g5 alicona austria which is a flexible optical 3d measurement instrument that enables simultaneous acquirement of roughness data and microscopic morphology the surface zeta potential of the fouling layers was measured by an electric solid surface analyzer surpass 3 anton paar austria 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect on the long term filtration performance as a function of time the permeate flux presented a decreasing trend and ultimately reached a pseudo steady state for all the filtration systems tested control n enriched and p enriched fig 1 a which was consistent with the expected behavior of gdm filtration system as reported in other studies chomiak et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 desmond et al 2018b peter varbanets et al 2010 the permeate flux was always the highest for the control filtration system followed by the n enriched and p enriched filtration systems fig 1a it was evident that for the first 10 days of operation the disparity between the permeate flux for all the filtration systems was not significant but subsequently the differences became apparent especially between the p enriched and control n enriched filtration systems fig 1a ultimately the permeate flux reached stable values of 2 94 0 22 2 80 0 19 and 1 60 0 16 l m 2 h 1 for the control n enriched and p enriched filtration systems respectively as shown by the ratio of permeate flux fig 1b the value of j n enriched j control always fluctuated around 1 0 during the experiment but j p enriched j control decreased from 1 0 during the operation of the first 19 days and finally stabilized at about 0 5 these ratios indicated that the slight increase of nitrogen in the influent did not have a pronounced impact on the permeate flux in comparison to the control filtration system but the slight increase in phosphorus reduced the flux by about 50 the corresponding hydraulic resistance fig 1c increased as a function of time and ultimately the p enriched filtration system 10 11 0 41 1012 m 1 was approximately twice that of the other two cases 5 47 0 41 1012 and 5 75 0 39 1012 m 1 for the control and n enriched filtration systems respectively in addition it took longer for the p enriched filtration system to reach the pseudo stable state about 19 days than the other two filtration systems about 10 days implying the greater contribution of phosphorus to hydraulic resistance the ratio of biofilm hydraulic resistance further suggested that the accumulated biofouling layer in the p enriched filtration system was responsible for the elevated hydraulic resistance but was much less so for the n enriched filtration system fig 1d 3 2 effect on the fouling layer properties as revealed by infinitefocus g5 the optical micrographs of the fouling layers captured at the end of the experiment were markedly different reflected mainly by the color and aggregation state fig 2 a the color of the control fouling layer was light brown and this changed to green with the increased nitrogen feed and dark green with the increased phosphorus feed it is believed that this is the first time that the direct visualization of the fouling layer color with high resolution has been reported additionally the images suggested that greater amounts of substances aggregated together in the n enriched and p enriched fouling layers than in the control fouling layer the surface roughness data revealed that the p enriched fouling layer had the largest value of s q 11 168 μm followed by the n enriched 5 075 μm and control fouling layers 3 885 μm table s2 indicating that the dosed nitrogen and phosphorus increased the heterogeneity of the fouling layer desmond et al 2018b moreover the slight increase of nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously lowered the zeta potential more negative of the fouling layers kruskal wallis p 0 01 fig 2b reaching 20 8 0 7 and 25 4 1 1 mv respectively as compared to that of control fouling layer 16 6 0 9 mv again phosphorus played a more prominent role than nitrogen in influencing the nature of the organic substances in the fouling layers in terms of the chemical bonds in the fouling layers similar absorption peaks were observed for all the fouling layers but the absorption intensity varied such as for the amide i amide ii and c o c bands fig 2c 3 3 effect on the structure of fouling layers 3 3 1 top view in order to provide detailed information on the structure of the fouling layer sample analysis by sem was performed from the top view the physical structure of the n enriched fouling layer was similar to the control fouling layer but distinguished from that in the p enriched filtration system fig 3 a large quantity of filamentous microbes can be observed clearly in both the control and n enriched fouling layers fig 3a c d f but this was much less apparent in the p enriched fouling layer fig 3g i this was a significant finding which was further investigated using high throughput sequencing technology and is discussed subsequently 3 3 2 side view as demonstrated in cross section discrepancies existed in the thickness and morphology of the fouling layers for the n enriched fouling layer the thickness was 202 4 27 9 μ m fig 4 b which was comparable to that of the control filtration layer being 204 8 48 6 μ m fig 4a but was much less than the p enriched fouling layer which was 967 5 20 0 μ m fig 4c it was also evident visually that the p enriched fouling layer had a much lower structural porosity than the control and n enriched fouling layers the variation of contact angle 200 s further revealed that the structural hydrophilicity was similar for the n enriched and control fouling layers whereas the p enriched fouling layer showed much lower contact angle values than the other two cases fig 4d which also reflected structural differences of the fouling layers according to the results with respect to the structural composition fig 4e the p enriched fouling layer yielded the highest concentrations of polysaccharides 94 473 5 540 μg cm 2 and proteins 15 781 0 698 μg cm 2 in accordance with the observed greater thickness of the fouling layer fig 4c in contrast low concentrations of polysaccharides 53 626 5 569 μg cm 2 and proteins 10 579 1 919 μg cm 2 were included in the n enriched fouling layer which were slightly greater than those in the fouling layer of the control 50 587 5 328 and 8 838 1 138 μg cm 2 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively 3 4 effect on removal efficiency of nom considering the markedly distinct structures of the fouling layers it was speculated that there would be differences in the removal of nom which is also a crucial influence on membrane fouling kimura et al 2016 yu et al 2018 the hpsec results demonstrated that the nom with large mw 100 600 kda corresponding to biopolymers were effectively removed by all the filtration systems even though there was some variation in their presence in the influents fig 5 a d g regarding to the fluorescence properties of the nom the influent samples all displayed eem spectra with two dominant peaks being tyrosine and tryptophan like substances in regions i and iv respectively figs 5b e h in the effluents the fluorescence intensities were substantially reduced fig 5c f i to investigate the variations of the fluorescent nom in more detail the eem spectra were divided and analyzed regionally figs 5j k fig s2 interestingly the n enriched filtration presented a consistent trend of variation with the control filtration showing positive values of removal quantity for regions i ii and iv but negative values for regions iii and v corresponding to fulvic acid and humic acid like substances respectively yet for the p enriched filtration system it always exhibited the positive and highest removal quantity for all the regions fig 5j further the p enriched filtration system still performed the best when evaluated by removal efficiency reaching approximately 59 96 1 10 21 99 2 43 and 33 88 0 60 for regions i ii and iv respectively fig 5k by contrast the values were low for the n enriched and control filtration systems for all the regions that is the thickness of the fouling layer played a non negligible role in the removal of fluorescent noms and thicker fouling layer conducted better removal performance with regard to the negative removal efficiency of fulvic acid and humic acid like substances regions iii and iv especially for the n enriched filtration system the dead microbes particularly the cyanobacteria or eukaryotic algae in the fouling layers were suspected to be predominantly responsible for as they could form or transfer into fulvic acid and humic acid like substances unpublished data in terms of the species of microbes in the fouling layers they will be unraveled and discussed in the following sections 3 5 effect on the bacterial and micro eukaryotic communities 3 5 1 shifts in community composition revealed by molecular bioinformatics for better understanding of the microbes in the fouling layers bacterial algal and protozoan communities were investigated taxonomically as revealed by high throughput sequencing technology the increase of nitrogen and phosphorus in feed waters led to disproportional shifts of lineages belonging to bacteria algae and protozoa fig 6 a with regard to the bacterial community the relative abundance of the dominant phylum proteobacteria was promoted from 37 4 6 0 control fouling layer to 49 1 11 6 and 69 7 1 9 for the n and p enriched fouling layers respectively the phylum verrucomicrobia that is often found in phosphorus enriched environments consistently presented the highest abundance in the p enriched fouling layer sun et al 2020 it was noted that the members of cyanobacteria accounted for 17 9 5 3 and 15 6 5 4 abundance in the control and n enriched fouling layers yet exhibited low abundance in the p enriched fouling layer approximately zero since the majority of the algae were affiliated to the phylum chlorophyta relative abundance 80 for all the fouling layers algal species were delineated at class level the class chlorophyceae occurred in very high members in both the control and p enriched fouling layers 99 7 0 1 and 98 8 0 1 respectively but for the n enriched fouling layer trebouxiophyceae occupied the greatest proportion 89 2 0 8 with respect to the protozoan community the phyla amoebozoa and apusozoa were the most abundant taxa in the control fouling layer while the phylum amoebozoa dominated the protozoan community when nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were slightly increased to provide further insight into the shifts of the communities species at smaller level were focused on it was found that the most abundant taxon was genus arthronema in both the control and n enriched bacterial communities fig 6b which was filamentous cyanobacterium and this coincided well with the sem observations figs 3a and b in contrast few arthronema were included in the p enriched bacterial community which explained the absence of the filamentous microbes in the sem images fig 3c and implied that the slight increase of phosphorus inhibited the growth of such filamentous cyanobacteria however the lineages belonging to xanthobacter were strongly promoted by phosphorus and took a major position in the p enriched fouling layer the genus xanthobacter was revealed to be able to excrete copious amounts of slimes also termed as eps wiegel 2006 and has been reported to be present in high abundance which contributed to the formation of thick fouling layers zhang et al 2021a 2021b therefore the thick fouling layer induced by the slightly increased phosphorus was readily comprehensible by contrast the slight elevation of nitrogen did not alter the relative abundance of xanthobacter interestingly the proportion of prosthecobacter was enhanced by both the nitrogen and phosphorus specifically 6 6 and 10 8 for the n enriched and p enriched fouling layers respectively for the algal community otu 526 order sphaeropleales otu 934 order chlorellales and otu 576 order sphaeropleales presented the highest abundance in the control n enriched and p enriched fouling layers respectively from this it can be inferred that dosed nitrogen altered the algal community more than phosphorus in the fouling layers with regard to the protozoan community the slight increase of nitrogen elevated pronouncedly the abundance of genus vannella leading to 86 6 proportion in the n enriched fouling layer by contrast members of hartmannella regarded as one of the most representative genera of amoebae in drinking water networks ren et al 2018 thomas et al 2008 valster et al 2009 were enhanced by the dosed phosphorus giving a proportion of 84 2 in support of this ren and co workers discovered that the abundance of hartmannella presented positive relationships with phosphorus in rivers ren et al 2018 implying that the slight elevation of phosphorus could stimulate the growth of hartmannella 3 5 2 diversity patterns of the community structures since several algal otus possessed the majority of abundance as shown in fig 6c the diversity analysis regarding to algae was excluded but bacteria and protozoa were included specifically for the bacteria fig 7 a a total of 125 otus presented in all the fouling layers and the number of shared otus was only 21 for the control p enriched fouling layers which was lower than that for the control n enriched filtration systems 121 otus the number of otus unique to the control fouling layer was 143 which was larger than the n enriched 78 and p enriched fouling layers 40 these suggested that bacterial richness was reduced by the slight increase of nitrogen and phosphorus as indicated visually in the pcoa plot based on bray curtis distance matrix fig 7b the bacterial communities were discernibly separated from each other revealing that the slight increase of nitrogen and phosphorus altered the bacterial community moreover the difference between the control and p enriched bacterial communities was the greatest as indicated by the largest bray curtis dissimilarity median 82 2 fig 7c which was consistent with the observation of the remarkably different structures fig 3 in comparison there was comparatively less difference between the control and n enriched bacterial communities as witnessed by the low median of bray curtis dissimilarity 64 9 which was consistent with the apparent similar morphological structures of the fouling layers from the sem images with respect to protozoa only one otu was shared across all the fouling layers and an overlap of 7 otus was observed in the control p enriched fouling layers which was greater than that shared between the control and n enriched fouling layers 4 otus fig 7d moreover it was found that the protozoan communities were distinctly separated by pcoa 1 and pcoa 2 as demonstrated by the pcoa plot drawn on the basis of bray curtis distance matrix fig 7e according to the calculated bray curtis dissimilarity the difference between the control and p enriched protozoan communities was less than that between the control and n enriched communities fig 7f which was in contrast to the case of the bacterial communities fig 7c 3 6 mechanisms underlying the divergent formation of membrane biofouling by nitrogen and phosphorus acting as essential nutrients for the growth of microbes the nitrogen and phosphorus play a crucial role in the membrane fouling as revealed by the results described in the above sections the accumulated fouling layers exhibited distinctly discrepancies in morphological structure compositional constituents microbial consortia and filtration performance when exposed to slightly elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the membrane feed water with regard to the associated mechanisms these are discussed as follows 3 6 1 variation in the concentration of nutrients begat shift in community structure as demonstrated by a previous investigation the changes in the structure of bacterial and protistan communities were mainly due to nutrients rather than other environmental variables li et al 2018 consistent with this it was also discovered in this study through the use of high throughput sequencing technology that the bacteria and micro eukaryotes displayed discrepant communities shift as feeding on different concentrations of nutrients fig 6 with slightly elevated nitrogen and phosphorus the proportion of proteobacteria presented an increased trend however the dosed nitrogen and phosphorus exerted contrasting influences on the cyanobacteria showing no pronounced effect with nitrogen but substantial inhibition with phosphorus fig 6a further analysis revealed that the slight increase in phosphorus decreased the abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria genus arthronema but dramatically increased the proportion of xanthobacter phylum proteobacteria this was attributed to the adaptability of xanthobacter to survive under the elevated phosphorus conditions in contrast to arthronema however when exposed to the increase of nitrogen the filamentous arthronema was predominant which was evident from the sem images fig 3d e collectively the results indicated that the slight elevation of nitrogen and phosphorus selectively promoted or inhibited the growth of bacteria and thus had a direct impact on the bacterial community the slight elevation in nitrogen stimulated the growth of chlorellales while under the p enriched condition the sphaeropleales was dominant in the algal survival and growth the heterotrophic bacteria were reported to play a ubiquitous role and complex communication and nutrient exchange were involved in the algae bacteria interactions ramanan et al 2016 in this sense the induced algal community was correlated to the presence of bacteria in the confined space fouling layer to some extent unfortunately probably because of being embedded by the large amounts of eps in the fouling layer variations in algal community were not directly observed via sem given that published studies focusing on the relationship between algal community and fouling layer formation are scarce further in depth investigation is warranted in the future since protozoa are important predators and main consumers of bacteria and algae xiong et al 2018 the interaction among them was suspected to constrain respective abundance based on the findings the dominant species across all the fouling layers was amoebae which were capable of establishing and stimulating the productivity of biofilms by adhering to surfaces and secreting metabolic substances such as glucopolysaccharides and proteins gomes et al 2020 when exposed to the slight elevation of nutrient concentration the genus vannella was enriched by nitrogen while members of hartmannella were enhanced by phosphorus a previous study also proposed that the protozoan composition was affected by nutrient concentrations and furthermore the algal shift exerted an influence on the protozoan community xu et al 2005 therefore apart from the direct impacts arising from an increase of nutrients the complicated interplay between the algal and protozoan communities were also suspected to influence the formation of divergent fouling layer 3 6 2 induced discrepancy in fouling layers drove disparity in the filtration performance as described previously the morphological structure of the fouling layers changed with the change in nutrient concentration together with the bacterial and micro eukaryotic communities which was indicated by the sem micrographs fig 3 previous studies also discovered that the fouling layers presented different morphologies under varying nutrients conditions and further investigations were performed based on this finding desmond et al 2018a 2018b in this study divergent fouling layers were formed by the slightly elevated nitrogen and phosphorus with the phosphorus having a major impact on the fouling layer structure compared to the control the comparable structures of the n enriched and control fouling layers exhibited similar permeate flux and hydraulic resistance while the divergent morphology of the p enriched fouling layer demonstrated an approximately 2 fold greater hydraulic resistance than the control thus the morphological structure of the fouling layer played an important role in determining the hydraulic resistance in accordance with the statements issued by desmond et al 2018a since all the fouling layers were heterogeneous it is likely that the thickness played a substantial role in the discrepancy of filtration performance desmond et al 2018a clearly the p enriched fouling layer was characterized by the highest thickness and greatest hydraulic resistance with respect to the removal efficiency of nom the heterogeneous p enriched fouling layer performed the best for all the fluorescent regions in contrast the n enriched fouling layer exhibited a poor performance displaying an increase of fulvic acid and humic acid like substances for the filtrate these results further demonstrated that divergent morphology of the fouling layers can lead to differences in the removal of nom components 4 conclusion in this study the respective role of slightly elevated nitrogen ca 0 5 mg l 1 and phosphorus ca 0 1 mg l 1 in membrane biofouling formation for drinking water treatment was investigated via a gdm filtration process the results revealed that the slightly elevated nitrogen did not dramatically decrease the permeate flux but approximately 50 of the permeate flux was reduced by the elevated phosphorus the formed fouling layer was thickened by about 4 fold due to the slight elevation in phosphorus which performed the best in the removal of fluorescent nom by contrast the elevated nitrogen did not markedly change the morphology of the fouling layer as a consequence there was a similar increase of the fulvic acid and humic acid like substances in the filtrate of the n enriched filtration and the control the slightly elevated nitrogen and phosphorus increased the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides and altered the bacterial algal and protozoan communities the filamentous arthronema dominated the n enriched fouling layer but was reduced to nearly zero in the p enriched fouling layer and the genus xanthobacter which was capable of secreting large amounts of eps was enhanced the growth of algae chlorellales was stimulated by the elevated nitrogen while for the p enriched condition the sphaeropleales occupied the dominance for protozoa vannella was enhanced by the elevation in nitrogen whereas members of hartmannella were enhanced by elevated phosphorus eqs 1 3 supporting information the supporting information includes 3 figures and 2 tables which supplement the results in the
