this study the occurrence composition and distribution of mps in the influents and effluents from 9 domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps 5 industrial wwtps wastewater of 10 industrial plants 4 livestock farms and 4 fish ponds in china were investigated water samples were enzymatically treated followed by digestion with hydrogen peroxide and density separation mps were characterized using micro raman spectroscopy and were categorized by shape size and color results showed that mp abundance in the influents and effluents of domestic wwtps was 18 890 and 6 26 n l 1 respectively with the removal efficiency ranging from 35 to 98 the effluents of industrial wwtps contained 6 12 n l 1 and the levels of mps in the wastewater of industrial plants livestock farms and fish ponds were in the range of 8 23 8 40 and 13 27 n l 1 respectively no significant differences of mp abundance were demonstrated among effluents or wastewater of different sources indicating they all constitute sources of mp pollution polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polystyrene ps made up almost 83 of the total mps fragment and film were the most abundant shapes and the majority of mps were smaller than 500 μm polymer type and shape in different sources did not vary statistically however there were slight differences among different sources concerning size and color of mps this study could fill mp data gaps

microplastic characteristics micro raman 1 introduction plastics were invented 110 years ago and have become the most extensively used materials in human life the biggest application is packaging followed by consumer items building materials automotive products electrical products and agriculture applications plasticseurope 2016 due to the inert nature plastics were initially thought to be harmless to organisms and large quantities of plastics were discharged into the environment especially aquatic environment it is estimated that 4900 million metric tons of plastic wastes were released into environment from 1950 to 2015 which induced a series of environmental problems geyer et al 2017 plastics may threaten health of fish and birds through entanglement and ingestion wilcox et al 2015 moreover large plastics are broken into small pieces through physical processes nowadays microplastics mps plastics that smaller than 5 mm have been detected globally in the environment extensive researches on detection of mps in seawater have been performed chubarenko et al 2016 desforges et al 2014 obbard et al 2014 it is estimated that at least 5 25 trillion mps are floating in the world s oceans and mp levels in deep sea water were comparable to surface values courtene jones et al 2017 eriksen et al 2014 in addition mps have been detected in freshwater around the world wong et al 2020 the density of mps in lake bolsena in central italy was 0 82 4 42 n m 3 fischer et al 2016 the abundance of mps in antuã river in portugal ranged from 58 to 1265 n m 3 rodrigues et al 2018 the concentration of mps in surface water of pearl river in china varied from 397 to 7924 n m 3 lin et al 2018 due to their small size mps are readily available for ingestion by aquatic organism which may exert various adverse effects on organisms such as decreasing feeding inhibiting growth development and breeding and even causing death besseling et al 2014 boerger et al 2010 cole et al 2015 huerta lwanga et al 2016 lee et al 2013 sussarellu et al 2016 mps can be subdivided into primary and secondary mps primary mps are directly produced in a micro size range such as pellets used in cosmetics and personal care products and secondary mps fragmented from large plastic materials under environmental stress approximately 80 of mps entered in marine were derived from terrestrial sources however pollution from land based sources received insufficient attention andrady 2011 previous studies have proved personal care products and domestic washing were significant sources of mp pollution browne et al 2011 de falco et al 2018a de falco et al 2019 de falco et al 2018b de falco et al 2018c fendall and sewell 2009 gregory 1996 mps in personal care products and synthetic fibers spread from domestic washing may directly go down household drains and end up at wastewater treatment plants wwtps it has been found that the mp concentrations significantly increased downstream of wwtps on the raritan river in the united states indicating the effluent of wwtps is a vital route for mps to enter freshwater environment estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 besides industrial plants were thought to be a potential contributor of mps lechner et al 2014 mani et al 2015 aquaculture have been regarded as a crucial sea based source of mps hinojosa and thiel 2009 however detailed information on mp pollution deriving from industry and aquaculture were scarce taihu lake basin is one of the most industrialized regions in china with high population density wujin district of changzhou city situated in the northwestern of taihu lake basin is one of the most polluted areas in this study we detected the occurrence composition and distribution of mps in the influents and effluents from 9 domestic wwtps and 5 industrial wwtps the wastewater of 10 industrial plants 4 livestock farms and 4 fish ponds in wujin district changzhou samples were enzyme digested and then subjected to wet peroxide oxidation and density separation mps were characterized using raman spectroscopy and categorized according to their size shape and color the removal efficiencies of mps in domestic wwtps were assessed the abundance and characteristics of mps obtained from different sources were compared this study can help identify the potential sources of mps which was necessary to tackle the aquatic pollution problem 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection wwtps industrial plants livestock farms and fish ponds were selected to investigate occurrence and characteristics of mps details on sampling sites are displayed in fig 1 and table s1 influents and effluents of 9 domestic wwtps w1 w9 effluents of 5 industrial wwtps iw1 iw5 wastewaters of 10 industrial plants i1 i10 4 livestock farms a1 a4 and 4 fish ponds f1 f4 were collected in march 2019 all wwtps applied secondary treatment and the specific treatment technology were shown in table 2 two liters of water were sampled in a clean and sealed glass jar and were transported to laboratory for further analysis 2 2 pretreatment samples were pretreated according to the method of previous research with some modification löder et al 2017 in brief organic compounds were digested with specific enzymes and h2o2 and inorganic compounds were removed from density separation procedure firstly 1 l of wastewater was vacuum filtered through a stainless steel sieve 90 mm diameter mesh size 13 μm about 50 ml of 10 w w sodium dodecyl sulfate sds was used to wash the residues from the sieve creating a suspension in a covered glass jar sample was incubated on a shaker 40 rpm at 50 c for 1 d after removal of sds by filtration 50 ml of protease buffer 1100 u ml 1 in 1m tris hcl ph 9 was added and sample was incubated at 50 c for 1 d with agitation 40 rpm then sample was treated with cellulose buffer 30 u ml 1 in 1m naoac ph 5 at 40 c and shaken at 40 rpm for 3 d the cellulose buffer was renewed every day due to its easy deactivation löder et al 2017 subsequently amylase buffer 40 u ml 1 in 1m naoac ph 5 was added and sample was incubated at 50 c for 1 d with shaking at 40 rpm after filtration residues retained in sieve were subjected to wet peroxide oxidation wpo to digest organic matter sample was digested with 20 ml 30 h2o2 in the presence of 20 mg ml 1 feso4 fenton s reagent at room temperature for 2 h tagg et al 2017 after vacuum filtration sample was treated with chitinase buffer 50 u ml 1 in 1m naoac ph 5 at 37 c for 1 d with shaking at 40 rpm after filtration the sample was subjected to wpo for a second time afterwards residues were suspended in saturated zncl2 solution with a density of 1 6 g cm 3 after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was passed over the sieve and resuspended in ultrapure water finally sample was filtered under vacuum onto a sterile mixed cellulose ester filter 47 mm diameter pose size 0 45 μm whatman filter was placed in clean and covered glass petri dishes dried in a desiccator and kept at 4 c until analysis 2 3 analysis filter was visually inspected under an optical microscope xyh 3a shanghai shangguang microscope china 90x potential mps were picked up and transferred on a titanium sheet 2 5 cm 7 5 cm 1 mm thickness and examined by micro raman spectroscopy renishaw invia raman uk spectra of mps were analyzed and identified by software knowitall informatics system bio rad cambridge ma usa the detected mps were counted and photographed the quantification was presented as number of mps per liter of water n l 1 and mps were sorted into categories according to shape fragments similar width and length films very thin particle pellets spherical granules and fibers significantly longer than width two dimensions length and width were measured and mps were assigned to six categories 100 μm 100 200 μm 200 500 μm 500 1000 μm 1000 2000 μm 2000 5000 μm based on the length besides mps were categorized into different color transparent white yellow blue gray green and pink 2 4 method validation recovery experiment was conducted in triplicates with 1 l of ultra pure water spiked with a known number of pe 400 μm and pvc 600 μm pellets after pretreatment obtained mps on filter were visually identified and counted 2 5 contamination prevention the following steps were taken to reduce the potential contamination occurring in the laboratory clean cotton lab coats and latex gloves were worn during experiment avoiding the use of plastic tools as much as possible work surfaces were cleaned with alcohol before experiment glassware and stainless steels sieve were rinsed with ethanol and ultrapure water before use three blank samples consisting of 10 l of ultra pure water were processed concurrently with wastewater 2 6 statistical analysis all data were initially tested for normality and homogeneity of variance if data were normally distributed anova with a dunnett s test was utilized for non normally distributed data a nonparametric kruskal wallis anova test was applied for statistical comparison principle component analysis pca was undertaken to determine the variables which accounted for most of the variations the tests were performed in spss and origin and the level of statistical significance was set at p 0 05 the correlations analysis between the abundance and characteristics of mps type size shape and color were conduct by spearman correlation 3 results and discussion 3 1 method validation good recoveries of mps from the spiked water samples were obtained with values ranging from 80 to 100 suggesting the method is reliable for mp extraction and quantification none of mps were found in the blank samples indicating the contamination occurring in the laboratory could be negligible 3 2 mps in influents of domestic wwtps as shown in table 1 mp abundance in the influents of domestic wwtps w1 w9 varied from 18 to 890 n l 1 with a median value of 41 n l 1 identified mps comprised of 6 polymers polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyamide pa typical optical microscopy images and raman spectra of mps and standards were provided in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively the polymer type size and color distribution of mps in influents of each wwtp were presented in fig s1 as displayed in fig 4 a pe was found predominantly 35 on average followed by ps 28 and pp 22 with small contributions from pa 9 pet 6 and pvc 1 the majority of mps were less than 500 μm representing almost of 89 by number mps in the size range 200 500 μm 37 were slightly more prevalent than those in the range of 100 200 μm 31 fig 4b film 53 was the most frequent type followed by fragment 29 with minor proportions arising from pellet 10 and fiber 8 fig 4c transparent mps were the most abundant 72 followed by white 20 and colored 8 fig 4d it should be noticed that the w2 exhibited exceptionally high level of mps in influent table 1 pellet mps which were generally produced as industrial raw materials of plastics were discovered to be the dominant type in w2 60 fig s1a it was found that influent of w2 consists of 70 household wastewater and 30 industrial wastewater which came from several industries including textile plastic food processing steel processing machine manufacturing communicating equipment manufacturing and chemical industries thus the relatively high abundance and frequency of pellets in w2 influent were probably due to plastic industries in w2 service area similarly pellet mps comprised 77 of the total mps in austrian danube owing to the nearby plastic production industries lechner et al 2014 currently only few studies were available on mp contamination in the influents of wwtps table 3 a study conducted at seven wwtps in netherlands discovered that the concentrations of mps in influents varied from 68 up to 910 n l 1 leslie et al 2017 dris et al founded the abundance of mps in the influent of one wwtp in france was 260 320 n l 1 dris et al 2015 reported levels of mps in the influents of two wwtps in united states ranged from 93 to 133 n l 1 michielssen et al 2016 however mps were identified by visual observation in the majority of these researches which may lead to an overestimation of the abundance in our study mps were characterized by micro raman spectroscopy and the abundance of mps in the influents of domestic wwtps was in the same order of magnitude as previous studies in which mps were identified by ft ir and micro raman the average concentrations of mps in the influents of wwtps in finland and scotland were 57 6 and 15 7 n l 1 respectively lares et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 we found most mps in the influents of wwtps were determined smaller than 500 μm however lares et al reported approximately 70 of mps had sizes above 500 μm lares et al 2018 this may be partly ascribed to the different mesh size mps smaller than the mesh size 250 μm could pass through the mesh resulting in a higher size detection limit compared with this study mesh size of 13 μm mps obtained from influents were mainly composed of pe pp ps pet and pa which were generally used in consumer products as well as packing geyer et al 2017 this was consistent with those previously reported lares et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 3 3 mps in effluents of domestic wwtps it can be seen from table 1 that mps were detected in the effluents of all domestic wwtps w1 w9 with abundance ranging from 6 to 26 n l 1 the mp abundance in the effluents significantly decreased compared to influents kruskal wallis anova p 0 01 indicating mps can be efficiently removed in wwtps all wwtps applied secondary treatment and the removal efficiency table 2 varied from 35 to 98 with the median percentage of 56 the removal efficiency varied greatly among different wwtps and there were no significant differences in mp removal efficiency among different secondary treatment technologies p 0 05 indicating the removal efficiency may be affected by treatment technology as well as operational conditions the differences in mp characteristics between the influents and effluents were investigated table s2 significant lower abundance of certain mps were found in effluents p 0 05 however distribution of type shape and size of mps in the effluents resembled influents p 0 05 suggesting no preferential removal of mps in the wwtps related to the type shape and size occurred thus the significant decrease in specific mp abundance probably due to their relatively high level in the influents quite a few researchers have paid attention to the abundance of mps in the effluent of secondary wwtps table 3 some studies simply identified mps through visual analysis which may overestimate mp levels dris et al 2015 dubaish and liebezeit 2013 leslie et al 2017 previously reported abundance of ftir identified mps in the effluents of secondary wwtps ranged from 0 to 7 5 n l 1 which was lower than our current study carr et al 2016 dyachenko et al 2017 lares et al 2018 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 this maybe attribuated to several reasons such as influent abundance specific treatment technology detection size limit and population density mps obtained from effluents here were mostly transparent smaller than 500 μm and composed of ps pe pp pa and pet which were similar to the previous studies mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a ziajahromi et al 2017 though treatment technologies are not designed to remove mps the majority of researchers suggested wwtps were efficient at removing mps from influents with the removal efficiency above 98 carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 however even the tertiary treatment could not completely remove mps sutton et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a 2017b in this study the removal efficiency varied from 35 to 98 and was affected by treatment technology as well as operational conditions similarly a study in netherlands reported the removal efficiency of 7 wwtps ranged from 11 to 94 leslie et al 2017 previous study found the shape and size of the mps can also influence their removal efficiency michielssen et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 sutton et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017b however in this study no preferential removal related to the type shape and size occurred which was in accordance with earlier study simon et al 2018 3 4 mps in effluents of industrial wwtps and wastewater of industrial plants industrial plants were generally considered as potential sources of mps lechner et al 2014 mani et al 2015 however no data was available for the levels of mps in industrial wastewater and for assessing their contribution to mp contamination most industrial wastewater was treated in wwtps and some was treated in industry and subsequently directly discharged into receiving waters effluents of 5 industrial wwtps and 10 industrial plants were investigated in this study changzhou is a city based on textile mechanical chemical and electroplating industry thus the influents of industrial wwtps mainly came from textile iw1 iw4 machine manufacturing iw2 chemical iw3 steel iw5 industries wastewater and industrial plants included chemical i1 i2 i3 i6 electroplating i4 i5 i8 i9 and machine manufacturing i7 i10 industries as can be seen in table 1 the mp abundance in the effluents of industrial wwtps iw1 iw5 and wastewater of industrial plants i1 i10 ranged from 6 12 and 8 23 n l 1 respectively the polymer type size and color distribution of mps in effluents of each industrial wwtp and wastewater of each industrial plant were demonstrated in fig s2 the differences in mp abundance and characteristics between effluents of industrial wwtps and wastewater of industrial plants were investigated table s4 which did not vary statistically p 0 05 suggesting industries constitute sources of mp contamination due to extensive application of plastics in various industries besides the mp levels especially ps levels of wastewater from chemical industries i1 i2 i3 i6 were significantly higher than that from electroplating industries i4 i5 i8 i9 fig 5 b and table s3 p 0 05 which might be because ps were used as raw materials in chemical industries 3 5 mps in wastewater of livestock farms and fish ponds whether agricultural wastewater is a source of mp pollution still remains unclear thus the wastewater of four livestock farms a1 a4 were examined in this research as represented in table 1 mps were detected in all wastewater of livestock farms with the abundance varied between 8 a1 and a4 and 40 a3 n l 1 pe 38 and pa 32 comprised predominant portions followed by ps 14 with minor fractions arising from pp 8 and pet 8 fig 4a fig s3 displayed the polymer type size and color distribution of mps in wastewater of each livestock farm it is noteworthy that a3 exhibited high abundance of pa in wastewater which may be due to the usage of nylon bags and films in addition to directly flowing into the receiving water wastewater of livestock farms may be used to irrigate farmlands consequently bringing mp contamination to terrestrial environment all wastewater collected from fish ponds contained mps which were found at levels ranging from 13 f3 to 27 f2 n l 1 the polymer type size and color distribution of mps in wastewater of each fish ponds were presented in fig s3 transparent 73 was the most frequent color followed by white 18 with minor proportions arising from green 4 yellow 3 and gray 3 fig 4d 3 6 comparison of domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources the differences in mp characteristics among effluents or wastewater of domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources were investigated table s5 wastewater of fish ponds exhibited higher abundance of pe and mps in the size of 200 500 μm than other effluents and wastewater p 0 05 which might result from the broken plastic fishing gear without appropriate treatment significant higher abundance and percentage of mps smaller than 100 μm were found in wastewater from industrial sources p 0 05 which might owing to small plastic pellet industrial raw materals the two dimensional size of mps in various effluents and wastewater was further compared to explore the difference fig s4 the two dimensional plots for mp size in each source were presented in fig s5 the majority of mps were located around the line y x indicating most of mps had similar length and width no significant differences of mps size among wastewater from domestic agricultural and aquacultural sources were found however wastewater of industrial source contained mps with long length around 1000 μm and small width around 30 μm which might be the result of the industrial chopping of plastic materials principle component analysis pca was applied to estimate which combination of variables best explain the variability among different sources the mp characteristics type size shape and color of each sampling site were compared to the mp abundance fig s6 and percentage fig s7 polymer type and shape in different sources did not vary statistically figs s6a s6c s7a and s7c which may be attributed to their versatility in innumerable applications however there were differences among different sources concerning size and color of mps the pca plot showed the color of mps from aquacultural source was different from agricultural source fig s6d which may attributed to the colored plastic buoys fishing ropes and nets the size distribution of mps from industrial source was different from domestic and aquacultural sources fig s7b which may attributed to small plastic pellet industrial raw materals and the industrial chopping of plastic materials in this study the occurrence and distribution of mps in effluents or wastewater from domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources were investigated and compared no apparent discrepancies of mp abundance were demonstrated among different sources though there were slight differences in mp characterstics among different sources it is still hard to track the sources of mps from its characterstics due to the extensive application of plastics in various applications no significant differences in polymer type and shape among different sources were observed the size and color may varied among different sources however the size of mps may decrease due to physical forces such as waves and sand friction in the marine environment and the rate of fragmentation is still unknown law and thompson 2014 the color of mps may change by ultraviolet oxidation previous research found mps in the lakes and wwtps had similar characterstics with those in facial cleansers and toothpaste respectively carr et al 2016 eriksen et al 2013 however more and more countries have banned the production and sale of personal care products containing mps the current microbeads in personal care products were generally made of cellulose derivatives and polyactide resins habib et al 2020 it is still of great necessity to examine the characteristics of mps because their potential negative effects vary with their shape size and color for instance mps smaller than 500 μm were more likely to be ingested by sea cucumbers graham and thompson 2009 some visual predators in aquatic environment may ingest mps due to their color resembling prey wright et al 2013 in this study pe and pp were the most abundant polymers in all samples which could be explained by that they were the most widely used plastics and composed 36 and 21 of global plastic production respectively geyer et al 2017 there was a significant correlation between pe and mp abundance r 0 409 p 0 05 indicating pe could be regarded as an indicator of mp pollution level the majority of mps in all water samples were fragments and films which come from fragmentation of large plastics previous studies found synthetic fibers spread from domestic washing was an important source of mp pollution browne et al 2011 de falco et al 2018c the absence of fibers in this study may be because that fiber passed vertically through the sieve 13 μm during several filtration steps mintenig et al 2017 as a matter of fact it is difficult to distinguish synthetic fibers from natural fibers such as cotton and linen when exploring mp abundance many studies included the natural fibers during the quantification which could account for 66 in some wastewater samples talvitie et al 2017b micro raman can theoretically identify particles as small as 1 μm however only mps whose length and width both greater than 13 μm can be captured and retained by sieve in this research and the lowest size of mp detected in this study was 16 μm therefore mps with a diameter larger than 16 μm were effectively detected and analyzed in this study most mps were determined smaller than 500 μm which may be ingested by aquatic organism once entered aquatic environment transparent mps were predominant in all water samples followed by white gray and colored mps three dyes in various polymers were detected in our study including irgalith blue gamboge and hostasol green g k these characteristics were in agreement with previous studies in which mps were obtained from surface water sediments and organisms collected from taihu lake su et al 2016 2018 the findings indicated effluents of domestic wwtps industrial wwtps wastewater of industrial plants livestock farms and fish ponds were all potential sources of mp pollution which could help understanding mp sources and further controling its pollution 4 conclusion plastics are frequently utilized in various applications in our daily life leading to mp pollution in the environment the occurrence and characteristics of mps in domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources domestic wwtps industrial wwtps industrial plants livestock farms and fish ponds of wastewater in changzhou china were examined in this study the results suggested that mp abundance in the influents and effluents of domestic wwtps were 18 890 and 6 26 n l 1 respectively with the removal efficiency ranging from 35 to 98 no significant differences of mp abundance were demonstrated among effluents or wastewater from domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources indicating they were all potential sources of mp pollution polymer type and shape in different sources did not vary statistically however there were small differences among different sources concerning the size and color of mps our work emphasizes the mp pollution in domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural wastewater and provides new insights into the sources of mps into

sealed glass jar and were transported to laboratory for further analysis 2 2 pretreatment samples were pretreated according to the method of previous research with some modification löder et al 2017 in brief organic compounds were digested with specific enzymes and h2o2 and inorganic compounds were removed from density separation procedure firstly 1 l of wastewater was vacuum filtered through a stainless steel sieve 90 mm diameter mesh size 13 μm about 50 ml of 10 w w sodium dodecyl sulfate sds was used to wash the residues from the sieve creating a suspension in a covered glass jar sample was incubated on a shaker 40 rpm at 50 c for 1 d after removal of sds by filtration 50 ml of protease buffer 1100 u ml 1 in 1m tris hcl ph 9 was added and sample was incubated at 50 c for 1 d with agitation 40 rpm then sample was treated with cellulose buffer 30 u ml 1 in 1m naoac ph 5 at 40 c and shaken at 40 rpm for 3 d the cellulose buffer was renewed every day due to its easy deactivation löder et al 2017 subsequently amylase buffer 40 u ml 1 in 1m naoac ph 5 was added and sample was incubated at 50 c for 1 d with shaking at 40 rpm after filtration residues retained in sieve were subjected to wet peroxide oxidation wpo to digest organic matter sample was digested with 20 ml 30 h2o2 in the presence of 20 mg ml 1 feso4 fenton s reagent at room temperature for 2 h tagg et al 2017 after vacuum filtration sample was treated with chitinase buffer 50 u ml 1 in 1m naoac ph 5 at 37 c for 1 d with shaking at 40 rpm after filtration the sample was subjected to wpo for a second time afterwards residues were suspended in saturated zncl2 solution with a density of 1 6 g cm 3 after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was passed over the sieve and resuspended in ultrapure water finally sample was filtered under vacuum onto a sterile mixed cellulose ester filter 47 mm diameter pose size 0 45 μm whatman filter was placed in clean and covered glass petri dishes dried in a desiccator and kept at 4 c until analysis 2 3 analysis filter was visually inspected under an optical microscope xyh 3a shanghai shangguang microscope china 90x potential mps were picked up and transferred on a titanium sheet 2 5 cm 7 5 cm 1 mm thickness and examined by micro raman spectroscopy renishaw invia raman uk spectra of mps were analyzed and identified by software knowitall informatics system bio rad cambridge ma usa the detected mps were counted and photographed the quantification was presented as number of mps per liter of water n l 1 and mps were sorted into categories according to shape fragments similar width and length films very thin particle pellets spherical granules and fibers significantly longer than width two dimensions length and width were measured and mps were assigned to six categories 100 μm 100 200 μm 200 500 μm 500 1000 μm 1000 2000 μm 2000 5000 μm based on the length besides mps were categorized into different color transparent white yellow blue gray green and pink 2 4 method validation recovery experiment was conducted in triplicates with 1 l of ultra pure water spiked with a known number of pe 400 μm and pvc 600 μm pellets after pretreatment obtained mps on filter were visually identified and counted 2 5 contamination prevention the following steps were taken to reduce the potential contamination occurring in the laboratory clean cotton lab coats and latex gloves were worn during experiment avoiding the use of plastic tools as much as possible work surfaces were cleaned with alcohol before experiment glassware and stainless steels sieve were rinsed with ethanol and ultrapure water before use three blank samples consisting of 10 l of ultra pure water were processed concurrently with wastewater 2 6 statistical analysis all data were initially tested for normality and homogeneity of variance if data were normally distributed anova with a dunnett s test was utilized for non normally distributed data a nonparametric kruskal wallis anova test was applied for statistical comparison principle component analysis pca was undertaken to determine the variables which accounted for most of the variations the tests were performed in spss and origin and the level of statistical significance was set at p 0 05 the correlations analysis between the abundance and characteristics of mps type size shape and color were conduct by spearman correlation 3 results and discussion 3 1 method validation good recoveries of mps from the spiked water samples were obtained with values ranging from 80 to 100 suggesting the method is reliable for mp extraction and quantification none of mps were found in the blank samples indicating the contamination occurring in the laboratory could be negligible 3 2 mps in influents of domestic wwtps as shown in table 1 mp abundance in the influents of domestic wwtps w1 w9 varied from 18 to 890 n l 1 with a median value of 41 n l 1 identified mps comprised of 6 polymers polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyamide pa typical optical microscopy images and raman spectra of mps and standards were provided in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively the polymer type size and color distribution of mps in influents of each wwtp were presented in fig s1 as displayed in fig 4 a pe was found predominantly 35 on average followed by ps 28 and pp 22 with small contributions from pa 9 pet 6 and pvc 1 the majority of mps were less than 500 μm representing almost of 89 by number mps in the size range 200 500 μm 37 were slightly more prevalent than those in the range of 100 200 μm 31 fig 4b film 53 was the most frequent type followed by fragment 29 with minor proportions arising from pellet 10 and fiber 8 fig 4c transparent mps were the most abundant 72 followed by white 20 and colored 8 fig 4d it should be noticed that the w2 exhibited exceptionally high level of mps in influent table 1 pellet mps which were generally produced as industrial raw materials of plastics were discovered to be the dominant type in w2 60 fig s1a it was found that influent of w2 consists of 70 household wastewater and 30 industrial wastewater which came from several industries including textile plastic food processing steel processing machine manufacturing communicating equipment manufacturing and chemical industries thus the relatively high abundance and frequency of pellets in w2 influent were probably due to plastic industries in w2 service area similarly pellet mps comprised 77 of the total mps in austrian danube owing to the nearby plastic production industries lechner et al 2014 currently only few studies were available on mp contamination in the influents of wwtps table 3 a study conducted at seven wwtps in netherlands discovered that the concentrations of mps in influents varied from 68 up to 910 n l 1 leslie et al 2017 dris et al founded the abundance of mps in the influent of one wwtp in france was 260 320 n l 1 dris et al 2015 reported levels of mps in the influents of two wwtps in united states ranged from 93 to 133 n l 1 michielssen et al 2016 however mps were identified by visual observation in the majority of these researches which may lead to an overestimation of the abundance in our study mps were characterized by micro raman spectroscopy and the abundance of mps in the influents of domestic wwtps was in the same order of magnitude as previous studies in which mps were identified by ft ir and micro raman the average concentrations of mps in the influents of wwtps in finland and scotland were 57 6 and 15 7 n l 1 respectively lares et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 we found most mps in the influents of wwtps were determined smaller than 500 μm however lares et al reported approximately 70 of mps had sizes above 500 μm lares et al 2018 this may be partly ascribed to the different mesh size mps smaller than the mesh size 250 μm could pass through the mesh resulting in a higher size detection limit compared with this study mesh size of 13 μm mps obtained from influents were mainly composed of pe pp ps pet and pa which were generally used in consumer products as well as packing geyer et al 2017 this was consistent with those previously reported lares et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 3 3 mps in effluents of domestic wwtps it can be seen from table 1 that mps were detected in the effluents of all domestic wwtps w1 w9 with abundance ranging from 6 to 26 n l 1 the mp abundance in the effluents significantly decreased compared to influents kruskal wallis anova p 0 01 indicating mps can be efficiently removed in wwtps all wwtps applied secondary treatment and the removal efficiency table 2 varied from 35 to 98 with the median percentage of 56 the removal efficiency varied greatly among different wwtps and there were no significant differences in mp removal efficiency among different secondary treatment technologies p 0 05 indicating the removal efficiency may be affected by treatment technology as well as operational conditions the differences in mp characteristics between the influents and effluents were investigated table s2 significant lower abundance of certain mps were found in effluents p 0 05 however distribution of type shape and size of mps in the effluents resembled influents p 0 05 suggesting no preferential removal of mps in the wwtps related to the type shape and size occurred thus the significant decrease in specific mp abundance probably due to their relatively high level in the influents quite a few researchers have paid attention to the abundance of mps in the effluent of secondary wwtps table 3 some studies simply identified mps through visual analysis which may overestimate mp levels dris et al 2015 dubaish and liebezeit 2013 leslie et al 2017 previously reported abundance of ftir identified mps in the effluents of secondary wwtps ranged from 0 to 7 5 n l 1 which was lower than our current study carr et al 2016 dyachenko et al 2017 lares et al 2018 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 this maybe attribuated to several reasons such as influent abundance specific treatment technology detection size limit and population density mps obtained from effluents here were mostly transparent smaller than 500 μm and composed of ps pe pp pa and pet which were similar to the previous studies mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a ziajahromi et al 2017 though treatment technologies are not designed to remove mps the majority of researchers suggested wwtps were efficient at removing mps from influents with the removal efficiency above 98 carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 however even the tertiary treatment could not completely remove mps sutton et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a 2017b in this study the removal efficiency varied from 35 to 98 and was affected by treatment technology as well as operational conditions similarly a study in netherlands reported the removal efficiency of 7 wwtps ranged from 11 to 94 leslie et al 2017 previous study found the shape and size of the mps can also influence their removal efficiency michielssen et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 sutton et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017b however in this study no preferential removal related to the type shape and size occurred which was in accordance with earlier study simon et al 2018 3 4 mps in effluents of industrial wwtps and wastewater of industrial plants industrial plants were generally considered as potential sources of mps lechner et al 2014 mani et al 2015 however no data was available for the levels of mps in industrial wastewater and for assessing their contribution to mp contamination most industrial wastewater was treated in wwtps and some was treated in industry and subsequently directly discharged into receiving waters effluents of 5 industrial wwtps and 10 industrial plants were investigated in this study changzhou is a city based on textile mechanical chemical and electroplating industry thus the influents of industrial wwtps mainly came from textile iw1 iw4 machine manufacturing iw2 chemical iw3 steel iw5 industries wastewater and industrial plants included chemical i1 i2 i3 i6 electroplating i4 i5 i8 i9 and machine manufacturing i7 i10 industries as can be seen in table 1 the mp abundance in the effluents of industrial wwtps iw1 iw5 and wastewater of industrial plants i1 i10 ranged from 6 12 and 8 23 n l 1 respectively the polymer type size and color distribution of mps in effluents of each industrial wwtp and wastewater of each industrial plant were demonstrated in fig s2 the differences in mp abundance and characteristics between effluents of industrial wwtps and wastewater of industrial plants were investigated table s4 which did not vary statistically p 0 05 suggesting industries constitute sources of mp contamination due to extensive application of plastics in various industries besides the mp levels especially ps levels of wastewater from chemical industries i1 i2 i3 i6 were significantly higher than that from electroplating industries i4 i5 i8 i9 fig 5 b and table s3 p 0 05 which might be because ps were used as raw materials in chemical industries 3 5 mps in wastewater of livestock farms and fish ponds whether agricultural wastewater is a source of mp pollution still remains unclear thus the wastewater of four livestock farms a1 a4 were examined in this research as represented in table 1 mps were detected in all wastewater of livestock farms with the abundance varied between 8 a1 and a4 and 40 a3 n l 1 pe 38 and pa 32 comprised predominant portions followed by ps 14 with minor fractions arising from pp 8 and pet 8 fig 4a fig s3 displayed the polymer type size and color distribution of mps in wastewater of each livestock farm it is noteworthy that a3 exhibited high abundance of pa in wastewater which may be due to the usage of nylon bags and films in addition to directly flowing into the receiving water wastewater of livestock farms may be used to irrigate farmlands consequently bringing mp contamination to terrestrial environment all wastewater collected from fish ponds contained mps which were found at levels ranging from 13 f3 to 27 f2 n l 1 the polymer type size and color distribution of mps in wastewater of each fish ponds were presented in fig s3 transparent 73 was the most frequent color followed by white 18 with minor proportions arising from green 4 yellow 3 and gray 3 fig 4d 3 6 comparison of domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources the differences in mp characteristics among effluents or wastewater of domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources were investigated table s5 wastewater of fish ponds exhibited higher abundance of pe and mps in the size of 200 500 μm than other effluents and wastewater p 0 05 which might result from the broken plastic fishing gear without appropriate treatment significant higher abundance and percentage of mps smaller than 100 μm were found in wastewater from industrial sources p 0 05 which might owing to small plastic pellet industrial raw materals the two dimensional size of mps in various effluents and wastewater was further compared to explore the difference fig s4 the two dimensional plots for mp size in each source were presented in fig s5 the majority of mps were located around the line y x indicating most of mps had similar length and width no significant differences of mps size among wastewater from domestic agricultural and aquacultural sources were found however wastewater of industrial source contained mps with long length around 1000 μm and small width around 30 μm which might be the result of the industrial chopping of plastic materials principle component analysis pca was applied to estimate which combination of variables best explain the variability among different sources the mp characteristics type size shape and color of each sampling site were compared to the mp abundance fig s6 and percentage fig s7 polymer type and shape in different sources did not vary statistically figs s6a s6c s7a and s7c which may be attributed to their versatility in innumerable applications however there were differences among different sources concerning size and color of mps the pca plot showed the color of mps from aquacultural source was different from agricultural source fig s6d which may attributed to the colored plastic buoys fishing ropes and nets the size distribution of mps from industrial source was different from domestic and aquacultural sources fig s7b which may attributed to small plastic pellet industrial raw materals and the industrial chopping of plastic materials in this study the occurrence and distribution of mps in effluents or wastewater from domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources were investigated and compared no apparent discrepancies of mp abundance were demonstrated among different sources though there were slight differences in mp characterstics among different sources it is still hard to track the sources of mps from its characterstics due to the extensive application of plastics in various applications no significant differences in polymer type and shape among different sources were observed the size and color may varied among different sources however the size of mps may decrease due to physical forces such as waves and sand friction in the marine environment and the rate of fragmentation is still unknown law and thompson 2014 the color of mps may change by ultraviolet oxidation previous research found mps in the lakes and wwtps had similar characterstics with those in facial cleansers and toothpaste respectively carr et al 2016 eriksen et al 2013 however more and more countries have banned the production and sale of personal care products containing mps the current microbeads in personal care products were generally made of cellulose derivatives and polyactide resins habib et al 2020 it is still of great necessity to examine the characteristics of mps because their potential negative effects vary with their shape size and color for instance mps smaller than 500 μm were more likely to be ingested by sea cucumbers graham and thompson 2009 some visual predators in aquatic environment may ingest mps due to their color resembling prey wright et al 2013 in this study pe and pp were the most abundant polymers in all samples which could be explained by that they were the most widely used plastics and composed 36 and 21 of global plastic production respectively geyer et al 2017 there was a significant correlation between pe and mp abundance r 0 409 p 0 05 indicating pe could be regarded as an indicator of mp pollution level the majority of mps in all water samples were fragments and films which come from fragmentation of large plastics previous studies found synthetic fibers spread from domestic washing was an important source of mp pollution browne et al 2011 de falco et al 2018c the absence of fibers in this study may be because that fiber passed vertically through the sieve 13 μm during several filtration steps mintenig et al 2017 as a matter of fact it is difficult to distinguish synthetic fibers from natural fibers such as cotton and linen when exploring mp abundance many studies included the natural fibers during the quantification which could account for 66 in some wastewater samples talvitie et al 2017b micro raman can theoretically identify particles as small as 1 μm however only mps whose length and width both greater than 13 μm can be captured and retained by sieve in this research and the lowest size of mp detected in this study was 16 μm therefore mps with a diameter larger than 16 μm were effectively detected and analyzed in this study most mps were determined smaller than 500 μm which may be ingested by aquatic organism once entered aquatic environment transparent mps were predominant in all water samples followed by white gray and colored mps three dyes in various polymers were detected in our study including irgalith blue gamboge and hostasol green g k these characteristics were in agreement with previous studies in which mps were obtained from surface water sediments and organisms collected from taihu lake su et al 2016 2018 the findings indicated effluents of domestic wwtps industrial wwtps wastewater of industrial plants livestock farms and fish ponds were all potential sources of mp pollution which could help understanding mp sources and further controling its pollution 4 conclusion plastics are frequently utilized in various applications in our daily life leading to mp pollution in the environment the occurrence and characteristics of mps in domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources domestic wwtps industrial wwtps industrial plants livestock farms and fish ponds of wastewater in changzhou china were examined in this study the results suggested that mp abundance in the influents and effluents of domestic wwtps were 18 890 and 6 26 n l 1 respectively with the removal efficiency ranging from 35 to 98 no significant differences of mp abundance were demonstrated among effluents or wastewater from domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural sources indicating they were all potential sources of mp pollution polymer type and shape in different sources did not vary statistically however there were small differences among different sources concerning the size and color of mps our work emphasizes the mp pollution in domestic industrial agricultural and aquacultural wastewater and provides new insights into the sources of mps into

17791,concrete corrosion as a major issue in sewer management has attracted considerable research in comparison the corrosion of reinforcing steel bar rebar is not well understood particularly fundamental knowledge of rebar corrosion and its interactions with concrete corrosion cracking is largely lacking this study investigated rebar corrosion and concrete degradation using reinforced concrete coupons exposed in a pilot sewer system the physical chemical corrosion characteristics were investigated in local regions the nature of rebar rusts was analyzed using the advanced mineral analytical techniques including scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and x ray diffraction xrd further the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete corrosion cracking were elucidated by characterizing the microstructure and element distribution in interfacial areas using mineral liberation analysis mla the rebar corrosion products were found to be iron oxides oxyhydroxides chlorides sulfides and sulfates the predominant rebar corrosion reactions varied with exposure time and the development of concrete corrosion when concrete corrosion reached rebar surface the cracking of the concrete cover was influenced by multiple effects including the macro cracking induced by the corrosion products expansion and the micro cracking accelerated by the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe derived from rebar rusts at the concrete corrosion front a conceptual model elucidating rebar corrosion and the complex interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation is proposed to support the development of corrosion prevention and refurbishment strategies for reinforced concrete sewers graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer corrosion rebar concrete mineral liberation analysis 1 introduction sewer networks are crucial urban infrastructures in modern society concrete is the most commonly used material particularly for large sewers due to its strength durability and relatively low costs in comparison to other materials such as ductile iron vitrified clay polyvinylchloride composite fiber reinforced polymer and high density polyethylene pipes vahidi et al 2016 corrosion of concrete pipes and related infrastructures such as manholes and pumping station for example is a critical deterioration process in sewers it not only causes loss of concrete mass but also induces cracking and even collapsing of the pipe structure ultimately grengg et al 2018 parker 1945b vollertsen et al 2008 the service life of sewer pipes is greatly shortened by corrosion and cracking accompanied with huge expenses on pipe rehabilitation and replacement an annual expenditure of several billion dollars was estimated for repairing and replacing corroded sewers worldwide which is expected to increase as the aging pipes proceed to fail epa 1991 koch et al 2002 as such an enhanced understanding of the corrosion and cracking of concrete sewers is imperative for extending sewer service life and reducing maintenance expenses concrete corrosion in sewers has attracted considerable research islander et al 1991 jiang et al 2015a joseph et al 2012 parande et al 2006a b parker 1945a b the corrosion process is initiated with the acidification by carbonation co2 and hydrogen sulfide h2s nielsen et al 2012 and then develops to more disruptive corrosion reactions between the cementitious materials and the biogenic sulfuric acid derived from oxidation of h2s present in sewer atmosphere jensen et al 2009 jiang et al 2014a 2015b monteny et al 2000 mori et al 1992 song et al 2019a previous studies on sewer corrosion mainly focus on concrete corrosion however another significant part embedded in concrete i e reinforcing steel bar rebar is also susceptible to corrosion the corrosion of rebars has not attracted a similar level of attention and is poorly understood at present grengg et al 2018 li et al 2017 song et al 2019b in sewers concrete pipes can either be plain or steel reinforced rebars are usually embedded with pipe diameter larger than 0 6 m in order to withhold the external loads and internal pressure joshi 2015 nnadi and lizarazo marriaga 2012 once the concrete cover is cracking or seriously corroded rebar would also suffer from potential corrosion because of the reduced alkalinity attack by aggressive substances through cracks and the direct exposure due to regional concrete scaling fandrich et al 2007 jahani et al 2001 the unique sewer conditions including the high gaseous h2s levels and high humidity altogether make the process more complicated than those in other reinforced concrete structures such as concrete buildings bridge decks marine structures slabs and floors bertolini et al 2013 lu et al 2018 the traditional corrosion of rebar in those reinforced concrete is an electrochemical process that causes the dissolution of iron to form various corrosion products bentur et al 1997 they are mainly composed of iron oxides and hydroxides depending on the levels of oxidation and the availability of moisture in the exposure environment zhao et al 2012 2014 chloride ions are one of the most significant factors to initiate and accelerate rebar corrosion which can penetrate through sound concrete or cracks derived from the external environment ahmad 2003 angst et al 2009 the leaching of alkalis which lowers the ph around rebar can also initiate the rebar corrosion grengg et al 2018 however in reinforced sewers fundamental knowledge of rebar corrosion is largely lacking although a recent study reported that h2s and the biogenic sulfuric acid may not directly participate in rebar corrosion it only investigated rebar covered by uncorroded concrete or exposed to low h2s concentrations 5 ppm song et al 2019b when concrete corrosion reaches the rebar surface or high h2s concentrations are provided the rebar corrosion reactions and products may be different collectively whether concrete corrosion and the harsh sewer atmosphere would exert effects on rebar corrosion in sewers remain to be elucidated once rebar is corroded it may in turn reduce sewer durability similar to those reported in other reinforced concrete structures such as concrete buildings and marine structures sutrisno et al 2017 the rebar rusts at the rebar concrete interface may obtain a volume 2 6 times of the original rebar thus causing the macro level concrete cracking epa 1991 however in sewers not enough attention has been paid to the effects of rebar corrosion on sewer degradation instead the internal concrete cracking is traditionally believed to be caused by the expansive concrete corrosion products i e gypsum caso4 2h2o and ettringite cao 3 al2o3 caso4 3 32h2o with significantly higher volumes than the intact concrete ranging from 124 to 700 joseph et al 2012 li et al 2017 monteny et al 2000 parande et al 2011 besides a recent study suggested that concrete corrosion also characterized the micro cracking at the concrete corrosion front through the cycle of iron dissolution in the highly acidic corrosion layer and the precipitation at the corrosion front jiang et al 2014b although this finding put new insights into concrete cracking it didn t clarify the source of iron and assumed that only pipes using cement containing fe2o3 would suffer from micro level cracking in reinforced concrete sewers whether rebar corrosion would cause the micro cracking in concrete is unknown a thorough understanding of the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete cracking is required for sewer corrosion management this study aims to enhance the understanding of rebar corrosion in sewers and the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation under the circumstances of late sewer service life or regional concrete scaling in particular how concrete corrosion would influence rebar corrosion and how rebar corrosion would in turn cause concrete cracking to simulate corrosion in real sewers reinforced concrete samples were exposed to the gas phase in a pilot gravity sewer pipe with 700 1100 ppm of h2s for 6 months the variation of corrosion characteristics with time and locations the formation of rebar rusts and the microstructure and element distribution at different interfaces inside the reinforced concrete were delineated using physical chemical tests and advanced mineral analytical techniques the outcomes from this study provide significant improvement to our understanding of the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete cracking leading to a new conceptual model for the concrete sewer degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reinforced concrete coupons the concrete coupons were prepared using a pre corroded reinforced concrete sewer from sydney water corporation australia the coupons were cut to a size that was approximately 100 mm length 70 mm width 70 mm thickness and then were embedded in stainless steel frames casting using epoxy fgi r180 epoxy h180 hardener after a certain time of exposure around 3 5 years in the laboratory corrosion chambers some of the coupons were retrieved washed dried and reused for the present study specifically the coupons were washed using high pressure water to remove the existing corrosion layer then they were dried in an oven thermotec 2000 contherm at 60 c for 3 days to achieve a stable initial water content for detailed information please refer to previous studies jiang et al 2015b joseph et al 2012 song et al 2019b each of the pre corroded concrete coupons contained a section of plain round rebar with a nominal diameter of 12 mm most of the rebar surface was exposed directly on the concrete surface while some were covered by thin concrete layers with a thickness around 5 mm section 2 2 the rebar surfaces were abraded sequentially using a series of waterproof abrasive papers of 500 800 1000 and 1200 grit afterwards there was no evidence of existing rebar rusts before being exposed to the corrosion atmosphere in section 2 2 2 2 pilot sewer system the concrete samples were exposed in the gravity mains of a pilot scale sewer system in the luggage point wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia the gravity lines consist of two parallel sets of pvc pipes with 225 mm as the internal pipe diameters 300 m as a workable length and adjustable pipe slopes fig 1 a during the exposure the system was at a slope of 0 56 real sewage of primarily domestic source was pumped to the inlets of both gravity lines at a pump rate of around 200 l min and the wastewater flow velocity was around 0 71 m s in each pipe the typical wastewater characteristics and the monitoring methods were determined in tables si 1 and tables si 2 the daily average values of biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and several other water quality parameters were presented in figure si 1 for the gas phase h2s concentrations and temperatures were monitored using an odalog detector detection range 0 2000 ppm type 2 app tek international pty ltd brendale australia the relative humidity rh was monitored using a hand held humidity meter hm70 vaisala finland the whole system was controlled by a programmable logic controller plc and manipulated using the lab view lab view 2014 real time details of the pilot sewer system was as delineated before li et al 2019b song et al 2019a for sampling purpose two parallel resealable gravity ports port a and b at the distance of 270 m from the inlet were utilized for duplicate experiments fig 1b four reinforced concrete coupons with embedded rebars were installed in the gas phase of the gravity ports i e coupon a and b in port a coupon c and d in port b fig 1c in particular coupon a contained two rebar sections with one exposed directly and the other covered by a thin concrete layer with a thickness around 5 mm section 3 1 for coupon b d each one contained one rebar partially exposed on the concrete surface the coupons were sitting on the plastic shelves inside the ports which enabled the exposed surface to face downwards about 110 mm above the sewage fig 1c and figure si 2 this arrangement well simulated the position of the sewer crown region a location highly susceptible to microbially induced concrete corrosion cayford et al 2017 jiang et al 2016b mori et al 1992 2 3 corrosion monitoring and corrosion sample collection the exposed surfaces of the concrete coupons simulating the crown regions were utilized for corrosion monitoring and sample collection to differentiate the localized physical chemical corrosion characteristics of rebar concrete and their interactive regions the surface was divided into different areas these were the rebar surface r the transitional region between rebar and corroded concrete r c the corroded concrete area within 2 cm from r and the corroded concrete further away from rebar c the corroded concrete area further than 2 cm from r the concrete coupons were exposed in the gravity pipes for 6 months during which each coupon was retrieved monthly for the corrosion morphology inspection and surface ph measurement the surface ph was measured in all areas of r r c and c using a flat surface ph electrode extech ph150 c concrete ph kit extech instruments afterwards coupons were put back in the pipe for further exposure at the time points of 1 3 and 6 months rebar rusts r were sampled for the analysis of micro level corrosion morphology and element compositions using scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds after 6 months of exposure the x ray diffraction xrd analysis was employed to identify the rust compounds to characterize the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete corrosion cracking mineral liberation analysis mla was conducted in the reinforced sample areas untouched by the rebar rusts sampling thin cross sectional slices about 10 mm thick were obtained by cutting the reinforced coupons perpendicularly to the rebar axis two types of cross sections with rebar covered or exposed were produced to characterize rebar corrosion when there was a slight concrete cover or the rebar was completely exposed then the slices were cut into smaller sections 30 mm length 40 mm width 10 mm thickness to extract the rebar while keeping the surrounding concrete intact prior to mla the sections were further ground polished casted by low viscosity epoxy resin to minimize any artificial damage and coated with a layer of carbon approximately 25 nm thick jeol jee 420 vacuum evaporator detailed preparations were as elucidated in previous studies jiang et al 2014b song et al 2019b 2 4 advanced mineral analysis the rebar rusts were examined by sem jeol jsm 6610 america equipped with a detector oxford 50mm2 x max sdd x ray that enabled simultaneous imaging and element analysis edax ametek inc at high count rates with 125 ev energy resolutions kulandaivelu et al 2019 the spot locations for element analysis were chosen by examining the backscattered electron image bse typically for mineral boundary identification grengg et al 2018 before the measurement the rusts were vacuum dried at room temperature for 12 h semsa oven 718 coated with 30 40 nm thick carbon quorum q150t uk and analyzed immediately after the sample preparation to prevent further oxidation the mineral compounds of the rebar rusts were identified by xrd bruker d8 advance mkii using a cu anode as the primary x ray beam source x rays were generated at 40 kv and 40 ma with 2 0 min as the scanning speed 2θ 10 100 as the scanning range diffraction patterns were processed using the rigaku pdxl2 version 2 3 1 0 the compounds were identified using gade software version 5 and pdf 2 crystal structure database kulandaivelu et al 2019 the amount nature and distribution of minerals including the concrete and rebar materials were identified by mla the technique combines the bse and x ray analysis which enables a comprehensive analysis of the mineral compositions and distribution the technique provides a bse image a false color classified particle map and a database containing adequate particle and grain information after the mla measurement the eds test edax ametek inc in the form of element mapping was further conducted to each zoom in area of interest with a procedure as detailed previously jiang et al 2014b 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual inspection and surface ph during the 6 month coupon exposure the sewer atmosphere in two gravity lines had parallel conditions with rh in the range of 90 100 temperature of 20 35 c and h2s of 700 1100 ppm song et al 2019a it provided a severely corrosive sewer condition that has previously been observed in real sewers wells and melchers 2015 indeed the monthly visual inspections showed that the concrete coupons corroded rapidly fig 2 within the first two months evident corrosion of the rebar and concrete was observed a thin light yellow corrosion layer started to accumulate on the concrete surface after three months of exposure the corrosion products expanded significantly with a sharp contrast of corrosion morphology between the rebar rusts and the concrete corrosion layers the rebar rusts were mainly black in color dotted with some brown and red hue while the latter being friable brown paste like and highly moisturized as the exposure prolonged the concrete corrosion layer grew thicker comparatively desiccated while fading into a more porous and viscous layer in addition for coupon a the rebar initially covered by a thin concrete layer was gradually exposed at local regions after 1 month of exposure fig 2a the localized concrete cover was scaling and the rebar corrosion was promoted similar to the described concrete cracking and spalling as inevitable processes following the rebar corrosion and rust expansion in reinforced structures zhao et al 2012 along with the variation of corrosion morphology significant decrease of ph was detected on the surfaces of both rebar and concrete fig 3 the ph values varied with localized regions generally following the order of r r c c the rebar surface had the highest ph values most of steel or iron corrosion reactions mainly occur under alkaline or neutral conditions if no extra acid is provided talbot and talbot 2007 although some reactions might induce potential acidification sanchez silva and rosowsky 2008 zhao et al 2013 the amount of hydrogen ions formed are much lower than those produced in the sulfur oxidizing concrete corrosion likely the reduced ph of rebar surface should be attributed to the ingression of the biogenic sulfuric acid produced nearby in the concrete corrosion layer indeed the ph values of the concrete regions decreased sharply especially in region c that was relatively further away from rebar the starting ph of concrete regions r and r c was in the range of 6 7 because of the previous laboratory chamber exposure and the high pressure washing that was used to remove any existing concrete corrosion products section 2 1 after six months of exposure the ph was lower than 2 indicating a serious corrosion condition jiang et al 2014a 2015b collectively the visual and ph results above showed that when concrete corrosion reached rebar surface the alkaline neutral environment that initially protected rebar would be reduced in return the rebar corrosion would induce concrete cracking and even spalling through rust expansion however further analysis is needed considering that visual inspection and surface ph could only be regarded as an supportive indicator of corrosion processes jiang et al 2014b 3 2 characterization of rebar corrosion products variations in microstructures and element compositions of rebar rusts were determined after 1 3 and 6 months of exposure fig 4 after 1 month the honeycomb like and plate like crystalized structures were observed fig 4 a d g which are typical appearances of ferric oxides known as the most common corrosion products of steel melchers 2013 tamura 2008 besides some disperse and fine globular crystals were detected in the cavities of the honeycomb like structures fig 4a previously identified as goethite α feooh song et al 2017 as the exposure period reached 3 months the relatively uniform and crystalized structures gradually aggregated into a more consolidated layered structure fig 4 b e h the layered structures consisted of a compact base fig 4b covered by loose globular honeycomb like crystals together with larger particles dispersedly nucleating on top right side in fig 4e and h the evident microstructural changes suggested the transformation of the rust compositions wong et al 2010 with continuous exposure the rusts piled up with varied sized particles wrapped with amorphous materials fig 4c f i some well crystalized particles typically flake like parallelogram or hexagon in shape were observed on the surface of rebar rusts as reported previously the particles were gypsum which is recognized as one of the major concrete corrosion products in sewers jiang et al 2014a 2014b li et al 2017 this phenomenon verified that the concrete corrosion layer indeed migrated to rebar surface and exerted potential effects on rebar corrosion as speculated in section 3 1 eds results showed that fe o s ca and si tables si 3 were major elements detected in the rebar rusts fig 4 within the first month the rusts were mainly composed of fe o and s in the order of the highest to the lowest weight percentages it indicated that oxygen may play a significant role at the initiation consistent with the sem analysis which assumed iron oxides as the major rust components compared to oxygen only a small amount of sulfur 10 was detected this phenomenon could be due to the fact that the oxygen level in sewer gas similar to atmosphere is 3 4 orders higher than that of h2s typically in the range of a few ppm to thousands of ppm song et al 2019b however after 3 months of exposure the sulfur contents increased while oxygen decreased especially in the relatively compact layer underneath where less oxygen was available spots 1 2 in fig 4 b spot 1in fig 4e spots 1 2 in fig 4h while on top of the compact layer the globular or honeycomb like crystals still mainly consisted of a significant amount of oxygen potentially due to higher oxygen availability at the surface spot 2 in fig 4e spots 3 4 in fig 4h nevertheless the increasing levels of s suggested that the sulfur combined iron rusts may accumulate as the exposure increased after six months of exposure ca and si were detected which further evidenced the contamination of rebar by the biogenic sulfuric acid and concrete corrosion products to further confirm the rust compositions xrd analysis was employed after 6 months of exposure figure si 4 the results demonstrated that the rebar corrosion products were a mixture of iron oxyhydroxide feooh iron oxides fe2o3 fe3o4 fexsy fes fe3s4 fes2 feclx h2o z and fe2 so4 3 h2o z consistent with the analysis above however as evidenced by the sem images fig 4 the rebar rusts were not homogenous thus the compositions were hard to be uniform depending on the rebar rust development and the concrete corrosion process nearby the results demonstrated that the corrosion mechanism of rebar in sewer atmosphere is very complex the predominant corrosion products and reactions varied with time and the development of concrete corrosion 3 3 interfacial analysis inside the reinforced concrete interfacial analysis including the element compositions and microstructures at the interfaces between the intact rebar rebar rusts rebar rusts concrete corrosion layer and concrete corrosion layer intact concrete is essential to understand the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation mla mappings of two typical sections with different rebar conditions i e rebar covered by a thin concrete layer section 1 and rebar exposed directly section 2 were determined fig 5 the mla results for other rebar sections initially covered by concrete layer but were exposed gradually were shown in figure si 5 for section 1 fig 5a which was initially protected by a thin concrete cover rebar was corroded with evident rust expansion comparably for section 2 much worse rebar mass loss was observed while few rusts accumulated on the rebar surface fig 5b the huge rust loss was likely attributed to the dissolution induced by the decreasing ph levels on the rebar surface fig 3 the results indicated that even a thin concrete layer could inhibit rebar corrosion once the rebar covered by concrete was corroded the expansion of the rebar rusts would stimulate the cracking and spalling of the concrete cover fig 5a which in turn accelerated rebar corrosion this phenomenon demonstrated the mutual interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation in addition mla results verified that the rebar rusts mainly consisted of various iron oxides iron sulfate iron sulfide and iron chlorides consistent with the micro morphology and xrd analysis in section 3 2 gypsum and ettringite were observed as the major corrosion products of concrete to further characterize the interfacial microstructure and element distribution bse and eds mapping were performed on the selected areas i e the interfaces between the rebar rusts concrete corrosion layer area 1 and the concrete corrosion layer intact concrete area 2 in fig 6 and figure si 6 3 4 the interface between the rebar rust concrete corrosion layer bse imaging and element mapping including fe o ca s si al and cl were characterized in area 1 fig 5 for section 1 fig 6a and section 2 figure si 6a respectively for area 1 in section 1 the boundary between the rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer was shown with a sharp contrast for the distributions of fe ca and s fig 6a fe was mainly observed in the rebar rusts while ca and s were largely detected in the concrete corrosion layer interestingly fe was also found in the concrete corrosion layer 16 51 wt except for the fe originally existing in portland cement 3 as fe2o3 jiang et al 2014b the majority of fe should be derived from the rebar rusts nearby 54 89 wt attributed to the acidic environment that induced fe dissolution and migration the other way around s 13 47 wt and ca 9 07 wt were also found to penetrate into the rebar rusts indicating the interactive reactions at the interface between rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer similarly the interactions between rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer were also demonstrated in area 1 section 2 figure si 6a although the rebar rusts were difficult to be differentiated from the concrete corrosion layer due to the significant cracks and voids formed nearby the black regions in the left lower and right upper corners the active interactions between the rebar rust and the concrete corrosion layer were evidenced by the abundant coexistence of fe s ca and si in the interacted region in addition to ca fe s the distribution of cl also varied in rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer consistent with the previous study chlorides tended to accumulate in the rebar rusts and play a significant role in rebar corrosion song et al 2019b zhao et al 2014 3 5 the interface between the concrete corrosion layer intact concrete the bse image showed that cracks and voids adjacent to the aggregates developed more severely in the concrete corrosion layer than those in the intact concrete fig 6b and figure si 6b besides tiny cracks and voids occurred around the interfaces between the concrete corrosion layer and the intact concrete corrosion front indicating its fragile condition different from the huge cracks penetrating or spalling the concrete layer those tiny cracks named as the micro cracks jiang et al 2014b were dispersed parallelly close to the corrosion front in order to find the correlations between the micro cracking and reinforced concrete corrosion the element mapping was conducted to investigate the distribution of fe o ca s si al and cl the contents of si derived from cement or inert silicate aggregates and levels of o and cl were analogous in both sides the concrete corrosion layer had higher levels of s 14 38 wt and fe 5 95 wt while the intact concrete was more abundant in ca and al the depletion of ca was caused by the sulfuric acid produced in the corroded concrete by dissolving the ca oh 2 or decalcifying the casio3 xh2o jiang et al 2014b specifically the levels of fe were higher in the concrete corrosion layer 5 95 wt compared to the intact concrete 2 19 wt and even much higher in the area adjacent to the micro cracks 9 14 wt fig 6b the area with intense accumulation of fe coincided with the places where micro cracks occurred indicating the potential correlations between the micro cracking and fe accumulation as discussed above fe derived from the rebar rusts were found to migrate into the nearby concrete corrosion layer in fig 6a 16 51 wt once the dissolved fe came across the alkaline environment close to the intact concrete ph 11 12 they may form precipitations the nature of which were iron oxides or oxy hydroxides the iron products were reported to induce expansive pressure against the surrounding concrete and cause cracking zhao et al 2012 however this phenomenon was different from the traditional macro cracking caused by the expansion of rebar rusts which developed in random directions such as perpendicularly or parallel to the rebar perimeter fig 5 the micro cracking on the contrary was facilitated by the expansion of fe depositions and progressed along the corrosion front of the concrete layers the micro cracks were not directly influenced by rebar rusts but the re precipitated iron deposits further away from the reinforcing steel bar 3 6 a conceptual model of rebar corrosion and its interaction with concrete degradation the ph profile corrosion products and interfacial analysis consistently showed that the corrosion mechanism of rebar in sewer was very complicated instead of forming iron oxides and oxyhydroxides as detected in other reinforced concrete structures zhao et al 2013 the predominant corrosion products and reactions in sewers varied with the exposure time and the development of concrete corrosion this has led to the establishment of the conceptual model of rebar corrosion in sewer shown in fig 7 at the initiation of rebar corrosion with concrete cover or exposed directly oxygen played a significant role in the corrosion process while gaseous h2s exerted minor effects in the electrochemical reactions fe2 and electrons were provided in the anodic region on rebar surface while oxygen accepted the electrons in the cathodic region 1 anode f e f e 2 2 e 2 cathode h 2 o 1 2 o 2 2 e 2 o h once fe2 encountered oh iron oxides and oxy hydroxides would be formed demonstrated by the honeycomb like and plate like crystalized structures fig 4a d g as well as the element tables si 3 and mla analysis fig 5 the overall corrosion reactions include box 1 in fig 7 high oxygen level 3 4 f e 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 f e o o h 4 2 f e o o h f e 2 o 3 h 2 o low oxygen level 5 2 f e o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e o h 2 6 6 f e o h 2 o 2 2 f e 3 o 4 6 h 2 o as the corrosion developed the rebar surface started to be acidified fig 3 due to the accumulation of h2s and the penetration of the acidic concrete corrosion layer likely the excessive h would take over the role of electron acceptors following the cathodic reaction below 7 cathode 2 h 2 e h 2 with the thickening of rebar rusts the effects of h2s started to increase especially in the inner rust layer where less oxygen was available as suggested by the layered rust structures fig 4 b e h iron sulfide was formed in the compact rust layer underneath while on top of the compact layer a significant amount of o was detected likely due to higher oxygen availability at the surface at this stage the corrosion involves the reaction below box 2 in fig 7 8 f e h 2 s f e s h 2 further with the exacerbation of concrete corrosion rebar corrosion was evidently influenced showing the continuously decreasing ph to around 4 the phenomenon was likely induced by the biogenic sulfuric acid generated in the surrounding concrete layer ph 2 fig 3 demonstrated by the penetration of concrete corrosion products into the rebar rusts shown in the microstructural analysis fig 4 c f i and the element mapping fig 6a presumably the acid would accelerate rebar corrosion not only by facilitating the cathodic reaction eq 7 but also through dissolving the rust layers containing iron oxides oxyhydroxides and iron sulfides box 3 in fig 7 9 f e 2 o 3 6 h 2 f e 3 3 h 2 o 10 f e 3 o 4 8 h 2 f e 3 f e 2 4 h 2 o 11 f e s 2 h f e 2 h 2 s then the dissolved rebar rusts might move away from the rust layer and penetrate into the concrete further away as shown in fig 6b collectively the overall rebar corrosion processes were influenced by multiple factors including the sewer atmosphere oxygen and h2s and the concrete corrosion processes as well however not much attention has been paid to rebar corrosion in sewer until a recent laboratory chamber study was conducted song et al 2019b it investigated the initiation of rebar corrosion covered by intact concrete or partially exposed to sewer atmosphere with very low h2s levels 5 ppm the study found oxygen and moisture were the major corrosion contributors which was in accordance with the corrosion reactions 3 6 as indicated in box 1 fig 7 at the initiation of rebar corrosion the accumulation of h2s and biogenic sulfuric acid was limited considering the protection of concrete covers this phenomenon indicated that optimal water cement ratios or other measures should be adopted in the production of sewer pipes to reduce the concrete porosity and permeability besides extra waterproof and sealing coatings linings are recommended for both of the rebar and inner surface of sewer pipes to prevent the diffusion of oxygen and water onto the rebar surface further as the corrosion is aggravated the effects of h2s and biogenic sulfuric acid will increase the present study demonstrated that when concrete corrosion reached rebar surface or at the later stage of direct rebar exposure rebar corrosion was evidently accelerated by h2s to form iron sulfide box 2 fig 7 or being dissolved away by the sulfuric acid box 3 fig 7 it should be noted that the current model is different from the previous model song et al 2019b which focused on the initiation of rebar corrosion particularly the reactions at the interface of intact rebar and rebar rusts rebar corrosion front the current model further expanded understanding of rebar corrosion by extending to the active rebar corrosion stages with rebar exposed directly to aggressive sewer atmosphere or corroded concrete particularly the reactions inside the rebar rusts and at the interfaces between rebar rusts corroded concrete and corroded concrete intact concrete concrete corrosion front more importantly the current conceptual model fig 7 emphasized on the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation which was not essential when concrete cover of rebar was not corroded in the previous model conditions in contrast to the conventional theory that the internal cracking and pitting of concrete sewers were mainly caused by the volume expansion of concrete corrosion products parande et al 2006a b rebar corrosion was also found significant in creating both macro and micro level concrete cracking it was reported that the rebar rusts at the steel concrete interface could obtain 2 6 times the volume of the original steel thus creating expansive stresses on the surrounding concrete epa 1991 lu et al 2018 in such the main structural damage was not the loss of rebar cross section but the cracking of the concrete matrix in this study after 6 months of exposure the thickness loss of the concrete cover due to concrete corrosion was 4 6 mm for coupon a the initial concrete cover around 5 mm above rebar was completed corroded the residual corrosion layer was cracking and even spalling away from the coupon surface due to the expansion of the rebar rusts figs 2a and 5a more importantly this study also proposed that the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe from the rebar rusts towards the corroded concrete layer could facilitate the micro cracking of the concrete corrosion front as demonstrated in this study fe derived from rebar rusts 50 60 can penetrate into the interfacial areas between rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer 15 18 then move further in the concrete corrosion layer 4 6 and eventually accumulated at the concrete corrosion front 9 13 due to the alkaline environment ph 11 12 close to the intact concrete different from the macro cracking at milli meter level mentioned above the micro cracks at micron meter level were not directly influenced by the rebar rusts but the re precipitated iron deposits further away from the reinforcing steel bar the propagation of the micro cracks majorly relied on the cycle of iron dissolution and deposition consistent with the phenomenon observed in a previous study jiang et al 2014b however this is the first time that rebar corrosion was considered and the transportation of fe from rebar to concrete was demonstrated using the reinforced concrete coupons in pilot sewers overall a relatively comprehensive cracking mechanism of reinforced concrete in sewers was established under the combined effects of corrosion products expansion together with the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe at the concrete corrosion front collectively the outcomes from this study are beneficial for both researchers and industries the knowledge of rebar corrosion in sewers will add to the current modelling approach that estimates sewer corrosion rates and predicts sewer service life the current models include primarily concrete corrosion processes jiang et al 2014b wells and melchers 2015 without consideration of the accelerated degradation of concrete cover due to rebar corrosion the results also imply that regular inspections of existing sewers are necessary to identify rebar exposure due to unexpected concrete spalling caused by internal external mechanical forces or microbially induced corrosion prompt repair should be conducted to restore a proper concrete cover for exposed rebar for a whole sewer section with inadequate cover due to severe concrete corrosion a complete rehabilitation with linings and coatings is indispensable before the full exposure of rebar however further studies are required to quantify the minimum thickness of the residual concrete prior to the sewer rehabilitation in order to extend the sewer service life cost effectively a systematic investigation regarding corrosion in concrete sewers have been conducted using laboratory scale corrosion chambers pilot sewer pipes and real sewers we employed corrosion chambers to identify the controlling environmental factors of concrete corrosion and its initiation through long term exposure tests jiang et al 2014a 2015b joseph et al 2012 to investigate the microbial community and processes on corroding concrete surface in sewers jiang et al 2016b sun et al 2014 to establish different conceptual and prediction models for the complicated physiochemical and biological processes of concrete corrosion jiang et al 2014 2016a li et al 2019a liu et al 2017 and to develop corrosion resistant concrete and cost effective control measures for sewer corrosion li et al 2020b sun et al 2015 2016 the unique pilot scale sewer pipes located in the innovation centre luggage point wwtp brisbane australia were utilized to study the chemically induced corrosion recently li et al 2019b and the distinct microbially induced concrete corrosion at tidal regions song et al 2019a we also investigated the microbially induced corrosion in real sewers across australia cayford et al 2012 2017 li et al 2020a following a previous study about corrosion initiation of rebar in the lab scale corrosion chambers song et al 2019b this study utilized the pilot sewer pipes to investigate rebar corrosion and the interactions with the concrete degradation under highly corrosive conditions it is the first experimental investigation of rebar corrosion in a pilot scale gravity sewer system foreseeing the research about rebar corrosion is still at the infant stage we will strive to facilitate the establishment of an advanced mathematical model to predict sewer service life more reinforced concrete coupons and various exposure conditions pilot scale and real sewers have been utilized for a further study in order to investigate the effects of other environmental and material factors on the corrosion process interfacial processes rebar rusts concrete corrosion layer concrete corrosion layer intact concrete and their temporal changes will be quantified by incorporating parameters related to corrosion processes of both concrete and rebar 4 conclusions the corrosion mechanism of rebar in reinforced concrete sewers and the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation were investigated using the physical chemical tests and advanced mineral analytical techniques particularly the corrosion morphology surface ph characteristics of rebar rusts microstructure and element distribution at local interfacial areas were determined leading to the following key findings 1 when rebar is exposed directly or poorly protected rebar corrosion and concrete cracking would develop rapidly resulting in aggregating corrosion morphology decreasing surface ph and severe concrete cracking and even scaling 2 the corrosion mechanism of rebar exposed directly to sewer gas or covered by poor conditioned concrete were more complicated than those protected by concrete covers the predominant corrosion products and reactions varied with the exposure time and the development of concrete corrosion the rebar corrosion products include iron oxides fe2o3 fe3o4 iron oxyhydroxides feooh lepidocrocite goethite iron sulfides fes fe3s4 fes2 iron chlorides feclx h2o z and iron sulfate fe2 so4 3 h2o z 3 when concrete corrosion reached rebar surface the cracking of the concrete cover was influenced by multiple effects including the macro cracking induced by the expansion of concrete and rebar corrosion products and the micro cracking accelerated by the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe at the concrete corrosion front 4 under the circumstance of late sewer service life or regional concrete scaling the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete corrosion cracking were intense the acidic concrete corrosion layer would accelerate rebar corrosion by facilitating the reactions and dissolving the rebar rusts which in turn would stimulate the concrete

17791,concrete corrosion as a major issue in sewer management has attracted considerable research in comparison the corrosion of reinforcing steel bar rebar is not well understood particularly

by the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe derived from rebar rusts at the concrete corrosion front a conceptual model elucidating rebar corrosion and the complex interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation is proposed to support the development of corrosion prevention and refurbishment strategies for reinforced concrete sewers graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer corrosion rebar concrete mineral liberation analysis 1 introduction sewer networks are crucial urban infrastructures in modern society concrete is the most commonly used material particularly for large sewers due to its strength durability and relatively low costs in comparison to other materials such as ductile iron vitrified clay polyvinylchloride composite fiber reinforced polymer and high density polyethylene pipes vahidi et al 2016 corrosion of concrete pipes and related infrastructures such as manholes and pumping station for example is a critical deterioration process in sewers it not only causes loss of concrete mass but also induces cracking and even collapsing of the pipe structure ultimately grengg et al 2018 parker 1945b vollertsen et al 2008 the service life of sewer pipes is greatly shortened by corrosion and cracking accompanied with huge expenses on pipe rehabilitation and replacement an annual expenditure of several billion dollars was estimated for repairing and replacing corroded sewers worldwide which is expected to increase as the aging pipes proceed to fail epa 1991 koch et al 2002 as such an enhanced understanding of the corrosion and cracking of concrete sewers is imperative for extending sewer service life and reducing maintenance expenses concrete corrosion in sewers has attracted considerable research islander et al 1991 jiang et al 2015a joseph et al 2012 parande et al 2006a b parker 1945a b the corrosion process is initiated with the acidification by carbonation co2 and hydrogen sulfide h2s nielsen et al 2012 and then develops to more disruptive corrosion reactions between the cementitious materials and the biogenic sulfuric acid derived from oxidation of h2s present in sewer atmosphere jensen et al 2009 jiang et al 2014a 2015b monteny et al 2000 mori et al 1992 song et al 2019a previous studies on sewer corrosion mainly focus on concrete corrosion however another significant part embedded in concrete i e reinforcing steel bar rebar is also susceptible to corrosion the corrosion of rebars has not attracted a similar level of attention and is poorly understood at present grengg et al 2018 li et al 2017 song et al 2019b in sewers concrete pipes can either be plain or steel reinforced rebars are usually embedded with pipe diameter larger than 0 6 m in order to withhold the external loads and internal pressure joshi 2015 nnadi and lizarazo marriaga 2012 once the concrete cover is cracking or seriously corroded rebar would also suffer from potential corrosion because of the reduced alkalinity attack by aggressive substances through cracks and the direct exposure due to regional concrete scaling fandrich et al 2007 jahani et al 2001 the unique sewer conditions including the high gaseous h2s levels and high humidity altogether make the process more complicated than those in other reinforced concrete structures such as concrete buildings bridge decks marine structures slabs and floors bertolini et al 2013 lu et al 2018 the traditional corrosion of rebar in those reinforced concrete is an electrochemical process that causes the dissolution of iron to form various corrosion products bentur et al 1997 they are mainly composed of iron oxides and hydroxides depending on the levels of oxidation and the availability of moisture in the exposure environment zhao et al 2012 2014 chloride ions are one of the most significant factors to initiate and accelerate rebar corrosion which can penetrate through sound concrete or cracks derived from the external environment ahmad 2003 angst et al 2009 the leaching of alkalis which lowers the ph around rebar can also initiate the rebar corrosion grengg et al 2018 however in reinforced sewers fundamental knowledge of rebar corrosion is largely lacking although a recent study reported that h2s and the biogenic sulfuric acid may not directly participate in rebar corrosion it only investigated rebar covered by uncorroded concrete or exposed to low h2s concentrations 5 ppm song et al 2019b when concrete corrosion reaches the rebar surface or high h2s concentrations are provided the rebar corrosion reactions and products may be different collectively whether concrete corrosion and the harsh sewer atmosphere would exert effects on rebar corrosion in sewers remain to be elucidated once rebar is corroded it may in turn reduce sewer durability similar to those reported in other reinforced concrete structures such as concrete buildings and marine structures sutrisno et al 2017 the rebar rusts at the rebar concrete interface may obtain a volume 2 6 times of the original rebar thus causing the macro level concrete cracking epa 1991 however in sewers not enough attention has been paid to the effects of rebar corrosion on sewer degradation instead the internal concrete cracking is traditionally believed to be caused by the expansive concrete corrosion products i e gypsum caso4 2h2o and ettringite cao 3 al2o3 caso4 3 32h2o with significantly higher volumes than the intact concrete ranging from 124 to 700 joseph et al 2012 li et al 2017 monteny et al 2000 parande et al 2011 besides a recent study suggested that concrete corrosion also characterized the micro cracking at the concrete corrosion front through the cycle of iron dissolution in the highly acidic corrosion layer and the precipitation at the corrosion front jiang et al 2014b although this finding put new insights into concrete cracking it didn t clarify the source of iron and assumed that only pipes using cement containing fe2o3 would suffer from micro level cracking in reinforced concrete sewers whether rebar corrosion would cause the micro cracking in concrete is unknown a thorough understanding of the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete cracking is required for sewer corrosion management this study aims to enhance the understanding of rebar corrosion in sewers and the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation under the circumstances of late sewer service life or regional concrete scaling in particular how concrete corrosion would influence rebar corrosion and how rebar corrosion would in turn cause concrete cracking to simulate corrosion in real sewers reinforced concrete samples were exposed to the gas phase in a pilot gravity sewer pipe with 700 1100 ppm of h2s for 6 months the variation of corrosion characteristics with time and locations the formation of rebar rusts and the microstructure and element distribution at different interfaces inside the reinforced concrete were delineated using physical chemical tests and advanced mineral analytical techniques the outcomes from this study provide significant improvement to our understanding of the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete cracking leading to a new conceptual model for the concrete sewer degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reinforced concrete coupons the concrete coupons were prepared using a pre corroded reinforced concrete sewer from sydney water corporation australia the coupons were cut to a size that was approximately 100 mm length 70 mm width 70 mm thickness and then were embedded in stainless steel frames casting using epoxy fgi r180 epoxy h180 hardener after a certain time of exposure around 3 5 years in the laboratory corrosion chambers some of the coupons were retrieved washed dried and reused for the present study specifically the coupons were washed using high pressure water to remove the existing corrosion layer then they were dried in an oven thermotec 2000 contherm at 60 c for 3 days to achieve a stable initial water content for detailed information please refer to previous studies jiang et al 2015b joseph et al 2012 song et al 2019b each of the pre corroded concrete coupons contained a section of plain round rebar with a nominal diameter of 12 mm most of the rebar surface was exposed directly on the concrete surface while some were covered by thin concrete layers with a thickness around 5 mm section 2 2 the rebar surfaces were abraded sequentially using a series of waterproof abrasive papers of 500 800 1000 and 1200 grit afterwards there was no evidence of existing rebar rusts before being exposed to the corrosion atmosphere in section 2 2 2 2 pilot sewer system the concrete samples were exposed in the gravity mains of a pilot scale sewer system in the luggage point wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia the gravity lines consist of two parallel sets of pvc pipes with 225 mm as the internal pipe diameters 300 m as a workable length and adjustable pipe slopes fig 1 a during the exposure the system was at a slope of 0 56 real sewage of primarily domestic source was pumped to the inlets of both gravity lines at a pump rate of around 200 l min and the wastewater flow velocity was around 0 71 m s in each pipe the typical wastewater characteristics and the monitoring methods were determined in tables si 1 and tables si 2 the daily average values of biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and several other water quality parameters were presented in figure si 1 for the gas phase h2s concentrations and temperatures were monitored using an odalog detector detection range 0 2000 ppm type 2 app tek international pty ltd brendale australia the relative humidity rh was monitored using a hand held humidity meter hm70 vaisala finland the whole system was controlled by a programmable logic controller plc and manipulated using the lab view lab view 2014 real time details of the pilot sewer system was as delineated before li et al 2019b song et al 2019a for sampling purpose two parallel resealable gravity ports port a and b at the distance of 270 m from the inlet were utilized for duplicate experiments fig 1b four reinforced concrete coupons with embedded rebars were installed in the gas phase of the gravity ports i e coupon a and b in port a coupon c and d in port b fig 1c in particular coupon a contained two rebar sections with one exposed directly and the other covered by a thin concrete layer with a thickness around 5 mm section 3 1 for coupon b d each one contained one rebar partially exposed on the concrete surface the coupons were sitting on the plastic shelves inside the ports which enabled the exposed surface to face downwards about 110 mm above the sewage fig 1c and figure si 2 this arrangement well simulated the position of the sewer crown region a location highly susceptible to microbially induced concrete corrosion cayford et al 2017 jiang et al 2016b mori et al 1992 2 3 corrosion monitoring and corrosion sample collection the exposed surfaces of the concrete coupons simulating the crown regions were utilized for corrosion monitoring and sample collection to differentiate the localized physical chemical corrosion characteristics of rebar concrete and their interactive regions the surface was divided into different areas these were the rebar surface r the transitional region between rebar and corroded concrete r c the corroded concrete area within 2 cm from r and the corroded concrete further away from rebar c the corroded concrete area further than 2 cm from r the concrete coupons were exposed in the gravity pipes for 6 months during which each coupon was retrieved monthly for the corrosion morphology inspection and surface ph measurement the surface ph was measured in all areas of r r c and c using a flat surface ph electrode extech ph150 c concrete ph kit extech instruments afterwards coupons were put back in the pipe for further exposure at the time points of 1 3 and 6 months rebar rusts r were sampled for the analysis of micro level corrosion morphology and element compositions using scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds after 6 months of exposure the x ray diffraction xrd analysis was employed to identify the rust compounds to characterize the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete corrosion cracking mineral liberation analysis mla was conducted in the reinforced sample areas untouched by the rebar rusts sampling thin cross sectional slices about 10 mm thick were obtained by cutting the reinforced coupons perpendicularly to the rebar axis two types of cross sections with rebar covered or exposed were produced to characterize rebar corrosion when there was a slight concrete cover or the rebar was completely exposed then the slices were cut into smaller sections 30 mm length 40 mm width 10 mm thickness to extract the rebar while keeping the surrounding concrete intact prior to mla the sections were further ground polished casted by low viscosity epoxy resin to minimize any artificial damage and coated with a layer of carbon approximately 25 nm thick jeol jee 420 vacuum evaporator detailed preparations were as elucidated in previous studies jiang et al 2014b song et al 2019b 2 4 advanced mineral analysis the rebar rusts were examined by sem jeol jsm 6610 america equipped with a detector oxford 50mm2 x max sdd x ray that enabled simultaneous imaging and element analysis edax ametek inc at high count rates with 125 ev energy resolutions kulandaivelu et al 2019 the spot locations for element analysis were chosen by examining the backscattered electron image bse typically for mineral boundary identification grengg et al 2018 before the measurement the rusts were vacuum dried at room temperature for 12 h semsa oven 718 coated with 30 40 nm thick carbon quorum q150t uk and analyzed immediately after the sample preparation to prevent further oxidation the mineral compounds of the rebar rusts were identified by xrd bruker d8 advance mkii using a cu anode as the primary x ray beam source x rays were generated at 40 kv and 40 ma with 2 0 min as the scanning speed 2θ 10 100 as the scanning range diffraction patterns were processed using the rigaku pdxl2 version 2 3 1 0 the compounds were identified using gade software version 5 and pdf 2 crystal structure database kulandaivelu et al 2019 the amount nature and distribution of minerals including the concrete and rebar materials were identified by mla the technique combines the bse and x ray analysis which enables a comprehensive analysis of the mineral compositions and distribution the technique provides a bse image a false color classified particle map and a database containing adequate particle and grain information after the mla measurement the eds test edax ametek inc in the form of element mapping was further conducted to each zoom in area of interest with a procedure as detailed previously jiang et al 2014b 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual inspection and surface ph during the 6 month coupon exposure the sewer atmosphere in two gravity lines had parallel conditions with rh in the range of 90 100 temperature of 20 35 c and h2s of 700 1100 ppm song et al 2019a it provided a severely corrosive sewer condition that has previously been observed in real sewers wells and melchers 2015 indeed the monthly visual inspections showed that the concrete coupons corroded rapidly fig 2 within the first two months evident corrosion of the rebar and concrete was observed a thin light yellow corrosion layer started to accumulate on the concrete surface after three months of exposure the corrosion products expanded significantly with a sharp contrast of corrosion morphology between the rebar rusts and the concrete corrosion layers the rebar rusts were mainly black in color dotted with some brown and red hue while the latter being friable brown paste like and highly moisturized as the exposure prolonged the concrete corrosion layer grew thicker comparatively desiccated while fading into a more porous and viscous layer in addition for coupon a the rebar initially covered by a thin concrete layer was gradually exposed at local regions after 1 month of exposure fig 2a the localized concrete cover was scaling and the rebar corrosion was promoted similar to the described concrete cracking and spalling as inevitable processes following the rebar corrosion and rust expansion in reinforced structures zhao et al 2012 along with the variation of corrosion morphology significant decrease of ph was detected on the surfaces of both rebar and concrete fig 3 the ph values varied with localized regions generally following the order of r r c c the rebar surface had the highest ph values most of steel or iron corrosion reactions mainly occur under alkaline or neutral conditions if no extra acid is provided talbot and talbot 2007 although some reactions might induce potential acidification sanchez silva and rosowsky 2008 zhao et al 2013 the amount of hydrogen ions formed are much lower than those produced in the sulfur oxidizing concrete corrosion likely the reduced ph of rebar surface should be attributed to the ingression of the biogenic sulfuric acid produced nearby in the concrete corrosion layer indeed the ph values of the concrete regions decreased sharply especially in region c that was relatively further away from rebar the starting ph of concrete regions r and r c was in the range of 6 7 because of the previous laboratory chamber exposure and the high pressure washing that was used to remove any existing concrete corrosion products section 2 1 after six months of exposure the ph was lower than 2 indicating a serious corrosion condition jiang et al 2014a 2015b collectively the visual and ph results above showed that when concrete corrosion reached rebar surface the alkaline neutral environment that initially protected rebar would be reduced in return the rebar corrosion would induce concrete cracking and even spalling through rust expansion however further analysis is needed considering that visual inspection and surface ph could only be regarded as an supportive indicator of corrosion processes jiang et al 2014b 3 2 characterization of rebar corrosion products variations in microstructures and element compositions of rebar rusts were determined after 1 3 and 6 months of exposure fig 4 after 1 month the honeycomb like and plate like crystalized structures were observed fig 4 a d g which are typical appearances of ferric oxides known as the most common corrosion products of steel melchers 2013 tamura 2008 besides some disperse and fine globular crystals were detected in the cavities of the honeycomb like structures fig 4a previously identified as goethite α feooh song et al 2017 as the exposure period reached 3 months the relatively uniform and crystalized structures gradually aggregated into a more consolidated layered structure fig 4 b e h the layered structures consisted of a compact base fig 4b covered by loose globular honeycomb like crystals together with larger particles dispersedly nucleating on top right side in fig 4e and h the evident microstructural changes suggested the transformation of the rust compositions wong et al 2010 with continuous exposure the rusts piled up with varied sized particles wrapped with amorphous materials fig 4c f i some well crystalized particles typically flake like parallelogram or hexagon in shape were observed on the surface of rebar rusts as reported previously the particles were gypsum which is recognized as one of the major concrete corrosion products in sewers jiang et al 2014a 2014b li et al 2017 this phenomenon verified that the concrete corrosion layer indeed migrated to rebar surface and exerted potential effects on rebar corrosion as speculated in section 3 1 eds results showed that fe o s ca and si tables si 3 were major elements detected in the rebar rusts fig 4 within the first month the rusts were mainly composed of fe o and s in the order of the highest to the lowest weight percentages it indicated that oxygen may play a significant role at the initiation consistent with the sem analysis which assumed iron oxides as the major rust components compared to oxygen only a small amount of sulfur 10 was detected this phenomenon could be due to the fact that the oxygen level in sewer gas similar to atmosphere is 3 4 orders higher than that of h2s typically in the range of a few ppm to thousands of ppm song et al 2019b however after 3 months of exposure the sulfur contents increased while oxygen decreased especially in the relatively compact layer underneath where less oxygen was available spots 1 2 in fig 4 b spot 1in fig 4e spots 1 2 in fig 4h while on top of the compact layer the globular or honeycomb like crystals still mainly consisted of a significant amount of oxygen potentially due to higher oxygen availability at the surface spot 2 in fig 4e spots 3 4 in fig 4h nevertheless the increasing levels of s suggested that the sulfur combined iron rusts may accumulate as the exposure increased after six months of exposure ca and si were detected which further evidenced the contamination of rebar by the biogenic sulfuric acid and concrete corrosion products to further confirm the rust compositions xrd analysis was employed after 6 months of exposure figure si 4 the results demonstrated that the rebar corrosion products were a mixture of iron oxyhydroxide feooh iron oxides fe2o3 fe3o4 fexsy fes fe3s4 fes2 feclx h2o z and fe2 so4 3 h2o z consistent with the analysis above however as evidenced by the sem images fig 4 the rebar rusts were not homogenous thus the compositions were hard to be uniform depending on the rebar rust development and the concrete corrosion process nearby the results demonstrated that the corrosion mechanism of rebar in sewer atmosphere is very complex the predominant corrosion products and reactions varied with time and the development of concrete corrosion 3 3 interfacial analysis inside the reinforced concrete interfacial analysis including the element compositions and microstructures at the interfaces between the intact rebar rebar rusts rebar rusts concrete corrosion layer and concrete corrosion layer intact concrete is essential to understand the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation mla mappings of two typical sections with different rebar conditions i e rebar covered by a thin concrete layer section 1 and rebar exposed directly section 2 were determined fig 5 the mla results for other rebar sections initially covered by concrete layer but were exposed gradually were shown in figure si 5 for section 1 fig 5a which was initially protected by a thin concrete cover rebar was corroded with evident rust expansion comparably for section 2 much worse rebar mass loss was observed while few rusts accumulated on the rebar surface fig 5b the huge rust loss was likely attributed to the dissolution induced by the decreasing ph levels on the rebar surface fig 3 the results indicated that even a thin concrete layer could inhibit rebar corrosion once the rebar covered by concrete was corroded the expansion of the rebar rusts would stimulate the cracking and spalling of the concrete cover fig 5a which in turn accelerated rebar corrosion this phenomenon demonstrated the mutual interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation in addition mla results verified that the rebar rusts mainly consisted of various iron oxides iron sulfate iron sulfide and iron chlorides consistent with the micro morphology and xrd analysis in section 3 2 gypsum and ettringite were observed as the major corrosion products of concrete to further characterize the interfacial microstructure and element distribution bse and eds mapping were performed on the selected areas i e the interfaces between the rebar rusts concrete corrosion layer area 1 and the concrete corrosion layer intact concrete area 2 in fig 6 and figure si 6 3 4 the interface between the rebar rust concrete corrosion layer bse imaging and element mapping including fe o ca s si al and cl were characterized in area 1 fig 5 for section 1 fig 6a and section 2 figure si 6a respectively for area 1 in section 1 the boundary between the rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer was shown with a sharp contrast for the distributions of fe ca and s fig 6a fe was mainly observed in the rebar rusts while ca and s were largely detected in the concrete corrosion layer interestingly fe was also found in the concrete corrosion layer 16 51 wt except for the fe originally existing in portland cement 3 as fe2o3 jiang et al 2014b the majority of fe should be derived from the rebar rusts nearby 54 89 wt attributed to the acidic environment that induced fe dissolution and migration the other way around s 13 47 wt and ca 9 07 wt were also found to penetrate into the rebar rusts indicating the interactive reactions at the interface between rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer similarly the interactions between rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer were also demonstrated in area 1 section 2 figure si 6a although the rebar rusts were difficult to be differentiated from the concrete corrosion layer due to the significant cracks and voids formed nearby the black regions in the left lower and right upper corners the active interactions between the rebar rust and the concrete corrosion layer were evidenced by the abundant coexistence of fe s ca and si in the interacted region in addition to ca fe s the distribution of cl also varied in rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer consistent with the previous study chlorides tended to accumulate in the rebar rusts and play a significant role in rebar corrosion song et al 2019b zhao et al 2014 3 5 the interface between the concrete corrosion layer intact concrete the bse image showed that cracks and voids adjacent to the aggregates developed more severely in the concrete corrosion layer than those in the intact concrete fig 6b and figure si 6b besides tiny cracks and voids occurred around the interfaces between the concrete corrosion layer and the intact concrete corrosion front indicating its fragile condition different from the huge cracks penetrating or spalling the concrete layer those tiny cracks named as the micro cracks jiang et al 2014b were dispersed parallelly close to the corrosion front in order to find the correlations between the micro cracking and reinforced concrete corrosion the element mapping was conducted to investigate the distribution of fe o ca s si al and cl the contents of si derived from cement or inert silicate aggregates and levels of o and cl were analogous in both sides the concrete corrosion layer had higher levels of s 14 38 wt and fe 5 95 wt while the intact concrete was more abundant in ca and al the depletion of ca was caused by the sulfuric acid produced in the corroded concrete by dissolving the ca oh 2 or decalcifying the casio3 xh2o jiang et al 2014b specifically the levels of fe were higher in the concrete corrosion layer 5 95 wt compared to the intact concrete 2 19 wt and even much higher in the area adjacent to the micro cracks 9 14 wt fig 6b the area with intense accumulation of fe coincided with the places where micro cracks occurred indicating the potential correlations between the micro cracking and fe accumulation as discussed above fe derived from the rebar rusts were found to migrate into the nearby concrete corrosion layer in fig 6a 16 51 wt once the dissolved fe came across the alkaline environment close to the intact concrete ph 11 12 they may form precipitations the nature of which were iron oxides or oxy hydroxides the iron products were reported to induce expansive pressure against the surrounding concrete and cause cracking zhao et al 2012 however this phenomenon was different from the traditional macro cracking caused by the expansion of rebar rusts which developed in random directions such as perpendicularly or parallel to the rebar perimeter fig 5 the micro cracking on the contrary was facilitated by the expansion of fe depositions and progressed along the corrosion front of the concrete layers the micro cracks were not directly influenced by rebar rusts but the re precipitated iron deposits further away from the reinforcing steel bar 3 6 a conceptual model of rebar corrosion and its interaction with concrete degradation the ph profile corrosion products and interfacial analysis consistently showed that the corrosion mechanism of rebar in sewer was very complicated instead of forming iron oxides and oxyhydroxides as detected in other reinforced concrete structures zhao et al 2013 the predominant corrosion products and reactions in sewers varied with the exposure time and the development of concrete corrosion this has led to the establishment of the conceptual model of rebar corrosion in sewer shown in fig 7 at the initiation of rebar corrosion with concrete cover or exposed directly oxygen played a significant role in the corrosion process while gaseous h2s exerted minor effects in the electrochemical reactions fe2 and electrons were provided in the anodic region on rebar surface while oxygen accepted the electrons in the cathodic region 1 anode f e f e 2 2 e 2 cathode h 2 o 1 2 o 2 2 e 2 o h once fe2 encountered oh iron oxides and oxy hydroxides would be formed demonstrated by the honeycomb like and plate like crystalized structures fig 4a d g as well as the element tables si 3 and mla analysis fig 5 the overall corrosion reactions include box 1 in fig 7 high oxygen level 3 4 f e 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 f e o o h 4 2 f e o o h f e 2 o 3 h 2 o low oxygen level 5 2 f e o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e o h 2 6 6 f e o h 2 o 2 2 f e 3 o 4 6 h 2 o as the corrosion developed the rebar surface started to be acidified fig 3 due to the accumulation of h2s and the penetration of the acidic concrete corrosion layer likely the excessive h would take over the role of electron acceptors following the cathodic reaction below 7 cathode 2 h 2 e h 2 with the thickening of rebar rusts the effects of h2s started to increase especially in the inner rust layer where less oxygen was available as suggested by the layered rust structures fig 4 b e h iron sulfide was formed in the compact rust layer underneath while on top of the compact layer a significant amount of o was detected likely due to higher oxygen availability at the surface at this stage the corrosion involves the reaction below box 2 in fig 7 8 f e h 2 s f e s h 2 further with the exacerbation of concrete corrosion rebar corrosion was evidently influenced showing the continuously decreasing ph to around 4 the phenomenon was likely induced by the biogenic sulfuric acid generated in the surrounding concrete layer ph 2 fig 3 demonstrated by the penetration of concrete corrosion products into the rebar rusts shown in the microstructural analysis fig 4 c f i and the element mapping fig 6a presumably the acid would accelerate rebar corrosion not only by facilitating the cathodic reaction eq 7 but also through dissolving the rust layers containing iron oxides oxyhydroxides and iron sulfides box 3 in fig 7 9 f e 2 o 3 6 h 2 f e 3 3 h 2 o 10 f e 3 o 4 8 h 2 f e 3 f e 2 4 h 2 o 11 f e s 2 h f e 2 h 2 s then the dissolved rebar rusts might move away from the rust layer and penetrate into the concrete further away as shown in fig 6b collectively the overall rebar corrosion processes were influenced by multiple factors including the sewer atmosphere oxygen and h2s and the concrete corrosion processes as well however not much attention has been paid to rebar corrosion in sewer until a recent laboratory chamber study was conducted song et al 2019b it investigated the initiation of rebar corrosion covered by intact concrete or partially exposed to sewer atmosphere with very low h2s levels 5 ppm the study found oxygen and moisture were the major corrosion contributors which was in accordance with the corrosion reactions 3 6 as indicated in box 1 fig 7 at the initiation of rebar corrosion the accumulation of h2s and biogenic sulfuric acid was limited considering the protection of concrete covers this phenomenon indicated that optimal water cement ratios or other measures should be adopted in the production of sewer pipes to reduce the concrete porosity and permeability besides extra waterproof and sealing coatings linings are recommended for both of the rebar and inner surface of sewer pipes to prevent the diffusion of oxygen and water onto the rebar surface further as the corrosion is aggravated the effects of h2s and biogenic sulfuric acid will increase the present study demonstrated that when concrete corrosion reached rebar surface or at the later stage of direct rebar exposure rebar corrosion was evidently accelerated by h2s to form iron sulfide box 2 fig 7 or being dissolved away by the sulfuric acid box 3 fig 7 it should be noted that the current model is different from the previous model song et al 2019b which focused on the initiation of rebar corrosion particularly the reactions at the interface of intact rebar and rebar rusts rebar corrosion front the current model further expanded understanding of rebar corrosion by extending to the active rebar corrosion stages with rebar exposed directly to aggressive sewer atmosphere or corroded concrete particularly the reactions inside the rebar rusts and at the interfaces between rebar rusts corroded concrete and corroded concrete intact concrete concrete corrosion front more importantly the current conceptual model fig 7 emphasized on the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation which was not essential when concrete cover of rebar was not corroded in the previous model conditions in contrast to the conventional theory that the internal cracking and pitting of concrete sewers were mainly caused by the volume expansion of concrete corrosion products parande et al 2006a b rebar corrosion was also found significant in creating both macro and micro level concrete cracking it was reported that the rebar rusts at the steel concrete interface could obtain 2 6 times the volume of the original steel thus creating expansive stresses on the surrounding concrete epa 1991 lu et al 2018 in such the main structural damage was not the loss of rebar cross section but the cracking of the concrete matrix in this study after 6 months of exposure the thickness loss of the concrete cover due to concrete corrosion was 4 6 mm for coupon a the initial concrete cover around 5 mm above rebar was completed corroded the residual corrosion layer was cracking and even spalling away from the coupon surface due to the expansion of the rebar rusts figs 2a and 5a more importantly this study also proposed that the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe from the rebar rusts towards the corroded concrete layer could facilitate the micro cracking of the concrete corrosion front as demonstrated in this study fe derived from rebar rusts 50 60 can penetrate into the interfacial areas between rebar rusts and concrete corrosion layer 15 18 then move further in the concrete corrosion layer 4 6 and eventually accumulated at the concrete corrosion front 9 13 due to the alkaline environment ph 11 12 close to the intact concrete different from the macro cracking at milli meter level mentioned above the micro cracks at micron meter level were not directly influenced by the rebar rusts but the re precipitated iron deposits further away from the reinforcing steel bar the propagation of the micro cracks majorly relied on the cycle of iron dissolution and deposition consistent with the phenomenon observed in a previous study jiang et al 2014b however this is the first time that rebar corrosion was considered and the transportation of fe from rebar to concrete was demonstrated using the reinforced concrete coupons in pilot sewers overall a relatively comprehensive cracking mechanism of reinforced concrete in sewers was established under the combined effects of corrosion products expansion together with the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe at the concrete corrosion front collectively the outcomes from this study are beneficial for both researchers and industries the knowledge of rebar corrosion in sewers will add to the current modelling approach that estimates sewer corrosion rates and predicts sewer service life the current models include primarily concrete corrosion processes jiang et al 2014b wells and melchers 2015 without consideration of the accelerated degradation of concrete cover due to rebar corrosion the results also imply that regular inspections of existing sewers are necessary to identify rebar exposure due to unexpected concrete spalling caused by internal external mechanical forces or microbially induced corrosion prompt repair should be conducted to restore a proper concrete cover for exposed rebar for a whole sewer section with inadequate cover due to severe concrete corrosion a complete rehabilitation with linings and coatings is indispensable before the full exposure of rebar however further studies are required to quantify the minimum thickness of the residual concrete prior to the sewer rehabilitation in order to extend the sewer service life cost effectively a systematic investigation regarding corrosion in concrete sewers have been conducted using laboratory scale corrosion chambers pilot sewer pipes and real sewers we employed corrosion chambers to identify the controlling environmental factors of concrete corrosion and its initiation through long term exposure tests jiang et al 2014a 2015b joseph et al 2012 to investigate the microbial community and processes on corroding concrete surface in sewers jiang et al 2016b sun et al 2014 to establish different conceptual and prediction models for the complicated physiochemical and biological processes of concrete corrosion jiang et al 2014 2016a li et al 2019a liu et al 2017 and to develop corrosion resistant concrete and cost effective control measures for sewer corrosion li et al 2020b sun et al 2015 2016 the unique pilot scale sewer pipes located in the innovation centre luggage point wwtp brisbane australia were utilized to study the chemically induced corrosion recently li et al 2019b and the distinct microbially induced concrete corrosion at tidal regions song et al 2019a we also investigated the microbially induced corrosion in real sewers across australia cayford et al 2012 2017 li et al 2020a following a previous study about corrosion initiation of rebar in the lab scale corrosion chambers song et al 2019b this study utilized the pilot sewer pipes to investigate rebar corrosion and the interactions with the concrete degradation under highly corrosive conditions it is the first experimental investigation of rebar corrosion in a pilot scale gravity sewer system foreseeing the research about rebar corrosion is still at the infant stage we will strive to facilitate the establishment of an advanced mathematical model to predict sewer service life more reinforced concrete coupons and various exposure conditions pilot scale and real sewers have been utilized for a further study in order to investigate the effects of other environmental and material factors on the corrosion process interfacial processes rebar rusts concrete corrosion layer concrete corrosion layer intact concrete and their temporal changes will be quantified by incorporating parameters related to corrosion processes of both concrete and rebar 4 conclusions the corrosion mechanism of rebar in reinforced concrete sewers and the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete degradation were investigated using the physical chemical tests and advanced mineral analytical techniques particularly the corrosion morphology surface ph characteristics of rebar rusts microstructure and element distribution at local interfacial areas were determined leading to the following key findings 1 when rebar is exposed directly or poorly protected rebar corrosion and concrete cracking would develop rapidly resulting in aggregating corrosion morphology decreasing surface ph and severe concrete cracking and even scaling 2 the corrosion mechanism of rebar exposed directly to sewer gas or covered by poor conditioned concrete were more complicated than those protected by concrete covers the predominant corrosion products and reactions varied with the exposure time and the development of concrete corrosion the rebar corrosion products include iron oxides fe2o3 fe3o4 iron oxyhydroxides feooh lepidocrocite goethite iron sulfides fes fe3s4 fes2 iron chlorides feclx h2o z and iron sulfate fe2 so4 3 h2o z 3 when concrete corrosion reached rebar surface the cracking of the concrete cover was influenced by multiple effects including the macro cracking induced by the expansion of concrete and rebar corrosion products and the micro cracking accelerated by the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe at the concrete corrosion front 4 under the circumstance of late sewer service life or regional concrete scaling the interactions between rebar corrosion and concrete corrosion cracking were intense the acidic concrete corrosion layer would accelerate rebar corrosion by facilitating the reactions and dissolving the rebar rusts which in turn would stimulate the concrete

water table 1 29 8 female participants ranging from 19 to 58 years old participated for the otc test of mdmp and 10 6 female participants ranging from 27 to 54 years old participated for the otc test of other pyrazines preliminary testing with 5 subjects was used to determine the appropriate concentration ranges for pyrazines concentrations differed by a factor of two for dmp trmp and temp and three for mdmp the otc of pyrazine was not determined as preliminary results showed its otc was above 16 mg l the afc protocol is described in detail astm international 2004 briefly starting with the lowest concentration the subject is provided three samples 2 with odor free water and one containing a single pyrazine at one concentration samples were prepared as 200 ml of odorant solution or odor free water was poured into a 500 ml wide mouth erlenmeyer flasks and heated in a water bath at 45 c for 15 min the subject smells each sample and selects the one in which they perceive an odor this is repeated for all eight concentrations and each pyrazine the resulting data are processed to determine otcs by both geometric means and logistic regressions an individual threshold was the geometric mean of the concentrations of the highest incorrectly identified sample and the next correctly identified sample when subjects had correct answers for all the subsequent samples after the last wrong answer if a subject did not correctly identify all samples consecutively within the range of tested concentrations it was assumed that the subject would correctly identify the next highest concentration or if a subject correctly identified all samples consecutively it was assumed that the subject would not correctly identify the next lowest concentration then the group threshold was determined by calculating the geometric mean of all individual thresholds astm international 1991 a logistic regression was used to determine the group otc corresponding to a probability of 50

confidence intervals ci generated from the results of testing eight concentrations in the afc sensory experiments with pyrazines dissolved in water for probability based threshold definitions such as astm international 1991 the group otc is calculated as some arbitrary value for the probability of detection usually 50 thus the concentration corresponding to 0 5 probability of detection using logistic regression was selected as the otc in this study this corresponds to 2540 ng l aq dmp 236 ng l aq trmp 0 043 ng l aq mdmp 502000 ng l aq temp initial experiments demonstrated that otc of pyrazine was 16000000 ng l and since the concentration was so high and improbable in drinking water a sensory testing for otc was not performed table 3 summarizes the aqueous otc values calculated by both logistic regression and geometric mean methods the otcs based on geometric mean were determined to be 4420 ng l aq dmp 385 ng l aq trmp 0 218 ng l aq mdmp and 771000 ng l aq temp respectively our aqueous otcs were significantly lower compared to previously reported values e g 9000000 54000000 ng l aq dmp 71000 9000000 ng l aq trmp and 10000000 ng l aq temp koehler et al 1971 bonvehí 2005 cerny 2010 the otc of mdmp was comparable to 0 4 ng l aq reported by czerny and grosch 2000 3 1 2 otcs for pyrazines in air data from twenty human subjects generating otcs in air through evaluating eight different concentrations of pyrazine dmd trmp mdmp and temp table 3 that were delivered by gc o fig 3 presents logistic regression curves and 95 confidence intervals for three of the pyrazines the concentration corresponding to 0 5 probability of detection was selected as the otc this corresponds to 2 18 ng l air dmp 0 46 ng l air trmp and 9 9e 6 ng l air mdmp no significant differences in otcs were found based on age or gender at concentrations close to the odor threshold the regressions exhibit a much sharper rise for trmp and mdmp dmp has a much shallower slope indicating a greater diversity of sensitivity among the population logistic regression was not applied to pyrazine or temp because their odor threshold concentrations were above the highest concentration tested 533 ng l air testing higher concentrations was not suitable for gc o as overloaded peaks resulted table 3 summarizes the air otc values calculated by both logistic regression and geometric mean methods for pyrazine and temp the geometric mean otc 533 ng l air represents the highest concentration tested and which was detected by 50 of the human subjects wagner et al 1999 reported similar high otcs 2000

2000 jelen 2011 3 1 3 comparisons of otcs in water and air odor thresholds for the five pyrazines varied immensely with the otc for mdmp being a factor 10 7 lower than for pyrazine in both air and water table 3 the human nose demonstrated the same ranking order of sensitivity for pyrazines in water and air the human population is most sensitive to mdmp otc values of 0 043 ng l aq and 9 9e 6 ng l air mdmp is followed by trmp otc values of 236 ng l aq and 0 46 ng l air and dmp otc values of 2540 ng l aq and 2 18 ng l air finally for temp and pyrazine which have otc values 105 ng l aq and 102 ng l air the human population can only detect very high concentrations that are unlikely in a water supply using henry s law and the corresponding aqueous otcs for logistic regression and geometric means the otcs air of trmp dmp and mdmp are predicted within a factor of 2 with good linearity r2 0 9 fig 4 and table 3 in general the otcs air determined by gc o method were about 0 5 5 1 times of the predicted otcs air the accuracy of predicted otcs air was affected by many factors such as aqueous otcs temperature and reliable henry s constants besides pyrazine gas was assumed to be an ideal gas while calculating the predicted otcs while the dataset is small the ability to use henry s law constants and otcs in one media e g aqueous or air to predict the otc in the other media could be a powerful tool the otcs determined by logistic regression were generally consistent with the geometric mean results table 3 and fig a2 a 1 53 5 07 fold difference was noted between logistic and geometric mean otcs this is partly explained when one subject could detect the lowest concentration or could not detect the highest concentration tested geometric mean otcs are impacted by the next highest lowest concentration in the concentration series also system errors and human variability always exist when using different methods to assess odor thresholds for chemicals burlingame et al 2017 burlingame and doty 2018 3 2 odor descriptors odor descriptors provided by human subjects for each pyrazine compound during the gc o study are depicted as word clouds in fig 5 word clouds applying increasing size and font weight to illustrate descriptor frequency overall sweet and musty were the dominant descriptors applied to all five pyrazines sweet and musty were augmented with many diverse and minor descriptors including those expected for pyrazines e g nutty chocolate roasted and unexpected e g rancid solvent lemon this diversity and non uniformity is often observed for odor descriptors dietrich and burlingame 2020 sweet was the most widely used descriptor for pyrazine and dmp the descriptors of dmp also included pungent solvent musty sulfurous and medicinal odor which are not in total agreement with descriptors of roasted nutty aroma in the literature frank et al 2004 mdmp and trmp had similar descriptors musty dominated followed by sweet chocolate earthy and nutty a solvent odor was also reported by some subjects nutty baked potato roasted peanut cocoa aroma milk are commonly cited for trmp takeoka et al 2008 niu et al 2017 mdmp is usually described using the unpleasant sensory descriptors like wet cardboard musty moldy dusty and earthy gallois and grimont 1985 slabizki et al 2015 while at higher concentration descriptors like chocolate or coffee are also used simpson et al 2004 for temp musty was again the most common followed by sweet pungent earthy and grassy in foods descriptors of musty potato like and bean like aromas burnt coffee are used to describe temp frank et al 2004 zhu et al 2016 overall word clouds showed that the musty and sweet pyrazines can be potential earthy musty odor causing compounds in water 3 3 occurrence of pyrazines in source and drinking water of china as shown in table 4 ibmp and ipmp were never detected in chinese waters pyrazine had the highest detection frequency 93 8 with concentrations of n d 32 7 ng l in source water and detection frequency was 97 9 with concentrations of n d 38 0 ng l in finished water the detection frequency of dmp was the second highest with concentrations of n d 62 2 ng l in source water and n d 39 6 ng l in finished water the average trmp concentrations in source and finished water samples were 4 3 ng l and 2 8 ng l with detection frequency of 76 3 and 63 8 respectively temp and emp showed lower detection rate in source and finished water compared to the other detected pyrazines in fig 6 the color series of blue and red was used to identify correlation coefficients r blue corresponds to a correlation of approximately 1 red to approximately 0 a circle with a larger size indicates a stronger correlation overall the detected pyrazines showed a correlation of 0 39 no negative correlations were observed there is a significant positive relationship among dmp trmp and emp with the highest correlation between emp and trmp r 0 92 p 0 05 besides pyrazine was highly correlated to temp r 0 73 p 0 05 specially dmp was less correlated to temp and pyrazine the higher correlation between the detected pyrazines suggests similar origin the data structure of detected pyrazines was further confirmed in the heatmap generated from a hierarchy clustering analysis based on the euclidean distance matrix fig 7 results showed that the five detected chemicals columns were divided into 2 groups and the cities rows were divided into 4 clusters the third and fourth city clusters cluster iii iv showed relatively high concentrations while the first cluster i showed relatively lower concentrations except ibmp and ipmp the other five pyrazines occurred throughout different river basins in china the pyrazines were mainly distributed downstream of areas with relatively high population densities and intensive industrial activities the highest concentrations of pyrazine temp emp and trmp were detected in chaohu and lianyungang followed by dongguan xuzhou shanghai and jinan the highest concentrations of dmp was detected in dongguan followed by xuzhou and shanghai due to widespread presence of pyrazines in foods and beverage food processing and domestic wastewater can be major sources of pyrazines oliveira et al 2014 reported that pyrazines as a class of chemicals were about 12 5 of the chemicals in a coffee producing wastewater chemical manufacturing can also produce pyrazines the industrial amination process for producing the industrial chemicals ethylenediamine piperazine and triethylenediamine is reported to contain about 2 3 alkylpyrazine wang et al 2015 3 4 pyrazine occurrence in dan and smith river in the dan and smith rivers ibmp and ipmp were detected in 5 8 and 3 5 of water samples respectively although found only sporadically the maximum river water concentration of ibmp was 83 9 ng l aq found on the smith river and well above the odor threshold of 2 16 ng l aq the maximum concentration of ipmp was 1 7 ng l and found on the dan river compared to the no detection of ibmp and ipmp in chinese source and drinking water the infrequently detected ibmp and ipmp in dan and smith rivers might be associated with nearby wastewater treatment plants mdmp was detected above the mdl in 18 1 of the aqueous water samples e g river and interstitial water it was present primarily during summer months and was nearly absent in during winter months although the highest concentration was detected in february 2017 in the dan river fig 8 and in june 2017 for the smith river mdmp was detected at the concentrations of n d 4 4 ng l aq in dan river with mean concentration of 0 25 ng l aq the median concentration was less than the detection limit relatively higher concentrations were detected in smith river n d 5 9 ng l aq with mean concentration of 0 25 ng l aq these detected concentrations greatly exceed the otc of 0 043 ng l aq mdmp the source was potentially an industry that discharged to the river or the waste water treatment plant wwtp similar to the situation reported in spain ventura et al 2010 3 5 estimation of oavs the oav indicates the likelihood of an odorant being smelled relative to the otc for water samples from china the calculated oavs were generally 1 which showed that pyrazines contributed little to the earthy musty odor in china while in dan and smith river samples the oav results indicate that mdmp as well as ibmp could sometimes be detectable by consumers the mean concentration of mdmp was 0 25 ng l aq in the dan river with an oav of 5 8 and was 0 46 ng l aq with an oav of 10 7 for smith river the maximum oavs of mdmp 135 1 for smith river and 102 6 for dan river were considerable indicating mdmp might contribute to the earthy musty odor in watersheds for ibmp and ipmp while a maximum oav of 42 was recorded for ibmp ibmp was rarely detected with a resulting mean oav of 1 ipmp was also detected at concentrations less than its otc 3 6 removal of pyrazines in dwtps of china except for pyrazine the occurrence concentrations of other pyrazines e g dmp emp trmp and temp in chinese source water were significantly higher compared to finished water according to two paired samples t test pyrazine p 0 13 other pyrazines p 0 05 the removal efficiencies of the detected five pyrazines are presented in fig 9 in general pyrazines were not efficiently removed by conventional drinking water treatment processes and some of dwtps even showed negative removals i e production of the chemical overall median removals by conventional treatment varied from 0 10 fig 9 advanced treatment process displays higher removal efficiencies for emp and trmp greater than 90 median removal was observed for emp followed by trmp with 56 5 median removal no significant differences were observed for temp pyrazine and dmp between advanced treatment process and conventional one two sample t test or wilcox p 0 05 this limited removal of pyrazines in conventional treatment process is consistent with their high aqueous solubility and low octanol water partition coefficients log kow ranging from 0 06 to 2 13 table a2 there is very little information available on the degradation of pyrazines by advanced treatment process except for ibmp and ipmp ozonation is efficient for the degradation of ipmp and ibmp in aqueous solution wang et al 2017 pyrazine moiety mainly reacts with oh during ozone oxidation with a low rate constant of 1 3 0 14 m 1s 1 which is partially explained by the lone electron pair of the nitrogen which is presumably not very accessible as well as the aromatic ring which is less activated for electrophilic attack tekle rottering et al 2016 4 discussion a diversity of pyrazine compounds including those with alkyl and methoxy substitutions provide flavor to foods and beverages typical literature descriptors are earthy musty nutty and or roasted as shown in this research these food and beverage pyrazines are nearly ubiquitous in source and or drinking waters for large cities and rural towns at concentrations from not detected to about 40 ng l the survey of seven pyrazines in source and drinking water samples from 31 chinese cities with populations from 0 79 to 24 24 million demonstrated that traditionally monitored ibmp and ipmp were never detected temp pyrazine dmp emp and trmp were detected in 45 95 of the water samples often co occurred were correlated were not removed by conventional water treatment although some dmp emp trmp could be removed by advanced oxidation a survey of ibmp ipmp and mdmp in rivers in rural virginia usa with towns of populations 0 04 million found detection rates of 3 5 18 at ng l concentrations no studies to date have focused on a survey of pyrazines in source and drinking water likely due to their low human toxicity even though humans are highly sensitive to their earthy musty nutty roasted odors which occur at pg l and ng l otc values descriptor analysis demonstrated that human subjects described pyrazine and dmp as more sweet than musty and mdmp trmp temp as more musty than sweet fig 5 individually the pyrazines in this study only occasionally exceeded their otc values such as ibmp and mdmp in the smith or dan rivers these chemicals may have caused the t o episodes in 2015 and 2016 on these rivers which were not attributed to geosmin or 2 mib byrd 2018 the actual chemical agent was not identified during the t o episode and perhaps as was the case in spain ventura et al 2010 the extremely odorous chemical mdmp with an otc of 0 043 ng l aq contributed to the odor episode as pyrazines were correlated and co occurred in chinese water samples similar to their presence in foods and beverages multiple pyrazines below their corresponding otcs may have collectively contributed to earthy musty odors detectable by humans studies show that mixtures of individual odorants within the same chemical class can have synergistic and additive sensory effects zhu j et al 2016 synergistic effects are reported to occur between individual odorants in complex food matrices as well as in surface water guo et al 2019 synergisms within odorant mixtures is relatively unexplored further research is needed to assess the pyrazine mixtures related to their combined odors the substitution and structure of pyrazine based chemicals profoundly affects odor thresholds and descriptors partly due to the variations of receptor molecule interaction in the olfactory laing et al 1991 this was confirmed in our research as alkyl pyrazines were less odorous and demonstrated orders of magnitude less sensitivity e g higher otcs compared to the alkyl methoxy pyrazine mdmp previous literature reported that alkyl pyrazines have otcs 100 to 1000 times higher than those of alkyl methoxy pyrazines gallois and grimont 1985 structure odor relationships were investigated for alkyl pyrazines showing that different alkyl groups and location in the pyrazine rings impact the odor thresholds of pyrazine significantly and by orders of magnitude wagner et al 1999 otcs adopted for oav calculation were determined in american subjects in this study the major limitation of using regional otcs in the data of other area of the world is people s sensory sensitivity differences due to variations in genetic gender age and odor memory or prior exposure experiences of people from different countries or districts dietrich et al 2014 burlingame et al 2017 for example the otcs of 2 mib were recorded ranging from 1 to 10 ng l worldwide piriou et al 2009 thus considering limited regional sensory data could be obtained from previous studies the odor characteristics of pyrazines including otcs should be further investigated among different districts when commonly known and expected earthy musty chemical such as geosmin 2 mib ibmp ipmp or haloanisoles are not identified in drinking water other alkyl and methoxy pyrazine compounds should be considered because of their high odor potency wide distribution and poor removal by conventional water treatment it should be noted that pyrazines have various structures with multiple combinations of alkyl and alkoxy groups thus different pyrazine compounds should be quantified to fully investigate the odor contributions due to their low sensory thresholds more sensitive techniques are needed for the detection of pyrazines at ng l even pg l levels in water 5 conclusion in this study pyrazines as a new class of odorants with earthy musty odors were explored including their odor characteristics occurrence and distributions in source water and drinking water as well as the removal efficiencies the results showed that musty and sweet were the most common descriptors for the investigated pyrazines mdmp could be smelled at less than ng l both in air and water by people and thus might have caused the earthy musty odor issues in dan river pyrazine dmp mdmp trmp and temp occurred throughout china and often co occurred the removal efficiencies through conventional water treatment were poor and advanced oxidation water treatment could only remove emp and trmp considering the widespread presence of pyrazines in source and drinking waters and their low odor threshold concentrations their potential contributions to the earthy musty odor problems in drinking water should be

of other pyrazines preliminary testing with 5 subjects was used to determine the appropriate concentration ranges for pyrazines concentrations differed by a factor of two for dmp trmp and temp and three for mdmp the otc of pyrazine was not determined as preliminary results showed its otc was above 16 mg l the afc protocol is described in detail astm international 2004 briefly starting with the lowest concentration the subject is provided three samples 2 with odor free water and one containing a single pyrazine at one concentration samples were prepared as 200 ml of odorant solution or odor free water was poured into a 500 ml wide mouth erlenmeyer flasks and heated in a water bath at 45 c for 15 min the subject smells each sample and selects the one in which they perceive an odor this is repeated for all eight concentrations and each pyrazine the resulting data are processed to determine otcs by both geometric means and logistic regressions an individual threshold was the geometric mean of the concentrations of the highest incorrectly identified sample and the next correctly identified sample when subjects had correct answers for all the subsequent samples after the last wrong answer if a subject did not correctly identify all samples consecutively within the range of tested concentrations it was assumed that the subject would correctly identify the next highest concentration or if a subject correctly identified all samples consecutively it was assumed that the subject would not correctly identify the next lowest concentration then the group threshold was determined by calculating the geometric mean of all individual thresholds astm international 1991 a logistic regression was used to determine the group otc corresponding to a probability of 50

confidence intervals ci generated from the results of testing eight concentrations in the afc sensory experiments with pyrazines dissolved in water for probability based threshold definitions such as astm international 1991 the group otc is calculated as some arbitrary value for the probability of detection usually 50 thus the concentration corresponding to 0 5 probability of detection using logistic regression was selected as the otc in this study this corresponds to 2540 ng l aq dmp 236 ng l aq trmp 0 043 ng l aq mdmp 502000 ng l aq temp initial experiments demonstrated that otc of pyrazine was 16000000 ng l and since the concentration was so high and improbable in drinking water a sensory testing for otc was not performed table 3 summarizes the aqueous otc values calculated by both logistic regression and geometric mean methods the otcs based on geometric mean were determined to be 4420 ng l aq dmp 385 ng l aq trmp 0 218 ng l aq mdmp and 771000 ng l aq temp respectively our aqueous otcs were significantly lower compared to previously reported values e g 9000000 54000000 ng l aq dmp 71000 9000000 ng l aq trmp and 10000000 ng l aq temp koehler et al 1971 bonvehí 2005 cerny 2010 the otc of mdmp was comparable to 0 4 ng l aq reported by czerny and grosch 2000 3 1 2 otcs for pyrazines in air data from twenty human subjects generating otcs in air through evaluating eight different concentrations of pyrazine dmd trmp mdmp and temp table 3 that were delivered by gc o fig 3 presents logistic regression curves and 95 confidence intervals for three of the pyrazines the concentration corresponding to 0 5 probability of detection was selected as the otc this corresponds to 2 18 ng l air dmp 0 46 ng l air trmp and 9 9e 6 ng l air mdmp no significant differences in otcs were found based on age or gender at concentrations close to the odor threshold the regressions exhibit a much sharper rise for trmp and mdmp dmp has a much shallower slope indicating a greater diversity of sensitivity among the population logistic regression was not applied to pyrazine or temp because their odor threshold concentrations were above the highest concentration tested 533 ng l air testing higher concentrations was not suitable for gc o as overloaded peaks resulted table 3 summarizes the air otc values calculated by both logistic regression and geometric mean methods for pyrazine and temp the geometric mean otc 533 ng l air represents the highest concentration tested and which was detected by 50 of the human subjects wagner et al 1999 reported similar high otcs 2000

2000 jelen 2011 3 1 3 comparisons of otcs in water and air odor thresholds for the five pyrazines varied immensely with the otc for mdmp being a factor 10 7 lower than for pyrazine in both air and water table 3 the human nose demonstrated the same ranking order of sensitivity for pyrazines in water and air the human population is most sensitive to mdmp otc values of 0 043 ng l aq and 9 9e 6 ng l air mdmp is followed by trmp otc values of 236 ng l aq and 0 46 ng l air and dmp otc values of 2540 ng l aq and 2 18 ng l air finally for temp and pyrazine which have otc values 105 ng l aq and 102 ng l air the human population can only detect very high concentrations that are unlikely in a water supply using henry s law and the corresponding aqueous otcs for logistic regression and geometric means the otcs air of trmp dmp and mdmp are predicted within a factor of 2 with good linearity r2 0 9 fig 4 and table 3 in general the otcs air determined by gc o method were about 0 5 5 1 times of the predicted otcs air the accuracy of predicted otcs air was affected by many factors such as aqueous otcs temperature and reliable henry s constants besides pyrazine gas was assumed to be an ideal gas while calculating the predicted otcs while the dataset is small the ability to use henry s law constants and otcs in one media e g aqueous or air to predict the otc in the other media could be a powerful tool the otcs determined by logistic regression were generally consistent with the geometric mean results table 3 and fig a2 a 1 53 5 07 fold difference was noted between logistic and geometric mean otcs this is partly explained when one subject could detect the lowest concentration or could not detect the highest concentration tested geometric mean otcs are impacted by the next highest lowest concentration in the concentration series also system errors and human variability always exist when using different methods to assess odor thresholds for chemicals burlingame et al 2017 burlingame and doty 2018 3 2 odor descriptors odor descriptors provided by human subjects for each pyrazine compound during the gc o study are depicted as word clouds in fig 5 word clouds applying increasing size and font weight to illustrate descriptor frequency overall sweet and musty were the dominant descriptors applied to all five pyrazines sweet and musty were augmented with many diverse and minor descriptors including those expected for pyrazines e g nutty chocolate roasted and unexpected e g rancid solvent lemon this diversity and non uniformity is often observed for odor descriptors dietrich and burlingame 2020 sweet was the most widely used descriptor for pyrazine and dmp the descriptors of dmp also included pungent solvent musty sulfurous and medicinal odor which are not in total agreement with descriptors of roasted nutty aroma in the literature frank et al 2004 mdmp and trmp had similar descriptors musty dominated followed by sweet chocolate earthy and nutty a solvent odor was also reported by some subjects nutty baked potato roasted peanut cocoa aroma milk are commonly cited for trmp takeoka et al 2008 niu et al 2017 mdmp is usually described using the unpleasant sensory descriptors like wet cardboard musty moldy dusty and earthy gallois and grimont 1985 slabizki et al 2015 while at higher concentration descriptors like chocolate or coffee are also used simpson et al 2004 for temp musty was again the most common followed by sweet pungent earthy and grassy in foods descriptors of musty potato like and bean like aromas burnt coffee are used to describe temp frank et al 2004 zhu et al 2016 overall word clouds showed that the musty and sweet pyrazines can be potential earthy musty odor causing compounds in water 3 3 occurrence of pyrazines in source and drinking water of china as shown in table 4 ibmp and ipmp were never detected in chinese waters pyrazine had the highest detection frequency 93 8 with concentrations of n d 32 7 ng l in source water and detection frequency was 97 9 with concentrations of n d 38 0 ng l in finished water the detection frequency of dmp was the second highest with concentrations of n d 62 2 ng l in source water and n d 39 6 ng l in finished water the average trmp concentrations in source and finished water samples were 4 3 ng l and 2 8 ng l with detection frequency of 76 3 and 63 8 respectively temp and emp showed lower detection rate in source and finished water compared to the other detected pyrazines in fig 6 the color series of blue and red was used to identify correlation coefficients r blue corresponds to a correlation of approximately 1 red to approximately 0 a circle with a larger size indicates a stronger correlation overall the detected pyrazines showed a correlation of 0 39 no negative correlations were observed there is a significant positive relationship among dmp trmp and emp with the highest correlation between emp and trmp r 0 92 p 0 05 besides pyrazine was highly correlated to temp r 0 73 p 0 05 specially dmp was less correlated to temp and pyrazine the higher correlation between the detected pyrazines suggests similar origin the data structure of detected pyrazines was further confirmed in the heatmap generated from a hierarchy clustering analysis based on the euclidean distance matrix fig 7 results showed that the five detected chemicals columns were divided into 2 groups and the cities rows were divided into 4 clusters the third and fourth city clusters cluster iii iv showed relatively high concentrations while the first cluster i showed relatively lower concentrations except ibmp and ipmp the other five pyrazines occurred throughout different river basins in china the pyrazines were mainly distributed downstream of areas with relatively high population densities and intensive industrial activities the highest concentrations of pyrazine temp emp and trmp were detected in chaohu and lianyungang followed by dongguan xuzhou shanghai and jinan the highest concentrations of dmp was detected in dongguan followed by xuzhou and shanghai due to widespread presence of pyrazines in foods and beverage food processing and domestic wastewater can be major sources of pyrazines oliveira et al 2014 reported that pyrazines as a class of chemicals were about 12 5 of the chemicals in a coffee producing wastewater chemical manufacturing can also produce pyrazines the industrial amination process for producing the industrial chemicals ethylenediamine piperazine and triethylenediamine is reported to contain about 2 3 alkylpyrazine wang et al 2015 3 4 pyrazine occurrence in dan and smith river in the dan and smith rivers ibmp and ipmp were detected in 5 8 and 3 5 of water samples respectively although found only sporadically the maximum river water concentration of ibmp was 83 9 ng l aq found on the smith river and well above the odor threshold of 2 16 ng l aq the maximum concentration of ipmp was 1 7 ng l and found on the dan river compared to the no detection of ibmp and ipmp in chinese source and drinking water the infrequently detected ibmp and ipmp in dan and smith rivers might be associated with nearby wastewater treatment plants mdmp was detected above the mdl in 18 1 of the aqueous water samples e g river and interstitial water it was present primarily during summer months and was nearly absent in during winter months although the highest concentration was detected in february 2017 in the dan river fig 8 and in june 2017 for the smith river mdmp was detected at the concentrations of n d 4 4 ng l aq in dan river with mean concentration of 0 25 ng l aq the median concentration was less than the detection limit relatively higher concentrations were detected in smith river n d 5 9 ng l aq with mean concentration of 0 25 ng l aq these detected concentrations greatly exceed the otc of 0 043 ng l aq mdmp the source was potentially an industry that discharged to the river or the waste water treatment plant wwtp similar to the situation reported in spain ventura et al 2010 3 5 estimation of oavs the oav indicates the likelihood of an odorant being smelled relative to the otc for water samples from china the calculated oavs were generally 1 which showed that pyrazines contributed little to the earthy musty odor in china while in dan and smith river samples the oav results indicate that mdmp as well as ibmp could sometimes be detectable by consumers the mean concentration of mdmp was 0 25 ng l aq in the dan river with an oav of 5 8 and was 0 46 ng l aq with an oav of 10 7 for smith river the maximum oavs of mdmp 135 1 for smith river and 102 6 for dan river were considerable indicating mdmp might contribute to the earthy musty odor in watersheds for ibmp and ipmp while a maximum oav of 42 was recorded for ibmp ibmp was rarely detected with a resulting mean oav of 1 ipmp was also detected at concentrations less than its otc 3 6 removal of pyrazines in dwtps of china except for pyrazine the occurrence concentrations of other pyrazines e g dmp emp trmp and temp in chinese source water were significantly higher compared to finished water according to two paired samples t test pyrazine p 0 13 other pyrazines p 0 05 the removal efficiencies of the detected five pyrazines are presented in fig 9 in general pyrazines were not efficiently removed by conventional drinking water treatment processes and some of dwtps even showed negative removals i e production of the chemical overall median removals by conventional treatment varied from 0 10 fig 9 advanced treatment process displays higher removal efficiencies for emp and trmp greater than 90 median removal was observed for emp followed by trmp with 56 5 median removal no significant differences were observed for temp pyrazine and dmp between advanced treatment process and conventional one two sample t test or wilcox p 0 05 this limited removal of pyrazines in conventional treatment process is consistent with their high aqueous solubility and low octanol water partition coefficients log kow ranging from 0 06 to 2 13 table a2 there is very little information available on the degradation of pyrazines by advanced treatment process except for ibmp and ipmp ozonation is efficient for the degradation of ipmp and ibmp in aqueous solution wang et al 2017 pyrazine moiety mainly reacts with oh during ozone oxidation with a low rate constant of 1 3 0 14 m 1s 1 which is partially explained by the lone electron pair of the nitrogen which is presumably not very accessible as well as the aromatic ring which is less activated for electrophilic attack tekle rottering et al 2016 4 discussion a diversity of pyrazine compounds including those with alkyl and methoxy substitutions provide flavor to foods and beverages typical literature descriptors are earthy musty nutty and or roasted as shown in this research these food and beverage pyrazines are nearly ubiquitous in source and or drinking waters for large cities and rural towns at concentrations from not detected to about 40 ng l the survey of seven pyrazines in source and drinking water samples from 31 chinese cities with populations from 0 79 to 24 24 million demonstrated that traditionally monitored ibmp and ipmp were never detected temp pyrazine dmp emp and trmp were detected in 45 95 of the water samples often co occurred were correlated were not removed by conventional water treatment although some dmp emp trmp could be removed by advanced oxidation a survey of ibmp ipmp and mdmp in rivers in rural virginia usa with towns of populations 0 04 million found detection rates of 3 5 18 at ng l concentrations no studies to date have focused on a survey of pyrazines in source and drinking water likely due to their low human toxicity even though humans are highly sensitive to their earthy musty nutty roasted odors which occur at pg l and ng l otc values descriptor analysis demonstrated that human subjects described pyrazine and dmp as more sweet than musty and mdmp trmp temp as more musty than sweet fig 5 individually the pyrazines in this study only occasionally exceeded their otc values such as ibmp and mdmp in the smith or dan rivers these chemicals may have caused the t o episodes in 2015 and 2016 on these rivers which were not attributed to geosmin or 2 mib byrd 2018 the actual chemical agent was not identified during the t o episode and perhaps as was the case in spain ventura et al 2010 the extremely odorous chemical mdmp with an otc of 0 043 ng l aq contributed to the odor episode as pyrazines were correlated and co occurred in chinese water samples similar to their presence in foods and beverages multiple pyrazines below their corresponding otcs may have collectively contributed to earthy musty odors detectable by humans studies show that mixtures of individual odorants within the same chemical class can have synergistic and additive sensory effects zhu j et al 2016 synergistic effects are reported to occur between individual odorants in complex food matrices as well as in surface water guo et al 2019 synergisms within odorant mixtures is relatively unexplored further research is needed to assess the pyrazine mixtures related to their combined odors the substitution and structure of pyrazine based chemicals profoundly affects odor thresholds and descriptors partly due to the variations of receptor molecule interaction in the olfactory laing et al 1991 this was confirmed in our research as alkyl pyrazines were less odorous and demonstrated orders of magnitude less sensitivity e g higher otcs compared to the alkyl methoxy pyrazine mdmp previous literature reported that alkyl pyrazines have otcs 100 to 1000 times higher than those of alkyl methoxy pyrazines gallois and grimont 1985 structure odor relationships were investigated for alkyl pyrazines showing that different alkyl groups and location in the pyrazine rings impact the odor thresholds of pyrazine significantly and by orders of magnitude wagner et al 1999 otcs adopted for oav calculation were determined in american subjects in this study the major limitation of using regional otcs in the data of other area of the world is people s sensory sensitivity differences due to variations in genetic gender age and odor memory or prior exposure experiences of people from different countries or districts dietrich et al 2014 burlingame et al 2017 for example the otcs of 2 mib were recorded ranging from 1 to 10 ng l worldwide piriou et al 2009 thus considering limited regional sensory data could be obtained from previous studies the odor characteristics of pyrazines including otcs should be further investigated among different districts when commonly known and expected earthy musty chemical such as geosmin 2 mib ibmp ipmp or haloanisoles are not identified in drinking water other alkyl and methoxy pyrazine compounds should be considered because of their high odor potency wide distribution and poor removal by conventional water treatment it should be noted that pyrazines have various structures with multiple combinations of alkyl and alkoxy groups thus different pyrazine compounds should be quantified to fully investigate the odor contributions due to their low sensory thresholds more sensitive techniques are needed for the detection of pyrazines at ng l even pg l levels in water 5 conclusion in this study pyrazines as a new class of odorants with earthy musty odors were explored including their odor characteristics occurrence and distributions in source water and drinking water as well as the removal efficiencies the results showed that musty and sweet were the most common descriptors for the investigated pyrazines mdmp could be smelled at less than ng l both in air and water by people and thus might have caused the earthy musty odor issues in dan river pyrazine dmp mdmp trmp and temp occurred throughout china and often co occurred the removal efficiencies through conventional water treatment were poor and advanced oxidation water treatment could only remove emp and trmp considering the widespread presence of pyrazines in source and drinking waters and their low odor threshold concentrations their potential contributions to the earthy musty odor problems in drinking water should be

17793,electrochemically mediated adsorption is an emerging technology that utilizes redox active or faradaic materials and has exhibited high salt adsorption capacity and superb ion selectivity here we use a redox polymer polyvinylferrocene pvfc as the anode and a conducting polymer polypyrrole doped with a large anionic surfactant ppy dbs as the cathode for selective electrochemical removal of inorganic and organic components we fabricated a flow system with alternating adsorption desorption steps incorporating an electrosorption cell and inline probes ultraviolet visible spectroscopy conductivity and ph sensors to demonstrate on the fly quantification of the ion adsorption performance the flow system provides a more realistic evaluation of dynamic selectivity for the active materials during cyclic operation than that based on a single equilibrium adsorption step in batch our results show a three fold cycle selectivity toward the removal of benzoate as a representative organic anion against a 50 fold abundance of perchlorate supporting anion indicating that electrochemically mediated adsorption is a promising technology for waste water remediation applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutants electrochemical adsorption environmental remediation redox active electrodes selective adsorption 1 introduction electrochemical means for water treatment and remediation have attracted great attention in recent years grimm et al 1998 oren 2008 su and hatton 2017a suss et al 2015 compared with techniques such as thermal pressure and ph swing electrochemical methods tailored for water treatment can potentially be operated under ambient temperature and pressure and do not require chemical regeneration or other post treatments moreover electrochemical methods are modular have lower footprint and are highly scalable various electrode materials have been employed for electrosorptive ion separation for example highly porous activated carbons allow for electrostatic entrapment of ions within their electric double layer edl ion intercalating materials such as sodium manganese oxide can sequester ions within their host sites and redox active materials such as polyvinylferrocene pvfc are able to bind favorably with certain ions due to specific interactions between the electronic cloud of the active material and the target ions when in the oxidation state ion intercalation materials including several materials previously used in li ion batteries have recently been investigated to leverage their high salt adsorption capacity and potential for ion selectivity lee et al 2017 singh et al 2020 2018 suss and presser 2018 tan et al 2020 due to a limited choice of anode materials early studies have focused on either metallic counter electrodes such as silver or symmetric electrodes with anion exchange membranes for example silver electrodes have been used for electrochemical sequestration of chloride anions chen et al 2017 kim et al 2017 although they are not favorable energetically and or economically additionally nickel hexacyanoferrate porada et al 2017 and copper hexacyanoferrate kim et al 2016 t kim et al 2017 electrodes have been used in a number of deionization systems the symmetric nature of these systems however required the use of ion exchange membranes considerably increasing the capital cost tan et al 2020 overcame these restrictions through the use of an asymmetric electrode configuration with a hexacyanoferrate cathode and pvfc anode in contrast to electrostatic ion sorption by porous carbon electrodes and ion sequestration by ion intercalating electrodes electrochemically mediated adsorption methods utilizing redox active polymeric materials su et al 2016 su and hatton 2017a can provide strong selectivity for organic anion separations with their high ion adsorption capacity fast kinetics and reversibility redox active materials present a promising direction for water treatment and remediation he et al 2018 beyond the high ion adsorption capacity a crucial requirement for electrosorption materials in water remediation is the ionic selectivity this is particularly important in chemical and pharmaceutical industries where charged organic and or inorganic species are often produced during chemical synthesis and catalytic processes and impose great environmental concern if discharged without proper treatment selective adsorptive removal of target ions in the micromolar range in the presence of excess supporting ions is therefore vital due to their toxicity hardness high value etc and yet is still challenging for conventional adsorption methods attempts have been made with electrosorption methods to achieve higher selectivity towards inorganic salts early studies on capacitive deionization demonstrated weak time dependent selectivity toward ca2 versus na attributing the selectivity to the non linear ion specific adsorption capacity of the edls zhao et al 2012 using sodium intercalating hexacyanoferrate electrodes with nickel porada et al 2017 demonstrated a three fold enhancement of k adsorption versus na more recently singh et al 2020 demonstrated a 15 25 selectivity for na over divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 using the same intercalation electrodes similarly by use of sodium manganese oxide as host material for the cathode kim et al 2017 reported significant selectivity for na over k mg2 and ca2 in a recent work oyarzun et al 2018 showed a 6 5 fold selectivity for nitrate versus chloride ions by modifying activated carbon electrodes with quaternary amine surfactants selectivity towards charged organic anions such as carboxylates sulfonates and phosphonates which are features of many micropollutants of emerging concern in the pharmaceutical industry and of products and byproducts in catalytic chemical processes bäuerlein et al 2012 however has gained much less attention the most relevant study is perhaps the work of su et al 2016 in which the use of a redox active polymer such as polyvinylferrocene pvfc was investigated as another approach for water remediation and especially for adsorption of organic anions in batch operation the redox active polymers could be designed at the molecular level to target specific micropollutants and target anions were selectively adsorbed onto the redox active polymers due to species specific directional hydrogen bonding with the cyclopentadienyl ligand a batch asymmetric cell with functionalization of both electrodes by redox active polymers was subsequently developed to allow for complementary charge storage capacity at the cathode and avoid parasitic reactions su et al 2017 the cobalt based polymer η 5 1 carboxy propylmethacrylate cyclopenta dienyl cobalt η 4 tetraphenylcyclobutadiene used in the cathode is challenging to synthesize however in this work we utilize a more facile and accessible alternate cathode material and extend the batch adsorption studies of organics to a study of a continuous flow system for selective adsorption of trace amounts of organic anions in the presence of a 50 fold excess background electrolyte as depicted in fig 1 our system consists of an electrochemical ion adsorption cell with multiple in line sensors uv vis spectroscopy conductivity and ph to allow real time measurement of the ion adsorption performance and selectivity we use pvfc polymer complexed with multi wall carbon nanotubes as the anode pvfc cnt and polypyrrole ppy polymers doped with a large anion surfactant dodecylbenzenesulfonate dbs as the cathode ppy dbs cnt the latter can be readily synthesized through electropolymerization of pyrrole monomers in the presence of dbs as shown in previous reports han et al 2005 hepel and dentrone 1996 ren et al 2018 the large dbs anionic surfactant anions are entrapped within the polymer layer due to their size this incorporates surface charge within the electrode and renders the polymer an effective host for adsorption of small sized cations such as li na cd2 pb2 ni2 etc the composite is easy to scale up han et al 2005 making this material an ideal cathode for this study we tested our asymmetric system for the selective removal of an organic anion benzoate from an excess background of perchlorate the selectivity of pvfc cnt electrodes towards a range of organic anions incorporating carboxylate sulfonate and phosphonate moieties has been shown in previous studies achilleos and hatton 2016 su et al 2016 su and hatton 2017b and we selected the benzoate anion as a simple representative of organic anions of interest while perchlorate was used due to its non interfering uv absorbance spectrum with that of benzoate we note that perchlorate and benzoate are just examples of many different compounds that could fall under this umbrella and were selected for convenience of quantification with the in line uv vis spectrophotometer importantly using our asymmetric redox active electrodes we demonstrated a three fold cycle selectivity for benzoate anion over a 50 fold abundance of the background anion 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all reagents were purchased from polysciences and sigma aldrich without further purification the electrode substrate was toray carbon paper without ptfe treatment tgp h 60 obtained from vwr scientific 2 2 electrode preparation carbon paper substrates 11 9 mg cm 2 were first cut into swatches of the desired size and wrapped with copper tape and wire to serve as current collectors electrochemical characterization was performed on 1 3 cm electrodes with 1 1 cm surface area exposed to the electrolyte the electrodes used in the flow cell were 2 3 cm in size with exposed surface area of 2 2 cm the pvfc cnt electrodes were prepared by the drop casting of a dispersion of the active material complexes in an appropriate solvent onto the carbon paper substrates a stock solution of 80 mg pvfc and 40 mg multiwalled cnt were dispersed in 10 ml chloroform a second dispersion of 40 mg of cnt in 10 ml chloroform was also prepared the two stock solutions were individually sonicated for 1 5 h in an ice bath to dissolve the polymer and disperse the cnts the pvfc cnt ink was then prepared by mixing the two stock solutions followed by another sonication step to ensure complete dispersion of the redox active polymer and cnts the ink was then drop cast onto the carbon paper substrate in increments of 50 μl and left to dry at room temperature throughout this work a total loading of 0 4 0 8 mg cm 2 of pvfc cnt equivalent to 50 100 μl cm 2 of pvfc cnt ink or 1 2 μmol cm 2 of pvfc was used the ppy dbs cnt electrodes were prepared by electropolymerization of pyrrole in the presence of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs and multiwalled cnts han et al 2005 the cnts were dispersed in 0 1 m sodium dbs aqueous solution and sonicated for 1 h the pyrrole monomer was added to the dispersion in a 7 1 5 pyrrole cnt mass ratio and the emulsion was stirred under ultrasonication for another 15 min at room temperature the composite film was electrochemically deposited onto the carbon paper substrate by electrolyzing the medium at 0 75 v vs ag agcl reference using a platinum wire counter electrode the total electronic charge transferred during the process was controlled to tune the amount of redox active polymer on the substrate the polymer loading was measured gravimetrically with 0 2 mg cm 2 mass equivalent to 0 39 c cm 2 charge after a thorough wash with di water and drying on a hot plate the loading of active material ppy dbs cnt on the cathode ranged from 0 12 to 0 2 mg cm 2 in this work 2 3 electrochemical characterization all electrochemical characterizations including cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry were performed on a versastat 4 potentiostat princeton applied research electrochemical synthesis and characterizations were performed in a 10 ml basi cell in the three electrode configuration platinum wire and ag agcl 3 m nacl were used as the counter and reference electrodes respectively 0 1 m naclo4 was chosen as the supporting electrolyte during the cyclic voltammetry cv experiment 2 and 5 mv s 1 scan rates with voltage windows of 0 0 8 v and 1 to 0 v respectively were applied to the anode 0 8 mg cm 2 loading and cathode 0 2 mg cm 2 loading in chronopotentiometry experiments an anode with 0 8 mg cm 2 pvfc cnt loading was tested under current densities in the range of 0 062 0 62 a g 1 a ppy dbs cnt electrode 0 2 mg cm 2 loading was used to pair with the anode for the full cell tests in deionization experiments 10 mm naclo4 solution was used as the electrolyte the cell voltage was 1 2 v during adsorption and 0 5 v during the desorption step under a constant flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and the pvfc cnt and ppy dbs cnt loadings at anode and cathode were 0 8 mg cm 2 and 0 2 mg cm 2 respectively in selective adsorption experiments a mixture of 12 5 mm naclo4 and 0 25 mm benzoic acid was used the applied voltage across the pvfc cnt and pseudo reference electrodes was 0 35 v and 0 1 v for adsorption and desorption steps respectively the flow rate was 1 ml min 1 and the pvfc cnt and ppy dbs cnt loadings were 0 4 mg cm 2 and 0 12 mg cm 2 respectively 2 4 flow platform as shown in the schematic in fig 2 a the flow system was composed of a peristaltic pump our electrochemical cell influent and effluent containers not shown a potentiostat and a number of flow through sensors in short the peristaltic pump drew the contaminated water from the influent container and passed the solution through the electrochemical cell at a constant flowrate additionally a potentiostat was used to control the voltage of the cell and measure the current or vice versa we used three inline sensors in the downstream of the cell for uv vis spectrophotometric quantification as well as conductivity and ph monitoring the internal volume of the three inline sensors was minimized to alleviate mixing effects within the sensors as much as possible moreover the sampling frequency of each sensor was at least 1 hz which provided adequate time resolution within the residence time of the cell the cell was composed of a pair of 200 μm thick carbon paper electrodes and a 50 μm thick polymer spacer mcmaster carr stacked between two titanium sheets acting as current collectors additionally in order to monitor the potential of the individual electrodes we prepared a pseudo reference electrode by electroplating a thin layer of agcl onto a ag wire in a hcl aqueous solution this electrode was then inserted into the cell stack without direct contact with either electrode the cell assembly had a radial flow structure similar to those discussed by hemmatifar et al 2016 and zhao et al 2010 as demonstrated in fig 2 b the aqueous solution entered the cell through the inlet located in the middle of the anodic current collector and flowed radially outward through the inlet manifold before reversing direction to flow radially inward toward the center of the stack in between the electrodes and collected at the outlet port 2 5 quantification via inline sensors three inline sensors were used to monitor the real time ion adsorption performance of our asymmetric system including a uv vis spectroscopy sensor equipped with a low volume flow through flow cell an electroconductivity sensor and a ph sensor the uv vis light source dh 2000 s duv ttl oceanoptics had a deuterium and tungsten bulb with wavelength in the range of 180 870 nm the uv vis spectrometer flame s uv vis es oceanoptics had a detection range of 190 850 nm a z shaped flow through cell fia z sma ult oceanoptics was used for real time measurement of the uv vis absorbance under flow conditions this cell had a 1 cm light path and an internal volume of only 6 μl to minimize mixing in the sensor two optical fibers qp450 0 25 xsr oceanoptics were used to connect the z shaped cell to the light source and the spectrometer respectively data were visualized and processed by the oceanview oceanoptics software the uv vis spectra were sampled at 2 hz frequency with 5 ms integration time absorbance at 237 nm near maximum adsorbance was used for the purpose of benzoate anion quantification the flow through conductivity sensor et916 edaq had a 17 μl internal volume the micro ph probe 8220bnwp thermo scientific with 2 5 mm outer diameter was inserted into a custom made t junction with an estimated internal volume of 40 μl the conductivity and ph probe were connected to conductivity epu357 edaq and ph epu353 edaq pods for data logging mutha et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrode characterization 3 1 1 electrode surface characteristics scanning electron microscopy sem images of the anode and cathode are presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a and b the pvfc coated carbon nanotubes were wrapped around the carbon fiber substrates and formed a rough porous coating previous studies have shown that the π π interaction between the ferrocene moieties and the carbon nanotubes allows a stable and dispersed film to be formed on the substrate mao et al 2013 enabling fast electron transfer from the carbon fiber substrate to the redox active center of the polymer moreover the porous structure of the polymer coating facilitates ionic transport within the electrode the cathode however exhibited a different morphology as shown in fig 3 c and d in the presence of large anionic surfactants the electrochemically polymerized polypyrrole formed a densely grown film on the carbon fibers the conformal coating around the carbon fibers was less porous than the pvfc cnt complex film and had a thickness of about 2 μm polypyrrole chains served as molecular wires for electron conduction in the cathode tian et al 2015 and enabled fast electron transfer as well 3 1 2 cyclic voltammetry response the electrochemical properties of the redox active electrodes were studied by cyclic voltammetry cv in 0 1 m naclo4 solution as shown in fig 3 e the pvfc cnt anode exhibited distinct redox peaks resulting from the fast and reversible electron transfer of the redox active moieties of the polymer complex the equilibrium potential of the anode estimated to be around 0 3 v vs ag agcl from averaging of the redox peaks is similar to the value reported in the literature mao et al 2013 tian et al 2015 the reaction mechanism at the anode can be written as he et al 2018 fc e a fc a where fc and fc denote the reduced and oxidized states of the redox active center respectively and a denotes the anion in the aqueous solution upon oxidation of the anode the uncharged reduced state ferrocene was oxidized to the ferrocenium and possessed a net positive charge which subsequently adsorbed anions from the solution the strength of which was moderated by hydrogen bonding in addition to the electrostatic attraction with a small portion due to capacitive charging su et al 2016 in the cathode in contrast to a pure ppy film which usually shows a quasi rectangular cv curve due to its capacitive nature tian et al 2015 the ppy dbs cnt film exhibits pseudocapacitive behavior this is evident from the two redox peaks in the cv curve with an equilibrium potential of around 0 5 v vs ag agcl in fig 3 e the redox active property is due to the large anions dbs trapped within the polymer layer during the electropolymerization of the ppy film hepel and dentrone 1996 as noted by ren et al 2018 the hydrophobicity of the conducting polymer can change during the charging and discharging steps which in turn changes the orientation of the surfactant anions and allows sodium ions to intercalate into or deintercalate out of the polymeric film the synthesized ppy film therefore exhibited cation exchange properties with the reaction mechanism ppy n dbs n n e n na ppy dbs n na n due to the successive surface redox reactions of ppy and change of orientation of the surfactants the redox active peaks of ppy dbs cnt complex film were broader than those for the pvfc cnt film furthermore fig 3 e compares the cv responses of a pure cnt film drop cast on the carbon fiber substrate with that of a pvfc cnt composite film the area within the cv sweep indicates the pseudo capacitance of the electrode clearly the capacitance contribution from pure capacitive charging from cnt was negligible compared with that of the pvfc cnt composite the capacitance of the latter mainly stemmed from the faradaic charge transfer process of the redox active moieties the same holds true for the cathode therefore the ion adsorption performance of our asymmetric system was attributed primarily to the specific chemical interactions between the ions and the redox active electrodes i e a nernstian response this behavior contrasts with that of purely capacitive process in which the adsorption of ions depends on incorporation within and stabilization of the electrical double layers moreover the faradaic activation of the redox active moieties provides a high ion adsorption capacity at lower cell voltages while much larger voltage operating windows and therefore higher energy consumption are required to establish sufficient edl capacity in purely capacitive systems he et al 2018 3 1 3 constant current response of the redox active electrode pair we paired the pvfc cnt anode with the ppy dbs cnt cathode and tested the cell under constant current charging and discharging at 100 μa in 0 1 m naclo4 electrolyte the cell voltage across the asymmetric electrode pair was monitored accordingly and is shown in the inset of fig 4 a the electrode pair was initially discharged to prime the redox active centers reduced state for the anode and oxidized state for the cathode and two successive charging discharging cycles were then conducted during the charging step positive current the voltage initially rose rapidly due to capacitive charging followed by a much slower faradaic charging phase during this step the redox active materials were activated and ions adsorbed onto the electrode pair during the discharging step negative current the voltage also fell rapidly initially and later transitioned to a slower decrease rate where the charged state was converted back to the original undoped state and the adsorbed ions were released to the bulk solution contrary to the behavior of purely capacitive materials under constant current charging where the voltage increases linearly with time the response of the redox active electrodes shown in fig 4 a is pseudo capacitive with an evident voltage plateau region for both the anode and the cathode the plateau indicates the faradaic process during which the electrons are transferred between the substrate and the redox active centers under fast kinetics this transfer exhibits a nernstian response where the inflection point of the curves indicates the equilibrium potential i e the redox active centers of the polymers are both half oxidized constant current discharge of the anode was further tested under current densities up to 0 62 a g 1 per mass of pvfc cnt with the results shown in fig 4 b the specific capacitance increased at lower current densities mainly due to a reduced charge and ion transfer resistance within the range of current densities studied the highest specific capacitance of 323 f g 1 occurred at 0 062 a g 1 and decreased steadily to plateau at around 192 f g 1 at 0 62 a g 1 the measured specific capacitance values are in accordance with values reported in the literature mao et al 2013 3 2 flow system 3 2 1 deionization of supporting electrolyte to characterize the electrosorption performance of our asymmetric redox cell under realistic conditions our cell assembly was tested under constant voltage operation and continuous flow of supporting electrolyte in the absence of benzoate anions the anode and cathode had respective loadings of 0 8 mg cm 2 pvfc cnt 8 μmol ferrocene moiety on the 2 2 cm electrode and 0 2 mg cm 2 ppy dbs cnt 16 μmol charge on the 2 2 cm electrode a 10 mm sodium perchlorate electrolyte at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min 1 was used at least three consecutive cycles were performed to ensure dynamic steady state as shown in fig 5 each cycle was composed of a 2 min charging at 1 2 v and a 2 min discharging step at 0 5 v the asymmetric charging and discharging voltages were due to the asymmetric nature of the redox electrodes specifically as shown in fig 3 e the average redox potentials for pvfc and ppy were around 0 3 v and 0 5 v vs ag agcl respectively we used a sufficiently high cell voltage of 1 2 v in charging to ensure pvfc oxidation and ppy reduction and a cell voltage of 0 5 v in discharging for complete pvfc reduction and ppy oxidation our experiments with 0 v discharge voltage not shown resulted in insignificant ion desorption suggesting incomplete reduction of the anode and oxidation of the cathode at 0 v during the charging step the anode was oxidized to form ferrocenium adsorbing anions the ppy dbs cnt cathode was concurrently reduced and adsorbed cations for charge balance the net electrolyte concentration thus decreased during the adsorption step as shown in fig 5 the concentration eventually rose and plateaued at the feed concentration value during the discharge step however the anode was reduced to the uncharged state and released the adsorbed anions to the electrolyte meanwhile the cathode was oxidized to form charged ppy and released the adsorbed cations to the spacer the total concentration thus increased rapidly initially and later gradually approached the feed concentration the local ph value also varied during the electrosorption process partially due to multiple parasitic reactions occurring on the electrodes such as carbon oxidation hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction a number of other reactions are also believed to be possibly responsible for ph variations during the operation as reported by holubowitch et al 2017 tang et al 2017 and choi 2014 further the ppy polymer can potentially participate in hydroxyl donation and acceptance increasing decreasing the solution ph during adsorption desorption step additionally our results showed that the total cycle charge efficiency of the process defined as the amount of salt removed per charge passed i e λ q s a l t q c h a r g e q c i n c d t i d t f with q being the volumetric flow rate c the concentration of anions cations and f the faraday constant is calculated to be 60 we believe the loss of charge efficiency was due to co ion repulsion as well as parasitic reactions in this case avraham et al 2011 biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 3 2 2 selective adsorption of benzoate in the presence of excess supporting electrolyte as stated earlier redox active electrode adsorbents provide promising selectivity towards certain target ions in water treatment applications oyarzun et al 2018b palko et al 2018 su et al 2016 su and hatton 2017b previous studies have shown high selectivity of the pvfc cnt electrode towards organic anions with electron donating groups such as carboxylic sulfonic and phosphoric acids su et al 2016 the mechanism of selectivity reportedly stems from the hydrogen bonding between the redox active moieties of the polymer in the charged state i e ferrocenium and the target anions the strength of which is modulated by the electron withdrawing capabilities of the substituent groups this hydrogen bonding is considerably stronger than the electrostatic interaction with the supporting anions purely due to the electric charge we here extend the previous observation performed in batch systems to a new system with asymmetric redox active electrodes under flow conditions our flow system provides a more realistic assessment of dynamic selectivity of the material during cyclic charging and discharging rather than selectivity based on a single equilibrium adsorption step under batch conditions for convenience in measurement we selected benzoic acid as representative of carboxylic acids in our study and used sodium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte perchlorate as the competing anion fig 6 demonstrates the ion adsorption performance and the selectivity towards the target anions i e benzoate of the adsorption cell with the mixture stream a three electrode setup was used to monitor the overall cell voltage as well as the voltage drop between the anode and our custom built pseudo reference electrode a ag agcl wire positioned in between the cell electrodes see section 2 4 for more information a constant voltage was applied between the anode and the pseudo reference electrode and the total cell voltage was monitored simultaneously the voltage and current results are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively at the end of the adsorption and desorption steps the cell voltages reached 0 72 v and 0 05 v respectively the voltage difference between the cathode and the pseudo reference was therefore 0 37 v during adsorption and 0 15 v during desorption as discussed earlier the anode was oxidized to ferrocenium during the adsorption step during which process the ferrocenium favorably bound the benzoate over perchlorate as a result of more polarized electronic cloud this was despite the fact that the concentration of benzoate was considerably lower 50 fold than that of the competing anions at the cathode on the other hand the sodium and hydronium ions were adsorbed to the electrode surface to balance the charge transferred to this electrode without the redox active materials on the cathode significant parasitic water splitting and other reactions could occur reducing total salt concentration during the adsorption step in order to quantify the anode selectivity between the two anions the effluent ph and the concentration of both the perchlorate and the benzoate were measured in situ via a ph probe a flow through conductivity probe and a uv vis spectrophotometer fig 6 c and d show respectively the effluent ph and the normalized concentration profiles for the target and supporting anions which can be used to quantify the ion selectivity the theoretical upper limit for the adsorption selectivity can be estimated from the relative chemical binding energies for the different anions i e from k a d e δ e b i n d r t however the observable in effluent selectivity during operation of the flow cell is affected by the dynamics of the ion transport in addition to this chemical binding oyarzun et al 2018a to this end we calculated the cycle or observable selectivity from experiments as s a x q a e q c a e q q x e q c x e q where q a e q c a e q represents the adsorbed amount of target anion under dynamic steady state normalized by its equilibrium bulk concentration under flow condition this is equivalent to the influent concentration and q x e q c x e q represents the same ratio for the supporting anion the equilibrium ion adsorption amount was determined by integrating the concentration profile below the feed concentration q e q q c i n c d t for individual anions under flow conditions with a 50 fold abundance of the supporting anions our results show a cycle selectivity of 3 we note that the reduced cycle selectivity compared to a single adsorption step in batch system is expected oyarzun et al 2018a firstly the cycle selectivity was obtained under flow conditions which poses mass transfer limitations and charge transfer resistance in the system secondly unlike batch adsorption studies our flow cell reached a dynamic steady state therefore the cycle selectivity is truly reversible without contributions from initial physisorption the adsorption of the perchlorate ions and stabilization of the ferrocenium moieties on the electrode surface was rapid because of the significant excess of this anion relative to the benzoate with time however the more dilute benzoate began to adsorb on the electrode and because it has a higher binding strength with ferrocenium than perchlorate does su et al 2016 it displaced the perchlorate anion resulting in that the ratio of adsorbed benzoate relative to perchlorate was 3 times higher than their ratio in the feed stream in addition to concentration measurements we also quantified the charge efficiency associated with the selective adsorption experiments the charge efficiency of the deionization experiment with 10 mm naclo4 binary electrolyte refer to section 3 2 for more details was 60 in the presence of benzoic acid on the other hand the charge efficiency increased significantly by almost 50 to values as high as 87 we hypothesize this is due to the buffer effect of benzoic acid weak acid with pk a 4 2 that tends to stabilize the ph in the mixture solution lower ph variations in this case are evident in fig 6 c compared to that in binary electrolyte experiment of fig 5 lastly the key independent metrics for water treatment and remediation recently proposed by hawks et al 2018 to facilitate benchmarking with other water treatment techniques are generally based on the total electrode mass as usually the entire electrode constitutes the active material these metrics may not be the most appropriate for the redox active polymeric systems discussed here however for which the amount of active material is the important determinant of capacity and not the supporting substrate or current collectors which can constitute more than 90 of the total electrode mass moreover for selective separations with the classes of compounds considered in this work the amount adsorbed is more conveniently expressed in moles per gram of material since adsorption is generally determined by specific interactions between the sorbate and the redox active moieties on the sorbent often close to stoichiometric su et al 2016 2017 2018 and this metric would provide a more direct evaluation of selectivity between different compounds than would one based on solute mass or equivalent solute mass from a process design perspective a convenient metric would be the molar adsorption capacity of the solute per geometric electrode area smolaca in mol m 2 for the current system the value of smolaca is 2 mmol m 2 while the capacity normalized by the active electrode mass smolacm is 0 38 mmol g 1 in general smacmol should be independent of active material loading on the electrode substrate while smolaca will depend on the loading percentage the mass based performance metrics while not totally appropriate for our system can nevertheless be calculated and are salt adsorption capacity sac of 22 5 mg g 1 nacl equiv salt adsorption per active material mass equivalent to 0 48 mg salt per g of total electrode mass with both active material and substrate mass included average salt adsorption rate asar of 5 6 mg g 1 min 1 per active material mass equivalent to 0 12 mg min 1 per g of total electrode mass productivity of 75 l h 1 m 2 and volumetric energy consumption e v of 47 wh m 3 importantly we note that the sac and asar performance metrics per total electrode mass basis can be readily improved by simply increasing the active material loading in future designs 4 conclusions we investigated a flow system with asymmetric redox active electrodes for electrochemically mediated and highly selective adsorption and desorption of organic anions we used a pvfc redox polymer with selective anion adsorption capability as the anode and a ppy conducting polymer with cation adsorption properties as the cathode the system was tested for selective removal of benzoate anion as a model compound of toxic carboxylates an important group of micropollutants under a highly abundant supporting anion with 50 fold initial excess concentration the system demonstrated a selectivity of 3 towards the target anion in this study we demonstrated and validated the electrochemically mediated adsorption technology for both deionization and water remediation applications our flow platform equipped with multiple inline sensors can facilitate the optimization of the experimental conditions such as electrode loading flow regimes and applied voltage window and can be easily extended to target other ionic species of environmental concern such as organic anion heavy metal oxyanions and cations a number of challenges should be addressed in the future development and improvement of flow systems for selective separations applications including 1 optimum mechanical

17793,electrochemically mediated adsorption is an emerging technology that utilizes redox active or faradaic materials and has exhibited high salt adsorption capacity and superb ion selectivity here we use a redox polymer polyvinylferrocene pvfc as the anode and a conducting polymer polypyrrole doped with a large anionic surfactant ppy dbs as the cathode for selective electrochemical removal of inorganic and organic components we fabricated a flow system with alternating adsorption desorption steps incorporating an electrosorption cell and inline probes ultraviolet visible spectroscopy conductivity and ph sensors to demonstrate on the fly quantification of the ion adsorption performance the flow system provides a more realistic evaluation of dynamic selectivity for the active materials during cyclic operation than that based on a single equilibrium adsorption step in batch our results show a three fold cycle selectivity toward the removal of benzoate as a representative organic anion against a 50 fold abundance of perchlorate supporting anion indicating that electrochemically mediated adsorption is a promising technology for waste water remediation applications

treatment and remediation have attracted great attention in recent years grimm et al 1998 oren 2008 su and hatton 2017a suss et al 2015 compared with techniques such as thermal pressure and ph swing electrochemical methods tailored for water treatment can potentially be operated under ambient temperature and pressure and do not require chemical regeneration or other post treatments moreover electrochemical methods are modular have lower footprint and are highly scalable various electrode materials have been employed for electrosorptive ion separation for example highly porous activated carbons allow for electrostatic entrapment of ions within their electric double layer edl ion intercalating materials such as sodium manganese oxide can sequester ions within their host sites and redox active materials such as polyvinylferrocene pvfc are able to bind favorably with certain ions due to specific interactions between the electronic cloud of the active material and the target ions when in the oxidation state ion intercalation materials including several materials previously used in li ion batteries have recently been investigated to leverage their high salt adsorption capacity and potential for ion selectivity lee et al 2017 singh et al 2020 2018 suss and presser 2018 tan et al 2020 due to a limited choice of anode materials early studies have focused on either metallic counter electrodes such as silver or symmetric electrodes with anion exchange membranes for example silver electrodes have been used for electrochemical sequestration of chloride anions chen et al 2017 kim et al 2017 although they are not favorable energetically and or economically additionally nickel hexacyanoferrate porada et al 2017 and copper hexacyanoferrate kim et al 2016 t kim et al 2017 electrodes have been used in a number of deionization systems the symmetric nature of these systems however required the use of ion exchange membranes considerably increasing the capital cost tan et al 2020 overcame these restrictions through the use of an asymmetric electrode configuration with a hexacyanoferrate cathode and pvfc anode in contrast to electrostatic ion sorption by porous carbon electrodes and ion sequestration by ion intercalating electrodes electrochemically mediated adsorption methods utilizing redox active polymeric materials su et al 2016 su and hatton 2017a can provide strong selectivity for organic anion separations with their high ion adsorption capacity fast kinetics and reversibility redox active materials present a promising direction for water treatment and remediation he et al 2018 beyond the high ion adsorption capacity a crucial requirement for electrosorption materials in water remediation is the ionic selectivity this is particularly important in chemical and pharmaceutical industries where charged organic and or inorganic species are often produced during chemical synthesis and catalytic processes and impose great environmental concern if discharged without proper treatment selective adsorptive removal of target ions in the micromolar range in the presence of excess supporting ions is therefore vital due to their toxicity hardness high value etc and yet is still challenging for conventional adsorption methods attempts have been made with electrosorption methods to achieve higher selectivity towards inorganic salts early studies on capacitive deionization demonstrated weak time dependent selectivity toward ca2 versus na attributing the selectivity to the non linear ion specific adsorption capacity of the edls zhao et al 2012 using sodium intercalating hexacyanoferrate electrodes with nickel porada et al 2017 demonstrated a three fold enhancement of k adsorption versus na more recently singh et al 2020 demonstrated a 15 25 selectivity for na over divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 using the same intercalation electrodes similarly by use of sodium manganese oxide as host material for the cathode kim et al 2017 reported significant selectivity for na over k mg2 and ca2 in a recent work oyarzun et al 2018 showed a 6 5 fold selectivity for nitrate versus chloride ions by modifying activated carbon electrodes with quaternary amine surfactants selectivity towards charged organic anions such as carboxylates sulfonates and phosphonates which are features of many micropollutants of emerging concern in the pharmaceutical industry and of products and byproducts in catalytic chemical processes bäuerlein et al 2012 however has gained much less attention the most relevant study is perhaps the work of su et al 2016 in which the use of a redox active polymer such as polyvinylferrocene pvfc was investigated as another approach for water remediation and especially for adsorption of organic anions in batch operation the redox active polymers could be designed at the molecular level to target specific micropollutants and target anions were selectively adsorbed onto the redox active polymers due to species specific directional hydrogen bonding with the cyclopentadienyl ligand a batch asymmetric cell with functionalization of both electrodes by redox active polymers was subsequently developed to allow for complementary charge storage capacity at the cathode and avoid parasitic reactions su et al 2017 the cobalt based polymer η 5 1 carboxy propylmethacrylate cyclopenta dienyl cobalt η 4 tetraphenylcyclobutadiene used in the cathode is challenging to synthesize however in this work we utilize a more facile and accessible alternate cathode material and extend the batch adsorption studies of organics to a study of a continuous flow system for selective adsorption of trace amounts of organic anions in the presence of a 50 fold excess background electrolyte as depicted in fig 1 our system consists of an electrochemical ion adsorption cell with multiple in line sensors uv vis spectroscopy conductivity and ph to allow real time measurement of the ion adsorption performance and selectivity we use pvfc polymer complexed with multi wall carbon nanotubes as the anode pvfc cnt and polypyrrole ppy polymers doped with a large anion surfactant dodecylbenzenesulfonate dbs as the cathode ppy dbs cnt the latter can be readily synthesized through electropolymerization of pyrrole monomers in the presence of dbs as shown in previous reports han et al 2005 hepel and dentrone 1996 ren et al 2018 the large dbs anionic surfactant anions are entrapped within the polymer layer due to their size this incorporates surface charge within the electrode and renders the polymer an effective host for adsorption of small sized cations such as li na cd2 pb2 ni2 etc the composite is easy to scale up han et al 2005 making this material an ideal cathode for this study we tested our asymmetric system for the selective removal of an organic anion benzoate from an excess background of perchlorate the selectivity of pvfc cnt electrodes towards a range of organic anions incorporating carboxylate sulfonate and phosphonate moieties has been shown in previous studies achilleos and hatton 2016 su et al 2016 su and hatton 2017b and we selected the benzoate anion as a simple representative of organic anions of interest while perchlorate was used due to its non interfering uv absorbance spectrum with that of benzoate we note that perchlorate and benzoate are just examples of many different compounds that could fall under this umbrella and were selected for convenience of quantification with the in line uv vis spectrophotometer importantly using our asymmetric redox active electrodes we demonstrated a three fold cycle selectivity for benzoate anion over a 50 fold abundance of the background anion 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all reagents were purchased from polysciences and sigma aldrich without further purification the electrode substrate was toray carbon paper without ptfe treatment tgp h 60 obtained from vwr scientific 2 2 electrode preparation carbon paper substrates 11 9 mg cm 2 were first cut into swatches of the desired size and wrapped with copper tape and wire to serve as current collectors electrochemical characterization was performed on 1 3 cm electrodes with 1 1 cm surface area exposed to the electrolyte the electrodes used in the flow cell were 2 3 cm in size with exposed surface area of 2 2 cm the pvfc cnt electrodes were prepared by the drop casting of a dispersion of the active material complexes in an appropriate solvent onto the carbon paper substrates a stock solution of 80 mg pvfc and 40 mg multiwalled cnt were dispersed in 10 ml chloroform a second dispersion of 40 mg of cnt in 10 ml chloroform was also prepared the two stock solutions were individually sonicated for 1 5 h in an ice bath to dissolve the polymer and disperse the cnts the pvfc cnt ink was then prepared by mixing the two stock solutions followed by another sonication step to ensure complete dispersion of the redox active polymer and cnts the ink was then drop cast onto the carbon paper substrate in increments of 50 μl and left to dry at room temperature throughout this work a total loading of 0 4 0 8 mg cm 2 of pvfc cnt equivalent to 50 100 μl cm 2 of pvfc cnt ink or 1 2 μmol cm 2 of pvfc was used the ppy dbs cnt electrodes were prepared by electropolymerization of pyrrole in the presence of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs and multiwalled cnts han et al 2005 the cnts were dispersed in 0 1 m sodium dbs aqueous solution and sonicated for 1 h the pyrrole monomer was added to the dispersion in a 7 1 5 pyrrole cnt mass ratio and the emulsion was stirred under ultrasonication for another 15 min at room temperature the composite film was electrochemically deposited onto the carbon paper substrate by electrolyzing the medium at 0 75 v vs ag agcl reference using a platinum wire counter electrode the total electronic charge transferred during the process was controlled to tune the amount of redox active polymer on the substrate the polymer loading was measured gravimetrically with 0 2 mg cm 2 mass equivalent to 0 39 c cm 2 charge after a thorough wash with di water and drying on a hot plate the loading of active material ppy dbs cnt on the cathode ranged from 0 12 to 0 2 mg cm 2 in this work 2 3 electrochemical characterization all electrochemical characterizations including cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry were performed on a versastat 4 potentiostat princeton applied research electrochemical synthesis and characterizations were performed in a 10 ml basi cell in the three electrode configuration platinum wire and ag agcl 3 m nacl were used as the counter and reference electrodes respectively 0 1 m naclo4 was chosen as the supporting electrolyte during the cyclic voltammetry cv experiment 2 and 5 mv s 1 scan rates with voltage windows of 0 0 8 v and 1 to 0 v respectively were applied to the anode 0 8 mg cm 2 loading and cathode 0 2 mg cm 2 loading in chronopotentiometry experiments an anode with 0 8 mg cm 2 pvfc cnt loading was tested under current densities in the range of 0 062 0 62 a g 1 a ppy dbs cnt electrode 0 2 mg cm 2 loading was used to pair with the anode for the full cell tests in deionization experiments 10 mm naclo4 solution was used as the electrolyte the cell voltage was 1 2 v during adsorption and 0 5 v during the desorption step under a constant flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and the pvfc cnt and ppy dbs cnt loadings at anode and cathode were 0 8 mg cm 2 and 0 2 mg cm 2 respectively in selective adsorption experiments a mixture of 12 5 mm naclo4 and 0 25 mm benzoic acid was used the applied voltage across the pvfc cnt and pseudo reference electrodes was 0 35 v and 0 1 v for adsorption and desorption steps respectively the flow rate was 1 ml min 1 and the pvfc cnt and ppy dbs cnt loadings were 0 4 mg cm 2 and 0 12 mg cm 2 respectively 2 4 flow platform as shown in the schematic in fig 2 a the flow system was composed of a peristaltic pump our electrochemical cell influent and effluent containers not shown a potentiostat and a number of flow through sensors in short the peristaltic pump drew the contaminated water from the influent container and passed the solution through the electrochemical cell at a constant flowrate additionally a potentiostat was used to control the voltage of the cell and measure the current or vice versa we used three inline sensors in the downstream of the cell for uv vis spectrophotometric quantification as well as conductivity and ph monitoring the internal volume of the three inline sensors was minimized to alleviate mixing effects within the sensors as much as possible moreover the sampling frequency of each sensor was at least 1 hz which provided adequate time resolution within the residence time of the cell the cell was composed of a pair of 200 μm thick carbon paper electrodes and a 50 μm thick polymer spacer mcmaster carr stacked between two titanium sheets acting as current collectors additionally in order to monitor the potential of the individual electrodes we prepared a pseudo reference electrode by electroplating a thin layer of agcl onto a ag wire in a hcl aqueous solution this electrode was then inserted into the cell stack without direct contact with either electrode the cell assembly had a radial flow structure similar to those discussed by hemmatifar et al 2016 and zhao et al 2010 as demonstrated in fig 2 b the aqueous solution entered the cell through the inlet located in the middle of the anodic current collector and flowed radially outward through the inlet manifold before reversing direction to flow radially inward toward the center of the stack in between the electrodes and collected at the outlet port 2 5 quantification via inline sensors three inline sensors were used to monitor the real time ion adsorption performance of our asymmetric system including a uv vis spectroscopy sensor equipped with a low volume flow through flow cell an electroconductivity sensor and a ph sensor the uv vis light source dh 2000 s duv ttl oceanoptics had a deuterium and tungsten bulb with wavelength in the range of 180 870 nm the uv vis spectrometer flame s uv vis es oceanoptics had a detection range of 190 850 nm a z shaped flow through cell fia z sma ult oceanoptics was used for real time measurement of the uv vis absorbance under flow conditions this cell had a 1 cm light path and an internal volume of only 6 μl to minimize mixing in the sensor two optical fibers qp450 0 25 xsr oceanoptics were used to connect the z shaped cell to the light source and the spectrometer respectively data were visualized and processed by the oceanview oceanoptics software the uv vis spectra were sampled at 2 hz frequency with 5 ms integration time absorbance at 237 nm near maximum adsorbance was used for the purpose of benzoate anion quantification the flow through conductivity sensor et916 edaq had a 17 μl internal volume the micro ph probe 8220bnwp thermo scientific with 2 5 mm outer diameter was inserted into a custom made t junction with an estimated internal volume of 40 μl the conductivity and ph probe were connected to conductivity epu357 edaq and ph epu353 edaq pods for data logging mutha et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrode characterization 3 1 1 electrode surface characteristics scanning electron microscopy sem images of the anode and cathode are presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a and b the pvfc coated carbon nanotubes were wrapped around the carbon fiber substrates and formed a rough porous coating previous studies have shown that the π π interaction between the ferrocene moieties and the carbon nanotubes allows a stable and dispersed film to be formed on the substrate mao et al 2013 enabling fast electron transfer from the carbon fiber substrate to the redox active center of the polymer moreover the porous structure of the polymer coating facilitates ionic transport within the electrode the cathode however exhibited a different morphology as shown in fig 3 c and d in the presence of large anionic surfactants the electrochemically polymerized polypyrrole formed a densely grown film on the carbon fibers the conformal coating around the carbon fibers was less porous than the pvfc cnt complex film and had a thickness of about 2 μm polypyrrole chains served as molecular wires for electron conduction in the cathode tian et al 2015 and enabled fast electron transfer as well 3 1 2 cyclic voltammetry response the electrochemical properties of the redox active electrodes were studied by cyclic voltammetry cv in 0 1 m naclo4 solution as shown in fig 3 e the pvfc cnt anode exhibited distinct redox peaks resulting from the fast and reversible electron transfer of the redox active moieties of the polymer complex the equilibrium potential of the anode estimated to be around 0 3 v vs ag agcl from averaging of the redox peaks is similar to the value reported in the literature mao et al 2013 tian et al 2015 the reaction mechanism at the anode can be written as he et al 2018 fc e a fc a where fc and fc denote the reduced and oxidized states of the redox active center respectively and a denotes the anion in the aqueous solution upon oxidation of the anode the uncharged reduced state ferrocene was oxidized to the ferrocenium and possessed a net positive charge which subsequently adsorbed anions from the solution the strength of which was moderated by hydrogen bonding in addition to the electrostatic attraction with a small portion due to capacitive charging su et al 2016 in the cathode in contrast to a pure ppy film which usually shows a quasi rectangular cv curve due to its capacitive nature tian et al 2015 the ppy dbs cnt film exhibits pseudocapacitive behavior this is evident from the two redox peaks in the cv curve with an equilibrium potential of around 0 5 v vs ag agcl in fig 3 e the redox active property is due to the large anions dbs trapped within the polymer layer during the electropolymerization of the ppy film hepel and dentrone 1996 as noted by ren et al 2018 the hydrophobicity of the conducting polymer can change during the charging and discharging steps which in turn changes the orientation of the surfactant anions and allows sodium ions to intercalate into or deintercalate out of the polymeric film the synthesized ppy film therefore exhibited cation exchange properties with the reaction mechanism ppy n dbs n n e n na ppy dbs n na n due to the successive surface redox reactions of ppy and change of orientation of the surfactants the redox active peaks of ppy dbs cnt complex film were broader than those for the pvfc cnt film furthermore fig 3 e compares the cv responses of a pure cnt film drop cast on the carbon fiber substrate with that of a pvfc cnt composite film the area within the cv sweep indicates the pseudo capacitance of the electrode clearly the capacitance contribution from pure capacitive charging from cnt was negligible compared with that of the pvfc cnt composite the capacitance of the latter mainly stemmed from the faradaic charge transfer process of the redox active moieties the same holds true for the cathode therefore the ion adsorption performance of our asymmetric system was attributed primarily to the specific chemical interactions between the ions and the redox active electrodes i e a nernstian response this behavior contrasts with that of purely capacitive process in which the adsorption of ions depends on incorporation within and stabilization of the electrical double layers moreover the faradaic activation of the redox active moieties provides a high ion adsorption capacity at lower cell voltages while much larger voltage operating windows and therefore higher energy consumption are required to establish sufficient edl capacity in purely capacitive systems he et al 2018 3 1 3 constant current response of the redox active electrode pair we paired the pvfc cnt anode with the ppy dbs cnt cathode and tested the cell under constant current charging and discharging at 100 μa in 0 1 m naclo4 electrolyte the cell voltage across the asymmetric electrode pair was monitored accordingly and is shown in the inset of fig 4 a the electrode pair was initially discharged to prime the redox active centers reduced state for the anode and oxidized state for the cathode and two successive charging discharging cycles were then conducted during the charging step positive current the voltage initially rose rapidly due to capacitive charging followed by a much slower faradaic charging phase during this step the redox active materials were activated and ions adsorbed onto the electrode pair during the discharging step negative current the voltage also fell rapidly initially and later transitioned to a slower decrease rate where the charged state was converted back to the original undoped state and the adsorbed ions were released to the bulk solution contrary to the behavior of purely capacitive materials under constant current charging where the voltage increases linearly with time the response of the redox active electrodes shown in fig 4 a is pseudo capacitive with an evident voltage plateau region for both the anode and the cathode the plateau indicates the faradaic process during which the electrons are transferred between the substrate and the redox active centers under fast kinetics this transfer exhibits a nernstian response where the inflection point of the curves indicates the equilibrium potential i e the redox active centers of the polymers are both half oxidized constant current discharge of the anode was further tested under current densities up to 0 62 a g 1 per mass of pvfc cnt with the results shown in fig 4 b the specific capacitance increased at lower current densities mainly due to a reduced charge and ion transfer resistance within the range of current densities studied the highest specific capacitance of 323 f g 1 occurred at 0 062 a g 1 and decreased steadily to plateau at around 192 f g 1 at 0 62 a g 1 the measured specific capacitance values are in accordance with values reported in the literature mao et al 2013 3 2 flow system 3 2 1 deionization of supporting electrolyte to characterize the electrosorption performance of our asymmetric redox cell under realistic conditions our cell assembly was tested under constant voltage operation and continuous flow of supporting electrolyte in the absence of benzoate anions the anode and cathode had respective loadings of 0 8 mg cm 2 pvfc cnt 8 μmol ferrocene moiety on the 2 2 cm electrode and 0 2 mg cm 2 ppy dbs cnt 16 μmol charge on the 2 2 cm electrode a 10 mm sodium perchlorate electrolyte at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min 1 was used at least three consecutive cycles were performed to ensure dynamic steady state as shown in fig 5 each cycle was composed of a 2 min charging at 1 2 v and a 2 min discharging step at 0 5 v the asymmetric charging and discharging voltages were due to the asymmetric nature of the redox electrodes specifically as shown in fig 3 e the average redox potentials for pvfc and ppy were around 0 3 v and 0 5 v vs ag agcl respectively we used a sufficiently high cell voltage of 1 2 v in charging to ensure pvfc oxidation and ppy reduction and a cell voltage of 0 5 v in discharging for complete pvfc reduction and ppy oxidation our experiments with 0 v discharge voltage not shown resulted in insignificant ion desorption suggesting incomplete reduction of the anode and oxidation of the cathode at 0 v during the charging step the anode was oxidized to form ferrocenium adsorbing anions the ppy dbs cnt cathode was concurrently reduced and adsorbed cations for charge balance the net electrolyte concentration thus decreased during the adsorption step as shown in fig 5 the concentration eventually rose and plateaued at the feed concentration value during the discharge step however the anode was reduced to the uncharged state and released the adsorbed anions to the electrolyte meanwhile the cathode was oxidized to form charged ppy and released the adsorbed cations to the spacer the total concentration thus increased rapidly initially and later gradually approached the feed concentration the local ph value also varied during the electrosorption process partially due to multiple parasitic reactions occurring on the electrodes such as carbon oxidation hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction a number of other reactions are also believed to be possibly responsible for ph variations during the operation as reported by holubowitch et al 2017 tang et al 2017 and choi 2014 further the ppy polymer can potentially participate in hydroxyl donation and acceptance increasing decreasing the solution ph during adsorption desorption step additionally our results showed that the total cycle charge efficiency of the process defined as the amount of salt removed per charge passed i e λ q s a l t q c h a r g e q c i n c d t i d t f with q being the volumetric flow rate c the concentration of anions cations and f the faraday constant is calculated to be 60 we believe the loss of charge efficiency was due to co ion repulsion as well as parasitic reactions in this case avraham et al 2011 biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 3 2 2 selective adsorption of benzoate in the presence of excess supporting electrolyte as stated earlier redox active electrode adsorbents provide promising selectivity towards certain target ions in water treatment applications oyarzun et al 2018b palko et al 2018 su et al 2016 su and hatton 2017b previous studies have shown high selectivity of the pvfc cnt electrode towards organic anions with electron donating groups such as carboxylic sulfonic and phosphoric acids su et al 2016 the mechanism of selectivity reportedly stems from the hydrogen bonding between the redox active moieties of the polymer in the charged state i e ferrocenium and the target anions the strength of which is modulated by the electron withdrawing capabilities of the substituent groups this hydrogen bonding is considerably stronger than the electrostatic interaction with the supporting anions purely due to the electric charge we here extend the previous observation performed in batch systems to a new system with asymmetric redox active electrodes under flow conditions our flow system provides a more realistic assessment of dynamic selectivity of the material during cyclic charging and discharging rather than selectivity based on a single equilibrium adsorption step under batch conditions for convenience in measurement we selected benzoic acid as representative of carboxylic acids in our study and used sodium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte perchlorate as the competing anion fig 6 demonstrates the ion adsorption performance and the selectivity towards the target anions i e benzoate of the adsorption cell with the mixture stream a three electrode setup was used to monitor the overall cell voltage as well as the voltage drop between the anode and our custom built pseudo reference electrode a ag agcl wire positioned in between the cell electrodes see section 2 4 for more information a constant voltage was applied between the anode and the pseudo reference electrode and the total cell voltage was monitored simultaneously the voltage and current results are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively at the end of the adsorption and desorption steps the cell voltages reached 0 72 v and 0 05 v respectively the voltage difference between the cathode and the pseudo reference was therefore 0 37 v during adsorption and 0 15 v during desorption as discussed earlier the anode was oxidized to ferrocenium during the adsorption step during which process the ferrocenium favorably bound the benzoate over perchlorate as a result of more polarized electronic cloud this was despite the fact that the concentration of benzoate was considerably lower 50 fold than that of the competing anions at the cathode on the other hand the sodium and hydronium ions were adsorbed to the electrode surface to balance the charge transferred to this electrode without the redox active materials on the cathode significant parasitic water splitting and other reactions could occur reducing total salt concentration during the adsorption step in order to quantify the anode selectivity between the two anions the effluent ph and the concentration of both the perchlorate and the benzoate were measured in situ via a ph probe a flow through conductivity probe and a uv vis spectrophotometer fig 6 c and d show respectively the effluent ph and the normalized concentration profiles for the target and supporting anions which can be used to quantify the ion selectivity the theoretical upper limit for the adsorption selectivity can be estimated from the relative chemical binding energies for the different anions i e from k a d e δ e b i n d r t however the observable in effluent selectivity during operation of the flow cell is affected by the dynamics of the ion transport in addition to this chemical binding oyarzun et al 2018a to this end we calculated the cycle or observable selectivity from experiments as s a x q a e q c a e q q x e q c x e q where q a e q c a e q represents the adsorbed amount of target anion under dynamic steady state normalized by its equilibrium bulk concentration under flow condition this is equivalent to the influent concentration and q x e q c x e q represents the same ratio for the supporting anion the equilibrium ion adsorption amount was determined by integrating the concentration profile below the feed concentration q e q q c i n c d t for individual anions under flow conditions with a 50 fold abundance of the supporting anions our results show a cycle selectivity of 3 we note that the reduced cycle selectivity compared to a single adsorption step in batch system is expected oyarzun et al 2018a firstly the cycle selectivity was obtained under flow conditions which poses mass transfer limitations and charge transfer resistance in the system secondly unlike batch adsorption studies our flow cell reached a dynamic steady state therefore the cycle selectivity is truly reversible without contributions from initial physisorption the adsorption of the perchlorate ions and stabilization of the ferrocenium moieties on the electrode surface was rapid because of the significant excess of this anion relative to the benzoate with time however the more dilute benzoate began to adsorb on the electrode and because it has a higher binding strength with ferrocenium than perchlorate does su et al 2016 it displaced the perchlorate anion resulting in that the ratio of adsorbed benzoate relative to perchlorate was 3 times higher than their ratio in the feed stream in addition to concentration measurements we also quantified the charge efficiency associated with the selective adsorption experiments the charge efficiency of the deionization experiment with 10 mm naclo4 binary electrolyte refer to section 3 2 for more details was 60 in the presence of benzoic acid on the other hand the charge efficiency increased significantly by almost 50 to values as high as 87 we hypothesize this is due to the buffer effect of benzoic acid weak acid with pk a 4 2 that tends to stabilize the ph in the mixture solution lower ph variations in this case are evident in fig 6 c compared to that in binary electrolyte experiment of fig 5 lastly the key independent metrics for water treatment and remediation recently proposed by hawks et al 2018 to facilitate benchmarking with other water treatment techniques are generally based on the total electrode mass as usually the entire electrode constitutes the active material these metrics may not be the most appropriate for the redox active polymeric systems discussed here however for which the amount of active material is the important determinant of capacity and not the supporting substrate or current collectors which can constitute more than 90 of the total electrode mass moreover for selective separations with the classes of compounds considered in this work the amount adsorbed is more conveniently expressed in moles per gram of material since adsorption is generally determined by specific interactions between the sorbate and the redox active moieties on the sorbent often close to stoichiometric su et al 2016 2017 2018 and this metric would provide a more direct evaluation of selectivity between different compounds than would one based on solute mass or equivalent solute mass from a process design perspective a convenient metric would be the molar adsorption capacity of the solute per geometric electrode area smolaca in mol m 2 for the current system the value of smolaca is 2 mmol m 2 while the capacity normalized by the active electrode mass smolacm is 0 38 mmol g 1 in general smacmol should be independent of active material loading on the electrode substrate while smolaca will depend on the loading percentage the mass based performance metrics while not totally appropriate for our system can nevertheless be calculated and are salt adsorption capacity sac of 22 5 mg g 1 nacl equiv salt adsorption per active material mass equivalent to 0 48 mg salt per g of total electrode mass with both active material and substrate mass included average salt adsorption rate asar of 5 6 mg g 1 min 1 per active material mass equivalent to 0 12 mg min 1 per g of total electrode mass productivity of 75 l h 1 m 2 and volumetric energy consumption e v of 47 wh m 3 importantly we note that the sac and asar performance metrics per total electrode mass basis can be readily improved by simply increasing the active material loading in future designs 4 conclusions we investigated a flow system with asymmetric redox active electrodes for electrochemically mediated and highly selective adsorption and desorption of organic anions we used a pvfc redox polymer with selective anion adsorption capability as the anode and a ppy conducting polymer with cation adsorption properties as the cathode the system was tested for selective removal of benzoate anion as a model compound of toxic carboxylates an important group of micropollutants under a highly abundant supporting anion with 50 fold initial excess concentration the system demonstrated a selectivity of 3 towards the target anion in this study we demonstrated and validated the electrochemically mediated adsorption technology for both deionization and water remediation applications our flow platform equipped with multiple inline sensors can facilitate the optimization of the experimental conditions such as electrode loading flow regimes and applied voltage window and can be easily extended to target other ionic species of environmental concern such as organic anion heavy metal oxyanions and cations a number of challenges should be addressed in the future development and improvement of flow systems for selective separations applications including 1 optimum mechanical design for reduction of dispersion effects in the cell which tends to lower the flow efficiency and 2 fast sensitive non destructive and non interfering with one another in line quantification methods

17794,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have raised great concern due to their ubiquity in aquatic environments and adsorption technologies are among the most promising treatment solutions this study investigated the key factors that influence the adsorption of anionic pfass on conventional and emerging adsorbents batch adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the removal of 20 target pfass at environmentally relevant concentrations by three different activated carbon ac materials and two different β cyclodextrin polymers cdps experiments were conducted in milli q water and in groundwater major physical properties of the adsorbents were measured along with general water chemistry parameters for each groundwater sample principal component analysis pca was subsequently employed to extract the important associations from the multivariate dataset the distinct performances of acs and cdps were attributed to their different surface chemistry and the distinct nature of their adsorption binding sites hydrophobic interactions dominated pfas adsorption onto acs while cdps mostly attracted anionic pfass via favorable electrostatic interactions acs of a smaller average particle size performed better with our data pointing to an increased external specific surface area as the likely reason ph and the concentration of cations were the primary contributors to adsorption inhibition in groundwater higher ph values limit anionic pfas adsorption by deprotonating the functional groups on adsorbent surfaces the elevated levels of cations in some groundwater samples limited the effects of attractive electrostatic interactions knowledge of pfas adsorption mechanisms gained from this study can be used to design more efficient adsorbents and to predict their

substances pfass are anthropogenic compounds that were first introduced to the global market in the 1940s and have been used as additives in food packaging fabrics carpets nonstick cookware paints adhesives electronics personal care products and firefighting foams guelfo et al 2018 schultes et al 2019 most perfluoroalkyl acids are present as anionic species in the environment rendering them highly water soluble one major pathway for human exposure to pfass is the consumption of contaminated drinking water domingo and nadal 2019 guelfo et al 2018 hatton et al 2018 martin et al 2019 however pfass have such strong thermal chemical and biological stability that they are recalcitrant to most conventional drinking water treatment processes houtz et al 2018 merino et al 2016 adsorption of pfass has been shown to be an effective removal technology especially when applied to address real world complexities arias espana et al 2015 ateia et al 2019 klemes et al 2019 activated carbons acs are currently the most widely applied conventional adsorbents for pfas removal from water granular acs have been used to remove pfas from water in packed bed filtration systems though slow adsorption kinetics on granular acs can lead to early breakthrough unless systems are designed with a significant excess of ac xiao et al 2017b yu et al 2009 powdered acs exhibit faster adsorption kinetics but are more appropriately used in batch adsorption contactors that have lower water throughput hansen et al 2010 yu et al 2009 in addition the efficiency of granular and powdered acs can be compromised by water matrix constituents including natural organic matter and inorganic ions which leads to frequent regeneration or replacement of acs inyang and dickenson 2017 rahman et al 2014 these deficiencies make acs rather expensive options for remediation of pfas contaminated water β cyclodextrin polymers cdps are emerging adsorbents that offer an alternative solution for remediation of pfas contaminated water previous research with cdps has focused on the removal of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa or perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos from milli q water karoyo and wilson 2013 xiao et al 2017a though the efficacy of cdps for removing broader groups of pfas from groundwater has not been fully explored more recently we demonstrated that a novel cdp crosslinked with a reduced terephthalonitrile referred to as amine cdp or acdp in this manuscript exhibits high affinity for a set of ten anionic pfas with reported removal efficiencies of 80 98 in milli q water klemes et al 2019 however no cdp has been evaluated for anionic pfas removal in a real water matrix and the effects of water matrix constituents on the performance of cdps remain unknown this study was designed to help bridge these knowledge gaps and to specifically fulfill the following objectives 1 evaluate the performance of conventional acs and emerging cdps to remove a wide range of pfass from pure water and groundwater 2 explore the physical properties of acs that contribute to variable performance and 3 explore the constituents of groundwater that influence the adsorption of anionic pfass on each adsorbent to meet the objectives we first conducted batch adsorption experiments to evaluate the removal of 20 anionic pfass at environmentally relevant concentrations by three conventional ac materials and two novel cdps in milli q water the three best performing adsorbents were subsequently selected to evaluate the removal of the target pfass in spiked groundwater and in pfas contaminated groundwater various parameters describing the adsorbent characteristics and groundwater matrices were measured principal component analysis pca was then employed to extract the important relationships from the multivariate dataset the results of this study provide new insights on the factors that influence the adsorption of anionic pfas on conventional and emerging adsorbents in aquatic matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 pfas stock solutions and reagents we selected 20 pfass as adsorbates for this study these pfass were selected to represent a set of anionic pfass with varying hydrophobicity and types of hydrophilic head groups specifically we selected nine perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas seven perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas three fluorotelomer sulfonic acids ftss and perfluoro 2 methyl 3 oxahexanoic acid genx stock solutions of each pfas were prepared in appropriate solvents at a concentration of 1 g l 1 or 50 mg l 1 depending on the solubility of the pfas the stock solutions were then used to prepare an analytical mixture containing all 20 target pfass and an internal standard mixture containing 7 isotope labeled internal standards iliss both in milli q water and at a concentration of 100 μg l 1 the stock solutions and mixtures were stored at 20 c and 4 c respectively until usage details regarding the 20 pfass the 7 iliss and the solvents and reagents used in this study are provided in tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary data sd 2 2 adsorbent materials we selected three activated carbon materials acs and two β cyclodextrin polymers cdps as adsorbents for this study these include the commercially available ccac aquacarb 1230c westates carbon siemens roseville mn awac filtrasorb 400 m calgon carbon co pittsburgh pa and cdp dexsorb cyclopure encinitas ca we note that the performance of cdp is reported here for the first time we also acquired hfac granular activated carbon used at a local drinking water treatment facility to process pfas contaminated groundwater and synthesized acdp amine cdp according to a previously described method klemes et al 2019 each ac was pulverized with a mortar and pestle and sieved into different particle size bins 10 75 125 212 425 850 and 1000 1700 μm the two smaller size bins are representative of pac and the two larger size bins are representative of gac all sieved acs were stored in amber vials at room temperature until use in experiments a detailed material characterization of the adsorbents including measurements of the particle size total pore volume micropore volume and zeta potential is provided in table s3 the particle diameters were determined using u s standard sieves the total pore and micropore volumes were measured with n2 adsorption isotherms generated using a micromeritics asap 2420 the zeta potential values were measured at ph 7 8 using a malvern zetasizer nano instrument with a he ne laser 633 nm max 5 mw 2 3 groundwater sources and characterizations we collected groundwater from two wells near military training sites in pennsylvania which we note as wa and aa in this study based on their background concentrations of pfcas and pfsas fig s1 these groundwater samples were representative of pfas contaminated groundwater groundwater from a private well in new york gw was selected as the representative sample for uncontaminated groundwater and was used for spiked groundwater experiments all groundwater samples were collected in 1l hdpe sampling bottles to minimize potential pfas adsorption onto any surface then sealed with parafilm and transported to our laboratory in styrofoam coolers packed with frozen ice packs trizma base was used as a buffer and pfas preservative during the collection of some of the samples specifically groundwater samples wa a aa a gw a were amended with trizma to a final concentration of 5 g l 1 as instructed in epa method 537 1 and groundwater sample wa d was collected with no trizma added all samples were stored at 4 c upon receipt until usage the groundwater samples were handled with polypropylene syringes and filtered through 0 22 μm pvdf filters restek prior to any experiment or analysis general water chemistry parameters were measured for all filtered groundwater samples including ph conductivity total organic carbon toc specific uv absorbance suva and the concentrations of a variety of cations and anions k ca2 na mg2 f cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 all parameters were measured using standard methods further details and the resulting data are provided in tables s4 and s5 all water chemistry analyses were conducted within 4 weeks of receiving a groundwater sample 2 4 rotator batch experiments for spiked experiments 10 ml of the water sample milli q or gw a was transferred into 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes corning and spiked with the 20 pfas analytical mixture to a target concentration of 500 ng l 1 adsorbate concentration selected to represent an environmentally relevant level for unspiked experiments 10 ml of the groundwater sample wa a wa d or aa a was transferred into 15 ml centrifuge tubes with no spiking of any pfas the centrifuge tubes were then loaded onto a rotary tube revolver thermo scientific and rotated at 40 revolutions per minute rpm for over 20 h to provide a homogeneous solution adsorbents acs or cdps were then added into the centrifuge tubes at a dose of approximately 10 60 mg l 1 representing the economically feasible dose for drinking water treatment the centrifuge tubes were then reloaded onto the tube revolver and rotated at 40 rpm for 48 h of treatment triplicate experiments with each adsorbent were conducted at 23 c the centrifuge tubes were sacrificed at predetermined time points 0 5 4 8 24 48 h filtered with a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter restek transferred into 18 mm screw top headspace vials fisher scientific spiked with the mixture of 7 iliss and stored at 4 c until hplc ms analysis we note that only limited pfas adsorption was observed in recovery experiments with the 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters control experiments were performed under the same conditions with no addition of adsorbents we note that the ph of the groundwater experiments was sufficiently buffered to remain constant throughout the batch experiments the ph of experiments in milli q water was assumed to remain stable at around 6 7 as has been experimentally confirmed in similar types of batch adsorption experiments ling et al 2020 2 5 pfas quantification quantification of 20 target pfass in all prepared samples spiked with iliss was conducted by means of high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometery ms qexactive thermofisher scientific analytical information for all pfass and their iliss is provided in table s6 briefly the mobile phase consisted of a lc ms grade water amended with 20 mm ammonium acetate and b lc ms grade methanol samples were injected at 5 ml volumes onto a hypersil gold dc18 12 μm 2 1 20 mm trap column thermofisher scientific and were eluted onto an atlantis dc18 5 μm 2 1 150 mm analytical column waters with a pump delivering 300 μl min 1 of a mobile phase gradient starting at 40 b the gradient composition followed that described in epa method 537 1 the column temperature was held constant at 25 c the hplc ms was operated with electrospray ionization in negative polarity mode calibration standards n 8 were prepared in milli q water with concentrations ranging between 0 ng l 1 to 750 ng l 1 for external calibration analytes were quantified from calibration standards spiked with the same amount of ilis based on the pfas target to ilis peak area ratio responses by linear least squares regression calibration curves were run at the beginning of the analytical sequence instrument blanks were run before and after the calibration curve and each batch of triplicate samples one quality control qc sample was placed halfway through every analytical sequence to ensure minimal contamination and adequate ms performance qc tolerance set at 30 quality control and limits of quantification loqs are provided in tables s7 and s8 2 6 data analysis the removal of each pfas in each sample was calculated as described in equation 1 equation 1 r m v l i r e p j 1 c i j t c i 0 100 where i is any of the 20 target pfass j is the number of the replicate j 1 2 3 t is the time point at which the sample was taken t 0 5 4 8 24 48 hr c i j t is the concentration of i in replicate j taken at t hr and c i 0 is the concentration of i in the 0 h control sample then the removal of each pfas was calculated as the arithmetic average of three replicates to quantify the overall performance of each adsorbent the weighted average removal of all 20 target pfass was calculated at each time point based on equations 2 and 3 equation 2 w e i g h t i c i 0 c i 0 equation 3 w e i g h t e d a v g r m v l w e i g h t i r m v l i where w e i g h t i is the weight that i carries in the calculation based on its share of initial concentration in the matrix and w e i g h t e d a v g r m v l is the overall removal of all pfass in the matrix after considering the distinctions among initial concentrations to quantify the extent of adsorption inhibition for each adsorbent in the different groundwater matrices we defined the parameter equation 4 m a t r i x e f f e c t w e i g h t e d a v g r m v l in gw w e i g h t e d a v g r m v l in milli q which quantifies how the adsorbent performs in a groundwater sample relative to milli q water the inhibition then provides a quantitative metric on how much the performance of an adsorbent is inhibited in a specific groundwater matrix relative to milli q water equation 5 i n h i b i t i o n 1 m a t r i x e f f e c t 100 principal component analysis pca is a statistical method that reduces the dimensionality of a multivariate dataset and helps visualize the connections among observations and inter correlated quantitative variables mostert et al 2010 pérez arribas et al 2017 we used the factominer and factoextra packages in the r statistical software to construct pca biplots that describe the relationships between adsorbent performance and the major physical properties of the adsorbents or the basic chemical parameters of the groundwater samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas removal by each adsorbent in milli q water the data provided in fig 1 show pfas removal in milli q water after 4 h of contact time on each of the five adsorbents fig s2 shows removal at other contact times and table s9 provides the average and standard deviation of the removal at each time point for all experiments the three acs are grouped into four particle size bins 10 75 μm 125 212 μm 425 850 μm 1000 1700 μm and the cdps were evaluated in their as synthesized particle sizes 212 425 μm for acdp and 63 μm for cdp there is a clear difference in the performance of the acs as a function of their particle size acs from the two larger size bins remove pfas from milli q water to a lower extent after 4 h of contact time than the acs from the two smaller size bins though greater extents of removal were observed after longer contact times fig s2 and table s9 this is consistent with previous studies that report slower and lower extents of pfas adsorption on larger sized acs chen et al 2017 yu et al 2009 it is widely known that the kinetics of adsorption on ac is controlled by relatively slow intra particle diffusion which requires adsorbates to diffuse into micropores to access free surfaces micropores can also be blocked by larger adsorbates which may limit the capacity of ac adsorbents punyapalakul et al 2013 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2011 we attribute the relatively slow adsorption of anionic pfas on larger sized acs to intra particle diffusion limitations that become less important for smaller sized acs that have greater specific external surface area it is also interesting to note that shorter chain pfass are removed from milli q water to greater extents than longer chain pfass by larger sized acs whereas longer chain pfass are removed to greater extents than shorter chain pfass by smaller sized acs we also attribute this finding to the greater importance of intra particle diffusion for larger sized acs and the more rapid diffusion of smaller pfas acs from the two smaller size bins 10 75 μm 125 212 μm remove nearly all of the pfas from milli q water after 4 h of contact time with the exception of the shorter chain pfcas i e pfba pfpea similar results on the removal of anionic pfas on powdered acs have been previously reported hansen et al 2010 punyapalakul et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the enhanced performance of powdered acs has previously been attributed to either the generation of more internal active binding sites during pulverization and the consequent shorter diffusion distances required to access them yu et al 2009 or the increased specific external surface area of smaller sized ac particles which can provide access to more binding sites even in the presence of larger adsorbates that block access to internal micropores ando et al 2010 partlan et al 2016 therefore the smaller sized acs in this study exhibit more rapid pfas adsorption kinetics and greater extents of adsorption than the larger sized acs the two cdps also remove nearly all of the pfass from milli q water after 4 h of contact time both of the cdps evaluated in this study consist of β cyclodextrin monomers crosslinked with rigid aromatics containing weakly basic acdp or permanently cationic cdp functional groups the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomer is the most likely active site for adsorption on cdps and the β cyclodextrin monomer is known to encapsulate anionic pfass to form well defined host guest complexes via hydrophobic interactions karoyo et al 2011 tang et al 2019 weiss errico and o shea 2017 xiao et al 2017a additionally the protonated crosslinkers of both cdps may facilitate the transport of anionic pfass to the β cyclodextrin monomers or provide alternate adsorption sites through complementary electrostatic interactions nassi et al 2014 zhang et al 2011b 3 2 physical properties that control pfas adsorption on activated carbon to further explore the adsorption behavior of anionic pfass on acs we constructed a pca biplot that describes the relationships between pfas removal performance and the major physical properties of the acs in each of the twelve experiments i e three acs four size bins conducted in milli q water the four physical properties considered in the pca analysis were particle size total pore volume micropore volume and zeta potential the results of the pca analysis are provided as fig 2 it is evident that when considering pfas adsorption on acs in general particle size is the leading factor to be considered the particle size was determined as the average particle diameter of each size bin and a strong negative association was discovered between particle size and the weighted average pfas removal at 4 h this outcome is consistent with the qualitative findings described in fig 1 removal of anionic pfas is enhanced with decreasing particle size the total pore volume is the weight specific total pore volume of an adsorbent and is estimated from the n2 adsorption isotherm the micropore volume is the distribution of micropores in the adsorbent and is likewise calculated based on the n2 adsorption measurements as demonstrated in fig 2 neither of these properties associate with particle size or with the weighted average pfas removal at 4 h rmvl 4h this important finding excludes the likelihood that the improved performance of smaller sized acs is related to enlarged intra particle pores as proposed by a previous study piai et al 2019 on the contrary this finding corroborates several other studies that report that the bet surface area and pore volume distributions of acs are not altered significantly during pulverization ando et al 2010 partlan et al 2016 therefore the enhanced performance of smaller sized acs must be attributed to other mechanisms such as an increased specific external surface area ando et al 2010 murray et al 2019 yu et al 2009 or the generation of more active binding sites that were originally inaccessible ando et al 2010 the zeta potential is used to represent the surface charge of each ac in the ph range of 7 8 this property also exhibited little association with the weighted average pfas removal at 4 h indicating that hydrophobic interactions dominate the adsorption of anionic pfas on acs 3 3 pfas removal by each adsorbent in groundwater to examine how pfas removal changes in natural groundwater matrices further experiments were conducted with three of the adsorbents in groundwater cdp acdp and awac the adsorbents were selected based on their performance in milli q water we used awac from the 125 212 μm size bin to increase the validity and reliability of the comparison among different types of adsorbents with minimum impact from their particle size the data provided in fig 3 show pfas removal in groundwater matrices after 4 h of contact time on each of the three adsorbents fig s3 shows removal at other contact times and table s10 provides the average and standard deviation of the removal at each time point for all experiments note that gw a was a pristine groundwater sample that was spiked with 500 ng l 1 of pfas and that the remaining groundwater samples were not spiked with pfas and evaluated for removal of the native pfass that were present in those samples gray squares in fig 3 indicate that a pfas was not present in a particular groundwater sample above the loq overall the extent of pfas removal on all three adsorbents in groundwater was less than what was observed in milli q water fig 1 which can be attributed to matrix interferences caused by the chemical properties of each groundwater unlike the performance of larger sized acs in milli q water longer chain pfas were always removed to greater extents than shorter chain pfas by all adsorbents in the groundwater experiments this is because adsorption of pfas on cdps and smaller sized acs is not controlled by intra particle diffusion limitations that can favor the adsorption of smaller sized adsorbates rather the affinity of pfas for the binding sites on each of the adsorbents is driven in part by hydrophobic interactions that are not diffusion limited ahrens et al 2010 eschauzier et al 2012 inyang and dickenson 2017 zhang et al 2016 therefore longer chain pfass have a higher tendency to partition from the bulk solution to a solid surface the data in fig 3 also demonstrate that for most pfass and in most groundwater samples the extent of pfas removal is the greatest on cdp this suggests that the matrix interferes with adsorption on awac and acdp more than it does for cdp to more accurately quantify the differences in performance of each adsorbent in each groundwater we calculated the inhibition for each adsorbent in each groundwater as described in equation 5 these data are presented in fig 4 the height of each bar in fig 4 represents the total extent to which pfas removal was inhibited in each groundwater sample relative to milli q water these data demonstrate that the extent of pfas adsorption on cdp was always inhibited the least compared to the other adsorbents except in groundwater aa a fig 4b implying that a particular constituent of groundwater aa a might selectively inhibit the adsorption of anionic pfas on cdp further the extent of pfas adsorption on acdp was always inhibited the most compared to the other adsorbents except in groundwater wa d fig 4d implying that a particular constituent of groundwater wa d might enhance adsorption of anionic pfas on acdp the colors of the bars in fig 4 refer to the specific groups of pfas included in this study i e pfcas pfsas ftss and genx although the ftss and genx were not always present at quantifiable levels in the groundwater samples fig 3 and fig s1 pfcas and pfsas were measured in every groundwater sample larger bars for a specific group of pfass in fig 4 suggests that the extent of adsorption inhibition was greater for that group of pfass in a particular groundwater sample from these data we can conclude that the extent of adsorption inhibition was significantly less for pfsas than it was for pfcas for all adsorbents this is especially obvious in fig 4c and d where the removal of pfsas was not inhibited at all this observation is consistent with previous studies illustrating the relatively high adsorption affinity of pfsas on a variety of adsorbents mccleaf et al 2017 xiao et al 2017b zhang et al 2016 3 4 chemical parameters of groundwater that contribute to adsorption inhibition to further explore the role that groundwater chemistry plays in pfas adsorption inhibition and to develop a mechanistic interpretation of the data we constructed a pca biplot that describes the relationships between inhibition i e the height of the bars in fig 4 and the major chemical parameters of each groundwater sample in each of the twelve experiments i e three adsorbents four groundwater samples the six chemical parameters considered in the pca analysis were ph conductivity toc suva and the molar concentrations of a variety of cations and anions the results of the pca analysis are provided as fig 5 ph exhibited a strong positive correlation with adsorption inhibition i e greater ph values resulted in a greater extent of adsorption inhibition among the anionic pfas the anionic pfass selected for this study have very low pka values and are therefore present only as anions within the ph range of the groundwater samples selected for this study therefore the noted ph dependence of inhibition is more readily explained by changes to the surface charge of the adsorbents rather than to protonation or deprotonation of the adsorbates awac has a negative surface charge in the ph range of 7 8 table s4 and the surface charge of awac will become increasingly negative at higher ph values this will lead to greater repulsive electrostatic forces for anionic pfas at higher ph values and result in more adsorption inhibition deng et al 2012 higgins and luthy 2006 both of the cdps selected for this study have a positive surface charge in the ph range 7 8 table s3 however acdp contains weakly basic functional groups that will be deprotonated at higher ph values whereas cdp does not undergo acid base reactions under these conditions and remains cationic over the studied ph range the deprotonation of acdp at higher ph values can weaken tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2011a or eliminate yu et al 2009 the attractive electrostatic interactions between acdp and anionic pfas at neutral ph our experimental adsorption data suggest that acdp has a positive surface charge in wa d but a negative surface charge at the higher ph values measured for gw a aa a and wa a the elimination of the attractive electrostatic interactions between acdp and anionic pfas at higher ph values can explain the higher extent of adsorption inhibition in those groundwater samples and particularly the limited inhibition in wa d fig 4 the permanently positive charge of cdp explains the resilience of cdp to adsorption inhibition in groundwater samples of varying ph and the relatively low extent of adsorption inhibition observed across all groundwater samples the total molar concentration of measured cations i e ca2 mg2 k na also exhibited a strong positive correlation with adsorption inhibition i e greater concentrations of cations resulted in a greater extent of adsorption inhibition among the anionic pfas a similar effect has been observed in other studies investigating the adsorption of anionic surfactants on a variety of adsorbents kwadijk et al 2013 wang and shih 2011 previous studies have concluded that divalent cations like mg2 and ca2 can bind with the anionic head groups of pfas to form weak neutral complexes which can decrease the extent of adsorption by weakening potential electrostatic interactions jeon et al 2011 wang and shih 2011 as is revealed in the pca biplot fig 5 and in the raw data table s4 groundwater aa a had the highest concentrations of cations including divalent cations among all groundwater samples which resulted in the greatest extent of adsorption inhibition among all of the adsorbents this phenomenon also explains the anomalous behavior of cdp and awac in aa a noted in the preceding fig 4b the permanently positive surface charge of cdp enhances the removal of anionic pfas through attractive electrostatic interactions that are diminished in the presence of divalent cations awac has a permanently negative surface charge and relies exclusively on hydrophobic interactions for the adsorption of anionic pfas and exhibits lower extents of adsorption inhibition in groundwater samples with higher concentrations of divalent cations in contrast to the concentration of cations neither conductivity nor the concentration of anions i e f cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 exhibited a significant association with adsorption inhibition indicating that these parameters do not contribute much to the observed adsorption inhibition in this study because we have adsorbents that have positive and negative surface charges and adsorbates that are always anionic this is further evidence that the effect from cations is likely due to interactions with the pfas and not the adsorbent if cations were affecting one type of adsorbent then we would expect anions to affect the adsorbent of the opposite surface charge in an analogous way likewise neither toc nor suva exhibited a significant association with adsorption inhibition this finding is notable because dissolved organic matter of a certain size has been previously shown to inhibit adsorption on other types of cdps ling et al 2020 particularly those that carry a negative surface charge the lack of an association between toc and suva and cdp adsorption inhibition in this study suggests that anionic dissolved organic matter may only influence adsorption on negatively charged cdps 3 5 implications for practice our study sought to explore the potential of conventional and emerging adsorbents to remove anionic pfas from water and to identify the factors that lead to adsorption inhibition in groundwater matrices in wa d the un amended pfas contaminated groundwater sample only cdp removed pfoa and pfos to concentrations below the us epa health advisory threshold of 70 ng l 1 in our experiments after 4 h of contact time 23 and 24 ng l 1 respectively all three adsorbents cdp acdp and awac exhibited limited removal of the shorter chain carboxylates and sulfonates in wa d but cdp again exhibited the greatest removal of these pfas in our experiments after 4 h of contact time in comparing the performance of all adsorbents across experiments conducted in milli q and groundwater we found that ph and the presence of inorganic cations contribute to adsorption inhibition to varying extents depending on the adsorbent these data could be used to help guide the selection of remediation technologies based on local environmental conditions together the new insights developed in our analyses improve our understanding of pfas adsorbent interactions and will lead to the continued development of novel adsorbents targeting a broad family of pfass and the design of more effective water treatment processes for pfas contaminated systems 4 conclusions the adsorption behaviors of 20 target pfass including 4 classes containing members with varying chain lengths onto 5 types of adsorbents including 3 acs and 2 cdps were studied in milli q water acs of larger particle size exhibited slower removal kinetics likely due to intra particle diffusion limitations additionally pfass of shorter chain length were observed to have faster initial adsorption onto the larger sized acs further indicating the probable steric related resistance that larger pfas molecules may experience when transporting within the micropores of acs in comparison all smaller sized acs and the two cdps exhibited nearly complete removal of the target pfass and seemed to be unaffected by intra particle diffusion limitations there was a clear trend that pfas removal can be greatly improved in kinetics if not in capacity with a decrease in the ac particle size a pca biplot was constructed to further explore the effect of particle size and the results suggested that although there were differences in surface charge and pore volume distributions among different types of acs none of these variables exhibited a significant association with the pfas removal performance consequently the particle size exhibited a significant association and we attribute that finding to an increased specific external surface area or the generation of more active binding sites that were originally inaccessible based on the adsorption performance in milli q water three adsorbents awac acdp cdp were selected for further experimentation in groundwater although all three adsorbents demonstrated nearly ideal performance in milli q water their pfas uptake in the groundwater experiments were all inhibited and were inhibited to different degrees implying that every adsorbent had its own unique mechanism in removing the target pfass and in interacting with the groundwater matrices regardless of the adsorbent type the uptake of pfsas were impacted the least compared to all other pfass indicating a higher adsorption affinity for this group of pfas molecules an approach to quantify the extent of adsorption inhibition was introduced and pca biplots were constructed to investigate the role that certain groundwater matrix constituents play in adsorption inhibition ph and the concentration of cations exhibited positive associations to adsorption inhibition given that the varying ph should have a limited effect on the strongly acidic pfas anions adsorption inhibition by means of alterations of the adsorbent surface chemistry was proposed the influence of cations was particularly prominent in the aa a groundwater for cdp indicating that the increased concentration of divalent cations in aa a might have weakened the electrostatic attractions between the pfas anions and the positively charged cdp declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

17794,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have raised great concern due to their ubiquity in aquatic environments and adsorption technologies are among the most promising treatment solutions this study investigated the key factors that influence the adsorption of anionic pfass on conventional and emerging adsorbents batch adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the removal of 20 target pfass at environmentally relevant concentrations by three different activated carbon ac materials and two different β cyclodextrin polymers cdps experiments were conducted in milli q water and in groundwater major physical properties of the adsorbents were measured along with general water chemistry parameters for each groundwater sample principal component analysis pca was subsequently employed to extract the important associations from the multivariate dataset the distinct performances of acs and cdps were attributed to their different surface chemistry and the distinct nature of their adsorption binding sites hydrophobic interactions dominated pfas adsorption onto acs while cdps mostly attracted anionic pfass via favorable electrostatic interactions acs of a smaller average particle size performed better with our data pointing to an increased external specific surface area as the likely reason ph and the concentration of cations were the primary contributors to adsorption inhibition in groundwater higher ph values limit anionic pfas adsorption by deprotonating the functional groups on adsorbent surfaces the elevated levels of cations in some groundwater samples limited the effects of attractive electrostatic interactions knowledge of pfas adsorption mechanisms gained from this study can be used to design more efficient adsorbents and to predict their

substances pfass are anthropogenic compounds that were first introduced to the global market in the 1940s and have been used as additives in food packaging fabrics carpets nonstick cookware paints adhesives electronics personal care products and firefighting foams guelfo et al 2018 schultes et al 2019 most perfluoroalkyl acids are present as anionic species in the environment rendering them highly water soluble one major pathway for human exposure to pfass is the consumption of contaminated drinking water domingo and nadal 2019 guelfo et al 2018 hatton et al 2018 martin et al 2019 however pfass have such strong thermal chemical and biological stability that they are recalcitrant to most conventional drinking water treatment processes houtz et al 2018 merino et al 2016 adsorption of pfass has been shown to be an effective removal technology especially when applied to address real world complexities arias espana et al 2015 ateia et al 2019 klemes et al 2019 activated carbons acs are currently the most widely applied conventional adsorbents for pfas removal from water granular acs have been used to remove pfas from water in packed bed filtration systems though slow adsorption kinetics on granular acs can lead to early breakthrough unless systems are designed with a significant excess of ac xiao et al 2017b yu et al 2009 powdered acs exhibit faster adsorption kinetics but are more appropriately used in batch adsorption contactors that have lower water throughput hansen et al 2010 yu et al 2009 in addition the efficiency of granular and powdered acs can be compromised by water matrix constituents including natural organic matter and inorganic ions which leads to frequent regeneration or replacement of acs inyang and dickenson 2017 rahman et al 2014 these deficiencies make acs rather expensive options for remediation of pfas contaminated water β cyclodextrin polymers cdps are emerging adsorbents that offer an alternative solution for remediation of pfas contaminated water previous research with cdps has focused on the removal of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa or perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos from milli q water karoyo and wilson 2013 xiao et al 2017a though the efficacy of cdps for removing broader groups of pfas from groundwater has not been fully explored more recently we demonstrated that a novel cdp crosslinked with a reduced terephthalonitrile referred to as amine cdp or acdp in this manuscript exhibits high affinity for a set of ten anionic pfas with reported removal efficiencies of 80 98 in milli q water klemes et al 2019 however no cdp has been evaluated for anionic pfas removal in a real water matrix and the effects of water matrix constituents on the performance of cdps remain unknown this study was designed to help bridge these knowledge gaps and to specifically fulfill the following objectives 1 evaluate the performance of conventional acs and emerging cdps to remove a wide range of pfass from pure water and groundwater 2 explore the physical properties of acs that contribute to variable performance and 3 explore the constituents of groundwater that influence the adsorption of anionic pfass on each adsorbent to meet the objectives we first conducted batch adsorption experiments to evaluate the removal of 20 anionic pfass at environmentally relevant concentrations by three conventional ac materials and two novel cdps in milli q water the three best performing adsorbents were subsequently selected to evaluate the removal of the target pfass in spiked groundwater and in pfas contaminated groundwater various parameters describing the adsorbent characteristics and groundwater matrices were measured principal component analysis pca was then employed to extract the important relationships from the multivariate dataset the results of this study provide new insights on the factors that influence the adsorption of anionic pfas on conventional and emerging adsorbents in aquatic matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 pfas stock solutions and reagents we selected 20 pfass as adsorbates for this study these pfass were selected to represent a set of anionic pfass with varying hydrophobicity and types of hydrophilic head groups specifically we selected nine perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas seven perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas three fluorotelomer sulfonic acids ftss and perfluoro 2 methyl 3 oxahexanoic acid genx stock solutions of each pfas were prepared in appropriate solvents at a concentration of 1 g l 1 or 50 mg l 1 depending on the solubility of the pfas the stock solutions were then used to prepare an analytical mixture containing all 20 target pfass and an internal standard mixture containing 7 isotope labeled internal standards iliss both in milli q water and at a concentration of 100 μg l 1 the stock solutions and mixtures were stored at 20 c and 4 c respectively until usage details regarding the 20 pfass the 7 iliss and the solvents and reagents used in this study are provided in tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary data sd 2 2 adsorbent materials we selected three activated carbon materials acs and two β cyclodextrin polymers cdps as adsorbents for this study these include the commercially available ccac aquacarb 1230c westates carbon siemens roseville mn awac filtrasorb 400 m calgon carbon co pittsburgh pa and cdp dexsorb cyclopure encinitas ca we note that the performance of cdp is reported here for the first time we also acquired hfac granular activated carbon used at a local drinking water treatment facility to process pfas contaminated groundwater and synthesized acdp amine cdp according to a previously described method klemes et al 2019 each ac was pulverized with a mortar and pestle and sieved into different particle size bins 10 75 125 212 425 850 and 1000 1700 μm the two smaller size bins are representative of pac and the two larger size bins are representative of gac all sieved acs were stored in amber vials at room temperature until use in experiments a detailed material characterization of the adsorbents including measurements of the particle size total pore volume micropore volume and zeta potential is provided in table s3 the particle diameters were determined using u s standard sieves the total pore and micropore volumes were measured with n2 adsorption isotherms generated using a micromeritics asap 2420 the zeta potential values were measured at ph 7 8 using a malvern zetasizer nano instrument with a he ne laser 633 nm max 5 mw 2 3 groundwater sources and characterizations we collected groundwater from two wells near military training sites in pennsylvania which we note as wa and aa in this study based on their background concentrations of pfcas and pfsas fig s1 these groundwater samples were representative of pfas contaminated groundwater groundwater from a private well in new york gw was selected as the representative sample for uncontaminated groundwater and was used for spiked groundwater experiments all groundwater samples were collected in 1l hdpe sampling bottles to minimize potential pfas adsorption onto any surface then sealed with parafilm and transported to our laboratory in styrofoam coolers packed with frozen ice packs trizma base was used as a buffer and pfas preservative during the collection of some of the samples specifically groundwater samples wa a aa a gw a were amended with trizma to a final concentration of 5 g l 1 as instructed in epa method 537 1 and groundwater sample wa d was collected with no trizma added all samples were stored at 4 c upon receipt until usage the groundwater samples were handled with polypropylene syringes and filtered through 0 22 μm pvdf filters restek prior to any experiment or analysis general water chemistry parameters were measured for all filtered groundwater samples including ph conductivity total organic carbon toc specific uv absorbance suva and the concentrations of a variety of cations and anions k ca2 na mg2 f cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 all parameters were measured using standard methods further details and the resulting data are provided in tables s4 and s5 all water chemistry analyses were conducted within 4 weeks of receiving a groundwater sample 2 4 rotator batch experiments for spiked experiments 10 ml of the water sample milli q or gw a was transferred into 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes corning and spiked with the 20 pfas analytical mixture to a target concentration of 500 ng l 1 adsorbate concentration selected to represent an environmentally relevant level for unspiked experiments 10 ml of the groundwater sample wa a wa d or aa a was transferred into 15 ml centrifuge tubes with no spiking of any pfas the centrifuge tubes were then loaded onto a rotary tube revolver thermo scientific and rotated at 40 revolutions per minute rpm for over 20 h to provide a homogeneous solution adsorbents acs or cdps were then added into the centrifuge tubes at a dose of approximately 10 60 mg l 1 representing the economically feasible dose for drinking water treatment the centrifuge tubes were then reloaded onto the tube revolver and rotated at 40 rpm for 48 h of treatment triplicate experiments with each adsorbent were conducted at 23 c the centrifuge tubes were sacrificed at predetermined time points 0 5 4 8 24 48 h filtered with a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter restek transferred into 18 mm screw top headspace vials fisher scientific spiked with the mixture of 7 iliss and stored at 4 c until hplc ms analysis we note that only limited pfas adsorption was observed in recovery experiments with the 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters control experiments were performed under the same conditions with no addition of adsorbents we note that the ph of the groundwater experiments was sufficiently buffered to remain constant throughout the batch experiments the ph of experiments in milli q water was assumed to remain stable at around 6 7 as has been experimentally confirmed in similar types of batch adsorption experiments ling et al 2020 2 5 pfas quantification quantification of 20 target pfass in all prepared samples spiked with iliss was conducted by means of high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometery ms qexactive thermofisher scientific analytical information for all pfass and their iliss is provided in table s6 briefly the mobile phase consisted of a lc ms grade water amended with 20 mm ammonium acetate and b lc ms grade methanol samples were injected at 5 ml volumes onto a hypersil gold dc18 12 μm 2 1 20 mm trap column thermofisher scientific and were eluted onto an atlantis dc18 5 μm 2 1 150 mm analytical column waters with a pump delivering 300 μl min 1 of a mobile phase gradient starting at 40 b the gradient composition followed that described in epa method 537 1 the column temperature was held constant at 25 c the hplc ms was operated with electrospray ionization in negative polarity mode calibration standards n 8 were prepared in milli q water with concentrations ranging between 0 ng l 1 to 750 ng l 1 for external calibration analytes were quantified from calibration standards spiked with the same amount of ilis based on the pfas target to ilis peak area ratio responses by linear least squares regression calibration curves were run at the beginning of the analytical sequence instrument blanks were run before and after the calibration curve and each batch of triplicate samples one quality control qc sample was placed halfway through every analytical sequence to ensure minimal contamination and adequate ms performance qc tolerance set at 30 quality control and limits of quantification loqs are provided in tables s7 and s8 2 6 data analysis the removal of each pfas in each sample was calculated as described in equation 1 equation 1 r m v l i r e p j 1 c i j t c i 0 100 where i is any of the 20 target pfass j is the number of the replicate j 1 2 3 t is the time point at which the sample was taken t 0 5 4 8 24 48 hr c i j t is the concentration of i in replicate j taken at t hr and c i 0 is the concentration of i in the 0 h control sample then the removal of each pfas was calculated as the arithmetic average of three replicates to quantify the overall performance of each adsorbent the weighted average removal of all 20 target pfass was calculated at each time point based on equations 2 and 3 equation 2 w e i g h t i c i 0 c i 0 equation 3 w e i g h t e d a v g r m v l w e i g h t i r m v l i where w e i g h t i is the weight that i carries in the calculation based on its share of initial concentration in the matrix and w e i g h t e d a v g r m v l is the overall removal of all pfass in the matrix after considering the distinctions among initial concentrations to quantify the extent of adsorption inhibition for each adsorbent in the different groundwater matrices we defined the parameter equation 4 m a t r i x e f f e c t w e i g h t e d a v g r m v l in gw w e i g h t e d a v g r m v l in milli q which quantifies how the adsorbent performs in a groundwater sample relative to milli q water the inhibition then provides a quantitative metric on how much the performance of an adsorbent is inhibited in a specific groundwater matrix relative to milli q water equation 5 i n h i b i t i o n 1 m a t r i x e f f e c t 100 principal component analysis pca is a statistical method that reduces the dimensionality of a multivariate dataset and helps visualize the connections among observations and inter correlated quantitative variables mostert et al 2010 pérez arribas et al 2017 we used the factominer and factoextra packages in the r statistical software to construct pca biplots that describe the relationships between adsorbent performance and the major physical properties of the adsorbents or the basic chemical parameters of the groundwater samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas removal by each adsorbent in milli q water the data provided in fig 1 show pfas removal in milli q water after 4 h of contact time on each of the five adsorbents fig s2 shows removal at other contact times and table s9 provides the average and standard deviation of the removal at each time point for all experiments the three acs are grouped into four particle size bins 10 75 μm 125 212 μm 425 850 μm 1000 1700 μm and the cdps were evaluated in their as synthesized particle sizes 212 425 μm for acdp and 63 μm for cdp there is a clear difference in the performance of the acs as a function of their particle size acs from the two larger size bins remove pfas from milli q water to a lower extent after 4 h of contact time than the acs from the two smaller size bins though greater extents of removal were observed after longer contact times fig s2 and table s9 this is consistent with previous studies that report slower and lower extents of pfas adsorption on larger sized acs chen et al 2017 yu et al 2009 it is widely known that the kinetics of adsorption on ac is controlled by relatively slow intra particle diffusion which requires adsorbates to diffuse into micropores to access free surfaces micropores can also be blocked by larger adsorbates which may limit the capacity of ac adsorbents punyapalakul et al 2013 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2011 we attribute the relatively slow adsorption of anionic pfas on larger sized acs to intra particle diffusion limitations that become less important for smaller sized acs that have greater specific external surface area it is also interesting to note that shorter chain pfass are removed from milli q water to greater extents than longer chain pfass by larger sized acs whereas longer chain pfass are removed to greater extents than shorter chain pfass by smaller sized acs we also attribute this finding to the greater importance of intra particle diffusion for larger sized acs and the more rapid diffusion of smaller pfas acs from the two smaller size bins 10 75 μm 125 212 μm remove nearly all of the pfas from milli q water after 4 h of contact time with the exception of the shorter chain pfcas i e pfba pfpea similar results on the removal of anionic pfas on powdered acs have been previously reported hansen et al 2010 punyapalakul et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the enhanced performance of powdered acs has previously been attributed to either the generation of more internal active binding sites during pulverization and the consequent shorter diffusion distances required to access them yu et al 2009 or the increased specific external surface area of smaller sized ac particles which can provide access to more binding sites even in the presence of larger adsorbates that block access to internal micropores ando et al 2010 partlan et al 2016 therefore the smaller sized acs in this study exhibit more rapid pfas adsorption kinetics and greater extents of adsorption than the larger sized acs the two cdps also remove nearly all of the pfass from milli q water after 4 h of contact time both of the cdps evaluated in this study consist of β cyclodextrin monomers crosslinked with rigid aromatics containing weakly basic acdp or permanently cationic cdp functional groups the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomer is the most likely active site for adsorption on cdps and the β cyclodextrin monomer is known to encapsulate anionic pfass to form well defined host guest complexes via hydrophobic interactions karoyo et al 2011 tang et al 2019 weiss errico and o shea 2017 xiao et al 2017a additionally the protonated crosslinkers of both cdps may facilitate the transport of anionic pfass to the β cyclodextrin monomers or provide alternate adsorption sites through complementary electrostatic interactions nassi et al 2014 zhang et al 2011b 3 2 physical properties that control pfas adsorption on activated carbon to further explore the adsorption behavior of anionic pfass on acs we constructed a pca biplot that describes the relationships between pfas removal performance and the major physical properties of the acs in each of the twelve experiments i e three acs four size bins conducted in milli q water the four physical properties considered in the pca analysis were particle size total pore volume micropore volume and zeta potential the results of the pca analysis are provided as fig 2 it is evident that when considering pfas adsorption on acs in general particle size is the leading factor to be considered the particle size was determined as the average particle diameter of each size bin and a strong negative association was discovered between particle size and the weighted average pfas removal at 4 h this outcome is consistent with the qualitative findings described in fig 1 removal of anionic pfas is enhanced with decreasing particle size the total pore volume is the weight specific total pore volume of an adsorbent and is estimated from the n2 adsorption isotherm the micropore volume is the distribution of micropores in the adsorbent and is likewise calculated based on the n2 adsorption measurements as demonstrated in fig 2 neither of these properties associate with particle size or with the weighted average pfas removal at 4 h rmvl 4h this important finding excludes the likelihood that the improved performance of smaller sized acs is related to enlarged intra particle pores as proposed by a previous study piai et al 2019 on the contrary this finding corroborates several other studies that report that the bet surface area and pore volume distributions of acs are not altered significantly during pulverization ando et al 2010 partlan et al 2016 therefore the enhanced performance of smaller sized acs must be attributed to other mechanisms such as an increased specific external surface area ando et al 2010 murray et al 2019 yu et al 2009 or the generation of more active binding sites that were originally inaccessible ando et al 2010 the zeta potential is used to represent the surface charge of each ac in the ph range of 7 8 this property also exhibited little association with the weighted average pfas removal at 4 h indicating that hydrophobic interactions dominate the adsorption of anionic pfas on acs 3 3 pfas removal by each adsorbent in groundwater to examine how pfas removal changes in natural groundwater matrices further experiments were conducted with three of the adsorbents in groundwater cdp acdp and awac the adsorbents were selected based on their performance in milli q water we used awac from the 125 212 μm size bin to increase the validity and reliability of the comparison among different types of adsorbents with minimum impact from their particle size the data provided in fig 3 show pfas removal in groundwater matrices after 4 h of contact time on each of the three adsorbents fig s3 shows removal at other contact times and table s10 provides the average and standard deviation of the removal at each time point for all experiments note that gw a was a pristine groundwater sample that was spiked with 500 ng l 1 of pfas and that the remaining groundwater samples were not spiked with pfas and evaluated for removal of the native pfass that were present in those samples gray squares in fig 3 indicate that a pfas was not present in a particular groundwater sample above the loq overall the extent of pfas removal on all three adsorbents in groundwater was less than what was observed in milli q water fig 1 which can be attributed to matrix interferences caused by the chemical properties of each groundwater unlike the performance of larger sized acs in milli q water longer chain pfas were always removed to greater extents than shorter chain pfas by all adsorbents in the groundwater experiments this is because adsorption of pfas on cdps and smaller sized acs is not controlled by intra particle diffusion limitations that can favor the adsorption of smaller sized adsorbates rather the affinity of pfas for the binding sites on each of the adsorbents is driven in part by hydrophobic interactions that are not diffusion limited ahrens et al 2010 eschauzier et al 2012 inyang and dickenson 2017 zhang et al 2016 therefore longer chain pfass have a higher tendency to partition from the bulk solution to a solid surface the data in fig 3 also demonstrate that for most pfass and in most groundwater samples the extent of pfas removal is the greatest on cdp this suggests that the matrix interferes with adsorption on awac and acdp more than it does for cdp to more accurately quantify the differences in performance of each adsorbent in each groundwater we calculated the inhibition for each adsorbent in each groundwater as described in equation 5 these data are presented in fig 4 the height of each bar in fig 4 represents the total extent to which pfas removal was inhibited in each groundwater sample relative to milli q water these data demonstrate that the extent of pfas adsorption on cdp was always inhibited the least compared to the other adsorbents except in groundwater aa a fig 4b implying that a particular constituent of groundwater aa a might selectively inhibit the adsorption of anionic pfas on cdp further the extent of pfas adsorption on acdp was always inhibited the most compared to the other adsorbents except in groundwater wa d fig 4d implying that a particular constituent of groundwater wa d might enhance adsorption of anionic pfas on acdp the colors of the bars in fig 4 refer to the specific groups of pfas included in this study i e pfcas pfsas ftss and genx although the ftss and genx were not always present at quantifiable levels in the groundwater samples fig 3 and fig s1 pfcas and pfsas were measured in every groundwater sample larger bars for a specific group of pfass in fig 4 suggests that the extent of adsorption inhibition was greater for that group of pfass in a particular groundwater sample from these data we can conclude that the extent of adsorption inhibition was significantly less for pfsas than it was for pfcas for all adsorbents this is especially obvious in fig 4c and d where the removal of pfsas was not inhibited at all this observation is consistent with previous studies illustrating the relatively high adsorption affinity of pfsas on a variety of adsorbents mccleaf et al 2017 xiao et al 2017b zhang et al 2016 3 4 chemical parameters of groundwater that contribute to adsorption inhibition to further explore the role that groundwater chemistry plays in pfas adsorption inhibition and to develop a mechanistic interpretation of the data we constructed a pca biplot that describes the relationships between inhibition i e the height of the bars in fig 4 and the major chemical parameters of each groundwater sample in each of the twelve experiments i e three adsorbents four groundwater samples the six chemical parameters considered in the pca analysis were ph conductivity toc suva and the molar concentrations of a variety of cations and anions the results of the pca analysis are provided as fig 5 ph exhibited a strong positive correlation with adsorption inhibition i e greater ph values resulted in a greater extent of adsorption inhibition among the anionic pfas the anionic pfass selected for this study have very low pka values and are therefore present only as anions within the ph range of the groundwater samples selected for this study therefore the noted ph dependence of inhibition is more readily explained by changes to the surface charge of the adsorbents rather than to protonation or deprotonation of the adsorbates awac has a negative surface charge in the ph range of 7 8 table s4 and the surface charge of awac will become increasingly negative at higher ph values this will lead to greater repulsive electrostatic forces for anionic pfas at higher ph values and result in more adsorption inhibition deng et al 2012 higgins and luthy 2006 both of the cdps selected for this study have a positive surface charge in the ph range 7 8 table s3 however acdp contains weakly basic functional groups that will be deprotonated at higher ph values whereas cdp does not undergo acid base reactions under these conditions and remains cationic over the studied ph range the deprotonation of acdp at higher ph values can weaken tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2011a or eliminate yu et al 2009 the attractive electrostatic interactions between acdp and anionic pfas at neutral ph our experimental adsorption data suggest that acdp has a positive surface charge in wa d but a negative surface charge at the higher ph values measured for gw a aa a and wa a the elimination of the attractive electrostatic interactions between acdp and anionic pfas at higher ph values can explain the higher extent of adsorption inhibition in those groundwater samples and particularly the limited inhibition in wa d fig 4 the permanently positive charge of cdp explains the resilience of cdp to adsorption inhibition in groundwater samples of varying ph and the relatively low extent of adsorption inhibition observed across all groundwater samples the total molar concentration of measured cations i e ca2 mg2 k na also exhibited a strong positive correlation with adsorption inhibition i e greater concentrations of cations resulted in a greater extent of adsorption inhibition among the anionic pfas a similar effect has been observed in other studies investigating the adsorption of anionic surfactants on a variety of adsorbents kwadijk et al 2013 wang and shih 2011 previous studies have concluded that divalent cations like mg2 and ca2 can bind with the anionic head groups of pfas to form weak neutral complexes which can decrease the extent of adsorption by weakening potential electrostatic interactions jeon et al 2011 wang and shih 2011 as is revealed in the pca biplot fig 5 and in the raw data table s4 groundwater aa a had the highest concentrations of cations including divalent cations among all groundwater samples which resulted in the greatest extent of adsorption inhibition among all of the adsorbents this phenomenon also explains the anomalous behavior of cdp and awac in aa a noted in the preceding fig 4b the permanently positive surface charge of cdp enhances the removal of anionic pfas through attractive electrostatic interactions that are diminished in the presence of divalent cations awac has a permanently negative surface charge and relies exclusively on hydrophobic interactions for the adsorption of anionic pfas and exhibits lower extents of adsorption inhibition in groundwater samples with higher concentrations of divalent cations in contrast to the concentration of cations neither conductivity nor the concentration of anions i e f cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 exhibited a significant association with adsorption inhibition indicating that these parameters do not contribute much to the observed adsorption inhibition in this study because we have adsorbents that have positive and negative surface charges and adsorbates that are always anionic this is further evidence that the effect from cations is likely due to interactions with the pfas and not the adsorbent if cations were affecting one type of adsorbent then we would expect anions to affect the adsorbent of the opposite surface charge in an analogous way likewise neither toc nor suva exhibited a significant association with adsorption inhibition this finding is notable because dissolved organic matter of a certain size has been previously shown to inhibit adsorption on other types of cdps ling et al 2020 particularly those that carry a negative surface charge the lack of an association between toc and suva and cdp adsorption inhibition in this study suggests that anionic dissolved organic matter may only influence adsorption on negatively charged cdps 3 5 implications for practice our study sought to explore the potential of conventional and emerging adsorbents to remove anionic pfas from water and to identify the factors that lead to adsorption inhibition in groundwater matrices in wa d the un amended pfas contaminated groundwater sample only cdp removed pfoa and pfos to concentrations below the us epa health advisory threshold of 70 ng l 1 in our experiments after 4 h of contact time 23 and 24 ng l 1 respectively all three adsorbents cdp acdp and awac exhibited limited removal of the shorter chain carboxylates and sulfonates in wa d but cdp again exhibited the greatest removal of these pfas in our experiments after 4 h of contact time in comparing the performance of all adsorbents across experiments conducted in milli q and groundwater we found that ph and the presence of inorganic cations contribute to adsorption inhibition to varying extents depending on the adsorbent these data could be used to help guide the selection of remediation technologies based on local environmental conditions together the new insights developed in our analyses improve our understanding of pfas adsorbent interactions and will lead to the continued development of novel adsorbents targeting a broad family of pfass and the design of more effective water treatment processes for pfas contaminated systems 4 conclusions the adsorption behaviors of 20 target pfass including 4 classes containing members with varying chain lengths onto 5 types of adsorbents including 3 acs and 2 cdps were studied in milli q water acs of larger particle size exhibited slower removal kinetics likely due to intra particle diffusion limitations additionally pfass of shorter chain length were observed to have faster initial adsorption onto the larger sized acs further indicating the probable steric related resistance that larger pfas molecules may experience when transporting within the micropores of acs in comparison all smaller sized acs and the two cdps exhibited nearly complete removal of the target pfass and seemed to be unaffected by intra particle diffusion limitations there was a clear trend that pfas removal can be greatly improved in kinetics if not in capacity with a decrease in the ac particle size a pca biplot was constructed to further explore the effect of particle size and the results suggested that although there were differences in surface charge and pore volume distributions among different types of acs none of these variables exhibited a significant association with the pfas removal performance consequently the particle size exhibited a significant association and we attribute that finding to an increased specific external surface area or the generation of more active binding sites that were originally inaccessible based on the adsorption performance in milli q water three adsorbents awac acdp cdp were selected for further experimentation in groundwater although all three adsorbents demonstrated nearly ideal performance in milli q water their pfas uptake in the groundwater experiments were all inhibited and were inhibited to different degrees implying that every adsorbent had its own unique mechanism in removing the target pfass and in interacting with the groundwater matrices regardless of the adsorbent type the uptake of pfsas were impacted the least compared to all other pfass indicating a higher adsorption affinity for this group of pfas molecules an approach to quantify the extent of adsorption inhibition was introduced and pca biplots were constructed to investigate the role that certain groundwater matrix constituents play in adsorption inhibition ph and the concentration of cations exhibited positive associations to adsorption inhibition given that the varying ph should have a limited effect on the strongly acidic pfas anions adsorption inhibition by means of alterations of the adsorbent surface chemistry was proposed the influence of cations was particularly prominent in the aa a groundwater for cdp indicating that the increased concentration of divalent cations in aa a might have weakened the electrostatic attractions between the pfas anions and the positively charged cdp declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following
