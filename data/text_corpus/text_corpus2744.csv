13720,in this research surface modified zeolites linde type a and clinoptilolite were used for the chromate ions uptake from aqueous solutions as well as its encapsulation through a vitrification process the surface chemistry of zeolites was modified using a cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma to promote the capability of anions uptake the results of characterization by x ray diffraction showed unique crystalline phases for each zeolite which remain unchanged after the incorporation of the surfactant evidence from fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies revealed the effective bond of the hdtma on the clinoptilolite surface results suggested that the presence of ch2 groups after the modification play a key role for the anion attraction kinetic studies revealed that surfactant modified clinoptilolite was able to adsorb 9 83 mg g of chromate and better fitted pseudo second order model r2 0 957 the equilibrium was better represented by freundlich model r2 0 993 finally the proposed vitrification process the spent zeolitic adsorbent was successful avoiding leaching of chromate ions after two months at different ph values keywords surface modified zeolites chromium uptake spent adsorbent vitrification 1 introduction one of the greatest environmental challenges is the proper quality control in wastewater discharge in particular the disposal of heavy metals in these streams has risen public concern due to these pollutants are non degradable highly toxic and sometimes carcinogenic such as arsenic as cadmium cd chromium cr and nickel ni 1 many industries such as mining tanneries electroplating paints and dye production 2 are still currently a significant source of contamination of water bodies moreover in developing countries where legislation is not always enforced adequately 3 chromium cr can be frequently found in aqueous media as both cr iii and cr vi oxidation states being the trivalent variety the more stable species while hexavalent chromium is more threatening to environment due to high mobility and solubility 4 the mobility of cr vi has been explained in terms of speciation where depending on ph conditions and metal concentration it is found as anionic chromate or dichromate which makes it very complicated to adsorb onto many mineral species 5 also it has been reported that cr vi is carcinogenic and mutagenic representing a hazardous threat to human health 6 the u s environmental protection agency usepa has set a maximum contaminant level of 100 parts per billion for total chromium in drinking water 7 recent trends and efforts in the chromium removal stabilization from wastewater include precipitation 8 reverse osmosis 9 nanofiltration 10 electrochemical procedures 11 and adsorption 12 adsorption technologies present several advantages such as efficiency selectivity ease to design and implement lower capital cost and regeneration capabilities 13 furthermore the use of non expensive adsorbents can reduce even more the associated costs of the adsorption process a vast number of materials of different nature have been evaluated as chromium adsorbents for example agroindustrial residues such as apple peel 12 pineapple leaves 14 maize zea mays 15 corncob 16 and rice straw 17 also waste materials such as tires 18 and crawfish shells 19 have been applied for the same purpose moreover composites such as chitosan montmorillonite 20 iron graphene 21 pvp mos2 22 and more recently novel metalorganic framework mof materials such as zn bdc dmf and silver triazolate have been also studied with promising results 23 24 most of these works evaluate the sorption characteristics for chromium vi and reported a wide range of removal percentages from 57 to 100 is exhibited depending upon the adsorption process conditions such as ph time and dosage along with additional particular factors zeolites are a versatile family of microporous and crystalline materials formed by silicon and aluminum tetrahedra connected by oxygen atoms 25 the aluminum presence in the zeolite gives origin to an unbalanced framework having as a consequence the intrinsic cationic exchange capacity 26 in general zeolites present an adequate porosity which is the main reason why these materials have been classically applied to remove cations from aqueous bodies with high efficiency synthetic zeolites such as type a and type x have been used to adsorb co cu zn ni and mn ions respectively 27 29 noroozi et al 30 used surfactant modified nanosized zeolite particles for the cyanide uptake also the same research group has reported the use of statistical functions to study the cyanide uptake kinetics using zeolite a nanoparticles 31 clinoptilolite the most abundant natural zeolite has been extensively used to remove metallic ions from water such as pb cs cu zn fe and cd 32 35 in addition to this recent efforts have been made to include anions and oxyanions for which they naturally have very low affinity in the group of potentially toxic compounds that could be removed by zeolites the versatility of these has allowed the proposal of several methodologies with the aim of tuning their sorption characteristics and improve their capability of attracting these anionic species the most widely used techniques are the use of surfactants chemical functionalization and the incorporation of metallic species 36 surface modified zeolites smz make use of surfactants which are generally long chain quaternary ammonium salts and allow the modification of the surface polarity of the zeolite these materials have been called also organ zeolites clinoptilolite type a zeolite mcm 41 and mordenite are examples of materials that have been treated with hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma and octadecyltrimethylammonium odtma and applied in the removal of chromates phosphates sulfates and arsenates 37 42 with promising results in the particular case of chromium ions the use of cationic surfactants to improve the adsorption capacity of zeolites is widely reported most of the studies agreed that a mechanism of exchange anions governs the adsorption phenomenon of cr on smz thus there is a significant effect of the ph in the systems on the speciation of cr and it has been found that acidic ph in the liquid phase is the best condition to achieve high adsorption of cr 40 46 however the used adsorbent represents an environmental hazard due to potential leaching and despite the numerous publications about the successful use of smz in the adsorption of heavy metals the adequate disposal must be considered recently harikishore et al 47 published an exhaustive article that summarizes the possibilities of spent adsorbents such as fertilizers catalysts and food additives particularly in soil fertilization processes zeolites that have removed nitrates ammonium phosphates or ions such as k cu zn or ca have been used which are beneficial compounds as nutrients for the soil or plants 48 49 however most of these adsorbed compounds do not represent major health risks as heavy metals in addition another problem is that the proper application of zeolite as a soil amendment or fertilizer needs a comprehensive study of the nutritional requirements of a particular crop and also of the physicochemical properties of the soil as well as the environmental conditions one of the most widespread uses of zeolites is as a catalyst or catalyst support in chemical reactions nevertheless the proposal to use a wasted zeolite based adsorbent seems unreliable since the objective of adsorption is to accumulate the greatest number of toxic elements but this is not necessarily the best for a catalytic process where an adequate distribution of the metallic species and specific particle sizes is often required finally the use of zeolites as a food additive after having adsorbed heavy metals is clearly prohibitive regardless of the aforementioned regeneration or recovery processes once it has been completely saturated the spent zeolite not only becomes useless but also converts into a new pollution source if it is not properly confined encapsulation of potential toxic metals in post sorbents through vitrification seems as a promissory strategy since produces chemically stable materials and reduces final disposal volume following a relatively straightforward method 50 vitrification is defined as the transformation of a substance into glass i e a non crystalline substance 51 this process is achieved under a high temperature treatment around the fusion point of the precursor materials mckittrick et al 52 have reported the vitrification from zeolite precursors they have described that the porous zeolite structure collapses when is heated and forms a glass prior to a crystallization stage ruled by equilibrium phase diagram under a thermal treatment these transitions have used to produce glassy bodies in the 1000 1200 c range the vitrification process has been recognized as a viable alternative for waste volume reduction in several fields such as nuclear industry there is scarce literature regarding the final disposal of zeolitic adsorbents where a safe management of the wasted adsorbent it is considered al jubouri et al 53 proposes the encapsulation of mn ii after the sorption process using vitrification and geopolymerization processes el eswed et al 54 solidified pb ii cu ii and cd ii producing kaolin zeolite geopolymers currently there are no data on the encapsulation of potentially toxic chromate ions over a surfactant modified zeolite through vitrification process this paper compares the performance of natural clinoptilolite and synthetic lta in the process of adsorption of chromium ions from an aqueous medium the zeolites were previously subjected to surface conditioning with hdtma surfactant adsorption kinetics was investigated using pseudo first and pseudo second order models langmuir freundlich and d r isotherms were used to describe the thermodynamic equilibrium between the solid and the adsorbed species additionally the encapsulation of cr ions via vitrification method was proposed as a feasible and practical alternative for the final and safe disposal of a based zeolite spent adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of lta lta zeolite was synthesized following the hydrothermal route the initial gel composition was 3na2o 0 85sio2 al2o3 180h2o 29 in a typical run 1 5 g of naoh 99 sigma aldrich was dissolved in 70 ml of deionized water then 4 4 g of sodium aluminate sigma aldrich were added and vigorously mixed until complete dissolution after 2 76 g of sodium metasilicate 98 sigma aldrich were added and stirred for 24 h afterwards the gel was transferred to a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave reactor for 3 h at 100 c the product was recovered by filtration and washed with deionized water until ph was below 9 the final solid was then dried for 24 h at 80 c and labeled as lta 2 2 clinoptilolite natural zeolite has been kindly supplied by san francisco mine san luis potosi mexico its chemical composition has been previously reported in a previous work 64 4 sio2 12 2 al2o3 1 13 fe2o3 0 54 na2o 3 07 k2o 2 6 cao and 0 5 mgo 55 clinoptilolite was sieved and mixed with a 2 m nacl solution to provide more homogeneous exchangeable ions in a typical run 1 g of zeolite was mixed with 50 ml of solution and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 24 h finally the solid material was washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 80 c and labeled as cli 2 3 zeolites conditioning this methodology has been adapted from leyva ramos et al 40 the modification of both lta and cli zeolites was achieved by using 0 06 m hdtma solution for this 1 g of each zeolite was mixed with 10 ml of the surfactant solution later the suspension was stirred for 24 h at room temperature and recovered by filtration materials were subsequently dried at 80 c overnight modified zeolite a and clinoptilolite were labeled lta and cli respectively 2 4 characterization structural characteristics of the materials were investigated by x ray diffraction using a siemens d5000 diffractometer germany with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å at 35 kv in the 2θ angular range of 5 50 with a step size of 0 020 min textural properties were determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k obtained with a micromeritics tristar ii device usa specific surface area was estimated with the brunauer emmet and teller method bet in a range of partial p p0 of 0 0 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to identify the chemical functional groups on the materials surface where a perkin elmer instrument spectrum one model usa was employed in the range from 500 to 4000 cm 1 morphological and elemental analysis were performed by scanning electron microscopy sem with field emission and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx using a jeol jsm 6701 f instrument 2 5 batch adsorption studies chromium uptake experiments were carried out using potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 sigma aldrich solutions and initial ph was adjusted using solutions of naoh and hcl 0 1 m accordingly the analysis of the liquid fractions was performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy cintra gbc 942 aa usa by direct aspiration into an air acetylene flame at a flowrate of 0 4 ml min using a wavelength of 327 5 nm all measurements were carried out by duplicate and the averages are presented in the results section the kinetic characteristics were studied by contacting 0 1 g of the zeolitic material with 10 ml a cr solution 100 ppm ph 4 at 25 c the suspensions were stirred in an orbital rocker and aliquots were taken and filtered after 5 10 15 30 60 90 120 360 and 1440 min respectively pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso equations have been applied to characterize the kinetic behavior of zeolitic materials and are defined as d q d t k 1 q e p f o q p f o d q d t k 2 q e p s o q e p s o 2 where qpfo and qpso are the chromium adsorption capacities estimated by the kinetic models in mg g 1 k1 is the pfo rate constant in min 1 and k2 is the pso rate constant in g mg 1 min 1 56 57 the effect of ph was also investigated taking the 2 4 6 8 and 10 as initial values in a typical run 10 ml of cr solution 100 ppm was contacted with 0 1 g of the correspondent zeolite and rocked for 24 h after the supernatant was recovered by filtration and analyzed finally the thermodynamic equilibrium of the sorptive process was studied by varying the initial concentration of cr 20 40 60 80 and 100 ppm for this 0 1 g of the zeolite were contacted with 10 ml of cr solution ph 4 for 24 h at 25 c and the total cr in the liquid fraction was quantified by aas the solid fraction i e the spent zeolitic adsorbent was also recovered for the final disposition study the removal capacity q mg g 1 for all aforementioned studies was determined by q c 0 c v m where c0 mg l 1 is the initial chromium concentration c mg l 1 is the chromium concentration after adsorption at any time t min v l is the solution volume and m g is the adsorbent mass langmuir and

estimated by non linear generalized reduced gradient algorithm grg2 and the coefficient of determination r2 was used to test the model fitting the objective function was the sum of the squared differences between experimental and model data 2 6 vitrification and leaching study the proposed method for chromate encapsulation is based on the works of al jubouri et al 53 the vitrification process of spent cli 1 1 these experiments were only carried out using cli since it showed an enhanced sorptive capacity compared to lta begun taking the used material at the higher concentration of chromate ions and longer time period i e 100 ppm and 24 h and then recovered by centrifugation and dried overnight a thermal treatment was carried out using a heating rate of 5 c min and kept at 1200 c for 2 h under oxidant atmosphere in a muffle furnace leaching experiments were proposed in order to evaluate the effective encapsulation of chromate ions the vitrified material was put in contact with deionized water varying ph 3 7 and 10 with stirring for eight weeks at room temperature after this period the total concentration of cr was assessed using aa under conditions previously described 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization fig 1 compares the diffractograms of the different zeolitic materials used in this work evidencing that unmodified zeolites i e lta and cli presented the characteristic peaks of its correspondent crystalline structure for lta at 7 1 2 0 0 10 1 2 2 0 and 12 4 2 2 2 according to jcpds no 73 2340 62 and for cli the main diffraction intensities are observed at 9 8 0 2 0 11 1 2 0 0 and 22 3 4 0 0 according to the pdf file 39 1383 and corresponding with the reported simulated xrd patterns for zeolites 63 the results of lta and cli indicated that the crystalline structure remained unchanged after the surfactant process preserving all the intensity peaks very close to unmodified zeolites this result suggest that the modification takes place only on the external surface of the materials agreeing with previous works 64 65 however the peaks for lta and cli patterns showed a decreased intensity when compared to unmodified zeolites this observation is also in agreement with the reported by asiedu 66 where a decrease after a similar chemical modification was observed kwon et al 67 also observed a reduction on peak intensities between different zeolite samples they attributed this effect to nanocrystalline zeolite particles assembling into a big aggregate decrease of peak intensity after zeolite modification has also been associated with pore closure by the organic surfactant material 68 fig 2 shows the ftir spectroscopy results the four materials show the characteristic absorption band in the 950 1250 cm 1 region which is generally attributed to the stretching of the si o and al o bonds in the structural units 69 this result is in agreement with xrd results and also confirms that the zeolite structure either cli or lta is not affected by the surface modification process further in the spectra appear a band at 1640 cm 1 assigned to oh bending mode due to physiosorbed water 69 it can be observed in the spectrum of cli the appearing of new adsorption bands related to the presence of the surfactant on the surface at 2920 2850 and 1472 cm 1 the first two bands are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric c h stretching modes of the methylene group ch2 70 while the latter at 1472 cm 1 is attributed to stretching of nh these results are in agreement with previous reports where these adsorption bands are related to the effective loading of the hdtma surfactant on zeolites surfaces 71 however in lta spectrum was not possible to observe this behavior this could be explained by the fact that inner surface of lta is less accessible for the bulky hdtma surfactant compared with cli zeolite pore diameter of cli is 28 5 larger than lta see table 1 previously reported values of ecec external cationic exchange capacity depend upon this coverage and micelles formation clinoptilolite modified with hdtma exhibit a range in 0 11 15 meq 100 g 72 73 while there is no reports for zeolite type a modified with hdtma the results obtained from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms are presented in fig 3 lta and lta show an isotherm type i according to the iupac classification 74 this kind of behavior is characteristic for microporous materials 2 nm pore diameter such as synthetic zeolites on the other hand cli and cli exhibit an isotherm type iv which is related to the presence of micro and mesopores 2 50 nm pore diameter and also for natural zeolites to other some level trace impurities such as quartz and minerals the decrease of the adsorbed volume in the modified zeolites lta and cli suggests that the presence of hdtma onto the zeolites reduced the surface area as it can be seen in table 1 where a 6 and 30 decrease was observed if compared to lta and cli respectively the blocking of the pores could be the cause of the reduction of the specific surface area as others have reported 40 75 in previous works this kind of behavior has been reported where a similar surface modification led to a surface area reduction up to 50 71 a summary of the textural properties including surface area pore volume and diameter is reported in table 1 these values are in the range of natural and synthetic zeolites previously reported fig 4 shows sem images of both cli and cli materials these images are representative of the clinoptilolite morphology where characteristic stacked flake shape particles are observed also it can be seen that zeolite particles are less of 1 μm furthermore it can be appreciated that in the image of the modified zeolite with hdtma there is a relative smoothing of the edges of the crystalline particles this can be directly related to the coverage of the surfactant on the zeolite these results are in agreement with those of warchol et al 41 which have reported the appearance of an organic layer onto the zeolitic material table 2 shows the elemental composition of analyzed samples the si al ratio for cli is 4 51 representing typical values for natural zeolites and in particular the heulandite type 4 5 2 the si al ratio remains constant after surfactant addition cli 4 5 which is consistent with xrd and ftir results where is described that the zeolite structure did no change after the modification process the si and al content is related to the crystalline framework of the zeolite furthermore it is observed that the na content decreased on the zeolite surface around 78 suggesting that the cations contained in the amino groups of the hdtma have been adsorbed by ion exchange 41 however the nature of these interactions is more complex and more simultaneous phenomena such as hydrophobic bonding could be involved as pointed out by li et al 76 3 2 adsorption results 3 2 1 kinetics the kinetic behavior of the zeolite materials on the uptake of chromate ions 100 ppm ph 4 at 25 c is presented in fig 5 the chromate ions uptake increased with time and reached equilibrium after 100 min for all materials except for cli in this case the plateau was achieved after 3 h and no significant changes in concentration were observed after 24 h the initial chromate ions sorption rates by modified zeolites are very high as a large number of adsorption sites are available at the beginning of the process the sticking probability is large and consequently adsorption proceeds with a high rate over time the active sites are gradually filled by cr species and adsorption process becomes slow consequently the kinetic becomes dependent on the rate 52 as expected unmodified lta and cli show poor adsorption capacity mainly due to its natural repulsion for negative charged species this has been attributed to a net negative structural charge in zeolites resulting from isomorphic substitution of cations in the crystal lattice 40 on the other hand a positive influence of surface modification of materials lta and cli on the removal capacity can be observed when compared with their respective initial material i e lta and cli the adsorption of inorganic anions on the surface of the modified zeolites is attributed to the formation of a bilayer at the zeolite surface the surfactant provides positive exchange sites to the zeolite surface and the uptake of the chromium anions occurs mainly by ion exchange by replacing the weakly bonded surfactant anions br in this case 53 38 the difference of capacities between cli and lta could be related to the different hdtma coverage due to their porous limitations as previously explained it is clear that other mechanisms could exist simultaneously such as complexation and precipitation the analysis of these in detail is beyond of the scope of this paper see the works by de gennaro 77 for an overview fig 6 shows the curves of the kinetic models of pseudo first order and pseudo second order for lta cli lta and cli kinetic parameters are shown in table 3 the material lta was adjusted to pseudo first order with a regression coefficient r2 of 0 607 indicating at some extent physical interaction between cr vi ions and the sites of lta surface of the material is physical 53 in contrast lta cli y cli better fitted a pseudo second order model with regression coefficient r2 values as follows 0 990 0 946 and 0 957 respectively therefore there is not only a physical but also a chemical interaction between the cr vi ions and the surface 52 53 the presence of chemical sorption was also verified by the absence of cr vi desorption in the last stage of the removal process thus the interaction between cr vi and these materials is strong cli showed a superior sorptive capacity under the described conditions compared to the rest of materials studied in this work up to 7 mg g 1 these results are significant since a better performance is shown compared with the results reported by guzel et al and song et al 54 52 where the maximum capacity is in the range of 3 4 5 mg g 1 although lta adsorption capacity is relatively low when compared to cli it can be considered competitive or even superior when compared with other materials such as activated carbons clays and agro industrial where adsorption capacities have been reported within a range of 0 069 mg g to 3 00 mg g 78 84 this is remarkable since there is no previous reports about the modification of lta zeolite and applied for the adsorption of chrome from aqueous solutions in order to find evidence of the hdtma participation in the adsorption process infrared analyses of the cli adsorbent before and after chromium adsorption were performed fig 7 shows the comparison of the corresponding infrared spectra it can be observed that the frequencies of main bands attributed to the presence of surfactant on the surface of zeolite 2920 2850 and 1472 cm 1 did not change after the adsorption process it seems that the presence of chromate anions interacting with the surfactant does not disturb the hydrophobic interactions between alkyl groups as others have reported 85 however a slight decrease in the intensity of the mentioned absorption bands is noted this suggests that the zeolite modification with hdtma created the active sites for the chromium adsorption 86 3 2 2 ph effect the effect of ph on the sorption of chromate ions was evaluated using 100 ppm solutions in the ph 2 10 range fig 8 shows the results and the maximum adsorption of chromate ions by the materials lta lta and cli was within the range of 0 3 0 mg g 1 a relationship between chromate adsorption and ph was not observed at these conditions lta shows better adsorption than lta which is in agreement with the kinetic results evidencing the positive effect of the surfactant modification in the removal process cli shows a clear trend in which the capacity decreases as a function of ph a maximum capacity up to 7 5 mg g 1 at acidic ph values was observed this is also consistent with the kinetic tests for this material cli capacity also shows a decrease as the ph increases although to a lesser extent two main anionic cr vi forms exist in aqueous media chromate cro4 2 and dichromate hcro4 while the latter form is more common with low ph values 2 4 the chromate form predominates at ph values above 6 53 55 at low ph cli shows increased adsorption due to hcro4 species using only one single adsorption site in contrast at higher ph the bichromate species needs two adsorption sites decreasing adsorption 52 55 furthermore at high ph values competition between bichromate and hydroxyl oh ions for surface adsorption is present also at low ph values the surface of the modified materials is positively charged attracting the anionic cr vi species which in turn increases uptake while at high ph the surface is charged negatively promoting repulsion of anionic cr vi species hence decreasing adsorption 52 3 2 3 equilibrium isotherms adsorption isotherms are the representation of adsorbed amount as a function of equilibrium concentration at constant temperature and hence they are very useful to describe the interaction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent 55 equilibrium studies were conducted to characterize the adsorption equilibrium of cr upon the adsorbents surface langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich d r and sips isotherms models were fitted to equilibrium data langmuir isotherm proposes that adsorption takes place only in a monolayer and considers homogenous adsorption sites adsorption isotherm followed a better adjustment to freundlich model for cli r2 0 993 indicating a multilayer adsorption materials cli r2 0 838 lta r2 0 980 and lta r2 0 890 better fit sips model as can be seen in table 4 along with all the obtained parameters with adsorption isotherm models the sips model assumes the form of the freundlich model at low sorbate concentrations while at high concentrations it predicts a monolayer sorption behavior similar to the langmuir model 87 the constant ms is often regarded as the heterogeneity factor and the system heterogeneity could stem from the solid or the adsorbate or a combination of both in general ms 1 and as the value of the parameter becomes higher the system is more heterogeneous if the values are close to 1 they indicate a solid with relatively homogeneous binding sites 88 the results of this work show values of ms greater than 1 for lta 1 239 lta 1 281 and cli 1 487 indicating that there is a heterogeneous system on the other hand cli presents a value of 0 904 which could be relate to a more homogeneous surface for this material 89 this results agreed with the fact of cli also adjusted to langmuir model this adsorption process is performed in monolayer in the case of cli cr adsorption capacity was calculated with d r model and was higher than the parameter obtained with langmuir model being qmd 18 810 qm 11 268 mg g 1 respectively the qm value in langmuir is close to the obtained experimental value in this study this is observed in the adsorption capacity plot in fig 9 which shows a maximum cr adsorption of 9 83 mg g 1 table 5 shows a comparison of several modified zeolites in the adsorption of cr finding that cli is competitive and even superior that those here summarized in the langmuir model a higher kl in lta 0 515 l mg 1 and cli 0 281 l mg 1 is related with a better stability of cr in the surface when the surfactant is present 52 when compared with lta 0 373 l mg 1 and cli 0 057 l mg 1 in the freundlich model a value of 1 n 1 indicates the isotherms can be characterized as favorable at low ion concentrations 25 56 57 correspondingly the value of n is associated with adsorption favorability a range of 2 10 denotes good adsorption 1 2 indicates a moderately difficult adsorption and n 1 is related with unfavorable adsorption characteristics 54 in this study the values of 1 n were lower than 1 for all adsorbents while the values of n ranged between 3 2 and 7 7 indicating adsorption of cr is favorable at low concentrations the dubinin radushkevich model was used for the estimation of apparent free adsorption energy it is known that the magnitude of apparent adsorption energy e is useful to estimate the type of adsorption values below 8 kj mol 1 are related with physical adsorption while values above 16 kj mol 1 indicate chemical adsorption if the value of e is between the range of 8 and 16 kj mol 1 the adsorption may be explained due to ionic exchange 58 the values calculated in this study were 6 366 6 244 2 817 and 4 553 kj mol 1 for adsorption of cr in lta lta cli and cli respectively these values imply that the main mechanism involved is related with physical adsorption by ion exchange again this does not guarantee absence of chemical interaction but this interaction may be weak or low according to the model the model fitting graphs are shown in fig 10 3 2 4 adsorption tests using real water samples the adsorbent was studied using tap water that was spiked with 100 ppm of cr to evaluate its performance in a real field situation the average uptake capacity was 9 73 mg g results showed the adsorption capacity is practically unchanged compared to 9 83 mg g it is believed that the concentration of competing anions is negligible for that particular water sample which generally contains chlorine fluorine sulfates and nitrates this behavior could also be attributed to modified zeolite that has an enhanced selectivity for chromate ions at those particular conditions of ph and 25 c this result is remarkable as it shows that a zeolite like clinoptilolite can even retain a competitive amount of chromium even in real situations with an actual viable applicability 3 3 solidification vitrification for the solidification experiments only spent cli was evaluated due to this material presented the greater removal capacity under the described conditions fig 11 shows the spent cli sample after the vitrification process presenting a brown glassy solid these results are in agreement with previous reports al jubouri and holmes 93 suggest that the appearance of the final vitrified zeolite pollutant composite could be related to the melting of al and the adsorbed species at high temperature forming a very stable composite the encapsulation of cr ions was evaluated and the leached concentration after eight weeks of being suspended in aqueous solution shown in table 6 three different ph values 3 7 and 10 were evaluated observing that there is no significative concentration of total chromium leaching to the water and remained encapsulated the leached cr from the zeolite composite was practically undetected indicating that the chromate ions were successfully immobilized after the thermal treatment within the vitrified material additionally the ph of the solution does not seem to have any significant effect on the leaching process in fact reported values are very close to the detection limit supplied by the manufacturer in addition it has been recently reported that spent adsorbents that have been used to retain elements such as ni cu and zn and subsequently vitrified are presented as a sustainable alternative for the production of ceramics not only a significative volume reduction of the waste sludge presenting competitive advantages in their mechanical and even aesthetic properties 94 4 conclusions in this work a surface modification of two different type zeolites through a straightforward methodology involving the use of hdtma surfactant has enabled superior removal of chromium anions from aqueous solutions results indicated that although the surface modification decreased the surface area of the zeolites without treatments the experimental procedure did not alter the structure of the zeolites the presence of functional group ch2 on clinoptilolite was also evidenced and its presence could be related to the significant increase in the ability to attract anions under the described conditions proper surfactant coverage is very important to increase anion retention the results of the reduced incorporation of hdtma in the highly restricted pores of lta is interesting and exemplifies why there are no studies in the literature with a zeolite so widely used in processes of removal of contaminants from water kinetic results showed a trend to follow pseudo second order indicating a higher probability that the phenomena is not only governed by initial cr concentration but also by the nature of adsorptive sites onto zeolitic surface the zeolite cli showed greater cr removal at low ph values attributed to the presence of hcro4 while at higher ph values adsorption

13720,in this research surface modified zeolites linde type a and clinoptilolite were used for the chromate ions uptake from aqueous solutions as well as its encapsulation through a vitrification process the surface chemistry of zeolites was modified using a cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma to promote the capability of anions uptake the results of characterization by x ray diffraction showed unique crystalline phases for each zeolite which remain unchanged after the incorporation of the surfactant evidence from fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies revealed the effective bond of the hdtma on the clinoptilolite surface results suggested that the presence of ch2 groups after the modification play a key role for the anion attraction kinetic studies revealed that surfactant modified clinoptilolite was able to adsorb 9 83 mg g of chromate and better fitted pseudo second order model r2 0 957 the equilibrium was better represented by freundlich model r2 0 993 finally the proposed vitrification process the spent zeolitic adsorbent was successful avoiding leaching of chromate ions after two months at different ph values keywords surface modified zeolites chromium uptake spent adsorbent vitrification 1 introduction one of the greatest environmental challenges is the proper quality control in wastewater discharge in particular the disposal of heavy metals in these streams has risen public concern due to these pollutants are non degradable highly toxic and sometimes carcinogenic such as arsenic as cadmium cd chromium cr and nickel ni 1 many industries such as mining tanneries electroplating paints and dye production 2 are still currently a significant source of contamination of water bodies moreover in developing countries where legislation is not always enforced adequately 3 chromium cr can be frequently found in aqueous media as both cr iii and cr vi oxidation states being the trivalent variety the more stable species while hexavalent chromium is more threatening to environment due to high mobility and solubility 4 the mobility of cr vi has been explained in terms of speciation where depending on ph conditions and metal concentration it is found as anionic chromate or dichromate which makes it very complicated to adsorb onto many mineral species 5 also it has been reported that cr vi is carcinogenic and mutagenic representing a hazardous threat to human health 6 the u s environmental protection agency usepa has set a maximum contaminant level of 100 parts per billion for total chromium in drinking water 7 recent trends and efforts in the chromium removal stabilization from wastewater include precipitation 8 reverse osmosis 9 nanofiltration 10 electrochemical procedures 11 and adsorption 12 adsorption technologies present several advantages such as efficiency selectivity ease to design and implement lower capital cost and regeneration capabilities 13 furthermore the use of non expensive adsorbents can reduce even more the associated costs of the adsorption process a vast number of materials of different nature have been evaluated as chromium adsorbents for example agroindustrial residues such as apple peel 12 pineapple leaves 14 maize zea mays 15 corncob 16 and rice straw 17 also waste materials such as tires 18 and crawfish shells 19 have been applied for the same purpose moreover composites such as chitosan montmorillonite 20 iron graphene 21 pvp mos2 22 and more recently novel metalorganic framework mof materials such as zn bdc dmf and silver triazolate have been also studied with promising results 23 24 most of these works evaluate the sorption characteristics for chromium vi and reported a wide range of removal percentages from 57 to 100 is exhibited depending upon the adsorption process conditions such as ph time and dosage along with additional particular factors zeolites are a versatile family of microporous and crystalline materials formed by silicon and aluminum tetrahedra connected by oxygen atoms 25 the aluminum presence in the zeolite gives origin to an unbalanced framework having as a consequence the intrinsic cationic exchange capacity 26 in general zeolites present an adequate porosity which is the main reason why these materials have been classically applied to remove cations from aqueous bodies with high efficiency synthetic zeolites such as type a and type x have been used to adsorb co cu zn ni and mn ions respectively 27 29 noroozi et al 30 used surfactant modified nanosized zeolite particles for the cyanide uptake also the same research group has reported the use of statistical functions to study the cyanide uptake kinetics using zeolite a nanoparticles 31 clinoptilolite the most abundant natural zeolite has been extensively used to remove metallic ions from water such as pb cs cu zn fe and cd 32 35 in addition to this recent efforts have been made to include anions and oxyanions for which they naturally have very low affinity in the group of potentially toxic compounds that could be removed by zeolites the versatility of these has allowed the proposal of several methodologies with the aim of tuning their sorption characteristics and improve their capability of attracting these anionic species the most widely used techniques are the use of surfactants chemical functionalization and the incorporation of metallic species 36 surface modified zeolites smz make use of surfactants which are generally long chain quaternary ammonium salts and allow the modification of the surface polarity of the zeolite these materials have been called also organ zeolites clinoptilolite type a zeolite mcm 41 and mordenite are examples of materials that have been treated with hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma and octadecyltrimethylammonium odtma and applied in the removal of chromates phosphates sulfates and arsenates 37 42 with promising results in the particular case of chromium ions the use of cationic surfactants to improve the adsorption capacity of zeolites is widely reported most of the studies agreed that a mechanism of exchange anions governs the adsorption phenomenon of cr on smz thus there is a significant effect of the ph in the systems on the speciation of cr and it has been found that acidic ph in the liquid phase is the best condition to achieve high adsorption of cr 40 46 however the used adsorbent represents an environmental hazard due to potential leaching and despite the numerous publications about the successful use of smz in the adsorption of heavy metals the adequate disposal must be considered recently harikishore et al 47 published an exhaustive article that summarizes the possibilities of spent adsorbents such as fertilizers catalysts and food additives particularly in soil fertilization processes zeolites that have removed nitrates ammonium phosphates or ions such as k cu zn or ca have been used which are beneficial compounds as nutrients for the soil or plants 48 49 however most of these adsorbed compounds do not represent major health risks as heavy metals in addition another problem is that the proper application of zeolite as a soil amendment or fertilizer needs a comprehensive study of the nutritional requirements of a particular crop and also of the physicochemical properties of the soil as well as the environmental conditions one of the most widespread uses of zeolites is as a catalyst or catalyst support in chemical reactions nevertheless the proposal to use a wasted zeolite based adsorbent seems unreliable since the objective of adsorption is to accumulate the greatest number of toxic elements but this is not necessarily the best for a catalytic process where an adequate distribution of the metallic species and specific particle sizes is often required finally the use of zeolites as a food additive after having adsorbed heavy metals is clearly prohibitive regardless of the aforementioned regeneration or recovery processes once it has been completely saturated the spent zeolite not only becomes useless but also converts into a new pollution source if it is not properly confined encapsulation of potential toxic metals in post sorbents through vitrification seems as a promissory strategy since produces chemically stable materials and reduces final disposal volume following a relatively straightforward method 50 vitrification is defined as the transformation of a substance into glass i e a non crystalline substance 51 this process is achieved under a high temperature treatment around the fusion point of the precursor materials mckittrick et al 52 have reported the vitrification from zeolite precursors they have described that the porous zeolite structure collapses when is heated and forms a glass prior to a crystallization stage ruled by equilibrium phase diagram under a thermal treatment these transitions have used to produce glassy bodies in the 1000 1200 c range the vitrification process has been recognized as a viable alternative for waste volume reduction in several fields such as nuclear industry there is scarce literature regarding the final disposal of zeolitic adsorbents where a safe management of the wasted adsorbent it is considered al jubouri et al 53 proposes the encapsulation of mn ii after the sorption process using vitrification and geopolymerization processes el eswed et al 54 solidified pb ii cu ii and cd ii producing kaolin zeolite geopolymers currently there are no data on the encapsulation of potentially toxic chromate ions over a surfactant modified zeolite through vitrification process this paper compares the performance of natural clinoptilolite and synthetic lta in the process of adsorption of chromium ions from an aqueous medium the zeolites were previously subjected to surface conditioning with hdtma surfactant adsorption kinetics was investigated using pseudo first and pseudo second order models langmuir freundlich and d r isotherms were used to describe the thermodynamic equilibrium between the solid and the adsorbed species additionally the encapsulation of cr ions via vitrification method was proposed as a feasible and practical alternative for the final and safe disposal of a based zeolite spent adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of lta lta zeolite was synthesized following the hydrothermal route the initial gel composition was 3na2o 0 85sio2 al2o3 180h2o 29 in a typical run 1 5 g of naoh 99 sigma aldrich was dissolved in 70 ml of deionized water then 4 4 g of sodium aluminate sigma aldrich were added and vigorously mixed until complete dissolution after 2 76 g of sodium metasilicate 98 sigma aldrich were added and stirred for 24 h afterwards the gel was transferred to a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave reactor for 3 h at 100 c the product was recovered by filtration and washed with deionized water until ph was below 9 the final solid was then dried for 24 h at 80 c and labeled as lta 2 2 clinoptilolite natural zeolite has been kindly supplied by san francisco mine san luis potosi mexico its chemical composition has been previously reported in a previous work 64 4 sio2 12 2 al2o3 1 13 fe2o3 0 54 na2o 3 07 k2o 2 6 cao and 0 5 mgo 55 clinoptilolite was sieved and mixed with a 2 m nacl solution to provide more homogeneous exchangeable ions in a typical run 1 g of zeolite was mixed with 50 ml of solution and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 24 h finally the solid material was washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 80 c and labeled as cli 2 3 zeolites conditioning this methodology has been adapted from leyva ramos et al 40 the modification of both lta and cli zeolites was achieved by using 0 06 m hdtma solution for this 1 g of each zeolite was mixed with 10 ml of the surfactant solution later the suspension was stirred for 24 h at room temperature and recovered by filtration materials were subsequently dried at 80 c overnight modified zeolite a and clinoptilolite were labeled lta and cli respectively 2 4 characterization structural characteristics of the materials were investigated by x ray diffraction using a siemens d5000 diffractometer germany with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å at 35 kv in the 2θ angular range of 5 50 with a step size of 0 020 min textural properties were determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k obtained with a micromeritics tristar ii device usa specific surface area was estimated with the brunauer emmet and teller method bet in a range of partial p p0 of 0 0 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to identify the chemical functional groups on the materials surface where a perkin elmer instrument spectrum one model usa was employed in the range from 500 to 4000 cm 1 morphological and elemental analysis were performed by scanning electron microscopy sem with field emission and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx using a jeol jsm 6701 f instrument 2 5 batch adsorption studies chromium uptake experiments were carried out using potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 sigma aldrich solutions and initial ph was adjusted using solutions of naoh and hcl 0 1 m accordingly the analysis of the liquid fractions was performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy cintra gbc 942 aa usa by direct aspiration into an air acetylene flame at a flowrate of 0 4 ml min using a wavelength of 327 5 nm all measurements were carried out by duplicate and the averages are presented in the results section the kinetic characteristics were studied by contacting 0 1 g of the zeolitic material with 10 ml a cr solution 100 ppm ph 4 at 25 c the suspensions were stirred in an orbital rocker and aliquots were taken and filtered after 5 10 15 30 60 90 120 360 and 1440 min respectively pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso equations have been applied to characterize the kinetic behavior of zeolitic materials and are defined as d q d t k 1 q e p f o q p f o d q d t k 2 q e p s o q e p s o 2 where qpfo and qpso are the chromium adsorption capacities estimated by the kinetic models in mg g 1 k1 is the pfo rate constant in min 1 and k2 is the pso rate constant in g mg 1 min 1 56 57 the effect of ph was also investigated taking the 2 4 6 8 and 10 as initial values in a typical run 10 ml of cr solution 100 ppm was contacted with 0 1 g of the correspondent zeolite and rocked for 24 h after the supernatant was recovered by filtration and analyzed finally the thermodynamic equilibrium of the sorptive process was studied by varying the initial concentration of cr 20 40 60 80 and 100 ppm for this 0 1 g of the zeolite were contacted with 10 ml of cr solution ph 4 for 24 h at 25 c and the total cr in the liquid fraction was quantified by aas the solid fraction i e the spent zeolitic adsorbent was also recovered for the final disposition study the removal capacity q mg g 1 for all aforementioned studies was determined by q c 0 c v m where c0 mg l 1 is the initial chromium concentration c mg l 1 is the chromium concentration after adsorption at any time t min v l is the solution volume and m g is the adsorbent mass langmuir and

estimated by non linear generalized reduced gradient algorithm grg2 and the coefficient of determination r2 was used to test the model fitting the objective function was the sum of the squared differences between experimental and model data 2 6 vitrification and leaching study the proposed method for chromate encapsulation is based on the works of al jubouri et al 53 the vitrification process of spent cli 1 1 these experiments were only carried out using cli since it showed an enhanced sorptive capacity compared to lta begun taking the used material at the higher concentration of chromate ions and longer time period i e 100 ppm and 24 h and then recovered by centrifugation and dried overnight a thermal treatment was carried out using a heating rate of 5 c min and kept at 1200 c for 2 h under oxidant atmosphere in a muffle furnace leaching experiments were proposed in order to evaluate the effective encapsulation of chromate ions the vitrified material was put in contact with deionized water varying ph 3 7 and 10 with stirring for eight weeks at room temperature after this period the total concentration of cr was assessed using aa under conditions previously described 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization fig 1 compares the diffractograms of the different zeolitic materials used in this work evidencing that unmodified zeolites i e lta and cli presented the characteristic peaks of its correspondent crystalline structure for lta at 7 1 2 0 0 10 1 2 2 0 and 12 4 2 2 2 according to jcpds no 73 2340 62 and for cli the main diffraction intensities are observed at 9 8 0 2 0 11 1 2 0 0 and 22 3 4 0 0 according to the pdf file 39 1383 and corresponding with the reported simulated xrd patterns for zeolites 63 the results of lta and cli indicated that the crystalline structure remained unchanged after the surfactant process preserving all the intensity peaks very close to unmodified zeolites this result suggest that the modification takes place only on the external surface of the materials agreeing with previous works 64 65 however the peaks for lta and cli patterns showed a decreased intensity when compared to unmodified zeolites this observation is also in agreement with the reported by asiedu 66 where a decrease after a similar chemical modification was observed kwon et al 67 also observed a reduction on peak intensities between different zeolite samples they attributed this effect to nanocrystalline zeolite particles assembling into a big aggregate decrease of peak intensity after zeolite modification has also been associated with pore closure by the organic surfactant material 68 fig 2 shows the ftir spectroscopy results the four materials show the characteristic absorption band in the 950 1250 cm 1 region which is generally attributed to the stretching of the si o and al o bonds in the structural units 69 this result is in agreement with xrd results and also confirms that the zeolite structure either cli or lta is not affected by the surface modification process further in the spectra appear a band at 1640 cm 1 assigned to oh bending mode due to physiosorbed water 69 it can be observed in the spectrum of cli the appearing of new adsorption bands related to the presence of the surfactant on the surface at 2920 2850 and 1472 cm 1 the first two bands are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric c h stretching modes of the methylene group ch2 70 while the latter at 1472 cm 1 is attributed to stretching of nh these results are in agreement with previous reports where these adsorption bands are related to the effective loading of the hdtma surfactant on zeolites surfaces 71 however in lta spectrum was not possible to observe this behavior this could be explained by the fact that inner surface of lta is less accessible for the bulky hdtma surfactant compared with cli zeolite pore diameter of cli is 28 5 larger than lta see table 1 previously reported values of ecec external cationic exchange capacity depend upon this coverage and micelles formation clinoptilolite modified with hdtma exhibit a range in 0 11 15 meq 100 g 72 73 while there is no reports for zeolite type a modified with hdtma the results obtained from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms are presented in fig 3 lta and lta show an isotherm type i according to the iupac classification 74 this kind of behavior is characteristic for microporous materials 2 nm pore diameter such as synthetic zeolites on the other hand cli and cli exhibit an isotherm type iv which is related to the presence of micro and mesopores 2 50 nm pore diameter and also for natural zeolites to other some level trace impurities such as quartz and minerals the decrease of the adsorbed volume in the modified zeolites lta and cli suggests that the presence of hdtma onto the zeolites reduced the surface area as it can be seen in table 1 where a 6 and 30 decrease was observed if compared to lta and cli respectively the blocking of the pores could be the cause of the reduction of the specific surface area as others have reported 40 75 in previous works this kind of behavior has been reported where a similar surface modification led to a surface area reduction up to 50 71 a summary of the textural properties including surface area pore volume and diameter is reported in table 1 these values are in the range of natural and synthetic zeolites previously reported fig 4 shows sem images of both cli and cli materials these images are representative of the clinoptilolite morphology where characteristic stacked flake shape particles are observed also it can be seen that zeolite particles are less of 1 μm furthermore it can be appreciated that in the image of the modified zeolite with hdtma there is a relative smoothing of the edges of the crystalline particles this can be directly related to the coverage of the surfactant on the zeolite these results are in agreement with those of warchol et al 41 which have reported the appearance of an organic layer onto the zeolitic material table 2 shows the elemental composition of analyzed samples the si al ratio for cli is 4 51 representing typical values for natural zeolites and in particular the heulandite type 4 5 2 the si al ratio remains constant after surfactant addition cli 4 5 which is consistent with xrd and ftir results where is described that the zeolite structure did no change after the modification process the si and al content is related to the crystalline framework of the zeolite furthermore it is observed that the na content decreased on the zeolite surface around 78 suggesting that the cations contained in the amino groups of the hdtma have been adsorbed by ion exchange 41 however the nature of these interactions is more complex and more simultaneous phenomena such as hydrophobic bonding could be involved as pointed out by li et al 76 3 2 adsorption results 3 2 1 kinetics the kinetic behavior of the zeolite materials on the uptake of chromate ions 100 ppm ph 4 at 25 c is presented in fig 5 the chromate ions uptake increased with time and reached equilibrium after 100 min for all materials except for cli in this case the plateau was achieved after 3 h and no significant changes in concentration were observed after 24 h the initial chromate ions sorption rates by modified zeolites are very high as a large number of adsorption sites are available at the beginning of the process the sticking probability is large and consequently adsorption proceeds with a high rate over time the active sites are gradually filled by cr species and adsorption process becomes slow consequently the kinetic becomes dependent on the rate 52 as expected unmodified lta and cli show poor adsorption capacity mainly due to its natural repulsion for negative charged species this has been attributed to a net negative structural charge in zeolites resulting from isomorphic substitution of cations in the crystal lattice 40 on the other hand a positive influence of surface modification of materials lta and cli on the removal capacity can be observed when compared with their respective initial material i e lta and cli the adsorption of inorganic anions on the surface of the modified zeolites is attributed to the formation of a bilayer at the zeolite surface the surfactant provides positive exchange sites to the zeolite surface and the uptake of the chromium anions occurs mainly by ion exchange by replacing the weakly bonded surfactant anions br in this case 53 38 the difference of capacities between cli and lta could be related to the different hdtma coverage due to their porous limitations as previously explained it is clear that other mechanisms could exist simultaneously such as complexation and precipitation the analysis of these in detail is beyond of the scope of this paper see the works by de gennaro 77 for an overview fig 6 shows the curves of the kinetic models of pseudo first order and pseudo second order for lta cli lta and cli kinetic parameters are shown in table 3 the material lta was adjusted to pseudo first order with a regression coefficient r2 of 0 607 indicating at some extent physical interaction between cr vi ions and the sites of lta surface of the material is physical 53 in contrast lta cli y cli better fitted a pseudo second order model with regression coefficient r2 values as follows 0 990 0 946 and 0 957 respectively therefore there is not only a physical but also a chemical interaction between the cr vi ions and the surface 52 53 the presence of chemical sorption was also verified by the absence of cr vi desorption in the last stage of the removal process thus the interaction between cr vi and these materials is strong cli showed a superior sorptive capacity under the described conditions compared to the rest of materials studied in this work up to 7 mg g 1 these results are significant since a better performance is shown compared with the results reported by guzel et al and song et al 54 52 where the maximum capacity is in the range of 3 4 5 mg g 1 although lta adsorption capacity is relatively low when compared to cli it can be considered competitive or even superior when compared with other materials such as activated carbons clays and agro industrial where adsorption capacities have been reported within a range of 0 069 mg g to 3 00 mg g 78 84 this is remarkable since there is no previous reports about the modification of lta zeolite and applied for the adsorption of chrome from aqueous solutions in order to find evidence of the hdtma participation in the adsorption process infrared analyses of the cli adsorbent before and after chromium adsorption were performed fig 7 shows the comparison of the corresponding infrared spectra it can be observed that the frequencies of main bands attributed to the presence of surfactant on the surface of zeolite 2920 2850 and 1472 cm 1 did not change after the adsorption process it seems that the presence of chromate anions interacting with the surfactant does not disturb the hydrophobic interactions between alkyl groups as others have reported 85 however a slight decrease in the intensity of the mentioned absorption bands is noted this suggests that the zeolite modification with hdtma created the active sites for the chromium adsorption 86 3 2 2 ph effect the effect of ph on the sorption of chromate ions was evaluated using 100 ppm solutions in the ph 2 10 range fig 8 shows the results and the maximum adsorption of chromate ions by the materials lta lta and cli was within the range of 0 3 0 mg g 1 a relationship between chromate adsorption and ph was not observed at these conditions lta shows better adsorption than lta which is in agreement with the kinetic results evidencing the positive effect of the surfactant modification in the removal process cli shows a clear trend in which the capacity decreases as a function of ph a maximum capacity up to 7 5 mg g 1 at acidic ph values was observed this is also consistent with the kinetic tests for this material cli capacity also shows a decrease as the ph increases although to a lesser extent two main anionic cr vi forms exist in aqueous media chromate cro4 2 and dichromate hcro4 while the latter form is more common with low ph values 2 4 the chromate form predominates at ph values above 6 53 55 at low ph cli shows increased adsorption due to hcro4 species using only one single adsorption site in contrast at higher ph the bichromate species needs two adsorption sites decreasing adsorption 52 55 furthermore at high ph values competition between bichromate and hydroxyl oh ions for surface adsorption is present also at low ph values the surface of the modified materials is positively charged attracting the anionic cr vi species which in turn increases uptake while at high ph the surface is charged negatively promoting repulsion of anionic cr vi species hence decreasing adsorption 52 3 2 3 equilibrium isotherms adsorption isotherms are the representation of adsorbed amount as a function of equilibrium concentration at constant temperature and hence they are very useful to describe the interaction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent 55 equilibrium studies were conducted to characterize the adsorption equilibrium of cr upon the adsorbents surface langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich d r and sips isotherms models were fitted to equilibrium data langmuir isotherm proposes that adsorption takes place only in a monolayer and considers homogenous adsorption sites adsorption isotherm followed a better adjustment to freundlich model for cli r2 0 993 indicating a multilayer adsorption materials cli r2 0 838 lta r2 0 980 and lta r2 0 890 better fit sips model as can be seen in table 4 along with all the obtained parameters with adsorption isotherm models the sips model assumes the form of the freundlich model at low sorbate concentrations while at high concentrations it predicts a monolayer sorption behavior similar to the langmuir model 87 the constant ms is often regarded as the heterogeneity factor and the system heterogeneity could stem from the solid or the adsorbate or a combination of both in general ms 1 and as the value of the parameter becomes higher the system is more heterogeneous if the values are close to 1 they indicate a solid with relatively homogeneous binding sites 88 the results of this work show values of ms greater than 1 for lta 1 239 lta 1 281 and cli 1 487 indicating that there is a heterogeneous system on the other hand cli presents a value of 0 904 which could be relate to a more homogeneous surface for this material 89 this results agreed with the fact of cli also adjusted to langmuir model this adsorption process is performed in monolayer in the case of cli cr adsorption capacity was calculated with d r model and was higher than the parameter obtained with langmuir model being qmd 18 810 qm 11 268 mg g 1 respectively the qm value in langmuir is close to the obtained experimental value in this study this is observed in the adsorption capacity plot in fig 9 which shows a maximum cr adsorption of 9 83 mg g 1 table 5 shows a comparison of several modified zeolites in the adsorption of cr finding that cli is competitive and even superior that those here summarized in the langmuir model a higher kl in lta 0 515 l mg 1 and cli 0 281 l mg 1 is related with a better stability of cr in the surface when the surfactant is present 52 when compared with lta 0 373 l mg 1 and cli 0 057 l mg 1 in the freundlich model a value of 1 n 1 indicates the isotherms can be characterized as favorable at low ion concentrations 25 56 57 correspondingly the value of n is associated with adsorption favorability a range of 2 10 denotes good adsorption 1 2 indicates a moderately difficult adsorption and n 1 is related with unfavorable adsorption characteristics 54 in this study the values of 1 n were lower than 1 for all adsorbents while the values of n ranged between 3 2 and 7 7 indicating adsorption of cr is favorable at low concentrations the dubinin radushkevich model was used for the estimation of apparent free adsorption energy it is known that the magnitude of apparent adsorption energy e is useful to estimate the type of adsorption values below 8 kj mol 1 are related with physical adsorption while values above 16 kj mol 1 indicate chemical adsorption if the value of e is between the range of 8 and 16 kj mol 1 the adsorption may be explained due to ionic exchange 58 the values calculated in this study were 6 366 6 244 2 817 and 4 553 kj mol 1 for adsorption of cr in lta lta cli and cli respectively these values imply that the main mechanism involved is related with physical adsorption by ion exchange again this does not guarantee absence of chemical interaction but this interaction may be weak or low according to the model the model fitting graphs are shown in fig 10 3 2 4 adsorption tests using real water samples the adsorbent was studied using tap water that was spiked with 100 ppm of cr to evaluate its performance in a real field situation the average uptake capacity was 9 73 mg g results showed the adsorption capacity is practically unchanged compared to 9 83 mg g it is believed that the concentration of competing anions is negligible for that particular water sample which generally contains chlorine fluorine sulfates and nitrates this behavior could also be attributed to modified zeolite that has an enhanced selectivity for chromate ions at those particular conditions of ph and 25 c this result is remarkable as it shows that a zeolite like clinoptilolite can even retain a competitive amount of chromium even in real situations with an actual viable applicability 3 3 solidification vitrification for the solidification experiments only spent cli was evaluated due to this material presented the greater removal capacity under the described conditions fig 11 shows the spent cli sample after the vitrification process presenting a brown glassy solid these results are in agreement with previous reports al jubouri and holmes 93 suggest that the appearance of the final vitrified zeolite pollutant composite could be related to the melting of al and the adsorbed species at high temperature forming a very stable composite the encapsulation of cr ions was evaluated and the leached concentration after eight weeks of being suspended in aqueous solution shown in table 6 three different ph values 3 7 and 10 were evaluated observing that there is no significative concentration of total chromium leaching to the water and remained encapsulated the leached cr from the zeolite composite was practically undetected indicating that the chromate ions were successfully immobilized after the thermal treatment within the vitrified material additionally the ph of the solution does not seem to have any significant effect on the leaching process in fact reported values are very close to the detection limit supplied by the manufacturer in addition it has been recently reported that spent adsorbents that have been used to retain elements such as ni cu and zn and subsequently vitrified are presented as a sustainable alternative for the production of ceramics not only a significative volume reduction of the waste sludge presenting competitive advantages in their mechanical and even aesthetic properties 94 4 conclusions in this work a surface modification of two different type zeolites through a straightforward methodology involving the use of hdtma surfactant has enabled superior removal of chromium anions from aqueous solutions results indicated that although the surface modification decreased the surface area of the zeolites without treatments the experimental procedure did not alter the structure of the zeolites the presence of functional group ch2 on clinoptilolite was also evidenced and its presence could be related to the significant increase in the ability to attract anions under the described conditions proper surfactant coverage is very important to increase anion retention the results of the reduced incorporation of hdtma in the highly restricted pores of lta is interesting and exemplifies why there are no studies in the literature with a zeolite so widely used in processes of removal of contaminants from water kinetic results showed a trend to follow pseudo second order indicating a higher probability that the phenomena is not only governed by initial cr concentration but also by the nature of adsorptive sites onto zeolitic surface the zeolite cli showed greater cr removal at low ph values attributed to the presence of hcro4 while at higher ph values adsorption decreases the final disposition of a spent zeolitic material via thermal treatment was successfully carried out and after eight weeks there was no evidence that cr ions have been leached from the vitrified sample clinoptilolite is presented as a material with tunable properties and high potential for ion removal also being able to immobilize toxic ions within its structure declaration of

13721,petroleum refinery wastewater prw contains high concentrations of phenolic compounds and ammonia that are noxious and harmful to the environment especially to human health the improper treatment of prw could cause serious problems in this study a membrane with a polyvinyl alcohol pva coating was fabricated to improve prw treatment for phenolic compounds and ammonia removal the fabricated membranes were investigated using scanning electron microscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir water contact angle mechanical strength permeability pollutant rejection and foulant resistance the coated membranes exhibited improved surface properties and mechanical strength compared to that of uncoated pristine polysulfone psf membranes the membranes also showed excellent phenol and ammonia removal up to 82 68 and 92 42 respectively although the permeate flux decreased with increasing pva concentration the antifouling behavior of the membrane was significantly improved therefore the fabricated membranes showed great potential for petroleum wastewater treatment keywords ammonia membrane petroleum phenol polyvinyl alcohol wastewater 1 introduction the large quantity of polluted wastewater generated by petroleum refineries requires treatment technologies to remove hazardous contaminants 1 in general the refinery industry generates a wastewater volume that is about 0 4 1 6 times greater than that of the volume of refined oil 2 petroleum refinery wastewater prw usually contains a high concentration of contaminants such as dissolved oil organics hydrocarbon derivatives heavy metals phenolic compounds ammonia and a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod 3 4 as reported in many studies prw generally contains dissolved oil and grease at 500 3000 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod at 750 1600 mg l 1 and 300 1000 mg l 1 respectively 5 toxic organics such as phenolic compounds are found in prw at approximately 950 mg l 1 and ammonia and sulfide are typically at 20 80 mg l 1 and 13 17 mg l 1 respectively 6 in some cases heavy metals and radioactive materials are observed in refinery wastewaters 7 existing prw treatments usually only reduce the total solids and major organic pollutants however this treated wastewater still contains phenolic compounds and ammonia at high concentrations phenolic compounds are identified as priority contaminants as they are highly toxic and corrosive even at a low concentration 8 the sources of phenolic compounds in prw are usually from the tank water drain multiphase separator desalter water effluent and neutralized spent caustic waste in pertamina ltd indonesia the primary source of the phenols is the residual fluid catalytic cracking rfcc waste stream with an average phenol concentration of 960 mg l 1 6 in recent years phenol and its derivatives have warranted more attention in the field of industrial wastewater because of their toxicity and contamination in wastewater production phenolic compounds discharged into the environment remain for long periods and harm the ecosystem especially humans 9 10 phenolic compounds that are commonly found in prw are phenol m p cresol o cresol tri and tetra chlorophenols and 4 chloro 3 cresol 11 as shown in fig 1 the us environmental protection agency epa has labeled phenolic derivatives as a priority contaminant in water the limited concentration of phenol in wastewater discharge was set strictly to avoid environmental damage the toxicity level of phenol derivatives is usually in the range of 9 25 mg l 1 for both humans and aquatic life 12 long term exposure to phenol can lead to a serious health problem such as diarrhea vertigo salivation tremors coma and respiratory failure for humans exposed to lethal doses therefore industries that produce phenol contaminated wastewater such as petroleum refineries must pay attention to the treatment of wastewater to meet quality standards of wastewater discharge another pollutant in petroleum refinery wastewater and petrochemicals that becomes a serious issue is ammonia ammonia in wastewater is usually generated from the degradation of nitrogen components excessive ammonia in wastewater is highly toxic and harmful to the environment and human health moreover ammonia is associated with the malodor problem of wastewater 13 generally the ammonia nitrogen content in refinery wastewater is in the range of 20 80 mg l 1 14 treatment using chemical and biological methods are unable to nitrify the ammonia content to the desired level ammonia in wastewater is generated from the degradation process of nitrogen containing compounds ammonia is toxic to aquatic life and human health at very low concentrations the common maximum permitted level of ammonia in discharged wastewater is 0 7 mg l 1 15 ammonia in water can be in an equilibrium state of dissolved ammonia and ammonium ions or bound as organic amine r nh2 as shown in eq 1 1 nh3 h2o nh4 oh wastewater from food processing plants is nutritious enough to enrich the nitrification bacteria by converting ammonium ions to nitrate ions however in petroleum wastewater treatment nitrifying bacteria are seldom observed because of poor nutritional content therefore it is highly important to develop an effective method for phenolic compounds and ammonia removal or neutralization given their serious environmental threat in recent decades many attempts have been made to eliminate contaminants in prw such as the advanced oxidation process aop coagulation absorption adsorption chemical and biological treatments 16 18 such methods effectively remove a variety of organic compounds however membrane separation is considered a faster and more efficient process than other physically driven and equilibrium driven processes conventional size exclusion based separations such as ultrafiltration is unable to remove phenolic compounds or ammonia with high separation efficiency 19 hence a dense membrane such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration membrane is required resulting in high energy consumption 20 and faster fouling formation a hybrid process such as the adsorption prior to membrane separation has been previously reported 21 using activated carbon followed by an ultrafiltration membrane this process effectively reduced energy consumption however the process is complex as it requires more than one stage in the past few years the membrane research is dominated by the development of mixed matrix membranes mmms that combine the molecular sieving mechanism and adsorption of inorganic filler furthermore the introduction of inorganic material significantly increases the surface properties mechanical strength and perm selectivity of the fabricated membrane 22 polymeric membranes with an embedded microsized inorganic filler have shown excellent performance in removing various organic compounds during water treatment and the membrane s hydrophilic property can be significantly improved however the incorporation of inorganic filler at normal size micron scale into polymeric membranes has the risk of producing defective membranes a defect membrane might be caused by the formation unselective void as the result of the de attachment between the polymer and the particle surface 23 recent developments include the incorporation of nanosized inorganic particles because of their higher surface area high shape uniformity and excellent affinity with a polymer matrix 24 many researchers have reported that the incorporation of nanosized inorganic materials and functionalized metal oxides into a polymeric membrane significantly enhance the permeability structural properties surface hydrophilicity antifouling behavior and separation properties 25 26 however in some cases of wastewater with a high organic level such as prw the utilization of the nanohybrid membrane has a short lifetime because of surface fouling 27 moreover the membrane with a smaller pore size that is used to remove molecular pollutants leads to low permeability in this study a nanohybrid psf membrane was used as a support membrane and a polyvinyl alcohol pva layer was added to improve the membrane surface properties pva is a low cost polymer that possesses good chemical and mechanical stability excellent hydrophilicity and film forming ability which is widely used as the coating material pva can be used to produce a stable membrane with good mechanical properties and selective permeability to water by crosslinking grafting or other modification reactions the objectives of introducing pva on the psf membrane were to enhance the removal efficiency of phenol and ammonia in petroleum wastewater and to improve the membrane mechanical properties as well as to minimize the membrane fouling during operation furthermore the removal efficiency and permeability were studied using untreated petroleum refinery wastewater effluent to explore the industrial applicability of this technique 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials polysulfone udel psu p1700nt polymer granules were purchased from solvay usa and used as the main polymer of the membrane preparation n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent and sulfuric acid were supplied from merck usa polyvinyl alcohol pva 86 88 hydrolyzed mw 130 000 da polyethylene glycol peg with a molecular weight of

prw sedimentation coagulation effluent was obtained from pertamina ltd and the characteristics of the wastewater are presented in table 1 2 2 preparation of the nanohybrid psf zno membrane nanohybrid psf zno membranes were fabricated via a non solvent induced phase separation nips method adapted from a previous study 28 zno nanoparticles were dispersed in nmp at various total solid concentrations as shown in table 2 and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min psf and peg were dissolved in nmp at the polymer concentrations listed in table 2 and stirred for 8 h the zno suspensions and polymer solutions were blended and homogenized the polymer solution was then cast using a manual casting machine with an outlet gap thickness of 150 μm the polymer film was evaporated for 60 s to form a selective layer and was subsequently immersed in pure water for 24 h at room temperature for complete phase separation the wet membranes were placed between filter papers and dried at 50 c for 24 h 2 3 pva coating of the psf zno membrane surface according to the previous work 29 the addition of zno in polymer matrix significantly improved the permeate flux and mechanical strength of the membrane but risks on creating unselective gap coating procedure using pva polymer on the fabricated nanohybrid membrane one of which aims to help overcoming the aforementioned issue the pva coating was prepared by dip coating the top surface of the membrane to provide a selectivity property 30 pva solutions were prepared with the concentrations in table 2 an appropriate amount of pva granules was dissolved in deionized water at 85 c under constant stirring for 8 h the top side of the membrane was dipped into the pva solution and the excess solution on the membrane surface was wiped off using filter paper the coated membranes were crosslinked using a crosslink agent containing 5 wt glutaraldehyde and 0 5 wt sulfuric acid as the catalyst the coated membranes were rinsed to remove the residual chemicals a schematic illustration of the membrane coating using pva is shown in fig 2 2 4 membrane characterization by sem and ft ir the morphology of both the surface and internal structure of the fabricated membranes were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy sem jeol series jsm 6510 la japan the morphological structure of the membrane was observed at low and high magnification 1000x and 20 000x fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir perkin elmer frontier usa was used for the investigation of the change in the chemical groups as a result of the modification treatment the ft ir spectra of the fabricated membranes were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 2 5 water contact angle and mechanical strength test water contact angle wca measurements were performed via a sessile drop method with 25 c pure water used as the probe liquid the static angle of the water droplet on the membrane surface was measured using an angle meter rase angle meter japan at six different points the membrane mechanical strength was studied by measuring the tensile strength and elongation percentage at break using a testing machine uts h001 china the membrane sample 5cm 1cm was clamped and stretched at a rate of 20 mm min 1 until the break poin the mechanical strength test was repeated three times for each membrane type 2 6 permeation and rejection performance of the membranes the membrane performance in terms of the pure water permeability pwp water flux using untreated prw and contaminant removal total phenols ammonia tds cod and turbidity were performed using a cross flow filtration setup as shown in fig 3 the tested membrane with an effective area of 15 90 cm2 was compacted using pure water at 5 bar for 30 min before pwp measurement the pwp was recorded every 0 5 h at a constant pressure of 5 bar for untreated refinery wastewater filtration the pure water was replaced with untreated wastewater the pwp jw and wastewater permeate flux ji were calculated using eq 2 31 2 j v a t where j is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 v is the permeate volume l a is the effective membrane area m2 and t is the permeation time h pollutant rejections were calculated using eq 3 as follows 32 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the pollutant concentration in the permeate and feed solution respectively the ammonia and total phenol concentration were analyzed using spectrophotometric measurements other pollutant rejections such as tds cod and turbidity were determined using a conductivity meter spectrophotometer and nephelometer respectively 2 7 fouling evaluation for refinery wastewater treatment fouling properties of the membrane in the refinery wastewater filtration were evaluated using a series model of cake resistance measurements 33 34 the membrane resistance during filtration is contributed to by the intrinsic membrane itself absorbed foulant compound irreversible fouling and cake of the foulant deposition on the membrane surface reversible fouling the clean membrane was used in the pure water permeation test and using eq 4 to evaluate the intrinsic membrane resistance to obtain the value of the irreversible fouling resistance the fouled membrane was rinsed using deionized di water to remove the foulant deposition on the membrane surface the fouled membrane was used for the di water permeation test and the irreversible fouling resistance was evaluated using eq 5 the cake resistance was assessed using the total fouled membrane for a di water permeation test the cake resistance was determined using eq 6 4 r m δ p μ j 0 5 r a δ p μ j a r m 6 r c δ p μ j t r m r a 7 r t r m r a r c where rm ra and rc are the resistance of the clean membrane absorbed foulant and cake of the deposited foulant respectively m 1 j0 ja

the transmembrane pressure pa 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane morphology characterization an investigation of the structure is necessary to evaluate the perm selectivity performance of the membrane the surface and cross sectional morphologies of the psf zno and pva coated psf zno membranes are shown in fig 4 a clear surface morphological difference is observed in figs 4a and 4b the membrane surface of the uncoated membrane is rough with many visible pores this morphology was affected by the addition of peg which is a known pore forming agent in the membrane fabrication process 35 the porous structure of the support membrane is beneficial as it provides better permeation in the filtration process the enhanced surface porosity might occur with the addition of a hydrophilic polymer peg which dissolves in a non solvent when the casting film was soaked in di water the exchange of the solvent non solvent was followed by the migration of peg into the water thus inducing the formation of more pores in fig 4b the surface is smooth and no pores were observed even at a magnification of 20 000x indicating that the surface layer is dense and suitable for molecular separation the smooth and dense layer might have resulted from the coating of the crosslinked pva a membrane with a smoother surface tends to have better antifouling properties finger like micropore structures were observed the cross sections of all membranes the shape and micropore size of the finger like structures were similar for all membranes because the membrane support materials have the same composition the structural properties of the membrane sublayer were attributed to the polymer solution composition the viscosity and hydrophilicity of the polymer solution play an important role in determining the micropore structural properties the high concentration of the incorporated nanoparticles leads to larger finger like micropores closer observation of the membrane top layer revealed that the thickness of the dense layer of the membrane is different the pva coated membrane has a thicker layer than the uncoated membrane the average dense layer thickness of the uncoated and pva coated membranes based on sem analysis are 1 62 0 30 μm and 3 47 0 41 μm respectively a thicker dense layer resulted from the pva coating on the selective layer of the membrane with focused observation at the selective layer it can be noticed the different characteristic layer can be ascertained as pva layer the denser selective layer may improve the molecular separation however it also decreases the water flux 36 3 2 ft ir spectra of the fabricated membrane the functional groups of the fabricated membrane were inspected using ft ir spectra analysis the ft ir spectra of the uncoated nanohybrid psf zno and pva coated membranes are shown in fig 5 the ft ir spectra of the uncoated membrane psf zno show characteristic peaks at around 1582 cm 1 representing the aromatic ring of the psf backbone methyl and sulfone groups were observed by the appearance of a single sharp peak at 1487 cm 1 and double peaks at around 1297 cm 1 respectively the peak at 2969 cm 1 also indicates the stretching of c h from the methyl in psf the presence of zno in the membrane was observed by the weak stretching of the absorbed hydroxyl at 450 cm 1 the weak broad peak from 3700 3000 cm 1 represented the vibration of oh absorbed by zno nanoparticles which indicates that the incorporation of zno nanoparticles improved the hydrophilicity of the polysulfone membrane the pva coated psf zno membrane shows a stronger broad peak around 3312 cm 1 which is typical for the hydroxyl vibration of the pva molecule the stronger peak also appears at 2937 cm 1 which is analogous to the peak at 2969 cm 1 of the uncoated psf zno membrane the peak shift from 2969 to 2937 cm 1 shows the presence of c h stretching from the vinyl group in pva the absorption band at 1146 cm 1 was observed in the pva coated membrane spectra which is related to the stretching of acetal ester groups as a result of the crosslinking reaction between pva and ga besides the co stretching at 1151 cm 1 in the uncoated membrane is replaced by a stronger absorption band at 1098 cm 1 that can be attributed to the ether co group formed by the crosslinking reaction a strong peak at 1733 cm 1 was observed at the pva coated membrane but it does not appear in the spectra of the uncoated membrane this peak belongs to the co stretching of the aldehyde from ga the result explains that the aldehyde group of ga did not completely react with the hydroxyl group in pva 37 given the presence of the strong oh stretching in the pva coated psf zno membrane the pva coating significantly improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface the improved hydrophilic property of the membrane surface improves the water flux and antifouling behavior 3 3 contact angle value and pure water permeability of the membrane surface the wca of the membrane surface is influenced by several factors including surface tension hydrophilic property and surface roughness membrane hydrophilicity is attributed to the water permeation rate through the membrane barrier in the filtration process as shown in fig 6 the static wca of the neat psf membrane shows the highest value i e 61 75 this result shows that polysulfone has a slight hydrophobic nature with the addition of 0 5 wt zno nanoparticles the wca decreases from 61 75 to 46 00 the zno nanoparticles enhance the hydrophilic property of the psf membrane surface this result is supported by the ft ir spectra analysis where the addition of zno resulted in the presence of absorbed oh thus the membrane becomes more hydrophilic the pva layer on the membrane surface significantly decreases the wca from 46 00 to 31 17 at a pva concentration of 1 wt the improvement of the surface hydrophilicity might come from the presence of hydroxyl groups in the pva this explanation is supported by the ft ir analysis where the hydroxyl vibration band increases significantly moreover the presence of pva as a selective skin layer decreases the surface roughness of the membrane as shown in fig 3 the previous study conducted by woo and co workers also revealed that a rougher membrane surface had a higher wca value 38 the higher concentration of the pva slightly decreasing the contact angle might be due to the increase in pva in the coating solution resulting in a denser skin top layer the denser skin layer slightly increased the surface tension therefore increasing the pva concentration in the coating solution is not linearly proportional to the decrease in the wca a pwp experiment was conducted to evaluate the water transport properties of the prepared membranes the pwp results at different operating pressures are shown in fig 7 it is shown that the permeate flux of pure water for all types of the membrane m1 m4 increased proportionally with the operating pressure 5 9 bar from the feed side this result indicates that the permeation of the membranes is a pressure driven filtration the pristine psf membrane seems to have a relatively low pwp value due to its slightly hydrophobic nature the pwp of the nanohybrid membrane increased by about 1 33 times with the incorporation of 0 5 wt zno nanoparticles the pwp enhancement might be from the improved structural properties with the incorporation of the nanoparticles as reported in a previous study the membrane blended with inorganic nanoparticles had improved membrane porosity average pore radius and surface hydrophilicity which leads to a permeate flux enhancement 39 this result is also supported by the sem image analysis where the nanohybrid membrane was shown to have a porous surface however the pva layer addition on the membrane surface significantly decreases the pwp by as much as 0 71 times at 1 wt pva the thicker dense top layer of the membrane due to pva deposition may increase the membrane resistance according to darcy s law of fluid transport through porous media the higher resistance of the membrane would decrease the permeate flux the pwp value continuously decreases with an increase in pva concentration from 1 wt to 3 wt although the pva coating enhances the surface hydrophilicity the increased density of the coating layer with increasing pva decreases the mass transfer rate of the water 3 4 mechanical strength evaluation of the fabricated membranes the individual structural components contribute to the mechanical properties of the overall membrane according to the sem images the overall membrane thickness increases when zno nanoparticles are incorporated and the membrane is coated with pva the nanoparticles change the rheological properties of the polymer solution that influences the formation of the membrane structure during the phase separation process table 3 presents the thickness tensile strength and elongation at break of the prepared membranes the thickness of the membrane increased with the modifications in this study the nanohybrid psf zno membrane has a thicker membrane compared with the neat psf membrane due to the impregnation of nanoparticles into the polymer structure the coating of pva also affected the membrane thickness as shown by the increase in the membrane skin layer thickness in the sem analysis however the increase in pva concentration did not significantly increase the thickness of the membrane the tensile strength values of the modified membranes were higher than the neat psf membrane the incorporated nanoparticles in the membrane help absorb the energy applied to the membrane during the mechanical test hence the membrane is not easily broken despite higher applied energy however the elongation at breakpoint decreases from 12 03 11 50 as zno is added as the zno nanoparticles restrict the chain mobility of the psf matrix to a certain extent the pva deposition on the psf zno membrane improves both the tensile strength and elongation at break this phenomenon is attributed to the pva coating on the membrane surface pva naturally has excellent tensile strength flexibility and adhesive properties the presence of pva provides enhancement of the support membrane mechanical strength the adhesive and flexibility properties of pva contributed to the tensile strength and elongation at break of the whole membrane the pva coating significantly enhanced the membrane mechanical strength extending the membrane life span 3 5 performance evaluation using refinery wastewater treatment untreated petroleum wastewater filtration experiments in a cross flow system were performed to evaluate the separation performance of the prepared membranes the wastewater was obtained from the physical chemical waste treatment output of pertamina ltd indonesia the characteristics of the wastewater were 1800 mg l 1 total dissolved solid 671 68 mg l 1 cod 143 mg l 1 nh3 75 mg l 1 total phenol and 32 ntu turbidity as shown in fig 8 the initial flux of psf was slightly enhanced from 1 68 to 1 82 l m 2 h 1 by the membrane with 0 5 wt zno nanoparticles however the pva coating caused a decline in the initial flux to 1 23 l m 2 h 1 0 84 l m 2 h 1 and 0 69 l m 2 h 1 for pva concentrations of 1 2 and 3 wt respectively the enhancement of the permeate flux may be related to the improvements in the membrane porosity and hydrophilicity by the addition of nano zno nanoparticles in the psf membrane the decline of the initial permeate flux might be due to the increase in skin layer thickness as a result of the pva coating that also increased the resistance over the operating time for each membrane decreases in the permeation fluxes were observed the significant decline in the first 60 min might be due to external fouling caused by particulate attachment on the membrane surface after 90 min of filtration time the flux profiles showed a pseudo steady state due to foulant adsorption and concentration polarization although the initial flux of the pva coated membranes was less than the pristine psf membrane the permeate flux decline of the pristine psf membrane yields a serious decline during the prw treatment higher level pseudo steady states was achieved by the membrane with a pva coating this phenomenon indicates that the foulant deposition on the pva coated membranes was less than that on the neat uncoated membrane the pva coating was proven to improve the antifouling behavior of the membrane during the filtration process however with a higher concentration of pva in the coating solution the pseudo steady state of the permeate flux declines by 0 5 0 6 times which might be due to a higher density of the membrane skin layer with the higher pva concentration as the coating agent the sharp flux decline of the neat psf membrane was consistent with a previous study 40 it might be ascribed to the hydrophobic nature of the psf polymer that attracts oil droplets from the wastewater to form a waterproof layer on the membrane surface and internal body of the membrane another parameter in the membrane performance evaluation was pollutant rejection in this study phenol and ammonia are the pollutants focused on removal from wastewater phenol and ammonia levels become an issue in prw treatment using conventional techniques as shown in fig 9 all fabricated membranes exhibited a phenol removal efficiency greater than 51 and the ammonia removal efficiency greater than 82 the removal efficiency obtained from this study was greater than a previous study 41 that reached 25 50 removal efficiency this lower efficiency may be due to the effect of other contaminants in the untreated wastewater ammonia nh3 in wastewater is in the equilibrium state with ammonium ions nh4 which can be absorbed by other contaminants such as colloids and suspended solids that are easier to remove using a membrane hence the ph plays an essential role in the separation efficiency where the ph of the feed determines the equilibrium state between nh3 and nh4 ions the presence of the pva layer improves the selectivity performance of the membrane by enhancing the phenol and ammonia removal efficiency from 51 52 82 68 and 82 89 92 42 respectively the enhanced removal efficiency may be due to charge exclusion as reported by li and co workers the pva polymer is a negatively charged polymer over the whole ph region that repels negatively charged molecules 42 in the alkaline environment of prw ph 8 6 the form of the dissolved nh3 in water is the dominating nh4 form since nh3 is a lewis base the nh3 molecules were rejected via donnan s exclusion mechanism by the pva surface phenolic compounds have hydroxyls linked to the benzene ring with a delocalized electron cloud the electron withdrawing groups electrophilic functional group can interfere with the electron cloud and create a partial positive charge in the aromatic ring 43 electronegative oxygen in phenolic compounds creates a negative charge on the benzene ring in the ph range of 8 12 where the hydrogen is attracted to form a phenolate anion that is negatively charged ammonia experiences a stronger electrostatic repelling force than phenolic compounds given its stronger negative charge however phenol and n nh3 concentrations in the permeate are still relatively high at 148 09 mg l 1 82 68 removal and 25 40 mg l 1 92 42 removal respectively according to the low removal efficiency of n nh3 another process such as advanced oxidation processes electrochemical oxidation fenton oxidation etc 44 45 should be integrated with the membrane separation to achieve the higher quality of treated water other pollutants such as tds cod and turbidity were also evaluated to investigate the membrane performance for contaminant removal efficiency the tds level represents the concentration of dissolved solids such as minerals the cod level indicates the concentration of organic compounds in the prw while turbidity is a measure of the micro particulates present in the prw as presented in fig 10 the tds removal increases with the addition of zno nanoparticles and pva coating however the higher concentration of pva in the coating solution does not have a significant effect on tds rejection the tds removal efficiency of all membranes was in the range of 18 33 38 25 in general the rejection of tds was relatively low which might be because the membrane was unable to reject monovalent ions such as na k and cl thus the monovalent ions experienced weak size exclusion and donnan s exclusion effects the enhancement of tds rejection by the pva coated membrane might be attributed to by the electrostatic repulsion the positively charged membrane surface provided a stronger repulsion force against cations the pva coating exhibits an obvious enhancement in the cod removal efficiency organics compounds were excluded due to both the size exclusion effect and charge exclusion effect due to their larger molecular size and functional groups many organic contaminants in prw are hydrocarbon and benzene derivatives that have strong repulsion forces with hydrophilic surfaces such as that produced by the pva coating turbidity removal efficiencies were excellent for all membrane types where the removal efficiencies are in the range of 97 99 the turbidity in prw was caused by particulates with a micro scale size since the membrane pores are nanoscale the particulates in prw were rejected via size exclusion mechanism 3 6 membrane fouling analysis the main issue in membrane separation applications for wastewater treatment is fouling during operation fouling in the membrane gradually decreases the permeation flux and also reduces the lifespan of the membrane therefore the membrane application is not economically feasible in this work the pva coating was used to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity to improve the antifouling behavior of the membrane the examination of the fouling can be performed by qualitative and quantitative analyses qualitative analysis can be performed through a fouling autopsy to indicate the foulant deposition on the membrane 46 in this study a quantitative approach was conducted to evaluate how much the membrane modification can mitigate the fouling formation during prw treatment a series model of the resistance equation derived from darcy s law was used to examine the resistance created by the foulant the resistance in the membrane separation was contributed to by the membrane structure itself absorbed foulant and cake formation of the foulant deposition on the membrane surface the resistance of the fabricated membranes during a 150 min prw filtration experiment are shown in table 4 the value of rm decreases slightly with the addition of zno nanoparticles possible because the incorporation of zno nanoparticles improves the porosity and hydrophilicity however the rm of the membrane increases as the pva coating is applied this increase in rm might be because the pva coating decreased the size of the surface pores on the membrane forming a denser membrane alternatively the pva addition increases the selective layer thickness thus increasing the resistance the lowest resistance from the absorbed foulant was shown by the membrane with a 2 wt pva coating the highest cake resistance was shown by a neat psf membrane that has a slightly hydrophobic surface and unrepaired properties as shown in table 4 the pva in the selective layer can reduce pollutant deposition on the membrane wall despite the significant increase in the intrinsic membrane resistance the pva coating improves the antifouling behavior of the membrane 4 conclusion nanohybrid membranes of psf zno with crosslinked pva were successfully fabricated with a dense and smooth surface using a non solvent induced phase separation nips method the pva coating can significantly repair the porous surface of the nanohybrid membrane as shown in sem images the ft ir spectra analysis also revealed that the addition of zno nanoparticles and a pva coating significantly improved the hydrophilicity by introducing oh functional groups these results were supported by wca measurement the membrane also exhibited a distinct improvement in the surface charge mechanical strength pollutant removal efficiency and antifouling behavior the modification made in this study significantly enhanced the phenol and ammonia removal efficiency from 51 52 82 68 and 82 89 92 42 respectively the fouling evaluation also showed that the pva coating

13721,petroleum refinery wastewater prw contains high concentrations of phenolic compounds and ammonia that are noxious and harmful to the environment especially to human health the improper treatment

therefore the fabricated membranes showed great potential for petroleum wastewater treatment keywords ammonia membrane petroleum phenol polyvinyl alcohol wastewater 1 introduction the large quantity

950 mg l 1 and ammonia and sulfide are typically at 20 80 mg l 1 and 13 17 mg l 1 respectively 6 in some cases heavy metals and radioactive materials are observed in refinery wastewaters 7 existing prw treatments usually only reduce the total solids and major organic pollutants however this treated wastewater still contains phenolic compounds and ammonia at high concentrations phenolic compounds are identified as priority contaminants as they are highly toxic and corrosive even at a low concentration 8 the sources of phenolic compounds in prw are usually from the tank water drain multiphase separator desalter water effluent and neutralized spent caustic waste in pertamina ltd indonesia the primary source of the phenols is the residual fluid catalytic cracking rfcc waste stream with an average phenol concentration of 960 mg l 1 6 in recent years phenol and its derivatives have warranted more attention in the field of industrial wastewater because of their toxicity and contamination in wastewater production phenolic compounds discharged into the environment remain for long periods and harm the ecosystem especially humans 9 10 phenolic compounds that are commonly found in prw are phenol m p cresol o cresol tri and tetra chlorophenols and 4 chloro 3 cresol 11 as shown in fig 1 the us environmental protection agency epa has labeled phenolic derivatives as a priority contaminant in water the limited concentration of phenol in wastewater discharge was set strictly to avoid environmental damage the toxicity level of phenol derivatives is usually in the range of 9 25 mg l 1 for both humans and aquatic life 12 long term exposure to phenol can lead to a serious health problem such as diarrhea vertigo salivation tremors coma and respiratory failure for humans exposed to lethal doses therefore industries that produce phenol contaminated wastewater such as petroleum refineries must pay attention to the treatment of wastewater to meet quality standards of wastewater discharge another pollutant in petroleum refinery wastewater and petrochemicals that becomes a serious issue is ammonia ammonia in wastewater is usually generated from the degradation of nitrogen components excessive ammonia in wastewater is highly toxic and harmful to the environment and human health moreover ammonia is associated with the malodor problem of wastewater 13 generally the ammonia nitrogen content in refinery wastewater is in the range of 20 80 mg l 1 14 treatment using chemical and biological methods are unable to nitrify the ammonia content to the desired level ammonia in wastewater is generated from the degradation process of nitrogen containing compounds ammonia is toxic to aquatic life and human health at very low concentrations the common maximum permitted level of ammonia in discharged wastewater is 0 7 mg l 1 15 ammonia in water can be in an equilibrium state of dissolved ammonia and ammonium ions or bound as organic amine r nh2 as shown in eq 1 1 nh3 h2o nh4 oh wastewater from food processing plants is nutritious enough to enrich the nitrification bacteria by converting ammonium ions to nitrate ions however in petroleum wastewater treatment nitrifying bacteria are seldom observed because of poor nutritional content therefore it is highly important to develop an effective method for phenolic compounds and ammonia removal or neutralization given their serious environmental threat in recent decades many attempts have been made to eliminate contaminants in prw such as the advanced oxidation process aop coagulation absorption adsorption chemical and biological treatments 16 18 such methods effectively remove a variety of organic compounds however membrane separation is considered a faster and more efficient process than other physically driven and equilibrium driven processes conventional size exclusion based separations such as ultrafiltration is unable to remove phenolic compounds or ammonia with high separation efficiency 19 hence a dense membrane such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration membrane is required resulting in high energy consumption 20 and faster fouling formation a hybrid process such as the adsorption prior to membrane separation has been previously reported 21 using activated carbon followed by an ultrafiltration membrane this process effectively reduced energy consumption however the process is complex as it requires more than one stage in the past few years the membrane research is dominated by the development of mixed matrix membranes mmms that combine the molecular sieving mechanism and adsorption of inorganic filler furthermore the introduction of inorganic material significantly increases the surface properties mechanical strength and perm selectivity of the fabricated membrane 22 polymeric membranes with an embedded microsized inorganic filler have shown excellent performance in removing various organic compounds during water treatment and the membrane s hydrophilic property can be significantly improved however the incorporation of inorganic filler at normal size micron scale into polymeric membranes has the risk of producing defective membranes a defect membrane might be caused by the formation unselective void as the result of the de attachment between the polymer and the particle surface 23 recent developments include the incorporation of nanosized inorganic particles because of their higher surface area high shape uniformity and excellent affinity with a polymer matrix 24 many researchers have reported that the incorporation of nanosized inorganic materials and functionalized metal oxides into a polymeric membrane significantly enhance the permeability structural properties surface hydrophilicity antifouling behavior and separation properties 25 26 however in some cases of wastewater with a high organic level such as prw the utilization of the nanohybrid membrane has a short lifetime because of surface fouling 27 moreover the membrane with a smaller pore size that is used to remove molecular pollutants leads to low permeability in this study a nanohybrid psf membrane was used as a support membrane and a polyvinyl alcohol pva layer was added to improve the membrane surface properties pva is a low cost polymer that possesses good chemical and mechanical stability excellent hydrophilicity and film forming ability which is widely used as the coating material pva can be used to produce a stable membrane with good mechanical properties and selective permeability to water by crosslinking grafting or other modification reactions the objectives of introducing pva on the psf membrane were to enhance the removal efficiency of phenol and ammonia in petroleum wastewater and to improve the membrane mechanical properties as well as to minimize the membrane fouling during operation furthermore the removal efficiency and permeability were studied using untreated petroleum refinery wastewater effluent to explore the industrial applicability of this technique 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials polysulfone udel psu p1700nt polymer granules were purchased from solvay usa and used as the main polymer of the membrane preparation n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent and sulfuric acid were supplied from merck usa polyvinyl alcohol pva 86 88 hydrolyzed mw 130 000 da polyethylene glycol peg with a molecular weight of

prw sedimentation coagulation effluent was obtained from pertamina ltd and the characteristics of the wastewater are presented in table 1 2 2 preparation of the nanohybrid psf zno membrane nanohybrid psf zno membranes were fabricated via a non solvent induced phase separation nips method adapted from a previous study 28 zno nanoparticles were dispersed in nmp at various total solid concentrations as shown in table 2 and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min psf and peg were dissolved in nmp at the polymer concentrations listed in table 2 and stirred for 8 h the zno suspensions and polymer solutions were blended and homogenized the polymer solution was then cast using a manual casting machine with an outlet gap thickness of 150 μm the polymer film was evaporated for 60 s to form a selective layer and was subsequently immersed in pure water for 24 h at room temperature for complete phase separation the wet membranes were placed between filter papers and dried at 50 c for 24 h 2 3 pva coating of the psf zno membrane surface according to the previous work 29 the addition of zno in polymer matrix significantly improved the permeate flux and mechanical strength of the membrane but risks on creating unselective gap coating procedure using pva polymer on the fabricated nanohybrid membrane one of which aims to help overcoming the aforementioned issue the pva coating was prepared by dip coating the top surface of the membrane to provide a selectivity property 30 pva solutions were prepared with the concentrations in table 2 an appropriate amount of pva granules was dissolved in deionized water at 85 c under constant stirring for 8 h the top side of the membrane was dipped into the pva solution and the excess solution on the membrane surface was wiped off using filter paper the coated membranes were crosslinked using a crosslink agent containing 5 wt glutaraldehyde and 0 5 wt sulfuric acid as the catalyst the coated membranes were rinsed to remove the residual chemicals a schematic illustration of the membrane coating using pva is shown in fig 2 2 4 membrane characterization by sem and ft ir the morphology of both the surface and internal structure of the fabricated membranes were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy sem jeol series jsm 6510 la japan the morphological structure of the membrane was observed at low and high magnification 1000x and 20 000x fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir perkin elmer frontier usa was used for the investigation of the change in the chemical groups as a result of the modification treatment the ft ir spectra of the fabricated membranes were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 2 5 water contact angle and mechanical strength test water contact angle wca measurements were performed via a sessile drop method with 25 c pure water used as the probe liquid the static angle of the water droplet on the membrane surface was measured using an angle meter rase angle meter japan at six different points the membrane mechanical strength was studied by measuring the tensile strength and elongation percentage at break using a testing machine uts h001 china the membrane sample 5cm 1cm was clamped and stretched at a rate of 20 mm min 1 until the break poin the mechanical strength test was repeated three times for each membrane type 2 6 permeation and rejection performance of the membranes the membrane performance in terms of the pure water permeability pwp water flux using untreated prw and contaminant removal total phenols ammonia tds cod and turbidity were performed using a cross flow filtration setup as shown in fig 3 the tested membrane with an effective area of 15 90 cm2 was compacted using pure water at 5 bar for 30 min before pwp measurement the pwp was recorded every 0 5 h at a constant pressure of 5 bar for untreated refinery wastewater filtration the pure water was replaced with untreated wastewater the pwp jw and wastewater permeate flux ji were calculated using eq 2 31 2 j v a t where j is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 v is the permeate volume l a is the effective membrane area m2 and t is the permeation time h pollutant rejections were calculated using eq 3 as follows 32 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the pollutant concentration in the permeate and feed solution respectively the ammonia and total phenol concentration were analyzed using spectrophotometric measurements other pollutant rejections such as tds cod and turbidity were determined using a conductivity meter spectrophotometer and nephelometer respectively 2 7 fouling evaluation for refinery wastewater treatment fouling properties of the membrane in the refinery wastewater filtration were evaluated using a series model of cake resistance measurements 33 34 the membrane resistance during filtration is contributed to by the intrinsic membrane itself absorbed foulant compound irreversible fouling and cake of the foulant deposition on the membrane surface reversible fouling the clean membrane was used in the pure water permeation test and using eq 4 to evaluate the intrinsic membrane resistance to obtain the value of the irreversible fouling resistance the fouled membrane was rinsed using deionized di water to remove the foulant deposition on the membrane surface the fouled membrane was used for the di water permeation test and the irreversible fouling resistance was evaluated using eq 5 the cake resistance was assessed using the total fouled membrane for a di water permeation test the cake resistance was determined using eq 6 4 r m δ p μ j 0 5 r a δ p μ j a r m 6 r c δ p μ j t r m r a 7 r t r m r a r c where rm ra and rc are the resistance of the clean membrane absorbed foulant and cake of the deposited foulant respectively m 1 j0 ja

the transmembrane pressure pa 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane morphology characterization an investigation of the structure is necessary to evaluate the perm selectivity performance of the membrane the surface and cross sectional morphologies of the psf zno and pva coated psf zno membranes are shown in fig 4 a clear surface morphological difference is observed in figs 4a and 4b the membrane surface of the uncoated membrane is rough with many visible pores this morphology was affected by the addition of peg which is a known pore forming agent in the membrane fabrication process 35 the porous structure of the support membrane is beneficial as it provides better permeation in the filtration process the enhanced surface porosity might occur with the addition of a hydrophilic polymer peg which dissolves in a non solvent when the casting film was soaked in di water the exchange of the solvent non solvent was followed by the migration of peg into the water thus inducing the formation of more pores in fig 4b the surface is smooth and no pores were observed even at a magnification of 20 000x indicating that the surface layer is dense and suitable for molecular separation the smooth and dense layer might have resulted from the coating of the crosslinked pva a membrane with a smoother surface tends to have better antifouling properties finger like micropore structures were observed the cross sections of all membranes the shape and micropore size of the finger like structures were similar for all membranes because the membrane support materials have the same composition the structural properties of the membrane sublayer were attributed to the polymer solution composition the viscosity and hydrophilicity of the polymer solution play an important role in determining the micropore structural properties the high concentration of the incorporated nanoparticles leads to larger finger like micropores closer observation of the membrane top layer revealed that the thickness of the dense layer of the membrane is different the pva coated membrane has a thicker layer than the uncoated membrane the average dense layer thickness of the uncoated and pva coated membranes based on sem analysis are 1 62 0 30 μm and 3 47 0 41 μm respectively a thicker dense layer resulted from the pva coating on the selective layer of the membrane with focused observation at the selective layer it can be noticed the different characteristic layer can be ascertained as pva layer the denser selective layer may improve the molecular separation however it also decreases the water flux 36 3 2 ft ir spectra of the fabricated membrane the functional groups of the fabricated membrane were inspected using ft ir spectra analysis the ft ir spectra of the uncoated nanohybrid psf zno and pva coated membranes are shown in fig 5 the ft ir spectra of the uncoated membrane psf zno show characteristic peaks at around 1582 cm 1 representing the aromatic ring of the psf backbone methyl and sulfone groups were observed by the appearance of a single sharp peak at 1487 cm 1 and double peaks at around 1297 cm 1 respectively the peak at 2969 cm 1 also indicates the stretching of c h from the methyl in psf the presence of zno in the membrane was observed by the weak stretching of the absorbed hydroxyl at 450 cm 1 the weak broad peak from 3700 3000 cm 1 represented the vibration of oh absorbed by zno nanoparticles which indicates that the incorporation of zno nanoparticles improved the hydrophilicity of the polysulfone membrane the pva coated psf zno membrane shows a stronger broad peak around 3312 cm 1 which is typical for the hydroxyl vibration of the pva molecule the stronger peak also appears at 2937 cm 1 which is analogous to the peak at 2969 cm 1 of the uncoated psf zno membrane the peak shift from 2969 to 2937 cm 1 shows the presence of c h stretching from the vinyl group in pva the absorption band at 1146 cm 1 was observed in the pva coated membrane spectra which is related to the stretching of acetal ester groups as a result of the crosslinking reaction between pva and ga besides the co stretching at 1151 cm 1 in the uncoated membrane is replaced by a stronger absorption band at 1098 cm 1 that can be attributed to the ether co group formed by the crosslinking reaction a strong peak at 1733 cm 1 was observed at the pva coated membrane but it does not appear in the spectra of the uncoated membrane this peak belongs to the co stretching of the aldehyde from ga the result explains that the aldehyde group of ga did not completely react with the hydroxyl group in pva 37 given the presence of the strong oh stretching in the pva coated psf zno membrane the pva coating significantly improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface the improved hydrophilic property of the membrane surface improves the water flux and antifouling behavior 3 3 contact angle value and pure water permeability of the membrane surface the wca of the membrane surface is influenced by several factors including surface tension hydrophilic property and surface roughness membrane hydrophilicity is attributed to the water permeation rate through the membrane barrier in the filtration process as shown in fig 6 the static wca of the neat psf membrane shows the highest value i e 61 75 this result shows that polysulfone has a slight hydrophobic nature with the addition of 0 5 wt zno nanoparticles the wca decreases from 61 75 to 46 00 the zno nanoparticles enhance the hydrophilic property of the psf membrane surface this result is supported by the ft ir spectra analysis where the addition of zno resulted in the presence of absorbed oh thus the membrane becomes more hydrophilic the pva layer on the membrane surface significantly decreases the wca from 46 00 to 31 17 at a pva concentration of 1 wt the improvement of the surface hydrophilicity might come from the presence of hydroxyl groups in the pva this explanation is supported by the ft ir analysis where the hydroxyl vibration band increases significantly moreover the presence of pva as a selective skin layer decreases the surface roughness of the membrane as shown in fig 3 the previous study conducted by woo and co workers also revealed that a rougher membrane surface had a higher wca value 38 the higher concentration of the pva slightly decreasing the contact angle might be due to the increase in pva in the coating solution resulting in a denser skin top layer the denser skin layer slightly increased the surface tension therefore increasing the pva concentration in the coating solution is not linearly proportional to the decrease in the wca a pwp experiment was conducted to evaluate the water transport properties of the prepared membranes the pwp results at different operating pressures are shown in fig 7 it is shown that the permeate flux of pure water for all types of the membrane m1 m4 increased proportionally with the operating pressure 5 9 bar from the feed side this result indicates that the permeation of the membranes is a pressure driven filtration the pristine psf membrane seems to have a relatively low pwp value due to its slightly hydrophobic nature the pwp of the nanohybrid membrane increased by about 1 33 times with the incorporation of 0 5 wt zno nanoparticles the pwp enhancement might be from the improved structural properties with the incorporation of the nanoparticles as reported in a previous study the membrane blended with inorganic nanoparticles had improved membrane porosity average pore radius and surface hydrophilicity which leads to a permeate flux enhancement 39 this result is also supported by the sem image analysis where the nanohybrid membrane was shown to have a porous surface however the pva layer addition on the membrane surface significantly decreases the pwp by as much as 0 71 times at 1 wt pva the thicker dense top layer of the membrane due to pva deposition may increase the membrane resistance according to darcy s law of fluid transport through porous media the higher resistance of the membrane would decrease the permeate flux the pwp value continuously decreases with an increase in pva concentration from 1 wt to 3 wt although the pva coating enhances the surface hydrophilicity the increased density of the coating layer with increasing pva decreases the mass transfer rate of the water 3 4 mechanical strength evaluation of the fabricated membranes the individual structural components contribute to the mechanical properties of the overall membrane according to the sem images the overall membrane thickness increases when zno nanoparticles are incorporated and the membrane is coated with pva the nanoparticles change the rheological properties of the polymer solution that influences the formation of the membrane structure during the phase separation process table 3 presents the thickness tensile strength and elongation at break of the prepared membranes the thickness of the membrane increased with the modifications in this study the nanohybrid psf zno membrane has a thicker membrane compared with the neat psf membrane due to the impregnation of nanoparticles into the polymer structure the coating of pva also affected the membrane thickness as shown by the increase in the membrane skin layer thickness in the sem analysis however the increase in pva concentration did not significantly increase the thickness of the membrane the tensile strength values of the modified membranes were higher than the neat psf membrane the incorporated nanoparticles in the membrane help absorb the energy applied to the membrane during the mechanical test hence the membrane is not easily broken despite higher applied energy however the elongation at breakpoint decreases from 12 03 11 50 as zno is added as the zno nanoparticles restrict the chain mobility of the psf matrix to a certain extent the pva deposition on the psf zno membrane improves both the tensile strength and elongation at break this phenomenon is attributed to the pva coating on the membrane surface pva naturally has excellent tensile strength flexibility and adhesive properties the presence of pva provides enhancement of the support membrane mechanical strength the adhesive and flexibility properties of pva contributed to the tensile strength and elongation at break of the whole membrane the pva coating significantly enhanced the membrane mechanical strength extending the membrane life span 3 5 performance evaluation using refinery wastewater treatment untreated petroleum wastewater filtration experiments in a cross flow system were performed to evaluate the separation performance of the prepared membranes the wastewater was obtained from the physical chemical waste treatment output of pertamina ltd indonesia the characteristics of the wastewater were 1800 mg l 1 total dissolved solid 671 68 mg l 1 cod 143 mg l 1 nh3 75 mg l 1 total phenol and 32 ntu turbidity as shown in fig 8 the initial flux of psf was slightly enhanced from 1 68 to 1 82 l m 2 h 1 by the membrane with 0 5 wt zno nanoparticles however the pva coating caused a decline in the initial flux to 1 23 l m 2 h 1 0 84 l m 2 h 1 and 0 69 l m 2 h 1 for pva concentrations of 1 2 and 3 wt respectively the enhancement of the permeate flux may be related to the improvements in the membrane porosity and hydrophilicity by the addition of nano zno nanoparticles in the psf membrane the decline of the initial permeate flux might be due to the increase in skin layer thickness as a result of the pva coating that also increased the resistance over the operating time for each membrane decreases in the permeation fluxes were observed the significant decline in the first 60 min might be due to external fouling caused by particulate attachment on the membrane surface after 90 min of filtration time the flux profiles showed a pseudo steady state due to foulant adsorption and concentration polarization although the initial flux of the pva coated membranes was less than the pristine psf membrane the permeate flux decline of the pristine psf membrane yields a serious decline during the prw treatment higher level pseudo steady states was achieved by the membrane with a pva coating this phenomenon indicates that the foulant deposition on the pva coated membranes was less than that on the neat uncoated membrane the pva coating was proven to improve the antifouling behavior of the membrane during the filtration process however with a higher concentration of pva in the coating solution the pseudo steady state of the permeate flux declines by 0 5 0 6 times which might be due to a higher density of the membrane skin layer with the higher pva concentration as the coating agent the sharp flux decline of the neat psf membrane was consistent with a previous study 40 it might be ascribed to the hydrophobic nature of the psf polymer that attracts oil droplets from the wastewater to form a waterproof layer on the membrane surface and internal body of the membrane another parameter in the membrane performance evaluation was pollutant rejection in this study phenol and ammonia are the pollutants focused on removal from wastewater phenol and ammonia levels become an issue in prw treatment using conventional techniques as shown in fig 9 all fabricated membranes exhibited a phenol removal efficiency greater than 51 and the ammonia removal efficiency greater than 82 the removal efficiency obtained from this study was greater than a previous study 41 that reached 25 50 removal efficiency this lower efficiency may be due to the effect of other contaminants in the untreated wastewater ammonia nh3 in wastewater is in the equilibrium state with ammonium ions nh4 which can be absorbed by other contaminants such as colloids and suspended solids that are easier to remove using a membrane hence the ph plays an essential role in the separation efficiency where the ph of the feed determines the equilibrium state between nh3 and nh4 ions the presence of the pva layer improves the selectivity performance of the membrane by enhancing the phenol and ammonia removal efficiency from 51 52 82 68 and 82 89 92 42 respectively the enhanced removal efficiency may be due to charge exclusion as reported by li and co workers the pva polymer is a negatively charged polymer over the whole ph region that repels negatively charged molecules 42 in the alkaline environment of prw ph 8 6 the form of the dissolved nh3 in water is the dominating nh4 form since nh3 is a lewis base the nh3 molecules were rejected via donnan s exclusion mechanism by the pva surface phenolic compounds have hydroxyls linked to the benzene ring with a delocalized electron cloud the electron withdrawing groups electrophilic functional group can interfere with the electron cloud and create a partial positive charge in the aromatic ring 43 electronegative oxygen in phenolic compounds creates a negative charge on the benzene ring in the ph range of 8 12 where the hydrogen is attracted to form a phenolate anion that is negatively charged ammonia experiences a stronger electrostatic repelling force than phenolic compounds given its stronger negative charge however phenol and n nh3 concentrations in the permeate are still relatively high at 148 09 mg l 1 82 68 removal and 25 40 mg l 1 92 42 removal respectively according to the low removal efficiency of n nh3 another process such as advanced oxidation processes electrochemical oxidation fenton oxidation etc 44 45 should be integrated with the membrane separation to achieve the higher quality of treated water other pollutants such as tds cod and turbidity were also evaluated to investigate the membrane performance for contaminant removal efficiency the tds level represents the concentration of dissolved solids such as minerals the cod level indicates the concentration of organic compounds in the prw while turbidity is a measure of the micro particulates present in the prw as presented in fig 10 the tds removal increases with the addition of zno nanoparticles and pva coating however the higher concentration of pva in the coating solution does not have a significant effect on tds rejection the tds removal efficiency of all membranes was in the range of 18 33 38 25 in general the rejection of tds was relatively low which might be because the membrane was unable to reject monovalent ions such as na k and cl thus the monovalent ions experienced weak size exclusion and donnan s exclusion effects the enhancement of tds rejection by the pva coated membrane might be attributed to by the electrostatic repulsion the positively charged membrane surface provided a stronger repulsion force against cations the pva coating exhibits an obvious enhancement in the cod removal efficiency organics compounds were excluded due to both the size exclusion effect and charge exclusion effect due to their larger molecular size and functional groups many organic contaminants in prw are hydrocarbon and benzene derivatives that have strong repulsion forces with hydrophilic surfaces such as that produced by the pva coating turbidity removal efficiencies were excellent for all membrane types where the removal efficiencies are in the range of 97 99 the turbidity in prw was caused by particulates with a micro scale size since the membrane pores are nanoscale the particulates in prw were rejected via size exclusion mechanism 3 6 membrane fouling analysis the main issue in membrane separation applications for wastewater treatment is fouling during operation fouling in the membrane gradually decreases the permeation flux and also reduces the lifespan of the membrane therefore the membrane application is not economically feasible in this work the pva coating was used to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity to improve the antifouling behavior of the membrane the examination of the fouling can be performed by qualitative and quantitative analyses qualitative analysis can be performed through a fouling autopsy to indicate the foulant deposition on the membrane 46 in this study a quantitative approach was conducted to evaluate how much the membrane modification can mitigate the fouling formation during prw treatment a series model of the resistance equation derived from darcy s law was used to examine the resistance created by the foulant the resistance in the membrane separation was contributed to by the membrane structure itself absorbed foulant and cake formation of the foulant deposition on the membrane surface the resistance of the fabricated membranes during a 150 min prw filtration experiment are shown in table 4 the value of rm decreases slightly with the addition of zno nanoparticles possible because the incorporation of zno nanoparticles improves the porosity and hydrophilicity however the rm of the membrane increases as the pva coating is applied this increase in rm might be because the pva coating decreased the size of the surface pores on the membrane forming a denser membrane alternatively the pva addition increases the selective layer thickness thus increasing the resistance the lowest resistance from the absorbed foulant was shown by the membrane with a 2 wt pva coating the highest cake resistance was shown by a neat psf membrane that has a slightly hydrophobic surface and unrepaired properties as shown in table 4 the pva in the selective layer can reduce pollutant deposition on the membrane wall despite the significant increase in the intrinsic membrane resistance the pva coating improves the antifouling behavior of the membrane 4 conclusion nanohybrid membranes of psf zno with crosslinked pva were successfully fabricated with a dense and smooth surface using a non solvent induced phase separation nips method the pva coating can significantly repair the porous surface of the nanohybrid membrane as shown in sem images the ft ir spectra analysis also revealed that the addition of zno nanoparticles and a pva coating significantly improved the hydrophilicity by introducing oh functional groups these results were supported by wca measurement the membrane also exhibited a distinct improvement in the surface charge mechanical strength pollutant removal efficiency and antifouling behavior the modification made in this study significantly enhanced the phenol and ammonia removal efficiency from 51 52 82 68 and 82 89 92 42 respectively the fouling evaluation also showed that the pva coating

13722,forward osmosis fo is an emerging novel filtration technology used to reclaim water from waste streams or concentrate the valuable component accurate water flux prediction of fo is essential to facilitate process optimization and scale up of membrane systems the overall objective of this investigation was to propose and confirm a model for prediction of the structural parameter s which is

introduction high quality water is a primary source of life and is generally obtained from freshwater sources including groundwater in addition freshwater is essential in the various field of industry for cleaning cooling heating electric power generation and as a raw material 1 3 in addition water is an important ingredient on most food products the expansion of civilization industrialization consistent population growth and global climate change have placed an increased demand for freshwater 4 6 the sources of water are also decreasing due to the environmental contamination and lower groundwater levels 7 to address these concerns many of the pressure driven filtration technologies have been researched and adopted for use in several different industries 8 9 these membrane separation technologies include microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 10 the limitations to these conventional filtration technologies such as ro include the high hydraulic pressures required to obtain high quality water these high pressures translate into significant energy requirements recently many researchers have studied forward osmosis fo for an alternative to pressure driven filtration 11 12 contrary to the conventional membrane systems the driving force of fo is a difference in osmotic pressure fo should involve the draw solution which contains a high concentration of solutes the main advantage of fo is separation at very low pressure or no pressure 13 fo operates with a high solute rejection rate and a lower rate of fouling when compared to conventional membrane systems 13 applications of fo has been investigated in several areas of food research 14 15 in addition fo has been successfully applied to treat wastewater originated from various industries 7 16 17 the research reveals promising utilization of fo for various practical applications in many fields of industry to facilitate implementation at pilot or industrial scales filtration performance in terms of water flux of fo must be demonstrated water flux is the most important factor to describe membrane efficiency in addition higher water flux becomes the basis to size up to the larger scales from the lab scales although fo has shown promise in various applications at laboratory scale industrial scale applications operate at lower water flux than the conventional filtration systems 18 enhanced water flux can be accomplished through the modification of process design fabrication of novel membrane material or optimization of process parameters 19 20 several researchers have attempted to develop new membrane materials for improvement of fo water flux zirehpour et al 21 employed nano sized metal organic framework particles to modify fo membranes and enhance structural properties choi et al 22 blended carbon nanotube into cellulose acetate membranes to prevent foulant formation while keeping sufficient water flux other research groups employed hydrophilic compounds such as sulfonated polysulfone or sulfonated poly bends to fabricate thin film composite tfc for this purpose 23 in addition enhancement of water flux can be achieved by the optimization of various process parameters including draw solution membrane orientation temperature and hydrodynamic conditions 24 26 due to complexity of operating parameters it is not plausible to experimentally test and identify all the conditions particularly in larger scales this leads to a necessity to develop a more accurate prediction model for fo water flux the developed prediction model will allow accurate predictions for water flux and help establish a cost model to evaluate economic benefits furthermore the model would help find an optimal condition for a given environment the prediction model for fo has been proposed by several researchers lee et al 27 first introduced the convection diffusion model to describe the behavior of water and solute flux across the membrane structure in 1981 recent fo researchers have improved this convection diffusion model into a more developed form to describe concentration polarization cp occurring inside and outside membrane structure 25 28 29 cp is a mass transfer phenomena that occurs during fo operation understanding cp is very important in fo modeling since it is the main cause for decreasing the concentration difference between feed and draw solution which is the driving force of fo cp occurs on the both outside and inside of membrane structures due to mass transfer resistance since internal concentration polarization icp is more severe than external concentration polarization ecp icp is the primary contributor to the reduction of driving force 26 30 31 thus accurate mathematical quantification of icp is essential in fo model development icp occurs due to asymmetric properties of fo in general commercially available fo membranes consist of two layers active and support the active layer is also called a coating layer and has an important role in the selective transport of molecules from one side of the membrane to the other 29 32 33 thus fo flux characteristics such as water permeability and solute permeability are determined by this active layer the support layer tends to be thicker more porous and more tortuous 29 32 33 the support layer is known to provide mechanical support for the whole membrane structure 34 the tortuous structure of the support layer reduces effective diffusion of solutes and generate concentration polarization across the membrane structure to describe the severity of icp the structural parameter s was introduced and expressed as follows 1 s l τ ε where l is the thickness of the support layer μ m τ is the tortuosity and ε is the porosity of the support layer the units of s μ m decsribe the average distance the solute molecule travels across the support layer although thickness of the membrane is easily measurable it is difficult to experimentally measure τ which is intrinsically related to support layer structure 35 in previous literature s was experimentally calculated based on the measured water flux and predicted surface concentration of feed and draw solution 25 32 36 37 however despite the very same experimental conditions and standardized model method different s values have been predicted among different research groups 38 this indicates that a mathematical model for an accurate prediction of s as well as tortuosity is desired to make a well developed theoretical model for fo research on direct contact membrane distillation dcmd has indicated that tortuosity can be predicted using porosity based on microporous polymeric membranes 39 43 in addition tortuosity in porous media can be predicted using various mathematical equations under certain geometric assumptions 44 these outcomes suggest that the porous structure of fo can be estimated using the mathematical models water permeability a and solute permeability b are also key intrinsic parameters in water flux prediction in general a pressurized method ro method has been used to measure a and b values for the fo membrane 45 46 during ro process deionized water or arbitrarily determined solute concentration of a solution is used as feed and high hydraulic pressure is applied measured water flux and solutes flux is used to reversely calculate a and b values respectively 38 47 however the commercial fo membrane was not designed for ro thus its structure is vulnerable and weak to external physical stress the weak structure of the support layer would be damaged under ro operation mode indicating that the obtained a and b values are not accurate 48 49 thus several researchers have suggested an alternative method fo method that does not use hydraulic pressure 11 50 however there are no studies regarding if there are differences in a and b values when operated in fo active layer facing feed and pro support layer facing feed mode this also implies the necessary to confirm if measured value in one mode is applicable in both operation mode the overall objective of this investigation was to propose and confirm a model for scale up of a forward osmosis fo system for waste stream treatment in this investigation a and b values were measured in fo and pro mode using the fo method the second specific objective was to estimate the structure parameter s based on measured porosity and predicted tortuosity using established models from the research literature to validate the calculated intrinsic parameters experimental and theoretical investigation was simultaneously conducted the theoretical model was statistically validated using root mean square error rmse bias and accuracy factors 2 theory the driving force for forward osmosis is the osmotic pressure difference across the active layer of the fo membrane as indicated in fig 1 the concentration difference across the active layer is much less than the difference between feed and draw solution water flux from the feed stream dilutes the concentration of the draw solution in addition the mass transfer boundary at the membrane surface as well as the porous structure of the support layer reduces the diffusion of solutes toward the active layer from the draw solution water flux jw and reverse solute flux js can be described by the following equations 2 j w a π d m π f m 3 j s b c d m c f m where a is the water permeability of the active layer b is the solute permeability of the active layer π d m and π f m are the osmotic pressure at the surface of the active layer on the draw and feed sides respectively and c d m are c f m are the solute concentrations at the surface of the active layer on the draw and feed sides respectively since the concentration difference across the active layer cannot be directly measured the concentration has been predicted using the diffusion convection equation based on the equation which includes the solute diffusion of solute from draw solution and convection from the feed stream the concentration across the active layer can be predicted 31 eqs 2 and 3 can be re written as following when in fo

where π d b and π f b are the osmotic pressure of bulk draw and feed solutions c d b and c f b are the bulk concentration of draw and feed solutions k f and k d are the mass transfer coefficient at the boundary layer of feed and draw solutions and d d and d f are the solute diffusion coefficient at draw and feed in addition the water flux and reverse solute flux in pro mode can be described as

viscosity and diffusion coefficient of nacl was obtained from the previous literature 51 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials two commercial fo membranes were used in this study the cellulose triacetate cta fo membrane was purchased from steriltech wa usa also the thin film composite tfc fo membrane was obtained from toray advanced materials korea inc gyeongsangbuk do south korea based on the manufacturer s recommendations the cta membrane was stored at ambient temperature while the tfc membrane was stored in 0 1 w v sodium bisulfite sigma aldrich usa at 4 before the use of the fo membrane the membrane was dipped into 500 ml of di water for 1 h to wash out preservatives these two membranes are denoted as cta and tfc respectively sodium chloride nacl fisher scientific usa was used to prepare the draw solution with ro water 3 2 experimental system the experimental phases of the research were conducted using cross flow fo membrane cells cf042 steriltech wa usa the active area of the fo membrane was 42 cm2 and the height of the flow channel was 23 mm a schematic diagram of the cross flow fo system is shown in fig 2 the draw solution and feed were circulated using two peristaltic pumps cole parmer il usa the initial volumes of draw solution and feed were 2 l the hydrodynamic conditions including flow rate and the pressure was recorded using a flow meter and pressure gauge the flow rate was 900 ml min the temperature of both feed and draw solution was controlled at 23 1 the flow temperature was measured and recorded every 5 s using thermocouples omega usa electric conductivity was measured in real time using an electrical conductivity meter hanna instrument usa to observe and calculate reverse solute flux water flux data was acquired through a connection of analytical balance to a computer and it was recorded every 5 s 3 3 membrane characterization 3 3 1 membrane porosity thickness and pore size the porosity of the cta and tfc membranes were measured using the gravimetric method 52 the membrane was soaked in 100 isopropyl alcohol ipa fisher scientific usa for 24 h to fill the porous structure with ipa and remove inside air and water from the structure the ipa soaked membrane was carefully transferred to 50 v v ipa for another 24 h the weight of the membrane was measured and dried at ambient temperature for 24 h the weight of the dried membrane was measured the porosity of the membrane was calculated using the following equation 12 ε ω 1 ω 2 ρ i ω 1 ω 2 ρ i ω 2 ρ p where ω 1 is the weight of the ipa wetted membrane ω 2 is the weight of dried membrane ρ i is the density of the ipa and ρ p is the density of the polymer the pore size was examined using an adsorption desorption analyzer asap 2020 micrometrics usa in addition the thickness of the membrane was measured using a micrometer 3 3 2 estimation of coefficient a and b the a and b coefficients have been evaluated in pro mode using a non pressurized fo experiment described by kim et al 53 the experiment was conducted using a range of nacl solutions from 0 5 to 2 m for the draw solution while water from a ro system was used a as feed stream in this approach the a can be computed using eq 2 the active layer of fo membrane which is exclusively permeable to water molecules is known to provide high rejection to salts 53 thus by assuming the active layer rejects all solutes flux and icp is negligible the eq 6 becomes simplified to eq 2 the osmotic pressure on the feed side is 0 and the osmotic pressure of draw can be predicted using thin film theory 54 13 π d m π d b e x p j w k d the osmotic pressure obtained in eq 13 can be used to solve eq 2 to obtain the value of a the value of b can be estimated in the following manner by conducting experiments with different concentrations of the draw solution the change of feed concentration was monitored by measurement of electrical conductivity meter the change in feed concentration can be described by the following relationship 14 c f v f 0 j w a m t j s a m t where v f 0 is the initial volume of the feed c f is the final concentration of the feed a m is the effective membrane area and t is the duration of the experiment j s was obtained by eq 14 and the following equation as re arranged from eq 3 was used to determine the value of b 15 b j s c d b e x p j w k d in order numerically estimate a and b for the fo mode the method proposed by tiraferri et al 50 was adopted and modified in addition external concentration polarization ecp at the draw solution surface was accommodated by using eqs 4 and 5 the experiment was conducted by varying the concentration of the draw solution from 1 to 4 m nacl and a feed stream of ro water a least square non linear fitting was used to fit the eqs 4 and 5 to the experimental results water flux and reverse solutes flux in each experimental condition 2 transport non linear equations including water flux and solute flux were obtained hence total 8 transport non linear equations were solved using least square minimization of global error a global error is the sum of normalized error between experimental results and calculated values of all water and solutes flux 16 e r r o r g l o b a l i 1 4 j w i e j w i c j w m e a n e 2 i 1 4 j s i e j s i c j s m e a n e 2 where j w m e a n e and j s m e a n e are the average of the experimental water and solute flux results j w i e and j s i e are the result of water and solute flux at each concentration condition and j w i c and j s i c are the flux predicted with eqs 4 and 5 respectively as the above equation is implicit this linear square minimization should be subjected to non linear equality constraints to solve the equation as the same assumption with pro mode the membrane was assumed to show almost 100 rejection of solutes this indicates that a dense active layer can maintain almost the same osmotic pressure during operation assuming that icp is the main contribution to the flux decline and ecp is ignorable the constraint equation becomes the following 17 j w a π d b e x p j w s d d 1 b j w 1 exp j w s d d to solve this least square minimization problem a series of the algorithms were developed and solved using matlab r2018b mathworks usa the obtained solution of a b was to minimize the global error eq 16 which was subjected to eq 17 during this calculation the s is also numerically obtained and further compared with the mathematically calculated s in 3 3 3 to validate the parameters the sequential quadratic programming sqp method was employed convergence was determined when the successive iteration produced the value less than the tolerance which is 1 10 6 violation of constraint was allowed up to 1 10 5 as reported in the previous study 50 our numerical solution also showed that the same value of the parameters was calculated in more strict tolerance levels as well 3 3 3 prediction of tortuosity and structural parameter tortuosity was predicted using the measurements of porosity for the support layer and the equations listed in tables 1 and 2 there are several mathematical correlations available in the literature many of these correlations are developed based on euclidean dimensions such as cubic sphere or cylinder mackies and meares 55 first proposed the correlation of tortuosity to the porosity of the membrane model 1 this approach has been successfully applied by other researchers to describe the tortuosity of the support layer of the ro membrane 39 56 in addition the tortuosity can be predicted using model 2 in an ordered packed structure of spheres 57 model 3 was based on the structure of the overlapping spheres as illustrated by several research groups 58 60 the tortuosity of a matrix consisting of impermeable overlapping circles can be described by the semi empirical model 4 as long as parameter p 0 67 0 67 61 in addition to the theoretical model model 5 was also derived and proposed for isotropic granular media 62 percolation theory was also adopted to estimate the tortuosity in randomly overlapping fibrous structures model 6 63 through a monte carlo simulation tomadakis and sotirchos determined the tortuosity with ε p percolation threshold 0 11 and an empirical constant α 0 785 63 model 7 was based on the matrix of impermeable non overlapping spheres 61 another theoretical model without an empirical coefficient but based on the assumption that some particles are either partially overlapped or not overlapping has been proposed as model 8 64 in addition to the models based on the euclidean dimension fractal theory has been incorporated by elias kohav et al 65 to develop model 9 to describe random walks for the structure of randomly clustered polymers another model model 10 was also proposed by li and yu 66 in this study a different approach to prediction of tortuosity has been proposed based on the fractal theory according to the fractal porous media theory fmpt the tortuosity of the fractal porous media is the function of porosity and spatial distribution of fractal dimension thus previous researchers have described the fractal structure based on fractal dimension 35 liu and nie 67 proposed prediction of tortuosity in fractal media with a parameter m to be calculated using the fractal dimension using the following equation 18 τ ε 1 m 19 m d t 2 d t where d t is the fractal dimension of a capillary xiao et al 68 proposed an equation for estimation of tortuosity fractal dimension as following 20 d t 1 l n 1 2 1 1 2 1 ε 1 ε 1 1 ε 1 2 1 4 1 1 ε l n 4 d f d f 1 4 2 π 1 ε 2 d f ε where d f is micropore area fractal dimension and was found to correlate with the porosity of porous media as follows 68 21 d f 2 l n ε l n 2 24 1 ε 1 0 342 ε in the current research eqs 18 and 19 have been incorporated with eqs 20 and 21 to predict the tortuosity of the porous structure of the fo support layer these steps lead to the proposed model 11 particularly model 11 describe the fractal nature of the porous structure of support layer and estimate the tortuosity with respect to the porosity eq 18 and fractal dimension eq 19 s has been predicted based on the tortuosity values from models 1 through 11 3 4 parameter validation and statistical analysis the predicted values of a b and s were compared to outcomes from experiments which account for all external ecp and icp experimental trials were conducted with feed concentrations from 0 5 to 1 5 m nacl and a draw solution concentration of 3 m nacl the goodness of the models was evaluated by computing a coefficient of determination r2 and an adjusted coefficient of determination ra 2 these coefficients are 22 r 2 1 s s r e s s s t o t a l 1 y i y ˆ i 2 y i y 2 23 r a 2 1 n 1 n k 1 1 r 2 where s s r e s is the sum of square of residuals s s t o t a l is the total sum of squares y i is the observed value y ˆ i is the predicted value y is the average of the observed values n is the number of experimental data and k is the number of parameters of the evaluated model in addition agreement between predicted and experimental data has been evaluated using the root mean square error rmse accuracy factor and bias

porosity of fo membrane as indicated by eq 1 the prediction of the structural parameter s requires measurement of the membrane thickness as indicated by the results presented in table 3 the thickness of the tfc membrane was found to be 100 μ m this is consistent with previous studies lee and ghaffour 69 used measurement from a digital micrometer and a scanning electron microscope sem and reported thickness of 100 μ m for a tfc membrane from the same manufacturer roest 70 reported that the thickness of the tfc was 100 μ m the thickness found in the current investigation of the cta was 113 3 μ m this measurement is similar to the previously reported value of 114 3 μ m 71 in contrast to tfc the cta measurements were more variable and could be due to the corrugated surface of the cta membrane sem images indicated that the cta membrane did not have a uniform thickness across the entire surface 72 the surface of tfc was relatively smooth as indicated in sem images 73 similar results were observed in our preliminary sem results data not shown the thickness of the support layer of both cta and tfc membranes were estimated culp et al 74 reported that the active dense layer accounts for 0 2 of the total volume other researchers have suggested the contribution of the active layer to the total thickness of the fo membrane is negligible due to the active layer being less than 100 nm 75 in order to develop the most accurate predictions the thickness of the active layer must be estimated the previous investigation indicated the thickness was found to ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 μ m for the tfc membrane 70 lee and ghaffour 69 reported value was 0 86 μ m another researchers reported measurements of 0 8 μ m for tfc 76 based on an evaluation of previous measurements the thickness of the support layer was estimated as 99 2 μ m for tfc used in this investigation in addition sem results presented that the thickness of the dense active layer was 1 μ m for the cta membrane produced from the same manufacturer 70 a similar experimental result was found in previously published research 77 based on an analysis of previous results and observations the support layer of cta of 112 3 μ m was selected for the current investigation the porosity and average pore size of the membranes were measured using the gravimetric method and the asap 2020 for membrane characterization the average pore size of tfc was 0 237 μ m while cta was 0 148 μ m the porosity of tfc was 67 7 whereas the cta was 69 4 these results are quite similar to the previous report lee and ghaffour 69 showed that the porosity of the support layer of tfc was 63 5 the porosity of the active layer and closed porosity was ignored in this estimation culp et al 74 reported that the closed porosity accounts for less than 0 1 for total membrane volume in addition chowdhury and mccutcheon 78 found that the porosity of the dense active layer of the fo membrane was approximately 0 01 for the current research the porosity of the support layer has been selected 4 2 estimation of a b and s of fo membrane to develop an accurate prediction model it is essential to identify the membrane parameter more sensitively in this presented study a non pressurized fo method was employed both tfc and cta membranes were characterized the results obtained for a and b are summarized in table 4 overall the water permeability a of tfc was greater than cta the water permeability of the tfc in fo mode was found to be 3 67 10 12 m3 m2 s pa whereas the cta was 0 93 10 12 m3 m2 s pa in addition the solutes permeabilities b were 14 7 10 8 m3 m2 s and 2 7 10 8 m3 m2 s for the tfc and cta in fo mode respectively the tfc fo membrane was known to have higher water flux performance than the cellulose based membrane 79 d haese 75 found that the water and solute permeabilities of tfc based membranes are higher than the cta membrane similar results were reported in the study conducted by bui et al 31 similarly the a and b values for tfc from the current research were higher in both operation modes wang et al 24 indicated that a and b of tfc were 1 33 10 11 m3 m2 s pa and 3 00 10 7 m3 m2 s respectively both values are much higher than the results being reported it should be noted that wang et al 24 used ro method with higher pressure requirements tiraferri et al 50 found that the intrinsic parameter acquired using the ro method was larger than the fo method due to the compaction of membrane structure under high hydraulic pressure an interesting finding is the differences in permeabilities of water and solutes depended on the operation mode in both fo membranes similar results were reported in the previous study 75 d haese et al 75 found that solute permeability of the tfc membrane varied with active layer orientation but with no obvious trend no clear explanation has been reported regarding this trend however this could be partially explained due to the interface between the active and the support layers water and draw solute might experience different conditions across the active layer the effective membrane surface area for diffusion may vary depending on location across the membrane surface as illustrated in fig 3 water and solute may be exposed to the entire surface area on the active layer on the outside membrane but the molecules positioned at the interface would be only partially exposed to the active layer these situations might cause the differences in permeability of water and solute depending on the operation mode in pro mode solute molecules diffuse from the draw solution to the inside of the membrane through the whole membrane area but in fo mode the solutes are facing smaller surface areas of the active layer due to the support structure in the previous studies the reduced surfaced area at the interface between the active layer and support layer has been described as an important key parameter for the water flux prediction 32 34 80 manickam and mccutcheon 32 suggested that a model to account for the effect of interface structure might be required lee et al 34 reported that an increase of the effective interface surface area had a significant effect on the water flux these outcomes imply that the permeability of the fo membrane is dependent on the effective surface area however to figure out the discrepancies of the a and b values depending on the membrane orientation a more comprehensive explanation must be given future research should be dedicated to providing a more comprehensive explanation in previous studies s has been reversely calculated from the experimental flux measurement small deviations in the experiment measurements can influence the magnitudes of s 32 the variability in s values has been observed even when experimental conditions are controlled for example when the same membrane material and a standardized model method have been employed 38 however theoretical s should be independent of test conditions using a numerical simulation with finite element park et al 81 demonstrated that the structural parameter of the support layer is constant in this investigation being reports a prediction model based on eq 1 has been used the information in table 5 a provides the predicted tortuosity and structural parameter the standard error for tortuosity was calculated following the rules of error propagation 23 δ τ τ δ a 1 a 1 δ a 2 a 2 δ a i a i where δ τ is the magnitude of τ deviation and a 1 a 2 a i are the parameters used in the equation most of the tortuosity values were in a range from 1 to 2 except for model 1 tortuosity should be equal to or larger than 1 44 in general model 9 and model 11 based on the fractal theory were found to have higher tortuosity magnitude the values obtained from model 11 were 1 611 and 1 511 for tfc and cta respectively the magnitude of the tortuosity is required in the estimation of the structural parameter tortuosity describes the ratio of actual flow path length to the thickness of the support layer 82 it is well established that the porous structure of the polymer can be described by the tortuosity and porosity since the membrane structure can be considered the porous media the flux behavior occurring inside a porous membrane is the fluid transport in general porous media 83 in particular iversen et al 39 reported that the tortuosity of the membrane system can be calculated from porosity due to the complexity of transport phenomena in a porous media many researchers have attempted to develop prediction models for tortuosity 57 64 84 86 most of the models are theoretical or semi empirical with a defined geometric model for the microstructure of the media for this investigation a model based on fractal porous media theory fpmt has been proposed through fpmt the migration path of a diffusing molecule inside the porous fractal system can be explained 35 more specifically the membrane which is composed of porous material can be described as fractal porous media 87 90 the proposed approach indicates that fpmt can also be applied to describe the transport behavior of the fo membrane the results of tortuosity directly affect the value of s as presented in table 5 b the magnitude of s calculated using model 11 were highest corresponding to 236 0 μ m and 244 6 μ m for tfc and cta respectively followed by values of model 9 in this study magnitudes of s predicted from the models were higher than the magnitude from the analysis described in section 3 3 2 the numerally predicted s was 100 μ m and 133 μ m for tfc and cta respectively the estimations in this study were much smaller than the values reported in previous studies lee and ghaffour 69 reported s values of 328 μ m for tfc wang et al 24 reported s of approximately 500 μ m however it should be noted that the researchers employed the conventional method to calculate s conventional method utilizes a high hydraulic pressure to characterize the membrane permeabilities as the structure of the commercial fo membranes is vulnerable to the external pressure the membrane permeabilities would be inaccurately measured in such experimental conditions this would lead to a huge variation in s estimation in previous studies manickam and mccutcheon 91 also reported that the conventional method overestimated s generating much higher values than the real intrinsic parameter the standard error of s was not presented in this study since the calculated deviation was less than 0 1 μ m 4 3 validation of the parameters with experimental results the a b and s parameters were confirmed using results of flux experiments in which dilutive concentrative ecp and icp occurs the concentration of feed stream was adjusted from 0 5 m to 1 5 m of nacl while the draw solution was fixed at 3 m the water flux results are presented in figs 4 and 5 overall tfc showed better performance than cta with respect to water flux in both fo and pro mode in addition higher feed concentrations induced lower water flux due to a smaller difference in osmotic pressure the goodness of fit was evaluated with r2 and ra 2 table 6 represents that model 9 and 11 showed improved goodness of fit r2 of models 9 and 11 were higher than 0 9 except for the fo mode of cta however most of others presented relatively lower goodness of fit also we compared the rmse accuracy factor and bias factor as an indicator for model comparison if the accuracy factor and bias factor equal to 1 this indicates that the proposed model perfectly predicts the experiment values 92 bias factor can be larger or smaller than 1 accuracy factor should be equal to or larger than 1 thus smaller rmse and values close to 1 for accuracy factor and bias factor are preferable to have a more sophisticated model 92 according to table 6 model 9 and model 11 were found to present better water flux predictions it should be emphasized that model 1 8 was developed based on the assumption that the pore structure can be described using euclidean geometry in addition model 10 was developed based on the assumption on the fractal structure where the pores of the porous media have a same size given that pore structure of support layer is likely to be very complex geometry the simplified geometric assumption would lead to wrong tortuosity estimation model 9 and proposed model 11account for the complex nature of the fractal structure of porous membranes particularly model 11 developed based on the fractal porous media theory accounts for the fractal nature of the pore structure of support layers in terms of spatial distribution of the complex structure fractal dimension eq 19 and the porosity eq 18 in other words this model can successfully capture the diffusion behavior occurring inside the porous structure the study conducted by paluri et al 35 also reported that the models based on the euclidean geometry such as circles spheres or cylinders underestimate the tortuosity of fractal shaped pore structure while fmpt provide improved prediction for tortuosity the obtained outcomes also indicate that numerically predicted s provided poor agreement with the experimental result it should be noted that the numerical calculation was subjected to the constraints which excludes the ecp effect this would result in the underestimation of s during the calculation resulting in poor prediction for the complex condition which includes the ecp effect in both sides of membranes as model 9 and model 11 appeared to present improved agreement with experimental results these were used for statistical comparison with numerically predicted s for the experiment involving ro water as a feed section 3 3 2 table 7 represents that model 9 and model 11 provide closer agreement with experimental results for both water flux and reverse salts flux based on the lower rmse and a 1 closer value of accuracy and bias factor the lower agreement of numerically predicted s would arise from the underestimation of the magnitude due to ecp exclusion during the numerical calculation the obtained outcomes highlight that model 9 and model 11 are preferable in tortuosity estimation for the support layer of fo membranes moreover we used the intrinsic parameters a and b obtained through pro mode to predict the water flux of fo mode and vice versa to compare statistical indicators these comparisons were only conducted for model 9 and model 11 overall it was revealed that the reverse use of a and b presented worse statistical results as presented in table 8 this indicates that a and b value obtained in fo mode is not preferable to predict water flux in pro mode and vice versa 5 conclusion in this study we proposed an alternative approach for the conventional fo water flux prediction an analysis based on complex expressions describing water and solute flux have been used to estimate permeability parameters for the fo and pro mode membrane orientation was found to influence permeability parameters a and b in fo and pro mode it can be partially explained by the reduced effective area at the interface between the active layer and the support layer but detailed research is required in the future study the structural parameter s can be estimated from thickness of support layer porosity and tortuosity and is a key

13722,forward osmosis fo is an emerging novel filtration technology used to reclaim water from waste streams or concentrate the valuable component accurate water flux prediction of fo is essential to facilitate process optimization and scale up of membrane systems the overall objective of this investigation was to propose and confirm a model for prediction of the structural parameter s which is required for flux determination of fo experimental measurements of water permeability a and solute permeability b revealed that these magnitudes were different for fo mode active layer facing feed compared to pro support layer facing feed mode using the non pressurized method a comprehensive review of research literature identified eleven 11 models for prediction of tortuosity after measurement of the membrane porosity the structural parameter s was predicted for each of the eleven tortuosity models experimental validation was conducted to statistically determine the accuracy and bias of the proposed models statistical results of root mean square error accuracy factor and bias factor exhibited that the newly proposed equation originated from fractal theory is most accurate for water flux predictions in both fo and pro mode of the two commercial membranes our results indicate that proper a and b values should be obtained and used depending on the operation mode while s can be

introduction high quality water is a primary source of life and is generally obtained from freshwater sources including groundwater in addition freshwater is essential in the various field of industry for cleaning cooling heating electric power generation and as a raw material 1 3 in addition water is an important ingredient on most food products the expansion of civilization industrialization consistent population growth and global climate change have placed an increased demand for freshwater 4 6 the sources of water are also decreasing due to the environmental contamination and lower groundwater levels 7 to address these concerns many of the pressure driven filtration technologies have been researched and adopted for use in several different industries 8 9 these membrane separation technologies include microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 10 the limitations to these conventional filtration technologies such as ro include the high hydraulic pressures required to obtain high quality water these high pressures translate into significant energy requirements recently many researchers have studied forward osmosis fo for an alternative to pressure driven filtration 11 12 contrary to the conventional membrane systems the driving force of fo is a difference in osmotic pressure fo should involve the draw solution which contains a high concentration of solutes the main advantage of fo is separation at very low pressure or no pressure 13 fo operates with a high solute rejection rate and a lower rate of fouling when compared to conventional membrane systems 13 applications of fo has been investigated in several areas of food research 14 15 in addition fo has been successfully applied to treat wastewater originated from various industries 7 16 17 the research reveals promising utilization of fo for various practical applications in many fields of industry to facilitate implementation at pilot or industrial scales filtration performance in terms of water flux of fo must be demonstrated water flux is the most important factor to describe membrane efficiency in addition higher water flux becomes the basis to size up to the larger scales from the lab scales although fo has shown promise in various applications at laboratory scale industrial scale applications operate at lower water flux than the conventional filtration systems 18 enhanced water flux can be accomplished through the modification of process design fabrication of novel membrane material or optimization of process parameters 19 20 several researchers have attempted to develop new membrane materials for improvement of fo water flux zirehpour et al 21 employed nano sized metal organic framework particles to modify fo membranes and enhance structural properties choi et al 22 blended carbon nanotube into cellulose acetate membranes to prevent foulant formation while keeping sufficient water flux other research groups employed hydrophilic compounds such as sulfonated polysulfone or sulfonated poly bends to fabricate thin film composite tfc for this purpose 23 in addition enhancement of water flux can be achieved by the optimization of various process parameters including draw solution membrane orientation temperature and hydrodynamic conditions 24 26 due to complexity of operating parameters it is not plausible to experimentally test and identify all the conditions particularly in larger scales this leads to a necessity to develop a more accurate prediction model for fo water flux the developed prediction model will allow accurate predictions for water flux and help establish a cost model to evaluate economic benefits furthermore the model would help find an optimal condition for a given environment the prediction model for fo has been proposed by several researchers lee et al 27 first introduced the convection diffusion model to describe the behavior of water and solute flux across the membrane structure in 1981 recent fo researchers have improved this convection diffusion model into a more developed form to describe concentration polarization cp occurring inside and outside membrane structure 25 28 29 cp is a mass transfer phenomena that occurs during fo operation understanding cp is very important in fo modeling since it is the main cause for decreasing the concentration difference between feed and draw solution which is the driving force of fo cp occurs on the both outside and inside of membrane structures due to mass transfer resistance since internal concentration polarization icp is more severe than external concentration polarization ecp icp is the primary contributor to the reduction of driving force 26 30 31 thus accurate mathematical quantification of icp is essential in fo model development icp occurs due to asymmetric properties of fo in general commercially available fo membranes consist of two layers active and support the active layer is also called a coating layer and has an important role in the selective transport of molecules from one side of the membrane to the other 29 32 33 thus fo flux characteristics such as water permeability and solute permeability are determined by this active layer the support layer tends to be thicker more porous and more tortuous 29 32 33 the support layer is known to provide mechanical support for the whole membrane structure 34 the tortuous structure of the support layer reduces effective diffusion of solutes and generate concentration polarization across the membrane structure to describe the severity of icp the structural parameter s was introduced and expressed as follows 1 s l τ ε where l is the thickness of the support layer μ m τ is the tortuosity and ε is the porosity of the support layer the units of s μ m decsribe the average distance the solute molecule travels across the support layer although thickness of the membrane is easily measurable it is difficult to experimentally measure τ which is intrinsically related to support layer structure 35 in previous literature s was experimentally calculated based on the measured water flux and predicted surface concentration of feed and draw solution 25 32 36 37 however despite the very same experimental conditions and standardized model method different s values have been predicted among different research groups 38 this indicates that a mathematical model for an accurate prediction of s as well as tortuosity is desired to make a well developed theoretical model for fo research on direct contact membrane distillation dcmd has indicated that tortuosity can be predicted using porosity based on microporous polymeric membranes 39 43 in addition tortuosity in porous media can be predicted using various mathematical equations under certain geometric assumptions 44 these outcomes suggest that the porous structure of fo can be estimated using the mathematical models water permeability a and solute permeability b are also key intrinsic parameters in water flux prediction in general a pressurized method ro method has been used to measure a and b values for the fo membrane 45 46 during ro process deionized water or arbitrarily determined solute concentration of a solution is used as feed and high hydraulic pressure is applied measured water flux and solutes flux is used to reversely calculate a and b values respectively 38 47 however the commercial fo membrane was not designed for ro thus its structure is vulnerable and weak to external physical stress the weak structure of the support layer would be damaged under ro operation mode indicating that the obtained a and b values are not accurate 48 49 thus several researchers have suggested an alternative method fo method that does not use hydraulic pressure 11 50 however there are no studies regarding if there are differences in a and b values when operated in fo active layer facing feed and pro support layer facing feed mode this also implies the necessary to confirm if measured value in one mode is applicable in both operation mode the overall objective of this investigation was to propose and confirm a model for scale up of a forward osmosis fo system for waste stream treatment in this investigation a and b values were measured in fo and pro mode using the fo method the second specific objective was to estimate the structure parameter s based on measured porosity and predicted tortuosity using established models from the research literature to validate the calculated intrinsic parameters experimental and theoretical investigation was simultaneously conducted the theoretical model was statistically validated using root mean square error rmse bias and accuracy factors 2 theory the driving force for forward osmosis is the osmotic pressure difference across the active layer of the fo membrane as indicated in fig 1 the concentration difference across the active layer is much less than the difference between feed and draw solution water flux from the feed stream dilutes the concentration of the draw solution in addition the mass transfer boundary at the membrane surface as well as the porous structure of the support layer reduces the diffusion of solutes toward the active layer from the draw solution water flux jw and reverse solute flux js can be described by the following equations 2 j w a π d m π f m 3 j s b c d m c f m where a is the water permeability of the active layer b is the solute permeability of the active layer π d m and π f m are the osmotic pressure at the surface of the active layer on the draw and feed sides respectively and c d m are c f m are the solute concentrations at the surface of the active layer on the draw and feed sides respectively since the concentration difference across the active layer cannot be directly measured the concentration has been predicted using the diffusion convection equation based on the equation which includes the solute diffusion of solute from draw solution and convection from the feed stream the concentration across the active layer can be predicted 31 eqs 2 and 3 can be re written as following when in fo

where π d b and π f b are the osmotic pressure of bulk draw and feed solutions c d b and c f b are the bulk concentration of draw and feed solutions k f and k d are the mass transfer coefficient at the boundary layer of feed and draw solutions and d d and d f are the solute diffusion coefficient at draw and feed in addition the water flux and reverse solute flux in pro mode can be described as

viscosity and diffusion coefficient of nacl was obtained from the previous literature 51 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials two commercial fo membranes were used in this study the cellulose triacetate cta fo membrane was purchased from steriltech wa usa also the thin film composite tfc fo membrane was obtained from toray advanced materials korea inc gyeongsangbuk do south korea based on the manufacturer s recommendations the cta membrane was stored at ambient temperature while the tfc membrane was stored in 0 1 w v sodium bisulfite sigma aldrich usa at 4 before the use of the fo membrane the membrane was dipped into 500 ml of di water for 1 h to wash out preservatives these two membranes are denoted as cta and tfc respectively sodium chloride nacl fisher scientific usa was used to prepare the draw solution with ro water 3 2 experimental system the experimental phases of the research were conducted using cross flow fo membrane cells cf042 steriltech wa usa the active area of the fo membrane was 42 cm2 and the height of the flow channel was 23 mm a schematic diagram of the cross flow fo system is shown in fig 2 the draw solution and feed were circulated using two peristaltic pumps cole parmer il usa the initial volumes of draw solution and feed were 2 l the hydrodynamic conditions including flow rate and the pressure was recorded using a flow meter and pressure gauge the flow rate was 900 ml min the temperature of both feed and draw solution was controlled at 23 1 the flow temperature was measured and recorded every 5 s using thermocouples omega usa electric conductivity was measured in real time using an electrical conductivity meter hanna instrument usa to observe and calculate reverse solute flux water flux data was acquired through a connection of analytical balance to a computer and it was recorded every 5 s 3 3 membrane characterization 3 3 1 membrane porosity thickness and pore size the porosity of the cta and tfc membranes were measured using the gravimetric method 52 the membrane was soaked in 100 isopropyl alcohol ipa fisher scientific usa for 24 h to fill the porous structure with ipa and remove inside air and water from the structure the ipa soaked membrane was carefully transferred to 50 v v ipa for another 24 h the weight of the membrane was measured and dried at ambient temperature for 24 h the weight of the dried membrane was measured the porosity of the membrane was calculated using the following equation 12 ε ω 1 ω 2 ρ i ω 1 ω 2 ρ i ω 2 ρ p where ω 1 is the weight of the ipa wetted membrane ω 2 is the weight of dried membrane ρ i is the density of the ipa and ρ p is the density of the polymer the pore size was examined using an adsorption desorption analyzer asap 2020 micrometrics usa in addition the thickness of the membrane was measured using a micrometer 3 3 2 estimation of coefficient a and b the a and b coefficients have been evaluated in pro mode using a non pressurized fo experiment described by kim et al 53 the experiment was conducted using a range of nacl solutions from 0 5 to 2 m for the draw solution while water from a ro system was used a as feed stream in this approach the a can be computed using eq 2 the active layer of fo membrane which is exclusively permeable to water molecules is known to provide high rejection to salts 53 thus by assuming the active layer rejects all solutes flux and icp is negligible the eq 6 becomes simplified to eq 2 the osmotic pressure on the feed side is 0 and the osmotic pressure of draw can be predicted using thin film theory 54 13 π d m π d b e x p j w k d the osmotic pressure obtained in eq 13 can be used to solve eq 2 to obtain the value of a the value of b can be estimated in the following manner by conducting experiments with different concentrations of the draw solution the change of feed concentration was monitored by measurement of electrical conductivity meter the change in feed concentration can be described by the following relationship 14 c f v f 0 j w a m t j s a m t where v f 0 is the initial volume of the feed c f is the final concentration of the feed a m is the effective membrane area and t is the duration of the experiment j s was obtained by eq 14 and the following equation as re arranged from eq 3 was used to determine the value of b 15 b j s c d b e x p j w k d in order numerically estimate a and b for the fo mode the method proposed by tiraferri et al 50 was adopted and modified in addition external concentration polarization ecp at the draw solution surface was accommodated by using eqs 4 and 5 the experiment was conducted by varying the concentration of the draw solution from 1 to 4 m nacl and a feed stream of ro water a least square non linear fitting was used to fit the eqs 4 and 5 to the experimental results water flux and reverse solutes flux in each experimental condition 2 transport non linear equations including water flux and solute flux were obtained hence total 8 transport non linear equations were solved using least square minimization of global error a global error is the sum of normalized error between experimental results and calculated values of all water and solutes flux 16 e r r o r g l o b a l i 1 4 j w i e j w i c j w m e a n e 2 i 1 4 j s i e j s i c j s m e a n e 2 where j w m e a n e and j s m e a n e are the average of the experimental water and solute flux results j w i e and j s i e are the result of water and solute flux at each concentration condition and j w i c and j s i c are the flux predicted with eqs 4 and 5 respectively as the above equation is implicit this linear square minimization should be subjected to non linear equality constraints to solve the equation as the same assumption with pro mode the membrane was assumed to show almost 100 rejection of solutes this indicates that a dense active layer can maintain almost the same osmotic pressure during operation assuming that icp is the main contribution to the flux decline and ecp is ignorable the constraint equation becomes the following 17 j w a π d b e x p j w s d d 1 b j w 1 exp j w s d d to solve this least square minimization problem a series of the algorithms were developed and solved using matlab r2018b mathworks usa the obtained solution of a b was to minimize the global error eq 16 which was subjected to eq 17 during this calculation the s is also numerically obtained and further compared with the mathematically calculated s in 3 3 3 to validate the parameters the sequential quadratic programming sqp method was employed convergence was determined when the successive iteration produced the value less than the tolerance which is 1 10 6 violation of constraint was allowed up to 1 10 5 as reported in the previous study 50 our numerical solution also showed that the same value of the parameters was calculated in more strict tolerance levels as well 3 3 3 prediction of tortuosity and structural parameter tortuosity was predicted using the measurements of porosity for the support layer and the equations listed in tables 1 and 2 there are several mathematical correlations available in the literature many of these correlations are developed based on euclidean dimensions such as cubic sphere or cylinder mackies and meares 55 first proposed the correlation of tortuosity to the porosity of the membrane model 1 this approach has been successfully applied by other researchers to describe the tortuosity of the support layer of the ro membrane 39 56 in addition the tortuosity can be predicted using model 2 in an ordered packed structure of spheres 57 model 3 was based on the structure of the overlapping spheres as illustrated by several research groups 58 60 the tortuosity of a matrix consisting of impermeable overlapping circles can be described by the semi empirical model 4 as long as parameter p 0 67 0 67 61 in addition to the theoretical model model 5 was also derived and proposed for isotropic granular media 62 percolation theory was also adopted to estimate the tortuosity in randomly overlapping fibrous structures model 6 63 through a monte carlo simulation tomadakis and sotirchos determined the tortuosity with ε p percolation threshold 0 11 and an empirical constant α 0 785 63 model 7 was based on the matrix of impermeable non overlapping spheres 61 another theoretical model without an empirical coefficient but based on the assumption that some particles are either partially overlapped or not overlapping has been proposed as model 8 64 in addition to the models based on the euclidean dimension fractal theory has been incorporated by elias kohav et al 65 to develop model 9 to describe random walks for the structure of randomly clustered polymers another model model 10 was also proposed by li and yu 66 in this study a different approach to prediction of tortuosity has been proposed based on the fractal theory according to the fractal porous media theory fmpt the tortuosity of the fractal porous media is the function of porosity and spatial distribution of fractal dimension thus previous researchers have described the fractal structure based on fractal dimension 35 liu and nie 67 proposed prediction of tortuosity in fractal media with a parameter m to be calculated using the fractal dimension using the following equation 18 τ ε 1 m 19 m d t 2 d t where d t is the fractal dimension of a capillary xiao et al 68 proposed an equation for estimation of tortuosity fractal dimension as following 20 d t 1 l n 1 2 1 1 2 1 ε 1 ε 1 1 ε 1 2 1 4 1 1 ε l n 4 d f d f 1 4 2 π 1 ε 2 d f ε where d f is micropore area fractal dimension and was found to correlate with the porosity of porous media as follows 68 21 d f 2 l n ε l n 2 24 1 ε 1 0 342 ε in the current research eqs 18 and 19 have been incorporated with eqs 20 and 21 to predict the tortuosity of the porous structure of the fo support layer these steps lead to the proposed model 11 particularly model 11 describe the fractal nature of the porous structure of support layer and estimate the tortuosity with respect to the porosity eq 18 and fractal dimension eq 19 s has been predicted based on the tortuosity values from models 1 through 11 3 4 parameter validation and statistical analysis the predicted values of a b and s were compared to outcomes from experiments which account for all external ecp and icp experimental trials were conducted with feed concentrations from 0 5 to 1 5 m nacl and a draw solution concentration of 3 m nacl the goodness of the models was evaluated by computing a coefficient of determination r2 and an adjusted coefficient of determination ra 2 these coefficients are 22 r 2 1 s s r e s s s t o t a l 1 y i y ˆ i 2 y i y 2 23 r a 2 1 n 1 n k 1 1 r 2 where s s r e s is the

porosity of fo membrane as indicated by eq 1 the prediction of the structural parameter s requires measurement of the membrane thickness as indicated by the results presented in table 3 the thickness of the tfc membrane was found to be 100 μ m this is consistent with previous studies lee and ghaffour 69 used measurement from a digital micrometer and a scanning electron microscope sem and reported thickness of 100 μ m for a tfc membrane from the same manufacturer roest 70 reported that the thickness of the tfc was 100 μ m the thickness found in the current investigation of the cta was 113 3 μ m this measurement is similar to the previously reported value of 114 3 μ m 71 in contrast to tfc the cta measurements were more variable and could be due to the corrugated surface of the cta membrane sem images indicated that the cta membrane did not have a uniform thickness across the entire surface 72 the surface of tfc was relatively smooth as indicated in sem images 73 similar results were observed in our preliminary sem results data not shown the thickness of the support layer of both cta and tfc membranes were estimated culp et al 74 reported that the active dense layer accounts for 0 2 of the total volume other researchers have suggested the contribution of the active layer to the total thickness of the fo membrane is negligible due to the active layer being less than 100 nm 75 in order to develop the most accurate predictions the thickness of the active layer must be estimated the previous investigation indicated the thickness was found to ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 μ m for the tfc membrane 70 lee and ghaffour 69 reported value was 0 86 μ m another researchers reported measurements of 0 8 μ m for tfc 76 based on an evaluation of previous measurements the thickness of the support layer was estimated as 99 2 μ m for tfc used in this investigation in addition sem results presented that the thickness of the dense active layer was 1 μ m for the cta membrane produced from the same manufacturer 70 a similar experimental result was found in previously published research 77 based on an analysis of previous results and observations the support layer of cta of 112 3 μ m was selected for the current investigation the porosity and average pore size of the membranes were measured using the gravimetric method and the asap 2020 for membrane characterization the average pore size of tfc was 0 237 μ m while cta was 0 148 μ m the porosity of tfc was 67 7 whereas the cta was 69 4 these results are quite similar to the previous report lee and ghaffour 69 showed that the porosity of the support layer of tfc was 63 5 the porosity of the active layer and closed porosity was ignored in this estimation culp et al 74 reported that the closed porosity accounts for less than 0 1 for total membrane volume in addition chowdhury and mccutcheon 78 found that the porosity of the dense active layer of the fo membrane was approximately 0 01 for the current research the porosity of the support layer has been selected 4 2 estimation of a b and s of fo membrane to develop an accurate prediction model it is essential to identify the membrane parameter more sensitively in this presented study a non pressurized fo method was employed both tfc and cta membranes were characterized the results obtained for a and b are summarized in table 4 overall the water permeability a of tfc was greater than cta the water permeability of the tfc in fo mode was found to be 3 67 10 12 m3 m2 s pa whereas the cta was 0 93 10 12 m3 m2 s pa in addition the solutes permeabilities b were 14 7 10 8 m3 m2 s and 2 7 10 8 m3 m2 s for the tfc and cta in fo mode respectively the tfc fo membrane was known to have higher water flux performance than the cellulose based membrane 79 d haese 75 found that the water and solute permeabilities of tfc based membranes are higher than the cta membrane similar results were reported in the study conducted by bui et al 31 similarly the a and b values for tfc from the current research were higher in both operation modes wang et al 24 indicated that a and b of tfc were 1 33 10 11 m3 m2 s pa and 3 00 10 7 m3 m2 s respectively both values are much higher than the results being reported it should be noted that wang et al 24 used ro method with higher pressure requirements tiraferri et al 50 found that the intrinsic parameter acquired using the ro method was larger than the fo method due to the compaction of membrane structure under high hydraulic pressure an interesting finding is the differences in permeabilities of water and solutes depended on the operation mode in both fo membranes similar results were reported in the previous study 75 d haese et al 75 found that solute permeability of the tfc membrane varied with active layer orientation but with no obvious trend no clear explanation has been reported regarding this trend however this could be partially explained due to the interface between the active and the support layers water and draw solute might experience different conditions across the active layer the effective membrane surface area for diffusion may vary depending on location across the membrane surface as illustrated in fig 3 water and solute may be exposed to the entire surface area on the active layer on the outside membrane but the molecules positioned at the interface would be only partially exposed to the active layer these situations might cause the differences in permeability of water and solute depending on the operation mode in pro mode solute molecules diffuse from the draw solution to the inside of the membrane through the whole membrane area but in fo mode the solutes are facing smaller surface areas of the active layer due to the support structure in the previous studies the reduced surfaced area at the interface between the active layer and support layer has been described as an important key parameter for the water flux prediction 32 34 80 manickam and mccutcheon 32 suggested that a model to account for the effect of interface structure might be required lee et al 34 reported that an increase of the effective interface surface area had a significant effect on the water flux these outcomes imply that the permeability of the fo membrane is dependent on the effective surface area however to figure out the discrepancies of the a and b values depending on the membrane orientation a more comprehensive explanation must be given future research should be dedicated to providing a more comprehensive explanation in previous studies s has been reversely calculated from the experimental flux measurement small deviations in the experiment measurements can influence the magnitudes of s 32 the variability in s values has been observed even when experimental conditions are controlled for example when the same membrane material and a standardized model method have been employed 38 however theoretical s should be independent of test conditions using a numerical simulation with finite element park et al 81 demonstrated that the structural parameter of the support layer is constant in this investigation being reports a prediction model based on eq 1 has been used the information in table 5 a provides the predicted tortuosity and structural parameter the standard error for tortuosity was calculated following the rules of error propagation 23 δ τ τ δ a 1 a 1 δ a 2 a 2 δ a i a i where δ τ is the magnitude of τ deviation and a 1 a 2 a i are the parameters used in the equation most of the tortuosity values were in a range from 1 to 2 except for model 1 tortuosity should be equal to or larger than 1 44 in general model 9 and model 11 based on the fractal theory were found to have higher tortuosity magnitude the values obtained from model 11 were 1 611 and 1 511 for tfc and cta respectively the magnitude of the tortuosity is required in the estimation of the structural parameter tortuosity describes the ratio of actual flow path length to the thickness of the support layer 82 it is well established that the porous structure of the polymer can be described by the tortuosity and porosity since the membrane structure can be considered the porous media the flux behavior occurring inside a porous membrane is the fluid transport in general porous media 83 in particular iversen et al 39 reported that the tortuosity of the membrane system can be calculated from porosity due to the complexity of transport phenomena in a porous media many researchers have attempted to develop prediction models for tortuosity 57 64 84 86 most of the models are theoretical or semi empirical with a defined geometric model for the microstructure of the media for this investigation a model based on fractal porous media theory fpmt has been proposed through fpmt the migration path of a diffusing molecule inside the porous fractal system can be explained 35 more specifically the membrane which is composed of porous material can be described as fractal porous media 87 90 the proposed approach indicates that fpmt can also be applied to describe the transport behavior of the fo membrane the results of tortuosity directly affect the value of s as presented in table 5 b the magnitude of s calculated using model 11 were highest corresponding to 236 0 μ m and 244 6 μ m for tfc and cta respectively followed by values of model 9 in this study magnitudes of s predicted from the models were higher than the magnitude from the analysis described in section 3 3 2 the numerally predicted s was 100 μ m and 133 μ m for tfc and cta respectively the estimations in this study were much smaller than the values reported in previous studies lee and ghaffour 69 reported s values of 328 μ m for tfc wang et al 24 reported s of approximately 500 μ m however it should be noted that the researchers employed the conventional method to calculate s conventional method utilizes a high hydraulic pressure to characterize the membrane permeabilities as the structure of the commercial fo membranes is vulnerable to the external pressure the membrane permeabilities would be inaccurately measured in such experimental conditions this would lead to a huge variation in s estimation in previous studies manickam and mccutcheon 91 also reported that the conventional method overestimated s generating much higher values than the real intrinsic parameter the standard error of s was not presented in this study since the calculated deviation was less than 0 1 μ m 4 3 validation of the parameters with experimental results the a b and s parameters were confirmed using results of flux experiments in which dilutive concentrative ecp and icp occurs the concentration of feed stream was adjusted from 0 5 m to 1 5 m of nacl while the draw solution was fixed at 3 m the water flux results are presented in figs 4 and 5 overall tfc showed better performance than cta with respect to water flux in both fo and pro mode in addition higher feed concentrations induced lower water flux due to a smaller difference in osmotic pressure the goodness of fit was evaluated with r2 and ra 2 table 6 represents that model 9 and 11 showed improved goodness of fit r2 of models 9 and 11 were higher than 0 9 except for the fo mode of cta however most of others presented relatively lower goodness of fit also we compared the rmse accuracy factor and bias factor as an indicator for model comparison if the accuracy factor and bias factor equal to 1 this indicates that the proposed model perfectly predicts the experiment values 92 bias factor can be larger or smaller than 1 accuracy factor should be equal to or larger than 1 thus smaller rmse and values close to 1 for accuracy factor and bias factor are preferable to have a more sophisticated model 92 according to table 6 model 9 and model 11 were found to present better water flux predictions it should be emphasized that model 1 8 was developed based on the assumption that the pore structure can be described using euclidean geometry in addition model 10 was developed based on the assumption on the fractal structure where the pores of the porous media have a same size given that pore structure of support layer is likely to be very complex geometry the simplified geometric assumption would lead to wrong tortuosity estimation model 9 and proposed model 11account for the complex nature of the fractal structure of porous membranes particularly model 11 developed based on the fractal porous media theory accounts for the fractal nature of the pore structure of support layers in terms of spatial distribution of the complex structure fractal dimension eq 19 and the porosity eq 18 in other words this model can successfully capture the diffusion behavior occurring inside the porous structure the study conducted by paluri et al 35 also reported that the models based on the euclidean geometry such as circles spheres or cylinders underestimate the tortuosity of fractal shaped pore structure while fmpt provide improved prediction for tortuosity the obtained outcomes also indicate that numerically predicted s provided poor agreement with the experimental result it should be noted that the numerical calculation was subjected to the constraints which excludes the ecp effect this would result in the underestimation of s during the calculation resulting in poor prediction for the complex condition which includes the ecp effect in both sides of membranes as model 9 and model 11 appeared to present improved agreement with experimental results these were used for statistical comparison with numerically predicted s for the experiment involving ro water as a feed section 3 3 2 table 7 represents that model 9 and model 11 provide closer agreement with experimental results for both water flux and reverse salts flux based on the lower rmse and a 1 closer value of accuracy and bias factor the lower agreement of numerically predicted s would arise from the underestimation of the magnitude due to ecp exclusion during the numerical calculation the obtained outcomes highlight that model 9 and model 11 are preferable in tortuosity estimation for the support layer of fo membranes moreover we used the intrinsic parameters a and b obtained through pro mode to predict the water flux of fo mode and vice versa to compare statistical indicators these comparisons were only conducted for model 9 and model 11 overall it was revealed that the reverse use of a and b presented worse statistical results as presented in table 8 this indicates that a and b value obtained in fo mode is not preferable to predict water flux in pro mode and vice versa 5 conclusion in this study we proposed an alternative approach for the conventional fo water flux prediction an analysis based on complex expressions describing water and solute flux have been used to estimate permeability parameters for the fo and pro mode membrane orientation was found to influence permeability parameters a and b in fo and pro mode it can be partially explained by the reduced effective area at the interface between the active layer and the support layer but detailed research is required in the future study the structural parameter s can be estimated from thickness of support layer porosity and tortuosity and is a key parameter needed to describe icp during fo operation expressions based on fractal theory ware found to provide the best estimates for tortuosity and structural parameter s for membranes to be used in forward osmosis an assumption that the structural parameter s is independent of experimental conditions such as membrane orientation feed and draw concentration has been confirmed our study demonstrates that the proposed models for tortuosity can also be employed in the forward osmosis research area declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest was declared acknowledgments

persistent pesticide such as profenofos pf due to more toxicity the removal of such organic compounds are necessary in environmental aspects the prepared nanocomposites were characterized and well explained using ft ir xrd uv drs sem edx tem tga dta pl and bet surface area measurements the oh and o2 radicals was benign effective oxidative species involved in the zgo mof system for the mineralization of organic pollutants besides zgo mof showed excellent photo stability over five repetitive runs for the removal of organic pesticides with minimal drop on catalytic activity eventually the intended photocatalytic mechanisms and degradation pathways of pf are readily determined in detail based on experimental results the catalyst achieves excellent efficiency of about 94 possible pq oxidative pathways and their reaction intermediates were observed by lc ms therefore the pollutant which primarily oxidize into ring ruptured components into innocuous products like h2o co2 and a few in organic salts with the concern of its environmental friendly low cost and benign simple synthesis zgo mof was expected to be a promising choice for applications in wastewater management keywords profenofos zgo mof batch experiments oxidative pathway mechanism 1 introduction pesticides plays a prominent role on ensuring safety by protecting crops from harmful insects and pests in the agricultural fields they are designed to kill pests which could enhance higher crop yields 1 however their effects were not limited to a specific species and they commonly harm or extirpate to other living organisms includes fishes human beings respectively moreover the change in bio diversity reducing nitrogen fixation pollinate inhibition hesitating habitats and majorly threatened to species of wildlife and environment 2 the amount of individual pesticide residue cannot exceed 0 1 μg l 1 while the total amount of pesticides cannot be above 0 5 μg l 1 3 in the present study the profenofos was chosen due to its extensive use water solubility toxicity and potential to contaminate water resources under favorable conditions the profenofos pf belongs to the group of synthetic organo thiophosphate insecticide which primarily used against lepidopteran insects throughout the world the common practice of using pesticides in agriculture for controlling pests in fruits cottons crop and vegetables 4 the toxic nature of pesticide that inhibits cholinesterase enzyme in central nervous system of human beings as well as animals owing to its widespread usage the residues are found in environmental matrices and persist in the environment for long period of time the high toxic nature of pesticide tends to adverse consequences for human beings especially to aquatic life therefore it is imperative to remove profenofos from wastewaters the practice of various techniques necessary for treating an intractable compounds numerous processes are available for pesticides removal which mainly includes photocatalytic degradation 5 photo fenton process 6 biological mineralization 7 aerobic degradation 8 nano filtration 9 membrane process 3 ozonation and adsorption process 10 among

photocatalysis are well known efficient technique for the remediation of environmental pollutants and the catalysts used are non toxic easy to synthesize and low cost notably sunlight can be used as an energy source in this technique 12 the uv vis light induced photocatalytic process are considered to be sustainable method and therefore it has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years photocatalysts are mostly made of semiconductor materials which can be pure doped or heterostructures semiconductor mediated photocatalytic mineralization of pollutants on wastewater occurs through simplistic and economic method among various oxide based semi conductive catalyst zno have been shown to be the most suitable for the photodegradation of organic contaminants owing to its wide bandgap 3 37 ev effective oxidizing power biologically inert non toxic and poses high stability against photochemical corrosion 13 on contrast in lone phases of zno the catalytic degradation reveals a narrow bandgap due to higher recombination rate as well as low separation of photo induced electron hole pairs to overcome this issue a highly surfaced graphene oxide go sheets was intrinsically doped on narrow band zno semiconductor herein the go a atomically thinned sheets of carbon particles or atoms ordered in a honeycomb arrangements 14 and it extends to two magnitude pile of sp2 hybridized carbon with larger surface area theoretical value 2630 m2 g tends to have degrading capability of pollutant 15 it contains a sequence of reactive oxygen functional groups on the sheet surface e g hydroxyl oh epoxide c o c and carboxylic acid coo groups the unique surface functional arrays shows that go a superior solution for doping metal metal oxides 16 furthermore go shows considerably higher photon based catalytic achievements due to the higher electron mobility and stretchy sheet like core 17 to reduce limitations and for enhancing the catalytic performance of go on zno a new type of hybrid network namely metal organic frameworks mofs was used mof s are considered as new type of fused porous coordination polymers and they are constructed by creating strong linking bonds flanked by organic ligands and metal ions 18 furthermore it occurs the possible ligand to metal charge transfer lmct or metal to ligand charge transfer mlct which makes mof materials tends to have higher photocatalytic performance and then it degraded into non toxic pollutant 19 mofs have been investigated and used in a wide range of application including as adsorbents for water treatment 20 compared to a secondary photocatalytic approach the photoactive mof has numerous advantages 1 the heterogeneity of photocatalysts simplifies their reprocessing and reuse 2 the extensible nature of mof synthesis led for adjustable tuning and also coherent pattern of these photocatalysts at the molecular extent and 3 an mof material with high porosity a pore size in the microporous to mesoporous range and finely tunable properties can be obtained by varying the connection of the inorganic part and the type of organic linkers 21 therefore the feasibility of using mof on zgo enhances the catalytic activity for pf were investigated herein we have synthesized a novel zgo mof composite by simple hydrothermal process the prepared nanocomposites were characterized and well explained by ft ir uv vis xrd uv drs sem edx tem tga dta esr pl and bet respectively regeneration studies was also carried out to detect the stability of the photocatalyst moreover the by products formed during degradation were examined using lc ms technique and the mechanism was discussed in detail eventually the zgo mof provides an alternative material for the remediation of organic contaminants in aqueous solutions 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods graphitic powder 150 200 mesh was acquired from merck germany and 1 4 benzenedicarboxylic acid terephthalate was supplied by sigma aldrich mumbai

mart in dindigul tamil nadu india systematic grade chemicals such as n n dimethylformamide dmf hydrogen peroxide h2o2 sulfuric acid h2so4 hydrochloric acid hcl ethanol c2h5oh sodium nitrate nano3 and potassium permanganate kmno4 were acquired from merck germany and used without further refinement the test solutions were inclined by using double distilled dd water for preparing pesticide samples

material 2 2 stock preparation a stock of 1000 mg l 1 profenofos was taken in a beaker for dissolution in an aqueous medium the solutions with various strength ranges from 10 to 100 mg l 1 were prepared using double distilled dd water different concentrations of various scavengers such as isopropanol tert butanol and h2o2 were added to solution containing catalyst to observe their effect on oxidation of profenofos under uv light radiation the chemical structure of profenofos are presented in fig s1 the physicochemical properties of profenofos used in this study were tabulated and presented as table s1 2 3 synthesis of photocatalyst 2 3 1 synthesis of mil fe 53 the mil fe 53 was prepared by mixing of about 10 mmol l 1 of terephthalic acid and 5 mmol l 1 of iron iii chloride in 50 ml of dimethylformamide dmf under magnetic stirring the slurry mixture was then poured into 125 ml teflon lined digester the digester was constantly heated at 150 c overnight for 16 h mil fe 53 solidified with dmf was obtained as a yellow colored powder and it was filtered through 0 2 μm membrane filter for the removal of un reacted dmf the material was further heated to 160 c in open air for quiet long time and cooled to room temperature finally the removal of remnant traces of dmf the suspension were agitated in a large volume of dd water filtered and dried at 60 c on overnight 22 the obtained products were labelled as mof for further treatment 2 3 2 fabrication of hierarchical zgo mof nanohybrid the synthesis of nano zinc oxide zno photocatalyst using sol gel method as described on previous literature 23 simultaneously the graphene oxide go was prepared using natural graphitic powder by hummer s method with slight modifications 24 briefly graphite 1 5 g nano3 1 5 g and h2so4 70 ml was taken in a 500 ml beaker and placed in an ice cold conditions subsequently 9 g of kmno4 was gradually added to the above mixture the mixture was then heated up to 40 c and stirred for 1 h in addition 100 ml of dd water was added and the mixture was reheated to 90 c for not less than 30 min an amount of 300 ml of water was repeatedly added followed by the gradual addition of 10 ml of 30 h2o2 the compound obtained was filtered and washed with 0 1 m hcl and water the suspension were discrete in a water methanol 5 1 combination which were filtered on centrifugation of about 10 000 rpm for 30 min the potable sample was disperse in deionized water and centrifuged at 2500 rpm to obtain highly flaked sheets of go 25 the resultant sheets were collected and dried furthermore the zno and go were taken separately on equimolar ratio 1 2 and then dispersed in water followed by addition of naoh in dropwise manner with vigorous stirring for 2 h the product obtained was filtered and then heated at 100 c in a hot air oven to obtain zno graphene oxide zgo composite about 0 5 g of zgo was taken in a beaker containing ethanol and the solution was stirred under magnetic stirrer subsequently a solution of mil fe 53 was gradually added into the beaker the obtained black colored solution turns brown upon adding causes formation of the zgo mof composite finally the prepared zgo mof nanocomposite was filtered dried and used for further batch studies the overall procedure of as synthesized zgo mof nanocomposite are depicted in scheme s2 2 4 photo activity experiment in the photocatalytic experiments the uv light was applied at a reaction temperature of 25 3 c the catalytic behavior of zgo mof material was estimated on profenofos under uv light irradiation the degradation studies were conducted in a heber multi lamp photo reactor hml lp 44 model for further investigation as described in previous study 26 this paradigm exists of eight average pressurized 8 w mercury vapor lamps placed in parallel discharge wavelength around 365 nm the photo reactor had a reaction cavity with unique designed mirrors that were assembled using gleaming aluminum and a construct with coolant support beneath the foot in addition it consisted of an agitator with magnetic support close to the midpoint a narrow borosilicate glass tube with a diameter and height of 20 mm and 40 cm respectively and with 100 ml volume capacity was used as the reaction container four standard pressurized mercury lamps exposure to radiation was conceded out the effective uv watt power of the lamps on degradation was considered to be 32 w the mixture of zgo mof and pesticide suspension was constantly bubbled with oxygen using motor pump for homogeneous mixing furthermore the investigations were conducted using zgo mof photocatalyst under various trial conditions to examine the synergistic effect of mof and zgo were treated suspension of profenofos in the dark as well as in light conditions to determine the effect of major parameters such as irradiation time catalytic dosage ph initial concentration and light magnitude on chosen pesticides batch experimentation was conducted for further experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 depiction of photocatalyst 3 1 1 ftir analysis the chemical bond structure and functional arrays of zno go and zgo mof were confirmed using ftir spectra analysis and the obtained ftir transmission spectra are shown in fig 1 the spectra showed a band occur at 3465 cm 1 which indicates oh stretching vibrations of adsorbed water molecules underneath the zno surface and the strong transmission band at 440 cm 1 signifies the stretching mode of zno 27 subsequently the go shows main oh breathing vibrations at 3460 cm 1 and c o stretching at 1728 cm 1 corresponds to fused h2o molecules present in between stacked layer of go furthermore the band at 1622 cm 1 corresponds to a strong transmission band at cc stretching while the peaks at 1167 cm 1 and 1051 cm 1 are assigned to co and coc functionality of go 28 for mil fe 53 the wide band at 3435 cm 1 is ascribed to the strong stretching of the oh plane of adsorbed water molecule the high pointed band at 1384 and 1539 cm 1 are assigned to asymmetric ν as co and symmetric ν s co modes accelerating to carboxyl groups that sustain the envelope of di carboxylate ligand linked inside the zgo mof material the obtained peaks at 747 cm 1 was observed due to mode of vibrations stretching to its m o band 29 the above results confirms the successful preparation of zgo mof nanocomposite 3 1 2 xrd pattern of zgo mof composite the x ray powder diffractogram was conducted to determine the crystalline prototype of mil fe 53 and the obtained xrd patterns are shown in fig 2 the diffraction phase of the sample corresponds to the major peaks at 2θ values of 24 52 33 92 37 8 41 82 and 49 18 which were matched to previously reported mil fe 53 phases 30 the spectra of mil fe 53 showed circumstantial and high intensities and they revealed high crystallinity in addition fe2o3 were detected indicating the inclusion of fe on the sample the xrd pattern of zgo mof showed a weak peak at the 2θ value of 24 3 clearly confirming the presence of zno fig 5a the peak value of 42 7 confirms the presence of go on mil fe 53 therefore the prepared nanocomposites have been successfully prepared through hydrothermal synthesis 3 1 3 structural analysis a morphological survey of as synthesized zno nanoparticles shows that the particles were either cylindrical or circular as shown in fig 3 a d mil fe 53 particles shows uniform shaped spherical structure with a mean size of about 6 nm furthermore they exhibits high homogeneity and the pesticide interleaved photocatalyst which is in accordance with preceding reports 30 to obtain further information about the structural changes and particle size of the mil fe 53 samples we conducted tem analysis the high magnification of sample showed uniform prism like structure as observed in fig 3 c d from fig 3 e f it is proved that the size of the mil fe 53 crystals varied in the range 1 3 μm the magnified images shows tiny pseudo octahedral nanoparticles of zno with a size in the range 5 8 nm on a facet of the mil fe 53 solids from fig 3 g the uniform dissemination of zno were observed in the range of 1 3 nm respectively with saed patterns of zgo mof and the particle size distribution of as synthesized material were identified to be 3 9 nm 3 1 4 thermogravimetric investigation the thermal stability of the synthesized catalyst were determined using thermal analysis in the temperature range 40 800 c at a heating rate and tga dta curves obtained are displayed in fig 4 before adsorption and photo degradation all the preprocessed catalysts showed the same weights and their weights after the completion of the analysis were 18 01 15 67 and 14 33 mg below 200 c the catalyst showed inconsequential mass reduction about 5 which could be due to loss of hydro molecules rapid and large loss of matter occurred from 180 to 350 c and it was ascribed to the deterioration of the benzene di carboxylate ligand framework and the release of volatile constituents of the catalyst a slower degradation pace was observed beyond 350 c and no considerable change occurred in the catalyst up to 800 c indicating that the polymeric nanohybrid materials were thermally stable after degradation the catalyst zgo mof composites vary from 350 800 c and it might be elucidated by the putrefaction of physisorbed pesticide molecules from the catalyst in dta the zgo mof composites exhibited a strong exothermic peak on 102 7 c 289 2 c and 431 3 c respectively between the glass transition temperatures and this attributed to evolving heat exothermic of zgo mof nanocomposites 3 1 5 photoluminescence photoluminescence pl spectra showed a strong evidence on recombination rate and photo separation efficiency of the nanocomposite when light was irradiated on the photocatalyst the photogenerated electrons holes were well separated on its surface if the charge carriers were to recombine immediately the pl spectra will show an intense peak 22 the band edge observed for mil fe 53 at about 440 500 nm with a peak band at 485 nm was related to the benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid linkers in mil fe 53 and the band edge was observed in the pl spectra of both mil fe 53 and zgo mof for mil fe 53 two high intensity emission peaks were centered at 454 and 443 nm and the functionalization of mil fe 53 with zgo caused their intensities to decrease the strong quenching of the emission spectra could be ascribed to hindrance of the photogenerated charge carriers moreover the subsequent charge transfer have increased followed by the delocalization of the zgo moiety this concludes that the intensity of the photocatalyst follows the order mil fe 53 zgo mof indicates that the lifetime of electron hole pairs tends to be longer in zgo mof nanocomposite 3 1 6 diffuse reflectance spectroscopy the optical characteristics of a photocatalyst play a vital part in its hetero catalytic activity therefore uv vis drs of the bare mil fe 53 and zgo mof were analyzed in the wavelength ranges from 200 to 800 nm the optical band gap energy of zgo and zgo mof have 3 1 2 9 ev respectively from absorption spectra are depicted in fig 5 the bandgap e g of an indirect gap semiconductor can be determined from the following equation 1 α h ν b h ν e g n where hν is the photon energy α is the absorption coefficient and a is a constant dependent on the substance 31 the equivalent αhν 1 2 α h curves are presented in fig 5 mil fe 53 showed an absorption edge at the wavelength of 463 nm with the load of zgo on mil fe 53 the absorption edge of zgo mof was not transposed the absorbance varied from 450 to 500 nm which increase in contrast to bare zgo this is attributed to the electronic contact between zgo and mil fe 53 thus we could predict that the addition of zgo might result in increase of mof s catalytic activity on controlled reaction 3 1 7 bet surface analysis the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of the sample was determined by the nitrogen n2 adsorption desorption method fig 6 a shows n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of zgo mof fig 6 b displays the bet surface area of zgo mof the bare zno showed surface area and an average pore diameter of 7 3 m2 g 1 and 40 1 nm its pore volume was around 0 0732 cm3 g 1 the facet area pore diameter and pore volume of zgo mof were 63 7 m2 g 1 5 890 nm and 0 093 cm3 g 1 respectively these values are tabulated in table s2 clearly the introduction of mof improved the surface area and pore aperture which has the sum total of potent sites of the material and it is favorable for enhancing the photocatalytic activity 3 1 8 mineralization by chemical oxygen demand the cod deduction rates are implied to pursue the pseudo first order kinetics endure the photocatalytic degradation of pesticides 32 as a prominence the cod assessment could be evaluated using the following equation 2 ln c o d o c o d k c o d t here k cod min 1 is the rate constant of cod removal with respect to time intervals a plot of ln codo cod versus t for the mineralization of profenofos through a collective oxidation scheme at 25 c was constructed and the resultant k cod and r2 values were obtained the r2 values were about 0 95 which confirmed that cod removal by the inter mixing network occurred through a pseudo first order prototype moreover k cod increased by a factor of three similar to the ph which increased from 2 to 5 the mineralization of profenofos at various ph ranges from 3 to 7 were carried out as a result it implies that at ph 5 the maximum mineralization occur at ambient temperature and depicted in fig s3 a 3 1 9 photo degradation of pesticides before irradiation a series of dark adsorption trials for 30 min have been performed to reach equilibrium on adsorption desorption degradation rate typically 50 mg of catalyst on 10 mg l of 50 ml profenofos with 40 min contact time have been fixed as optimized parameters for the pre adsorption process the maximum adsorption efficiencies of zno go and mil fe 53 samples were 10 01 6 25 and 17 43 respectively clearly after the uv irradiation on photocatalyst for 90 min the degradation efficiency of profenofos was improved significantly the activity of single zno go and mil fe 53 displays poor catalytic activity with only 28 31 33 52 and 41 56 of profenofos degradation respectively after combination of zno and go with mil fe 53 the catalytic behavior of the photocatalyst were further improved as compared to other photocatalyst the zgo mof exhibits superior catalytic performance with the degradation efficiency of about 94 the improved photo response of the zgo mof owe to the formation of zgo mof heterojunction which expedite the transmitting and separation of photo induced carriers the inhibition of photo induced electrons recombination rate thus improved the performance of photocatalyst the photocatalytic activity of zgo mof tends to be higher than that of bare catalytic materials such as zno go and mil fe 53 respectively the higher degradation capability of mil fe 53 tends to prove the synergistic effect and ensures the separation of charge carriers in zgo and mil fe 53 these results proves that the zgo mof photocatalyst reveals the higher degradation rate for profenofos removal 3 1 10 effect of uv illumination the intensity of light is considered as a major factor in photocatalytic reactions occur due to e h pairs produced by light energy the uv driven photocatalyst shows quiet attractive techniques in the field of photocatalysis owing to abundant uv rays present in solar light the conversion of light energy into chemical energy the higher photonic energy of uv light is used in most photocatalytic techniques the percentage of removal was tend to display very low for profenofos when they have been irradiate by uv light only the mineralization of selected pesticide using zgo mof in the presence of uv radiation results in stupendous photocatalytic degradation hence further photocatalytic activities were limited to zgo mof alone zgo mof uv the mineralization of profenofos under uv illumination was primarily because of oxidizing behavior of zgo mof the deterioration of profenofos made unchanged below the uv illumination owing to low light adsorption by profenofos at 254 nm wavelength about 42 3 of profenofos was removed through adsorption by zgo mof in the absence of uv irradiation the degradation efficiency of zgo mof were increased up to 73 2 under uv illumination uv illumination enhanced the mineralization of profenofos by 21 2 thus uv radiation of 365 nm have been carried synergistic influence on degradation of profenofos by zgo mof nanocomposite 3 2 effect of batch experiments on adsorption degradation process to accomplish a preface review reveals behavior of the catalyst set of experiments have been switched out by means of a motorized shudder with speed of 150 rpm along with 25 c for 45 min with optimized amount of catalyst the dosage ranges from 0 10 to 1 g in contact with 25 ml of faux processed profenofos stock mixture 10 100 mg l the ph of the suspension was set to about 7 at the beginning of the analysis for different amount of dosage ranges from 0 10 to 1 g the elimination ratio of the pesticide from the liquid solution was determined by calculating the absorbance variation before and after treatment the removal effectiveness of profenofos was obtained from the following eq 3 3 p e r c e n t a g e r e m o v a l c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial pesticide concentration mg l and c t is the final pesticide concentration mg l 3 2 1 effect of exposure time with respective dosage the photocatalytic test have been examined to prove the profenofos from aqueous solution have driven the contact time from 10 to 60 min with 25 ml of sample solution as primal concentration at ph 3 0 5 0 in ambient temperature the reaction substances were trembled systematically by means of an automated agitator at 180 rpm with a quantum mass of the sorbent dose the effect of the exposure time on the adhesion of profenofos to zgo mof composites was studied and it is shown in fig 7 a the influence of the adsorbent dose increased upon changing the quantity of portion and various factors such as adhesion time under room conditions fig 7 a obviously keen out the destruction part where adsorbent dosage increases as the percentage increase and it is well elucidated by improved lively sites the removal percentage increased up to the symmetry phase after which there was no substantial change because of the absence of adsorption sites fig 7 b shows that the degradation of profenofos was optimized as 50 mg of zgo mof photocatalyst the effective degradation increased with an increase in the contact time for the as prepared photocatalyst fig 7 a shows that the optimal time taken for the mineralization of profenofos by the zgo mof hybrid was fixed to 40 min and the complex attained symmetry near 50 min therefore the time required for attaining stability was considered to be 40 min in additional investigations the pace of oxidation of profenofos increased with time indicating that the oxidation route was time dependent the zgo mof showed a higher removal percentage of pf degradation further at the symmetry stage the percentage of oxidation was insignificant and this can be attributed to the dearth of vacant apertures on the adsorbent 3 2 2 influence of ph and initial concentration the catalyst charge influences the amphoteric nature of oxides therefore ph plays an important role in the photo degradation of profenofos the zero point charge of the catalyst was found to be negative in acidic media this result showed that the phosphate center ion of profenofos po4 3 controls at lower ph values below ph 5 3 to examine the ph dependence of the oxidation of profenofos by mil fe 53 at high ph values we investigated the uptake of profenofos as a function of ph the removal efficiency of profenofos in the range ph 1 11 was investigated as shown in fig 8 a as shown in fig 8 b the maximal attained efficiency of mil fe 53 was 94 for the removal of pf at ph 5 furthermore at near ph 7 the removal efficiency decreased due to hard base structure whereas the mil fe 53 is unstable especially when terephthalic acid acts as a nodule mil fe 53 showed higher adsorption ability at ph 5 3 in aqueous solutions containing pesticide this ability is regulated by the organophosphate group which consists of negatively charged ions tends to donate a set of electrons lewis base which firmly combines with fe3 cations lewis acid in the mil fe 53 structure and interacts with the lewis acid base phase additionally coulomb interaction occurs between the pivot positively charged fe3 in mil fe 53 and negatively charged profenofos in the suspension the possible dualistic interactions enhances the pf degradation on zgo mof nanocomposite 3 2 3 impact of co anions on degradation pathway in agro wastewater containing solution the deliquescent inorganic ions are rather simple these molecules ions have attached to the active portion on the surface of photocatalyst and provide anionic or cationic stimulus to photo oxidative degradation of profenofos the common ions present in wastewater are nitrate sulfate bicarbonate and chloride respectively the influence of co ions on photocatalytic mineralization of profenofos by zgo mof was determined and it is displayed in fig 9 these experiments were performed by setting the constituent ratio of co anions as 200 mg l and the primary concentration of profenofos as 100 mg l while remaining all other factors as consistent in photocatalytic schemes the presence of several ions leads to a removal in the oxidation fraction because of the hole scavenging properties of chloride and hydroxyl scavenging effects of so4 2 no3 and hco3 33 the oxidizing species that are important for photocatalytic removal were found to decrease with an increase in co anions such as cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 respectively moreover the active spots on the faces of zgo mof photocatalysts might become congested with these external ions thereby disengaging the catalyst from the pesticide molecules 34 3 3 investigation of kinetics on degradation of profenofos a certain amount of profenofos is removed by zno in dark conditions and 18 of the initial contaminant amount is removed after 30 min of constant churning this substantial decrease results from the adsorption of the pesticide on zno furthermore the oxidation of profenofos increased within 45 min upon irradiation with 254 nm irradiation in the presence of zno various investigational outcomes have shown that the oxidation values of pesticide in the presence of zgo mof photocatalyst have tailored the langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetics prototype 35 according to this prototype the l h kinetics rate outlined in eq 4 4 r d c d t k k c m 1 k c m hence r denotes the rate of initial photocatalytic degradation mol l 1 min 1 c is the concentration of the adsorbent after the degradation step mol l 1 t is the irradiation time min k is the rate constant m is the kinetic order with respect to methyl and k is the l h kinetic constant displays in table s3 therefore k obs represents the rate constant of the pseudo first order min 1 kinetics in our analysis by plotting ln co ct as a function of the period we obtained a conventional line which confirms the pseudo first order kinetics as shown in table s4 fig 10 3 4 photoproduct of profenofos the mineralization and by product formation of profenofos are depicted in fig 11 the profenofos comprises of structural s alkyl phosphorothioate groups the peak describes typical activities conforming to the division of the op bond which is prominent in the equivalent thiono thiolo and phenol isomers the chromatography study showed the design of a photoproduct with m z value of 205 the structure of isomers is related to the mass of the product the by product was formed by the splitting of the et o bond and the other would relate to support oxidation of profenofos the oxidative products formed correspond to the cleavage of the o et alkyl ester bond as creation of analogous photoproducts from organophosphate as photodecomposition the other fragments reveal the de bromination mass the value mentioning that the both redox process were professed with the removal of bromide atom parallel products that could be observed such as m h 331 da by gcms technique as shown in fig s3 furthermore the remove of cl molecules which fragmented pathway from the 4 bcp molecule that were observed in lcms the ring opened structure of n proponal propenthiol etc confirms the profenofos photodegradation 36 it could be further degraded into po4 3 co2 h2o and inorganic salts 3 5 evaluation of mechanistic degradation of profenofos on the basis of above outcomes the photocatalytic process involving in zgo mof catalyst could be explained as shown in fig 12 the photo chemical reaction plays vital role on degradation process which converts light into chemical energy the process of supplying energy to the reaction system has considered as main components of the photosystem when a photons of energy irradiate on photocatalyst to valence band vb at certain wavelength the electronic transition states of electrons excite to conduction band cb this transfer of electrons from one species to another which enhances photo catalytically or photo chemically encourage on chemical transformations the photochemical stimulation of profenofos by photocatalyst can excite electron from vb produces holes h to reductive electron e in cb eq 5 the atmospheric oxygen o2 reacts with excited electrons to form anionic superoxide o2 radicals eq 6 the holes directly oxidize the profenofos or combine with surface water molecules h2o thus producing highly reactive species such as oh and ooh radicals eq 7 9 as a result both oh and o2 radicals eq 10 plays important role on transformation of organic contaminants into their by products such as h2o co2 and inorganic minerals etc according to an earlier survey the cb and vb of zno are 4 05 ev and 7 25 ev 37 since the band gap of go can be regulated in the range of 4 5 ev 5 5 ev 38 the energy stages of zgo mof phase could be conceived as shown in fig 12 uv light irradiation of mil fe 53 produces photo induced e h sets and it might be elevated by radiance caused by the d d transition of fe3 ion on the iron oxo group 39 the energy proportion of graphene tends to be smaller than the cb of zno in such a case the photo generated electrons are transferred to go and the electrons react with the o2 species to form reactive species such as o2 which mineralizes profenofos to carbon dioxide water molecules and other inorganic moiety as indicated by the cod investigation the photogenerated holes can react with oh ions to produce powerful oxidizing species that can be very effective for oxidizing pesticide complexes furthermore the formation of h leads to the organic material being oxidized when the photons radiate in organics on the shallow of the zgo mof hybrids the electrons on the go sheet could not be transferred to the surface of zno which might be distinct the photogenerated species it could reduce the recombination rate and thereby enhance the photocatalytic activity in the zgo mof photocatalytic system the major possible reactions for the degradation of profenofos are displayed as follows 5 10 5 z

photocatalytic degradation of pf were hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 radicals from fig s2 clearly shows the signs of dmpo oh adducts can be detected in the light condition under light illumination the oh adducts can be found on uv irradiation over the zgo mof photocatalyst the results proved that hydroxyl radicals oh plays a prominent role in the effective photodegradation of profenofos under uv irradiation 4 regeneration and reusability studies an examination of the possible restoring and recycling the zgo mof nanocomposite showed the high stability of the photocatalyst it is noted that stupendous stability is superior for restoring zgo mof composite which involves the use of warm water and methanol it was noticed that the synthesized material could oxidize profenofos molecules after third cycles of restoration with suitable solvents and it could remove 91 of profenofos from watery mixtures up to the third run after which its efficiency decreased gradually this is shown in fig 13

in organic salts with the concern of its environmental friendly low cost and benign simple synthesis zgo mof was expected to be a promising choice for applications in wastewater management keywords profenofos zgo mof batch experiments oxidative pathway mechanism 1 introduction pesticides plays a prominent role on ensuring safety by protecting crops from harmful insects and pests in the agricultural fields they are designed to kill pests which could enhance higher crop yields 1 however their effects were not limited to a specific species and they commonly harm or extirpate to other living organisms includes fishes human beings respectively moreover the change in bio diversity reducing nitrogen fixation pollinate inhibition hesitating habitats and majorly threatened to species of wildlife and environment 2 the amount of individual pesticide residue cannot exceed 0 1 μg l 1 while the total amount of pesticides cannot be above 0 5 μg l 1 3 in the present study the profenofos was chosen due to its extensive use water solubility toxicity and potential to contaminate water resources under favorable conditions the profenofos pf belongs to the group of synthetic organo thiophosphate insecticide which primarily used against lepidopteran insects throughout the world the common practice of using pesticides in agriculture for controlling pests in fruits cottons crop and vegetables 4 the toxic nature of pesticide that inhibits cholinesterase enzyme in central nervous system of human beings as well as animals owing to its widespread usage the residues are found in environmental matrices and persist in the environment for long period of time the high toxic nature of pesticide tends to adverse consequences for human beings especially to aquatic life therefore it is imperative to remove profenofos from wastewaters the practice of various techniques necessary for treating an intractable compounds numerous processes are available for pesticides removal which mainly includes photocatalytic degradation 5 photo fenton process 6 biological mineralization 7 aerobic degradation 8 nano filtration 9 membrane process 3 ozonation and adsorption process 10 among other conventional methods the advanced oxidation process aop are increasingly being used for removing organic contaminants due to high efficiency homogeneity good reproducibility and ease of use 5 11 photocatalysis are well known efficient technique for the remediation of environmental pollutants and the catalysts used are non toxic easy to synthesize and low cost notably sunlight can be used as an energy source in this technique 12 the uv vis light induced photocatalytic process are considered to be sustainable method and therefore it has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years photocatalysts are mostly made of semiconductor materials which can be pure doped or heterostructures semiconductor mediated photocatalytic mineralization of pollutants on wastewater occurs through simplistic and economic method among various oxide based semi conductive catalyst zno have been shown to be the most suitable for the photodegradation of organic contaminants owing to its wide bandgap 3 37 ev effective oxidizing power biologically inert non toxic and poses high stability against photochemical corrosion 13 on contrast in lone phases of zno the catalytic degradation reveals a narrow bandgap due to higher recombination rate as well as low separation of photo induced electron hole pairs to overcome this issue a highly surfaced graphene oxide go sheets was intrinsically doped on narrow band zno semiconductor herein the go a atomically thinned sheets of carbon particles or atoms ordered in a honeycomb arrangements 14 and it extends to two magnitude pile of sp2 hybridized carbon with larger surface area theoretical value 2630 m2 g tends to have degrading capability of pollutant 15 it contains a sequence of reactive oxygen functional groups on the sheet surface e g hydroxyl oh epoxide c o c and carboxylic acid coo groups the unique surface functional arrays shows that go a superior solution for doping metal metal oxides 16 furthermore go shows considerably higher photon based catalytic achievements due to the higher electron mobility and stretchy sheet like core 17 to reduce limitations and for enhancing the catalytic performance of go on zno a new type of hybrid network namely metal organic frameworks mofs was used mof s are considered as new type of fused porous coordination polymers and they are constructed by creating strong linking bonds flanked by organic ligands and metal ions 18 furthermore it occurs the possible ligand to metal charge transfer lmct or metal to ligand charge transfer mlct which makes mof materials tends to have higher photocatalytic performance and then it degraded into non toxic pollutant 19 mofs have been investigated and used in a wide range of application including as adsorbents for water treatment 20 compared to a secondary photocatalytic approach the photoactive mof has numerous advantages 1 the heterogeneity of photocatalysts simplifies their reprocessing and reuse 2 the extensible nature of mof synthesis led for adjustable tuning and also coherent pattern of these photocatalysts at the molecular extent and 3 an mof material with high porosity a pore size in the microporous to mesoporous range and finely tunable properties can be obtained by varying the connection of the inorganic part and the type of organic linkers 21 therefore the feasibility of using mof on zgo enhances the catalytic activity for pf were investigated herein we have synthesized a novel zgo mof composite by simple hydrothermal process the prepared nanocomposites were characterized and well explained by ft ir uv vis xrd uv drs sem edx tem tga dta esr pl and bet respectively regeneration studies was also carried out to detect the stability of the photocatalyst moreover the by products formed during degradation were examined using lc ms technique and the mechanism was discussed in detail eventually the zgo mof provides an alternative material for the remediation of organic contaminants in aqueous solutions 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods graphitic powder 150 200 mesh was acquired from merck germany and 1 4 benzenedicarboxylic acid terephthalate was supplied by sigma aldrich mumbai

mart in dindigul tamil nadu india systematic grade chemicals such as n n dimethylformamide dmf hydrogen peroxide h2o2 sulfuric acid h2so4 hydrochloric acid hcl ethanol c2h5oh sodium nitrate nano3 and potassium permanganate kmno4 were acquired from merck germany and used without further refinement the test solutions were inclined by using double distilled dd water for preparing pesticide samples the ph modification can be adjusted by using solutions of 0 1 m naoh hcl the various analytical techniques were investigated for the as prepared samples and explained in detailed supplementary material 2 2 stock preparation a stock of 1000 mg l 1 profenofos was taken in a beaker for dissolution in an aqueous medium the solutions with various strength ranges from 10 to 100 mg l 1 were prepared using double distilled dd water different concentrations of various scavengers such as isopropanol tert butanol and h2o2 were added to solution containing catalyst to observe their effect on oxidation of profenofos under uv light radiation the chemical structure of profenofos are presented in fig s1 the physicochemical properties of profenofos used in this study were tabulated and presented as table s1 2 3 synthesis of photocatalyst 2 3 1 synthesis of mil fe 53 the mil fe 53 was prepared by mixing of about 10 mmol l 1 of terephthalic acid and 5 mmol l 1 of iron iii chloride in 50 ml of dimethylformamide dmf under magnetic stirring the slurry mixture was then poured into 125 ml teflon lined digester the digester was constantly heated at 150 c overnight for 16 h mil fe 53 solidified with dmf was obtained as a yellow colored powder and it was filtered through 0 2 μm membrane filter for the removal of un reacted dmf the material was further heated to 160 c in open air for quiet long time and cooled to room temperature finally the removal of remnant traces of dmf the suspension were agitated in a large volume of dd water filtered and dried at 60 c on overnight 22 the obtained products were labelled as mof for further treatment 2 3 2 fabrication of hierarchical zgo mof nanohybrid the synthesis of nano zinc oxide zno photocatalyst using sol gel method as described on previous literature 23 simultaneously the graphene oxide go was prepared using natural graphitic powder by hummer s method with slight modifications 24 briefly graphite 1 5 g nano3 1 5 g and h2so4 70 ml was taken in a 500 ml beaker and placed in an ice cold conditions subsequently 9 g of kmno4 was gradually added to the above mixture the mixture was then heated up to 40 c and stirred for 1 h in addition 100 ml of dd water was added and the mixture was reheated to 90 c for not less than 30 min an amount of 300 ml of water was repeatedly added followed by the gradual addition of 10 ml of 30 h2o2 the compound obtained was filtered and washed with 0 1 m hcl and water the suspension were discrete in a water methanol 5 1 combination which were filtered on centrifugation of about 10 000 rpm for 30 min the potable sample was disperse in deionized water and centrifuged at 2500 rpm to obtain highly flaked sheets of go 25 the resultant sheets were collected and dried furthermore the zno and go were taken separately on equimolar ratio 1 2 and then dispersed in water followed by addition of naoh in dropwise manner with vigorous stirring for 2 h the product obtained was filtered and then heated at 100 c in a hot air oven to obtain zno graphene oxide zgo composite about 0 5 g of zgo was taken in a beaker containing ethanol and the solution was stirred under magnetic stirrer subsequently a solution of mil fe 53 was gradually added into the beaker the obtained black colored solution turns brown upon adding causes formation of the zgo mof composite finally the prepared zgo mof nanocomposite was filtered dried and used for further batch studies the overall procedure of as synthesized zgo mof nanocomposite are depicted in scheme s2 2 4 photo activity experiment in the photocatalytic experiments the uv light was applied at a reaction temperature of 25 3 c the catalytic behavior of zgo mof material was estimated on profenofos under uv light irradiation the degradation studies were conducted in a heber multi lamp photo reactor hml lp 44 model for further investigation as described in previous study 26 this paradigm exists of eight average pressurized 8 w mercury vapor lamps placed in parallel discharge wavelength around 365 nm the photo reactor had a reaction cavity with unique designed mirrors that were assembled using gleaming aluminum and a construct with coolant support beneath the foot in addition it consisted of an agitator with magnetic support close to the midpoint a narrow borosilicate glass tube with a diameter and height of 20 mm and 40 cm respectively and with 100 ml volume capacity was used as the reaction container four standard pressurized mercury lamps exposure to radiation was conceded out the effective uv watt power of the lamps on degradation was considered to be 32 w the mixture of zgo mof and pesticide suspension was constantly bubbled with oxygen using motor pump for homogeneous mixing furthermore the investigations were conducted using zgo mof photocatalyst under various trial conditions to examine the synergistic effect of mof and zgo were treated suspension of profenofos in the dark as well as in light conditions to determine the effect of major parameters such as irradiation time catalytic dosage ph initial concentration and light magnitude on chosen pesticides batch experimentation was conducted for further experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 depiction of photocatalyst 3 1 1 ftir analysis the chemical bond structure and functional arrays of zno go and zgo mof were confirmed using ftir spectra analysis and the obtained ftir transmission spectra are shown in fig 1 the spectra showed a band occur at 3465 cm 1 which indicates oh stretching vibrations of adsorbed water molecules underneath the zno surface and the strong transmission band at 440 cm 1 signifies the stretching mode of zno 27 subsequently the go shows main oh breathing vibrations at 3460 cm 1 and c o stretching at 1728 cm 1 corresponds to fused h2o molecules present in between stacked layer of go furthermore the band at 1622 cm 1 corresponds to a strong transmission band at cc stretching while the peaks at 1167 cm 1 and 1051 cm 1 are assigned to co and coc functionality of go 28 for mil fe 53 the wide band at 3435 cm 1 is ascribed to the strong stretching of the oh plane of adsorbed water molecule the high pointed band at 1384 and 1539 cm 1 are assigned to asymmetric ν as co and symmetric ν s co modes accelerating to carboxyl groups that sustain the envelope of di carboxylate ligand linked inside the zgo mof material the obtained peaks at 747 cm 1 was observed due to mode of vibrations stretching to its m o band 29 the above results confirms the successful preparation of zgo mof nanocomposite 3 1 2 xrd pattern of zgo mof composite the x ray powder diffractogram was conducted to determine the crystalline prototype of mil fe 53 and the obtained xrd patterns are shown in fig 2 the diffraction phase of the sample corresponds to the major peaks at 2θ values of 24 52 33 92 37 8 41 82 and 49 18 which were matched to previously reported mil fe 53 phases 30 the spectra of mil fe 53 showed circumstantial and high intensities and they revealed high crystallinity in addition fe2o3 were detected indicating the inclusion of fe on the sample the xrd pattern of zgo mof showed a weak peak at the 2θ value of 24 3 clearly confirming the presence of zno fig 5a the peak value of 42 7 confirms the presence of go on mil fe 53 therefore the prepared nanocomposites have been successfully prepared through hydrothermal synthesis 3 1 3 structural analysis a morphological survey of as synthesized zno nanoparticles shows that the particles were either cylindrical or circular as shown in fig 3 a d mil fe 53 particles shows uniform shaped spherical structure with a mean size of about 6 nm furthermore they exhibits high homogeneity and the pesticide interleaved photocatalyst which is in accordance with preceding reports 30 to obtain further information about the structural changes and particle size of the mil fe 53 samples we conducted tem analysis the high magnification of sample showed uniform prism like structure as observed in fig 3 c d from fig 3 e f it is proved that the size of the mil fe 53 crystals varied in the range 1 3 μm the magnified images shows tiny pseudo octahedral nanoparticles of zno with a size in the range 5 8 nm on a facet of the mil fe 53 solids from fig 3 g the uniform dissemination of zno were observed in the range of 1 3 nm respectively with saed patterns of zgo mof and the particle size distribution of as synthesized material were identified to be 3 9 nm 3 1 4 thermogravimetric investigation the thermal stability of the synthesized catalyst were determined using thermal analysis in the temperature range 40 800 c at a heating rate and tga dta curves obtained are displayed in fig 4 before adsorption and photo degradation all the preprocessed catalysts showed the same weights and their weights after the completion of the analysis were 18 01 15 67 and 14 33 mg below 200 c the catalyst showed inconsequential mass reduction about 5 which could be due to loss of hydro molecules rapid and large loss of matter occurred from 180 to 350 c and it was ascribed to the deterioration of the benzene di carboxylate ligand framework and the release of volatile constituents of the catalyst a slower degradation pace was observed beyond 350 c and no considerable change occurred in the catalyst up to 800 c indicating that the polymeric nanohybrid materials were thermally stable after degradation the catalyst zgo mof composites vary from 350 800 c and it might be elucidated by the putrefaction of physisorbed pesticide molecules from the catalyst in dta the zgo mof composites exhibited a strong exothermic peak on 102 7 c 289 2 c and 431 3 c respectively between the glass transition temperatures and this attributed to evolving heat exothermic of zgo mof nanocomposites 3 1 5 photoluminescence photoluminescence pl spectra showed a strong evidence on recombination rate and photo separation efficiency of the nanocomposite when light was irradiated on the photocatalyst the photogenerated electrons holes were well separated on its surface if the charge carriers were to recombine immediately the pl spectra will show an intense peak 22 the band edge observed for mil fe 53 at about 440 500 nm with a peak band at 485 nm was related to the benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid linkers in mil fe 53 and the band edge was observed in the pl spectra of both mil fe 53 and zgo mof for mil fe 53 two high intensity emission peaks were centered at 454 and 443 nm and the functionalization of mil fe 53 with zgo caused their intensities to decrease the strong quenching of the emission spectra could be ascribed to hindrance of the photogenerated charge carriers moreover the subsequent charge transfer have increased followed by the delocalization of the zgo moiety this concludes that the intensity of the photocatalyst follows the order mil fe 53 zgo mof indicates that the lifetime of electron hole pairs tends to be longer in zgo mof nanocomposite 3 1 6 diffuse reflectance spectroscopy the optical characteristics of a photocatalyst play a vital part in its hetero catalytic activity therefore uv vis drs of the bare mil fe 53 and zgo mof were analyzed in the wavelength ranges from 200 to 800 nm the optical band gap energy of zgo and zgo mof have 3 1 2 9 ev respectively from absorption spectra are depicted in fig 5 the bandgap e g of an indirect gap semiconductor can be determined from the following equation 1 α h ν b h ν e g n where hν is the photon energy α is the absorption coefficient and a is a constant dependent on the substance 31 the equivalent αhν 1 2 α h curves are presented in fig 5 mil fe 53 showed an absorption edge at the wavelength of 463 nm with the load of zgo on mil fe 53 the absorption edge of zgo mof was not transposed the absorbance varied from 450 to 500 nm which increase in contrast to bare zgo this is attributed to the electronic contact between zgo and mil fe 53 thus we could predict that the addition of zgo might result in increase of mof s catalytic activity on controlled reaction 3 1 7 bet surface analysis the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of the sample was determined by the nitrogen n2 adsorption desorption method fig 6 a shows n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of zgo mof fig 6 b displays the bet surface area of zgo mof the bare zno showed surface area and an average pore diameter of 7 3 m2 g 1 and 40 1 nm its pore volume was around 0 0732 cm3 g 1 the facet area pore diameter and pore volume of zgo mof were 63 7 m2 g 1 5 890 nm and 0 093 cm3 g 1 respectively these values are tabulated in table s2 clearly the introduction of mof improved the surface area and pore aperture which has the sum total of potent sites of the material and it is favorable for enhancing the photocatalytic activity 3 1 8 mineralization by chemical oxygen demand the cod deduction rates are implied to pursue the pseudo first order kinetics endure the photocatalytic degradation of pesticides 32 as a prominence the cod assessment could be evaluated using the following equation 2 ln c o d o c o d k c o d t here k cod min 1 is the rate constant of cod removal with respect to time intervals a plot of ln codo cod versus t for the mineralization of profenofos through a collective oxidation scheme at 25 c was constructed and the resultant k cod and r2 values were obtained the r2 values were about 0 95 which confirmed that cod removal by the inter mixing network occurred through a pseudo first order prototype moreover k cod increased by a factor of three similar to the ph which increased from 2 to 5 the mineralization of profenofos at various ph ranges from 3 to 7 were carried out as a result it implies that at ph 5 the maximum mineralization occur at ambient temperature and depicted in fig s3 a 3 1 9 photo degradation of pesticides before irradiation a series of dark adsorption trials for 30 min have been performed to reach equilibrium on adsorption desorption degradation rate typically 50 mg of catalyst on 10 mg l of 50 ml profenofos with 40 min contact time have been fixed as optimized parameters for the pre adsorption process the maximum adsorption efficiencies of zno go and mil fe 53 samples were 10 01 6 25 and 17 43 respectively clearly after the uv irradiation on photocatalyst for 90 min the degradation efficiency of profenofos was improved significantly the activity of single zno go and mil fe 53 displays poor catalytic activity with only 28 31 33 52 and 41 56 of profenofos degradation respectively after combination of zno and go with mil fe 53 the catalytic behavior of the photocatalyst were further improved as compared to other photocatalyst the zgo mof exhibits superior catalytic performance with the degradation efficiency of about 94 the improved photo response of the zgo mof owe to the formation of zgo mof heterojunction which expedite the transmitting and separation of photo induced carriers the inhibition of photo induced electrons recombination rate thus improved the performance of photocatalyst the photocatalytic activity of zgo mof tends to be higher than that of bare catalytic materials such as zno go and mil fe 53 respectively the higher degradation capability of mil fe 53 tends to prove the synergistic effect and ensures the separation of charge carriers in zgo and mil fe 53 these results proves that the zgo mof photocatalyst reveals the higher degradation rate for profenofos removal 3 1 10 effect of uv illumination the intensity of light is considered as a major factor in photocatalytic reactions occur due to e h pairs produced by light energy the uv driven photocatalyst shows quiet attractive techniques in the field of photocatalysis owing to abundant uv rays present in solar light the conversion of light energy into chemical energy the higher photonic energy of uv light is used in most photocatalytic techniques the percentage of removal was tend to display very low for profenofos when they have been irradiate by uv light only the mineralization of selected pesticide using zgo mof in the presence of uv radiation results in stupendous photocatalytic degradation hence further photocatalytic activities were limited to zgo mof alone zgo mof uv the mineralization of profenofos under uv illumination was primarily because of oxidizing behavior of zgo mof the deterioration of profenofos made unchanged below the uv illumination owing to low light adsorption by profenofos at 254 nm wavelength about 42 3 of profenofos was removed through adsorption by zgo mof in the absence of uv irradiation the degradation efficiency of zgo mof were increased up to 73 2 under uv illumination uv illumination enhanced the mineralization of profenofos by 21 2 thus uv radiation of 365 nm have been carried synergistic influence on degradation of profenofos by zgo mof nanocomposite 3 2 effect of batch experiments on adsorption degradation process to accomplish a preface review reveals behavior of the catalyst set of experiments have been switched out by means of a motorized shudder with speed of 150 rpm along with 25 c for 45 min with optimized amount of catalyst the dosage ranges from 0 10 to 1 g in contact with 25 ml of faux processed profenofos stock mixture 10 100 mg l the ph of the suspension was set to about 7 at the beginning of the analysis for different amount of dosage ranges from 0 10 to 1 g the elimination ratio of the pesticide from the liquid solution was determined by calculating the absorbance variation before and after treatment the removal effectiveness of profenofos was obtained from the following eq 3 3 p e r c e n t a g e r e m o v a l c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial pesticide concentration mg l and c t is the final pesticide concentration mg l 3 2 1 effect of exposure time with respective dosage the photocatalytic test have been examined to prove the profenofos from aqueous solution have driven the contact time from 10 to 60 min with 25 ml of sample solution as primal concentration at ph 3 0 5 0 in ambient temperature the reaction substances were trembled systematically by means of an automated agitator at 180 rpm with a quantum mass of the sorbent dose the effect of the exposure time on the adhesion of profenofos to zgo mof composites was studied and it is shown in fig 7 a the influence of the adsorbent dose increased upon changing the quantity of portion and various factors such as adhesion time under room conditions fig 7 a obviously keen out the destruction part where adsorbent dosage increases as the percentage increase and it is well elucidated by improved lively sites the removal percentage increased up to the symmetry phase after which there was no substantial change because of the absence of adsorption sites fig 7 b shows that the degradation of profenofos was optimized as 50 mg of zgo mof photocatalyst the effective degradation increased with an increase in the contact time for the as prepared photocatalyst fig 7 a shows that the optimal time taken for the mineralization of profenofos by the zgo mof hybrid was fixed to 40 min and the complex attained symmetry near 50 min therefore the time required for attaining stability was considered to be 40 min in additional investigations the pace of oxidation of profenofos increased with time indicating that the oxidation route was time dependent the zgo mof showed a higher removal percentage of pf degradation further at the symmetry stage the percentage of oxidation was insignificant and this can be attributed to the dearth of vacant apertures on the adsorbent 3 2 2 influence of ph and initial concentration the catalyst charge influences the amphoteric nature of oxides therefore ph plays an important role in the photo degradation of profenofos the zero point charge of the catalyst was found to be negative in acidic media this result showed that the phosphate center ion of profenofos po4 3 controls at lower ph values below ph 5 3 to examine the ph dependence of the oxidation of profenofos by mil fe 53 at high ph values we investigated the uptake of profenofos as a function of ph the removal efficiency of profenofos in the range ph 1 11 was investigated as shown in fig 8 a as shown in fig 8 b the maximal attained efficiency of mil fe 53 was 94 for the removal of pf at ph 5 furthermore at near ph 7 the removal efficiency decreased due to hard base structure whereas the mil fe 53 is unstable especially when terephthalic acid acts as a nodule mil fe 53 showed higher adsorption ability at ph 5 3 in aqueous solutions containing pesticide this ability is regulated by the organophosphate group which consists of negatively charged ions tends to donate a set of electrons lewis base which firmly combines with fe3 cations lewis acid in the mil fe 53 structure and interacts with the lewis acid base phase additionally coulomb interaction occurs between the pivot positively charged fe3 in mil fe 53 and negatively charged profenofos in the suspension the possible dualistic interactions enhances the pf degradation on zgo mof nanocomposite 3 2 3 impact of co anions on degradation pathway in agro wastewater containing solution the deliquescent inorganic ions are rather simple these molecules ions have attached to the active portion on the surface of photocatalyst and provide anionic or cationic stimulus to photo oxidative degradation of profenofos the common ions present in wastewater are nitrate sulfate bicarbonate and chloride respectively the influence of co ions on photocatalytic mineralization of profenofos by zgo mof was determined and it is displayed in fig 9 these experiments were performed by setting the constituent ratio of co anions as 200 mg l and the primary concentration of profenofos as 100 mg l while remaining all other factors as consistent in photocatalytic schemes the presence of several ions leads to a removal in the oxidation fraction because of the hole scavenging properties of chloride and hydroxyl scavenging effects of so4 2 no3 and hco3 33 the oxidizing species that are important for photocatalytic removal were found to decrease with an increase in co anions such as cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 respectively moreover the active spots on the faces of zgo mof photocatalysts might become congested with these external ions thereby disengaging the catalyst from the pesticide molecules 34 3 3 investigation of kinetics on degradation of profenofos a certain amount of profenofos is removed by zno in dark conditions and 18 of the initial contaminant amount is removed after 30 min of constant churning this substantial decrease results from the adsorption of the pesticide on zno furthermore the oxidation of profenofos increased within 45 min upon irradiation with 254 nm irradiation in the presence of zno various investigational outcomes have shown that the oxidation values of pesticide in the presence of zgo mof photocatalyst have tailored the langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetics prototype 35 according to this prototype the l h kinetics rate outlined in eq 4 4 r d c d t k k c m 1 k c m hence r denotes the rate of initial photocatalytic degradation mol l 1 min 1 c is the concentration of the adsorbent after the degradation step mol l 1 t is the irradiation time min k is the rate constant m is the kinetic order with respect to methyl and k is the l h kinetic constant displays in table s3 therefore k obs represents the rate constant of the pseudo first order min 1 kinetics in our analysis by plotting ln co ct as a function of the period we obtained a conventional line which confirms the pseudo first order kinetics as shown in table s4 fig 10 3 4 photoproduct of profenofos the mineralization and by product formation of profenofos are depicted in fig 11 the profenofos comprises of structural s alkyl phosphorothioate groups the peak describes typical activities conforming to the division of the op bond which is prominent in the equivalent thiono thiolo and phenol isomers the chromatography study showed the design of a photoproduct with m z value of 205 the structure of isomers is related to the mass of the product the by product was formed by the splitting of the et o bond and the other would relate to support oxidation of profenofos the oxidative products formed correspond to the cleavage of the o et alkyl ester bond as creation of analogous photoproducts from organophosphate as photodecomposition the other fragments reveal the de bromination mass the value mentioning that the both redox process were professed with the removal of bromide atom parallel products that could be observed such as m h 331 da by gcms technique as shown in fig s3 furthermore the remove of cl molecules which fragmented pathway from the 4 bcp molecule that were observed in lcms the ring opened structure of n proponal propenthiol etc confirms the profenofos photodegradation 36 it could be further degraded into po4 3 co2 h2o and inorganic salts 3 5 evaluation of mechanistic degradation of profenofos on the basis of above outcomes the photocatalytic process involving in zgo mof catalyst could be explained as shown in fig 12 the photo chemical reaction plays vital role on degradation process which converts light into chemical energy the process of supplying energy to the reaction system has considered as main components of the photosystem when a photons of energy irradiate on photocatalyst to valence band vb at certain wavelength the electronic transition states of electrons excite to conduction band cb this transfer of electrons from one species to another which enhances photo catalytically or photo chemically encourage on chemical transformations the photochemical stimulation of profenofos by photocatalyst can excite electron from vb produces holes h to reductive electron e in cb eq 5 the atmospheric oxygen o2 reacts with excited electrons to form anionic superoxide o2 radicals eq 6 the holes directly oxidize the profenofos or combine with surface water molecules h2o thus producing highly reactive species such as oh and ooh radicals eq 7 9 as a result both oh and o2 radicals eq 10 plays important role on transformation of organic contaminants into their by products such as h2o co2 and inorganic minerals etc according to an earlier survey the cb and vb of zno are 4 05 ev and 7 25 ev 37 since the band gap of go can be regulated in the range of 4 5 ev 5 5 ev 38 the energy stages of zgo mof phase could be conceived as shown in fig 12 uv light irradiation of mil fe 53 produces photo induced e h sets and it might be elevated by radiance caused by the d d transition of fe3 ion on the iron oxo group 39 the energy proportion of graphene tends to be smaller than the cb of zno in such a case the photo generated electrons are transferred to go and the electrons react with the o2 species to form reactive species such as o2 which mineralizes profenofos to carbon dioxide water molecules and other inorganic moiety as indicated by the cod investigation the photogenerated holes can react with oh ions to produce powerful oxidizing species that can be very effective for oxidizing pesticide complexes furthermore the formation of h leads to the organic material being oxidized when the photons radiate in organics on the shallow of the zgo mof hybrids the electrons on the go sheet could not be transferred to the surface of zno which might be distinct the photogenerated species it could reduce the recombination rate and thereby enhance the photocatalytic activity in the zgo mof photocatalytic system the major possible reactions for the degradation of profenofos are displayed as follows 5 10 5 z

photocatalytic degradation of pf were hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 radicals from fig s2 clearly shows the signs of dmpo oh adducts can be detected in the light condition under light illumination the oh adducts can be found on uv irradiation over the zgo mof photocatalyst the results proved that hydroxyl radicals oh plays a prominent role in the effective photodegradation of profenofos under uv irradiation 4 regeneration and reusability studies an examination of the possible restoring and recycling the zgo mof nanocomposite showed the high stability of the photocatalyst it is noted that stupendous stability is superior for restoring zgo mof composite which involves the use of warm water and methanol it was noticed that the synthesized material could oxidize profenofos molecules after third cycles of restoration with suitable solvents and it could remove 91 of profenofos from watery mixtures up to the third run after which its efficiency decreased gradually this is shown in fig 13 comparative studies on degradation of profenofos by different nanocomposites involved in the removal process as tabulated in table 1 5 conclusions a new type crumpled paddy shaped zno coated graphene

13724,dichlorvos or 2 2 dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate ddvp is a chlorinated organophosphorus pesticide which is frequently detected in the aqueous environment in this study an environmentally friendly and highly efficient oxidant i e sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 was introduced to an ozonation process for the degradation of dichlorvos ddvp experimental results revealed an enhancement of ddvp degradation efficiency via the o3 spc process compared with o3 alone due to the generation of reactive species oh and co3 under various conditions both processes fitted the pseudo first order kinetic model and the reaction rate constant of the o3 spc process under low spc dosage 30 mg l 1 was more than two times higher than for o3 alone the ddvp removal performance was evaluated in terms of initial ph o3 dosage spc dosage and water matrix the ph played a significant role in ddvp degradation during the o3 spc process especially on the occurrence of the different types of reactive species based on radical scavenger experiments oh were observed over the full ph range but dominated under neutral and alkaline conditions while less oxidative co3 emerged at lower ph furthermore the complex matrix of real wastewater inhibited the oxidation process due to the competition for oxidative species between organic matter and ddvp a modified kinetic model based on a steady state hypothesis was established to predict ddvp degradation via the o3 spc treatment and provided a fair result under different conditions this observation suggested that eco friendly spc could be considered as a promising alternative for h2o2 in developing sustainable ozone based oxidation processes for recalcitrant compounds elimination in wastewater treatment keywords ddvp o3 spc advanced oxidation process degradation kinetics sustainability 1 introduction the widespread use of pesticides has resulted in the release of these substances into the environment and has caused serious toxic effects on humans and other organisms 1 2 there are growing concerns that pesticide residues can highly affect human health and for example lead to an increase in some types of cancer and birth defects 3 previous studies have put forward that about 220 000 deaths occur each year in the developing world because of exposure to pesticides 4 furthermore it is well known that pesticides pose a risk to fish and other aquatic species 3 one of the pesticide groups often used is organophosphorus pesticides which is traditionally employed in agriculture animal production and even in households 5 6 because of their potential risks to human and animal health the organophosphorus pesticides have been classified as priority substances by the eu directive 2013 39 eu which means that special measures should be taken to monitor and remove these compounds from the polluted water and wastewater 7 8 dichlorvos 2 2 dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate ddvp a chlorinated organophosphorus pesticide is widely used as an insecticide in food storage areas for household protection and in outdoor areas e g liquid spray 5 9 despite very low concentrations of ddvp in water resources its residues pose serious risks to human and environmental health especially under unknown long term effects 4 examples from the international agency for research on cancer iarc suggest that acute exposure to ddvp may cause breathing problems and nervous system cell metabolic disorders 10 moreover chronic exposure to ddvp has been observed to cause liver and other body organs malfunction 11 additionally surveys such as the one conducted by aimer et al 12 have shown that ddvp is highly toxic to fish birds and honeybees in view of the reasons above ddvp is regarded as an extremely hazardous compound by the world health organization who and the use of ddvp was restricted for agricultural use across european union countries starting from 2012 5 however ddvp is still massively applied for managing pests in many developing countries 3 due to its extensive use and residues in a lot of products ddvp has been widely detected in surface water worldwide with concentrations ranging from 1 4 to 5630 ng l 1 9 therefore research on effective and environmentally friendly treatment approaches for eliminating ddvp from water and wastewater is highly welcome among various physicochemical and biological methods developed so far to deal with the polluted water and wastewater conventional biodegradation processes are not efficient enough for purifying wastewater containing ddvp due to its toxic effects on the microorganisms which are responsible for the decomposition of organic compounds 13 other approaches such as coagulation flocculation are also not effective for ddvp elimination achieving less than 30 removal efficiency 14 a promising alternative to deal with these issues and to remove recalcitrant pesticides from polluted water is advanced oxidation processes aops 15 existing research has shown that ozonation exhibits great potential for the degradation of various organic compounds 7 16 a unique property of ozone is its partial decomposition in water to yield hydroxyl radicals oh oh is a non selective oxidative species with an extraordinary oxidation capacity extensive research has indicated that the oxidation of various pollutants via oh has a faster reaction rate and stronger mineralization ability compared to the direct oxidation with molecular ozone 12 however the extent of ozone dissociation into oh depends on the ph of the medium 17 i e only at alkaline conditions an extensive generation of oh takes place to overcome this disadvantage various hybrid ozone based aops have been developed to enhance the generation of oh radicals including o3 uv 18 o3 catalyst 19 o3 persulfate 20 o3 hydroxylamine 21 and o3 h2o2 16 for example both heterogeneous catalytic ozonation using tio2 19 α feooh 22 or activated carbon 23 as catalysts and homogeneous catalytic ozonation applying mn2 24 or fe2 25 have been characterized with oh generation to achieve high performance in organic pollutants degradation qiao et al 20 and qin et al 21 reported that the combination of ozone and persulfate or hydroxylamine results in the generation of oh as well as so4 or nh2oo respectively whereas the degradation efficiency for ddvp was high for these processes the complex separation of the catalyst or the secondary pollution from the additive are major disadvantages as a consequence some researchers pay more attention to the application of o3 h2o2 peroxone peroxone is the most practical way of upgrading current ozonation processes to an aop system on one side it is only necessary to add h2o2 which is a relatively green reagent to promote the formation of oh eqs 1 4 26 on the other side the oh yield for the peroxone process is approximately 50 which is the highest between ozone based processes 27 1 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 3 h o 2 h o 5 3 h o 5 h o 2 o 3 4 o 3 h 2 o o 2 o h o h from a sustainability point of view a method needs to be efficient cost effective environmentally friendly and easy to use to be able to be transferred from lab scales to real scale applications in this regard the peroxone process has the disadvantage that it is difficult to use store and transport concentrated h2o2 sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 which is an environmentally friendly reagent with strong oxidation potential 1 8 ev has been employed as an alternative for h2o2 in peroxone aops 26 28 as a source of solid h2o2 spc has more advantages than the traditional h2o2 solution because it is stable safe non toxic and easy to handle 28 recently spc has been regarded as a substitute and widely applied for the degradation of different organic pollutants in fenton or fenton like oxidation uv and ultrasound related aops 14 29 its application in combination with ozonation however has seldom been studied in detail before this study presents the effect of various experimental parameters ph ozone dosage and spc dosage on the degradation efficiency and the kinetics of ddvp via o3 spc oxidation furthermore the presence of reactive species and the influence of matrix components present in the water on the process efficiency were investigated additionally a modified kinetic model was built to predict the ddvp degradation via the o3 spc process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dichlorvos ddvp c4h7cl2o4p analytical standard and sodium percarbonate na2co3 1 5h2o2 avail h2o2 20 30 were purchased from sigma aldrich

further purification all solutions were prepared using milli q ultra pure water millipore usa secondary effluent was collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant of aquafin mechelen noord belgium the collected water was filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size filter before use in the experiments 2 2 ozonation procedure the ddvp degradation tests were conducted in a cylindrical glass reactor with an internal diameter of 9 3 cm and a height of 24 cm 500 ml ddvp solution was added to the reactor a schematic of the experimental set up is presented in fig s1 see the supplementary materials ozone was produced by an ozone generator com ad 02 anseros with a maximum ozone production rate of 10 g h 1 and introduced to the solution by a stainless steel diffuser pore size 5 μm brouwland belgium the reaction mixture was continuously stirred magnetically and a water jacket surrounding the reactor guaranteed a constant reaction temperature 22 c ozone off gas was monitored by an ozone analyzer m465 teledyne the initial ph of the solutions was adjusted with 0 1 m naoh or h2so4 in a typical process 500 ml ddvp solution 4 0 mg l 1 containing 30 mg l 1 spc was transferred to the reactor and adjusted to the corresponding ph under continuous stirring produced ozone gas was bubbled through the solution via the diffusor at a concentration of 4 21 mg l 1 sampling was performed at regular time intervals and the samples taken were immediately quenched by adding excess na2s2o3 the same procedure was conducted at different conditions varying ozone dosage spc dosage and ph all experiments were performed at least in duplicate and average values are reported 2 3 analytical methods the ddvp was separated and detected using an hplc system agilent 1100 with a g1314a uv detector the separation was achieved on an agilent eclipse plus c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm the column temperature was kept at 30 c using the thermostatic compartment the mobile phase consisted of ultrapure water a and acetonitrile b with the gradient elution program of a b v v from 60 40 to 55 45 for the first 7 min then maintaining the ratio at 55 45 for 1 min at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the injection volume was 50 μl and the detector wavelength was set at 205 nm toc values were determined by a toc l analyzer tnm l rohs shimadzo japan cod was measured by cod cuvettes 15 150 mg l 1 o2 hach belgium 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of ddvp via o3 spc process the ddvp degradation efficiency was evaluated and compared for spc alone o3 alone o3 spc and o3 h2o2 processes as depicted in fig 1 the combination of o3 and spc showed synergistic effects on ddvp degradation the ddvp degradation by the direct spc process was negligible 2 specifically the ddvp concentration decreased by approximately 86 5 after 10 min in the o3 process while the decrease was 99 5 in combination with spc for the same reaction time when combining o3 with h2o2 in the same concentration a much lower improvement of the o3 alone treatment was observed showing a decrease in the concentration of 91 9 after a 10 min reaction time these results are consistent with previous research on ddvp degradation by ozonation in which a complete degradation of ddvp was observed for an o3 dosage of 6 mg l 1 and at ph 7 26 it has been reported that ddvp reacted mildly with molecular ozone but reacted fast with hydroxyl radicals with a rate constant of 1 2 1011 m 1 min 1 9 this can be the explanation for the high degradation efficiency obtained for the combined o3 spc process as will be discussed in section 3 3 in addition the inserted figure shows that toc removal after 20 min in o3 alone and o3 spc processes were 21 7 and 58 3 respectively which confirms that the presence of spc during ozonation significantly enhances the mineralization process pseudo first order kinetics for ozone based oxidation were previously reported 30 the pseudo first order kinetic model was verified and confirmed by fitting the experimental data as described in eq 5 5 d d d v p t d t k o b s d d v p t integration of eq 5 could be transferred into eq 6 6 l n d d v p t d d v p 0 k o b s t where ddvp t is the ddvp concentration measured at treatment time t min ddvp 0 is the initial ddvp concentration and kobs is the observed reaction rate constant min 1 the pseudo first order rate constants kobs can be calculated as the slope of fitted linear regression as shown in fig 1 b the degradation kinetics of the ddvp under o3 alone o3 spc and o3 h2o2 followed the pseudo first order model with kobs values of 0 274 0 513 and 0 252 min 1 respectively confirming the validity of the pseudo first order kinetic model 3 2 effects of operational parameters in o3 spc process 3 2 1 effect of ozone dosage it is seen in fig s2 that the ddvp degradation considerably increased with increasing the ozone concentration in the gas introduced in the reactor from 1 65 to 8 71 mg l 1 this trend was confirmed for both the o3 spc and o3 alone systems such observations are explained by the increase in o3 partial pressure in the gas phase with higher inlet o3 concentration improving o3 transfer to the liquid and resulting in a higher dissolved o3 concentration 21 in addition as displayed in fig 2 a the enhancement was much higher for the o3 spc treatment compared with o3 alone about 85 ddvp was removed within 2 min by the o3 spc treatment at an o3 concentration of 8 71 mg l 1 while only 29 degradation was obtained in o3 alone system hence the presence of spc promoted ddvp degradation in the o3 spc system and the ddvp removal efficiency was enhanced by 17 2 45 3 within 2 min in the o3 spc system compared to the o3 alone system moreover as illustrated in fig 2b the kobs value increased from 0 023 to 0 043 min 1 for the o3 alone system and from 0 189 to 0 778 min 1 for the o3 spc system respectively to summarize adding spc accelerates the reaction between o3 and h2o2 at different inlet o3 concentrations which generated oh radicals to improve the ddvp degradation rate consequently 26 in order to maintain a relatively high degradation efficiency an o3 concentration of 4 21 mg l 1 was selected to study the effects of ph and spc dosage on ddvp degradation 3 2 2 effect of spc dosage as can be seen from fig 3 a the ddvp degradation efficiency was enhanced from 51 8 to 89 8 within 5 min by increasing the spc dosage from 2 to 30 mg l 1 the corresponding kobs value increased from 0 223 to 0 517 min 1 respectively however when the spc dosage further increased to 120 mg l 1 the kobs value promptly decreased to 0 281 mg l 1 this trend can be explained as follows at low spc concentrations a dosage increase can result in a higher oh production and promotes ddvp degradation once a critical spc concentration is reached the generated oh radicals are scavenged by the overdosed spc similar results were observed in previous research on coumarin degradation 26 the promotion effect was mainly depending on a higher h2o2 participation with increasing spc dosage eqs 1 4 the inhibition effect of spc could be attributed to the oh scavenging role of excess h2o2 and hco3 in the solution as illustrated in eqs 7 and 8 h2o2 should be regarded as a scavenger for oh besides excess dominating hco3 resulting from spc at neutral ph may consume part of the oh eq 9 resulting in the hindering of the ddvp degradation 7 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o k o h h 2 o 2 1 6 10 9 m 1 m i n 1 8 h o 2 o h h o 2 o h k o h h o 2 4 5 10 11 m 1 m i n 1 9 h c o 3 o h c o 3 h 2 o k o h h c o 3 5 2 10 8 m 1 m i n 1 3 2 3 effect of initial ph the solution ph plays a crucial role in the o3 spc process due to its significant influence on the decomposition of o3 and the interaction between o3 and spc it was observed that see fig s3 ddvp was only marginally degraded with spc alone oxidation and a negligible effect on ddvp degradation 2 was found with increasing ph the effect of the initial ph on ddvp degradation by o3 and o3 spc oxidation are shown in fig s4 in general ddvp removal by o3 oxidation within 5 min was enhanced from 46 2 to 86 7 when ph increased from 3 5 to 10 0 fig 4 a the corresponding kobs value increased from 0 183 to 0 362 min 1 for the o3 alone process and specifically the degradation was enhanced faster in the alkaline ph range 7 10 moreover the presence of spc in the ph range of 3 5 8 0 revealed an obvious synergistic effect on ddvp degradation and the removal efficiency of ddvp within 5 min was promoted from 47 0 to 90 1 when the ph continued to increase from 8 0 to 10 0 an inhibiting effect appeared and ddvp removal efficiency decreased to 75 8 at ph 10 0 fig 4a the same trend was observed for the kobs value of the o3 spc process with an initial increase in kobs until a maximum value of 0 539 min 1 at ph 8 0 followed by a decrease at higher ph values it is well known that indirect oxidation dominates in alkaline ph i e more oh radicals are generated at higher ph ph 8 for the o3 process this promotes the ddvp degradation efficiency however a limited increase 10 7 of kobs was observed in the acidic ph range initial ph from 3 5 to 7 because of the dominating direct oxidation of molecular ozone in contrast the kobs value of the o3 spc process increased with a factor of 2 2 in the same ph range this was ascribed to the mutual promotion of the reaction between o3 and h2o2 as eqs 1 4 increasing ph facilitates the dissociation of h2o2 to ho2 which is an initiator for the oh radical however excess ho2 quenches oh eq 8 besides the scavenging effects of oh by co3 2 with increasing ph eq 10 are enhanced due to the dissociation effects of hco3 co3 2 pka2 10 33 both reactions explain the reverse effects of high ph on ddvp degradation efficiency by the o3 spc process 10 c o 3 2 o h c o 3 o h k o h c o 3 2 2 4 10 10 m 1 m i n 1 3 3 identification of radical species during o3 and o3 spc treatment on ddvp degradation it was previously reported that reactive species such as oh participate in the degradation of benzene or trichloroethylene in spc related oxidation systems 28 31 tan et al 26 suggested that co3 are additionally involved in the oxidation when spc is present to investigate the contributions of different reactive species in o3 and o3 spc systems quenching experiments were conducted by adding tba and ipa as radical scavengers it is well known that tba has a higher reaction rate constant with oh 2 3 4 6 1010 m 1 min 1 32 33 in addition ipa also easily reacts with oh 109 1010 m 1 min 1 34 on the other hand the reaction rate between ipa and co3 is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than the rate between tba and co3 kipa co3 2 4 106 m 1 min 1 ktba co3 1 6 103 m 1 min 1 35 therefore ipa was selected in the following quenching experiments to quench both oh and co3 whereas tba only scavenges oh as shown in fig s5 ddvp degradation was significantly suppressed with the addition of 1 mm tba or ipa and the impact further increased with higher scavenger concentration until the addition of 50 mm tba or ipa in the o3 spc system the inhibitory effects were attributed to the dominating radical oxidation e g oh and ddvp removal efficiency decreased to 97 3 and 98 8 at a ph of 8 3 in the presence of 50 mm tba and ipa respectively fig s6c these results indicate that the reactive species that participated in ddvp degradation 97 3 mainly existed in the form of oh on the other hand a small fraction of co3 1 5 and ozone molecules 1 4 contributed to the degradation of the pollutant in the o3 alone system it is clear from fig s6c that tba shows a partial inhibition to ddvp degradation and the reaction rate constant decreased by 60 3 compared with no scavenger addition this phenomenon could be interpreted with dominating indirect oxidation in basic ph conditions and mild reactivity between o3 and ddvp ko3 ddvp 3 5 104 m 1 min 1 which is in agreement with the previous research by cruz alcalde et al 9 moreover the changes in the contribution of o3 ko3 way oh koh way and or co3 k co3 way to ddvp degradation at lower ph were shown in fig s6a and fig s6b as the initial ph values decreased to neutral or acidic conditions ph from 6 8 to 5 5 a lower ph resulted in higher o3 and co3 contributions from 8 2 and 40 8 to 21 5 and 55 8 respectively towards ddvp degradation as well as less oh participation from 50 9 22 7 during the o3 spc process fig 5 this could be explained by the fact that acidic conditions lead to the formation of co3 from oh and co 3 2 eq 7 in addition the presence of less oxidative co3 radicals causes a drop in the kobs value from 0 31 min 1 at ph 8 3 to 0 17 min 1 at ph 5 5 consequently radical oxidation governed ddvp degradation during o3 spc treatment oh played a major role at a higher ph whereas co3 dominated at a lower ph molecular ozone only played a minor role in contrast non radical oxidation governs ddvp degradation in the o3 alone treatment especially at acidic ph range 3 4 water matrix effects inorganic ions and natural organic matter nom widely exist in wastewater and they might affect the degradation process through scavenging radicals during the o3 spc process the effects of 5 mm co existing inorganic ions so4 2 no3 no2 cl h2po4 and hpo4 and different concentrations of humic acid an important component of nom on ddvp degradation were investigated and displayed in fig 6 it was observed from fig 6a that so4 2 no3 and h2po4 exhibited no distinct effects on ddvp degradation in the o3 spc process probably due to the relatively low ion concentrations applied the presence of cl slightly improved the degradation of ddvp kobs increased by 5 3 this could be ascribed to cl production from cl and oh at low cl concentration which may eliminate ddvp by cl with a high redox potential of 2 4 v 36 a more obvious improvement on kobs to 0 3892 min 1 was found with the addition of hpo4 because of the increase of the initial solution ph 8 5 higher initial ph favored oh generation on the other hand the relatively low reaction rate constant k 106 m 1 min 1 between oh and hpo4 does not cause inhibition effects on oh oxidation efficiency however the introduction of no2 considerably inhibited the degradation process this discrepancy could be attributed to the role of no2 as a scavenger of oh koh no2 3 6 1011 m 1 min 1 37 another possible explanation is that no2 also has a moderate reaction rate constant of 2 2 107 m 1 min 1 towards ozone 21 which would interfere with the reaction of o3 and spc moreover the presence of nom showed a repressive effect on ddvp degradation in fig 6b the o3 alone process was suppressed kobs decreased by 15 7 when a low concentration of humic acid 0 8 mg l 1 as toc was introduced the o3 spc process only exhibited a negligible difference on ddvp removal as the humic acid concentration increased to 10 mg l 1 kobs decreased from 0 20 and 0 27 min 1 to 0 08 and 0 14 min 1 in o3 and o3 spc process respectively this could be explained by the competition of humic acid and ddvp for oh radicals kha oh 8 4 106 l mg c 1 min 1 which was in agreement with the research of wu et al 38 showing that the presence of humic acid considerably affected the prometon as one of the widely used triazine herbicides degradation during o3 peroxymonosulfate treatment furthermore as illustrated in fig 7 the secondary effluent significantly inhibited the ddvp removal with kobs of 0 038 and 0 019 min 1 compared to those of 0 306 and 0 132 min 1 in o3 spc and o3 control deionized water systems respectively note that there is recalcitrant organic matters in the secondary effluent wastewater characteristics in table 1 those water matrix compounds could compete with ddvp for the oxidative species thus suppressing the oxidation process 3 5 kinetic study of ddvp degradation by o3 spc process although it is difficult to predict the micropollutant removal efficiency due to the combined reaction of ozone and oh radicals a method based on chemical reaction kinetics can be used the degradation of ddvp during the o3 spc process can be expressed as follows 11 l n d d v p t d d v p 0 k o

introduced to activate the o3 system as a substitute for h2o2 for the degradation of ddvp the presence of spc resulted in a significant enhancement in ddvp removal during ozonation the degradation process via o3 alone and o3 spc processes both followed pseudo first order reaction kinetic patterns the reaction rates depended on ph o3 dosage spc dosage and the water matrix a high dosage of ozonation favored ddvp degradation while for ph and spc dosage an optimum value of 8 and 30 mg l 1 spc respectively were observed to reach the maximum rate constant 0 53 min 1 a 99 1 removal of ddvp was achieved after 8 min of reaction time with 1 32 mg l 1 o3 and 30 mg l 1 spc at ph 8 by the o3 spc treatment excessive ph values or spc dosage have a negative impact on the enhancement due to the scavenging of oh by oh or spc itself in addition the complex matrix e g nom in real wastewater suppressed the oxidation process due to the competition for oxidative species with organic matters and ddvp the major reactive species during the o3 spc treatment were determined to be oh and co3 based on radical scavenger experiments oh were observed at full ph range but dominated under neutral and alkaline conditions while less oxidative co3 emerged and participated in the reaction at lower ph values a modified kinetic model for the prediction of ddvp degradation via the o3 spc treatment was proposed which was verified to be reliable to estimate ddvp abatement with high accuracy the findings revealed that the o3 spc system could be further investigated as a novel and potential oxidation process for recalcitrant compounds elimination it can be also emphasized that such as the proposed process for the degradation of the persistent organic compounds can satisfy the sustainability considerations by offering a highly efficient and safe treatment technology which is also environmentally friendly and less expensive compared to other chemical treatment techniques hence the studied method can be considered for large scale applications for the purification of polluted waters declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments this work

13724,dichlorvos or 2 2 dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate ddvp is a chlorinated organophosphorus pesticide which is frequently detected in the aqueous environment in this study an environmentally friendly and highly efficient oxidant i e sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 was introduced to an ozonation process for the degradation of dichlorvos ddvp experimental results revealed an enhancement of ddvp degradation efficiency via the o3 spc process compared with o3 alone due to the generation of reactive species oh and co3 under various conditions both processes fitted the pseudo first order kinetic model and the reaction rate constant of the o3 spc process under low spc dosage 30 mg l 1 was more than two times higher than for o3 alone the ddvp removal performance was evaluated in terms of initial ph o3 dosage spc dosage and water matrix the ph played a significant role in ddvp degradation during the o3 spc process especially on the occurrence of the different types of reactive species based on radical scavenger experiments oh were observed over the full ph range but dominated under neutral and alkaline conditions while less oxidative co3 emerged at lower ph furthermore the complex matrix of real wastewater inhibited the oxidation process due to the competition for oxidative species between organic matter and ddvp a modified kinetic model based on a steady state hypothesis was established to predict ddvp degradation via the o3 spc treatment and provided a fair result under different conditions this observation suggested that eco friendly spc could be considered as a promising alternative for h2o2 in developing sustainable ozone based oxidation processes for recalcitrant compounds elimination in wastewater treatment keywords ddvp o3 spc advanced oxidation process degradation kinetics sustainability 1 introduction the widespread use of pesticides has resulted in the release of these substances into the environment and has caused serious toxic effects on humans and other organisms 1 2 there are growing concerns that pesticide residues can highly affect human health and for example lead to an increase in some types of cancer and birth defects 3 previous studies have put forward that about 220 000 deaths occur each year in the developing world because of exposure to pesticides 4 furthermore it is well known that pesticides pose a risk to fish and other aquatic species 3 one of the pesticide groups often used is organophosphorus pesticides which is traditionally employed in agriculture animal production and even in households 5 6 because of their potential risks to human and animal health the organophosphorus pesticides have been classified as priority substances by the eu directive 2013 39 eu which means that special measures should be taken to monitor and remove these compounds from the polluted water and wastewater 7 8 dichlorvos 2 2 dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate ddvp a chlorinated organophosphorus pesticide is widely used as an insecticide in food storage areas for household protection and in outdoor areas e g liquid spray 5 9 despite very low concentrations of ddvp in water resources its residues pose serious risks to human and environmental health especially under unknown long term effects 4 examples from the international agency for research on cancer iarc suggest that acute exposure to ddvp may cause breathing problems and nervous system cell metabolic disorders 10 moreover chronic exposure to ddvp has been observed to cause liver and other body organs malfunction 11 additionally surveys such as the one conducted by aimer et al 12 have shown that ddvp is highly toxic to fish birds and honeybees in view of the reasons above ddvp is regarded as an extremely hazardous compound by the world health organization who and the use of ddvp was restricted for agricultural use across european union countries starting from 2012 5 however ddvp is still massively applied for managing pests in many developing countries 3 due to its extensive use and residues in a lot of products ddvp has been widely detected in surface water worldwide with concentrations ranging from 1 4 to 5630 ng l 1 9 therefore research on effective and environmentally friendly treatment approaches for eliminating ddvp from water and wastewater is highly welcome among various physicochemical and biological methods developed so far to deal with the polluted water and wastewater conventional biodegradation processes are not efficient enough for purifying wastewater containing ddvp due to its toxic effects on the microorganisms which are responsible for the decomposition of organic compounds 13 other approaches such as coagulation flocculation are also not effective for ddvp elimination achieving less than 30 removal efficiency 14 a promising alternative to deal with these issues and to remove recalcitrant pesticides from polluted water is advanced oxidation processes aops 15 existing research has shown that ozonation exhibits great potential for the degradation of various organic compounds 7 16 a unique property of ozone is its partial decomposition in water to yield hydroxyl radicals oh oh is a non selective oxidative species with an extraordinary oxidation capacity extensive research has indicated that the oxidation of various pollutants via oh has a faster reaction rate and stronger mineralization ability compared to the direct oxidation with molecular ozone 12 however the extent of ozone dissociation into oh depends on the ph of the medium 17 i e only at alkaline conditions an extensive generation of oh takes place to overcome this disadvantage various hybrid ozone based aops have been developed to enhance the generation of oh radicals including o3 uv 18 o3 catalyst 19 o3 persulfate 20 o3 hydroxylamine 21 and o3 h2o2 16 for example both heterogeneous catalytic ozonation using tio2 19 α feooh 22 or activated carbon 23 as catalysts and homogeneous catalytic ozonation applying mn2 24 or fe2 25 have been characterized with oh generation to achieve high performance in organic pollutants degradation qiao et al 20 and qin et al 21 reported that the combination of ozone and persulfate or hydroxylamine results in the generation of oh as well as so4 or nh2oo respectively whereas the degradation efficiency for ddvp was high for these processes the complex separation of the catalyst or the secondary pollution from the additive are major disadvantages as a consequence some researchers pay more attention to the application of o3 h2o2 peroxone peroxone is the most practical way of upgrading current ozonation processes to an aop system on one side it is only necessary to add h2o2 which is a relatively green reagent to promote the formation of oh eqs 1 4 26 on the other side the oh yield for the peroxone process is approximately 50 which is the highest between ozone based processes 27 1 h 2 o 2 h o

spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 which is an environmentally friendly reagent with strong oxidation potential 1 8 ev has been employed as an alternative for h2o2 in peroxone aops 26 28 as a source of solid h2o2 spc has more advantages than the traditional h2o2 solution because it is stable safe non toxic and easy to handle 28 recently spc has been regarded as a substitute and widely applied for the degradation of different organic pollutants in fenton or fenton like oxidation uv and ultrasound related aops 14 29 its application in combination with ozonation however has seldom been studied in detail before this study presents the effect of various experimental parameters ph ozone dosage and spc dosage on the degradation efficiency and the kinetics of ddvp via o3 spc oxidation furthermore the presence of reactive species and the influence of matrix components present in the water on the process efficiency were investigated additionally a modified kinetic model was built to predict the ddvp degradation via the o3 spc process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dichlorvos ddvp c4h7cl2o4p analytical standard and sodium percarbonate na2co3 1 5h2o2 avail h2o2 20 30 were purchased from sigma aldrich

further purification all solutions were prepared using milli q ultra pure water millipore usa secondary effluent was collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant of aquafin mechelen noord belgium the collected water was filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size filter before use in the experiments 2 2 ozonation procedure the ddvp degradation tests were conducted in a cylindrical glass reactor with an internal diameter of 9 3 cm and a height of 24 cm 500 ml ddvp solution was added to the reactor a schematic of the experimental set up is presented in fig s1 see the supplementary materials ozone was produced by an ozone generator com ad 02 anseros with a maximum ozone production rate of 10 g h 1 and introduced to the solution by a stainless steel diffuser pore size 5 μm brouwland belgium the reaction mixture was continuously stirred magnetically and a water jacket surrounding the reactor guaranteed a constant reaction temperature 22 c ozone off gas was monitored by an ozone analyzer m465 teledyne the initial ph of the solutions was adjusted with 0 1 m naoh or h2so4 in a typical process 500 ml ddvp solution 4 0 mg l 1 containing 30 mg l 1 spc was transferred to the reactor and adjusted to the corresponding ph under continuous stirring produced ozone gas was bubbled through the solution via the diffusor at a concentration of 4 21 mg l 1 sampling was performed at regular time intervals and the samples taken were immediately quenched by adding excess na2s2o3 the same procedure was conducted at different conditions varying ozone dosage spc dosage and ph all experiments were performed at least in duplicate and average values are reported 2 3 analytical methods the ddvp was separated and detected using an hplc system agilent 1100 with a g1314a uv detector the separation was achieved on an agilent eclipse plus c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm the column temperature was kept at 30 c using the thermostatic compartment the mobile phase consisted of ultrapure water a and acetonitrile b with the gradient elution program of a b v v from 60 40 to 55 45 for the first 7 min then maintaining the ratio at 55 45 for 1 min at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the injection volume was 50 μl and the detector wavelength was set at 205 nm toc values were determined by a toc l analyzer tnm l rohs shimadzo japan cod was measured by cod cuvettes 15 150 mg l 1 o2 hach belgium 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of ddvp via o3 spc process the ddvp degradation efficiency was evaluated and compared for spc alone o3 alone o3 spc and o3 h2o2 processes as depicted in fig 1 the combination of o3 and spc showed synergistic effects on ddvp degradation the ddvp degradation by the direct spc process was negligible 2 specifically the ddvp concentration decreased by approximately 86 5 after 10 min in the o3 process while the decrease was 99 5 in combination with spc for the same reaction time when combining o3 with h2o2 in the same concentration a much lower improvement of the o3 alone treatment was observed showing a decrease in the concentration of 91 9 after a 10 min reaction time these results are consistent with previous research on ddvp degradation by ozonation in which a complete degradation of ddvp was observed for an o3 dosage of 6 mg l 1 and at ph 7 26 it has been reported that ddvp reacted mildly with molecular ozone but reacted fast with hydroxyl radicals with a rate constant of 1 2 1011 m 1 min 1 9 this can be the explanation for the high degradation efficiency obtained for the combined o3 spc process as will be discussed in section 3 3 in addition the inserted figure shows that toc removal after 20 min in o3 alone and o3 spc processes were 21 7 and 58 3 respectively which confirms that the presence of spc during ozonation significantly enhances the mineralization process pseudo first order kinetics for ozone based oxidation were previously reported 30 the pseudo first order kinetic model was verified and confirmed by fitting the experimental data as described in eq 5 5 d d d v p t d t k o b s d d v p t integration of eq 5 could be transferred into eq 6 6 l n d d v p t d d v p 0 k o b s t where ddvp t is the ddvp concentration measured at treatment time t min ddvp 0 is the initial ddvp concentration and kobs is the observed reaction rate constant min 1 the pseudo first order rate constants kobs can be calculated as the slope of fitted linear regression as shown in fig 1 b the degradation kinetics of the ddvp under o3 alone o3 spc and o3 h2o2 followed the pseudo first order model with kobs values of 0 274 0 513 and 0 252 min 1 respectively confirming the validity of the pseudo first order kinetic model 3 2 effects of operational parameters in o3 spc process 3 2 1 effect of ozone dosage it is seen in fig s2 that the ddvp degradation considerably increased with increasing the ozone concentration in the gas introduced in the reactor from 1 65 to 8 71 mg l 1 this trend was confirmed for both the o3 spc and o3 alone systems such observations are explained by the increase in o3 partial pressure in the gas phase with higher inlet o3 concentration improving o3 transfer to the liquid and resulting in a higher dissolved o3 concentration 21 in addition as displayed in fig 2 a the enhancement was much higher for the o3 spc treatment compared with o3 alone about 85 ddvp was removed within 2 min by the o3 spc treatment at an o3 concentration of 8 71 mg l 1 while only 29 degradation was obtained in o3 alone system hence the presence of spc promoted ddvp degradation in the o3 spc system and the ddvp removal efficiency was enhanced by 17 2 45 3 within 2 min in the o3 spc system compared to the o3 alone system moreover as illustrated in fig 2b the kobs value increased from 0 023 to 0 043 min 1 for the o3 alone system and from 0 189 to 0 778 min 1 for the o3 spc system respectively to summarize adding spc accelerates the reaction between o3 and h2o2 at different inlet o3 concentrations which generated oh radicals to improve the ddvp degradation rate consequently 26 in order to maintain a relatively high degradation efficiency an o3 concentration of 4 21 mg l 1 was selected to study the effects of ph and spc dosage on ddvp degradation 3 2 2 effect of spc dosage as can be seen from fig 3 a the ddvp degradation efficiency was enhanced from 51 8 to 89 8 within 5 min by increasing the spc dosage from 2 to 30 mg l 1 the corresponding kobs value increased from 0 223 to 0 517 min 1 respectively however when the spc dosage further increased to 120 mg l 1 the kobs value promptly decreased to 0 281 mg l 1 this trend can be explained as follows at low spc concentrations a dosage increase can result in a higher oh production and promotes ddvp degradation once a critical spc concentration is reached the generated oh radicals are scavenged by the overdosed spc similar results were observed in previous research on coumarin degradation 26 the promotion effect was mainly depending on a higher h2o2 participation with increasing spc dosage eqs 1 4 the inhibition effect of spc could be attributed to the oh scavenging role of excess h2o2 and hco3 in the solution as illustrated in eqs 7 and 8 h2o2 should be regarded as a scavenger for oh besides excess dominating hco3 resulting from spc at neutral ph may consume part of the oh eq 9 resulting in the hindering of the ddvp degradation 7 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o k o h h 2 o 2 1 6 10 9 m 1 m i n 1 8 h o 2 o h h o 2 o h k o h h o 2 4 5 10 11 m 1 m i n 1 9 h c o 3 o h c o 3 h 2 o k o h h c o 3 5 2 10 8 m 1 m i n 1 3 2 3 effect of initial ph the solution ph plays a crucial role in the o3 spc process due to its significant influence on the decomposition of o3 and the interaction between o3 and spc it was observed that see fig s3 ddvp was only marginally degraded with spc alone oxidation and a negligible effect on ddvp degradation 2 was found with increasing ph the effect of the initial ph on ddvp degradation by o3 and o3 spc oxidation are shown in fig s4 in general ddvp removal by o3 oxidation within 5 min was enhanced from 46 2 to 86 7 when ph increased from 3 5 to 10 0 fig 4 a the corresponding kobs value increased from 0 183 to 0 362 min 1 for the o3 alone process and specifically the degradation was enhanced faster in the alkaline ph range 7 10 moreover the presence of spc in the ph range of 3 5 8 0 revealed an obvious synergistic effect on ddvp degradation and the removal efficiency of ddvp within 5 min was promoted from 47 0 to 90 1 when the ph continued to increase from 8 0 to 10 0 an inhibiting effect appeared and ddvp removal efficiency decreased to 75 8 at ph 10 0 fig 4a the same trend was observed for the kobs value of the o3 spc process with an initial increase in kobs until a maximum value of 0 539 min 1 at ph 8 0 followed by a decrease at higher ph values it is well known that indirect oxidation dominates in alkaline ph i e more oh radicals are generated at higher ph ph 8 for the o3 process this promotes the ddvp degradation efficiency however a limited increase 10 7 of kobs was observed in the acidic ph range initial ph from 3 5 to 7 because of the dominating direct oxidation of molecular ozone in contrast the kobs value of the o3 spc process increased with a factor of 2 2 in the same ph range this was ascribed to the mutual promotion of the reaction between o3 and h2o2 as eqs 1 4 increasing ph facilitates the dissociation of h2o2 to ho2 which is an initiator for the oh radical however excess ho2 quenches oh eq 8 besides the scavenging effects of oh by co3 2 with increasing ph eq 10 are enhanced due to the dissociation effects of hco3 co3 2 pka2 10 33 both reactions explain the reverse effects of high ph on ddvp degradation efficiency by the o3 spc process 10 c o 3 2 o h c o 3 o h k o h c o 3 2 2 4 10 10 m 1 m i n 1 3 3 identification of radical species during o3 and o3 spc treatment on ddvp degradation it was previously reported that reactive species such as oh participate in the degradation of benzene or trichloroethylene in spc related oxidation systems 28 31 tan et al 26 suggested that co3 are additionally involved in the oxidation when spc is present to investigate the contributions of different reactive species in o3 and o3 spc systems quenching experiments were conducted by adding tba and ipa as radical scavengers it is well known that tba has a higher reaction rate constant with oh 2 3 4 6 1010 m 1 min 1 32 33 in addition ipa also easily reacts with oh 109 1010 m 1 min 1 34 on the other hand the reaction rate between ipa and co3 is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than the rate between tba and co3 kipa co3 2 4 106 m 1 min 1 ktba co3 1 6 103 m 1 min 1 35 therefore ipa was selected in the following quenching experiments to quench both oh and co3 whereas tba only scavenges oh as shown in fig s5 ddvp degradation was significantly suppressed with the addition of 1 mm tba or ipa and the impact further increased with higher scavenger concentration until the addition of 50 mm tba or ipa in the o3 spc system the inhibitory effects were attributed to the dominating radical oxidation e g oh and ddvp removal efficiency decreased to 97 3 and 98 8 at a ph of 8 3 in the presence of 50 mm tba and ipa respectively fig s6c these results indicate that the reactive species that participated in ddvp degradation 97 3 mainly existed in the form of oh on the other hand a small fraction of co3 1 5 and ozone molecules 1 4 contributed to the degradation of the pollutant in the o3 alone system it is clear from fig s6c that tba shows a partial inhibition to ddvp degradation and the reaction rate constant decreased by 60 3 compared with no scavenger addition this phenomenon could be interpreted with dominating indirect oxidation in basic ph conditions and mild reactivity between o3 and ddvp ko3 ddvp 3 5 104 m 1 min 1 which is in agreement with the previous research by cruz alcalde et al 9 moreover the changes in the contribution of o3 ko3 way oh koh way and or co3 k co3 way to ddvp degradation at lower ph were shown in fig s6a and fig s6b as the initial ph values decreased to neutral or acidic conditions ph from 6 8 to 5 5 a lower ph resulted in higher o3 and co3 contributions from 8 2 and 40 8 to 21 5 and 55 8 respectively towards ddvp degradation as well as less oh participation from 50 9 22 7 during the o3 spc process fig 5 this could be explained by the fact that acidic conditions lead to the formation of co3 from oh and co 3 2 eq 7 in addition the presence of less oxidative co3 radicals causes a drop in the kobs value from 0 31 min 1 at ph 8 3 to 0 17 min 1 at ph 5 5 consequently radical oxidation governed ddvp degradation during o3 spc treatment oh played a major role at a higher ph whereas co3 dominated at a lower ph molecular ozone only played a minor role in contrast non radical oxidation governs ddvp degradation in the o3 alone treatment especially at acidic ph range 3 4 water matrix effects inorganic ions and natural organic matter nom widely exist in wastewater and they might affect the degradation process through scavenging radicals during the o3 spc process the effects of 5 mm co existing inorganic ions so4 2 no3 no2 cl h2po4 and hpo4 and different concentrations of humic acid an important component of nom on ddvp degradation were investigated and displayed in fig 6 it was observed from fig 6a that so4 2 no3 and h2po4 exhibited no distinct effects on ddvp degradation in the o3 spc process probably due to the relatively low ion concentrations applied the presence of cl slightly improved the degradation of ddvp kobs increased by 5 3 this could be ascribed to cl production from cl and oh at low cl concentration which may eliminate ddvp by cl with a high redox potential of 2 4 v 36 a more obvious improvement on kobs to 0 3892 min 1 was found with the addition of hpo4 because of the increase of the initial solution ph 8 5 higher initial ph favored oh generation on the other hand the relatively low reaction rate constant k 106 m 1 min 1 between oh and hpo4 does not cause inhibition effects on oh oxidation efficiency however the introduction of no2 considerably inhibited the degradation process this discrepancy could be attributed to the role of no2 as a scavenger of oh koh no2 3 6 1011 m 1 min 1 37 another possible explanation is that no2 also has a moderate reaction rate constant of 2 2 107 m 1 min 1 towards ozone 21 which would interfere with the reaction of o3 and spc moreover the presence of nom showed a repressive effect on ddvp degradation in fig 6b the o3 alone process was suppressed kobs decreased by 15 7 when a low concentration of humic acid 0 8 mg l 1 as toc was introduced the o3 spc process only exhibited a negligible difference on ddvp removal as the humic acid concentration increased to 10 mg l 1 kobs decreased from 0 20 and 0 27 min 1 to 0 08 and 0 14 min 1 in o3 and o3 spc process respectively this could be explained by the competition of humic acid and ddvp for oh radicals kha oh 8 4 106 l mg c 1 min 1 which was in agreement with the research of wu et al 38 showing that the presence of humic acid considerably affected the prometon as one of the widely used triazine herbicides degradation during o3 peroxymonosulfate treatment furthermore as illustrated in fig 7 the secondary effluent significantly inhibited the ddvp removal with kobs of 0 038 and 0 019 min 1 compared to those of 0 306 and 0 132 min 1 in o3 spc and o3 control deionized water systems respectively note that there is recalcitrant organic matters in the secondary effluent wastewater characteristics in table 1 those water matrix compounds could compete with ddvp for the oxidative species thus suppressing the oxidation process 3 5 kinetic study of ddvp degradation by o3 spc process although it is difficult to predict the micropollutant removal efficiency due to the combined reaction of ozone and oh radicals a method based on chemical reaction kinetics can be used the degradation of ddvp during the o3 spc process can be expressed as follows 11 l n d d v p t d d v p 0 k o

different ph and different ozone dosage conditions the calculated data of kobs from eq 19 were compared with the test data and plotted as fig 5 20 k o b s e x p 0 0021 k o b s t h e o 0 0012 as illustrated in fig 8 most of the points are included in the 95 confidence level band and all the points are inside of the 95 prediction band in addition the linear fit is good with r2 of 0 924 and the experimental values are well matched with the calculated ones confirming that the kinetic model eq 20 was valid to predict the removal of ddvp in the o3 spc process 4 conclusion in this study spc was introduced to activate the o3 system as a substitute for h2o2 for the degradation of ddvp the presence of spc resulted in a significant enhancement in ddvp removal during ozonation the degradation process via o3 alone and o3 spc processes both followed pseudo first order reaction kinetic patterns the reaction rates depended on ph o3 dosage spc dosage and the water matrix a high dosage of ozonation favored ddvp degradation while for ph and spc dosage an optimum value of 8 and 30 mg l 1 spc respectively were observed to reach the maximum rate constant 0 53 min 1 a 99 1 removal of ddvp was achieved after 8 min of reaction time with 1 32 mg l 1 o3 and 30 mg l 1 spc at ph 8 by the o3 spc treatment excessive ph values or spc dosage have a negative impact on the enhancement due to the scavenging of oh by oh or spc itself in addition the complex matrix e g nom in real wastewater suppressed the oxidation process due to the competition for oxidative species with organic matters and ddvp the major reactive species during the o3 spc treatment were determined to be oh and co3 based on radical scavenger experiments oh were observed at full ph range but dominated under neutral and alkaline conditions while less oxidative co3 emerged and participated in the reaction at lower ph values a modified kinetic model for the prediction of ddvp degradation via the o3 spc treatment was proposed which was verified to be reliable to estimate ddvp abatement with high accuracy the findings revealed that the o3 spc system could be further investigated as a novel and potential oxidation process for recalcitrant compounds elimination it can be also emphasized that such as the proposed process for the degradation of the persistent organic compounds can satisfy the sustainability considerations by offering a highly efficient and safe treatment technology which is also environmentally friendly and less expensive compared to other chemical treatment techniques hence the studied method can be considered for large scale applications for the purification of polluted waters declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments this work
