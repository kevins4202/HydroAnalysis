18390,bromide and natural organic matter nom are both precursors of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps in drinking water during drinking water treatment process chloride form anion exchange resin adsorption is expected to be capable of removing these dbp precursors and in the meantime releasing chloride ions the released chloride as well as the chloride initially present in source water could be oxidized through electrolysis to generate free chlorine for disinfection based on the above assumptions we developed a new disinfection approach using chloride form anion exchange resin adsorption followed by electrolysis to control halogenated dbps parameter setup and optimization were performed for resin adsorption and electrolysis processes results showed that 93 7 of nom and 90 of bromide could be removed at a resin dose of 20 ml per 2 l of simulated source water sample with a contact time of 1 h meanwhile 49 5 mg l of chloride was released from the resin to the water sample via anion exchange and the released chloride was further oxidized by electrolysis ti ruo2 iro2 anode and graphite cathode current intensity of 0 4 a to generate free chlorine 5 mg l as cl2 within 192 s with this new approach formation of total organic halogen four trihalomethanes and five haloacetic acids was reduced by 86 4 98 5 and 93 2 respectively compared with chemical chlorination alone although the new approach might enhance the formation of some phenolic dbps by decreasing bromide levels in source water the overall cytotoxicity of the water samples treated with the new approach was significantly decreased by 68 8 according to a human hepatoma cell cytotoxicity assay notably disinfection ability evaluation showed that the new approach achieved 3 36 log10 reductions of three seeded bacteria escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus in 19 s suggesting that it was not only effective to e coli but also effective to the chlorine resistant bacteria p aeruginosa and s aureus graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts anion exchange resin adsorption electrolysis disinfection cytotoxicity drinking water 1 introduction chlorination is one of the most intensively adopted drinking water disinfection methods to protect public from waterborne diseases however chlorine can react with halides and natural organic matter nom in source water to generate numerous halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps richardson and postigo 2011 up to now approximately 700 dbps have been discovered ever since the first identification of haloforms in chlorinated natural waters rook 1974 richardson and ternes 2018 previous toxicological and epidemiological studies have proved that drinking water dbps were cytotoxic genotoxic mutagenic and positively correlated to human risks such as cancer miscarriage and birth defects wagner and plewa 2017 wright et al 2017 li and mitch 2018 an important dbp control strategy during drinking water treatment process is to decrease dbp precursor levels prior to disinfection and the main methods include activated carbon adsorption membrane filtration enhanced coagulation resin adsorption etc bond et al 2011 anion exchange resin adsorption is a promising water treatment method with relatively low cost and high regeneration ability it is expected to be capable of removing dbp precursors such as nom and halides and thus should be effective in control of halogenated dbps hsu and singer 2010 previous studies have reported that anion exchange resin is effective to control the formation of the commonly known halogenated dbps through nom and bromide removal boyer and singer 2005 gan et al 2013 bazri et al 2016 however its control efficiency on overall halogenated dbps as well as some newly identified dbps is still unclear thus total organic halogen tox should be employed as a collective parameter for a more comprehensive evaluation of halogenated dbps in a water sample hua and reckhow 2006 li et al 2010 chloride form anion exchange resins were widely used for nom removal for their relatively inert in water chemistry reaction low cost of sodium chloride for generation and better performance than oh type resins rokicki and boyer 2011 however application of chloride form anion exchange resins to remove nom can result in releasing of chloride which may affect drinking water quality aesthetically at relatively high concentrations of above 250 mg l who 2017 although chloride generated during anion exchange process is unwelcome alone however when electrolysis is further coupled to resin adsorption chloride either initially present or artificially added could be quickly oxidized on the electrode surface to become reactive chlorine species with strong bactericidal activity moreover other reactive intermediate species such as reactive oxygen species as well as electric field effect are co exiting during electrolysis feng et al 2004 electrolysis has been proved to be effective in inactivating a wide variety of microorganisms and algae and could even inactivate some chlorine resistant bacteria such as legionella pneumophilia in various water matrices martínez huitle and brillas 2008 cano et al 2012 huang et al 2016 a recent study also pointed out that electrolysis of municipal effluents pretreated by chloride form anion exchange resins could generate free chlorine that served as an efficient disinfectant to inactivate coliform wang et al 2014 in this study a new disinfection approach using chloride form anion exchange resin adsorption followed by electrolysis was developed and optimized control efficiency of the new approach on halogenated dbps was investigated through analyses of tox four trihalomethanes thms five haloacetic acids haas and 23

at the same amount as that generated during electrolysis all the samples were kept at 21 c in darkness for a contact time of 12 h after that the chlorine residual in each sample was titrated and quenched using 105 of the required na2so3 2 5 sample pretreatment for desalination and concentration the water samples solutions were pretreated following the procedure of a previous study zhang et al

plates with the cell density of about 2 0 105 cells well the cells in each well were maintained in dmem at 37 c under 5 co2 for 24 h and then exposed to dmem containing different volumes of a concentrated sample after another 24 h exposure each well was dosed with 10 μl cck 8 solution and further incubated for 1 5 h finally the cells were measured with a microplate reader eclipse ti s nikon at 450 nm cell viability for each sample concentration was determined by the relative absorbance with six replicates the 50 maximal effect concentration ec50 value of each sample was calculated

attc 8099 pseudomonas aeruginosa attc 15442 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538 were employed as model bacteria which were cultured in luria bertani lb broth br solarbio at 37 c for 20 h after a 2 min centrifugation at 8500 g and re suspending in 1 pbs the bacterial suspensions were used as bacterial stock all disinfection experiments were performed in a beaker in which 2 l aliquots of simulated source water samples with resin adsorption were prepared prior to each experiment a 0 1 1 0 ml of freshly prepared bacterial stock suspension was seeded to the water samples to provide an approximate final concentration of 106 cfu ml and stabilized for 30 min the water samples were either dosed with naocl directly or electrolyzed until required amounts of free chlorine were produced and then kept in darkness at 21 c for a contact time of 10 min after disinfection the bacterial cells were analyzed by plating colony forming units cfu were determined using a spot titer plating assay beck et al 2009 forsyth et al 2013 which could be characterized by dispensing 20 μl droplets of samples on nutrient agar na br solarbio plates 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of the new approach 3 1 1 effect of resin dose on doc bromide and chloride fig 1 a shows the change of doc uv254 and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva with increasing resin dose in the simulated source water as the resin dose increasing from 0 to 20 ml per 2 l of source water sample the removal rate of doc was significantly enhanced from 55 6 to 93 7 a further increase of resin dose from 20 to 30 ml only slightly elevated the doc removal rate from 93 7 to 94 9 at resin doses above 30 ml the doc level began to rise again which might due to inadequate reaction between resin and simulated source water similarly uv254 kept on decreasing with the increasing resin dose as an effective aromatic content indicator of doc as well as dbp formation predictor suva value also showed a significant decrease with the increasing resin dose it is known that water samples with suva values lower than 2 l mg m basically contain non humic hydrophilic substances white et al 1997 indicating that most of the remaining doc components in the simulated source water after resin adsorption were non humic this finding was also supported by previous studies which showed that humic substances are preferentially removed through anion exchange resin adsorption in water samples with relatively high suva values humbert et al 2005 as shown in fig 1b when 20 ml of resin was dosed into 2 l of simulated source water the bromide level declined to 0 2 mg l with a removal rate of 90 meanwhile the released chloride was accumulated to 49 5 mg l when 30 50 ml of resin was added the bromide concentration further decreased from 0 2 to 0 1 mg l with removal rate increased from 90 to 95 and in the meantime the released chloride increased to 56 1 mg l besides nom and bromide the simulated source water contained a large amount 90 mg l as caco3 of bicarbonate as shown in fig 1c with the increasing resin dose the bicarbonate level gradually decreased suggesting that bicarbonate could be removed together with nom and bromide during resin adsorption process it has been pointed out that anions such as carbonate and bicarbonate could compete with bromide for adsorption sites hsu and singer 2010 since the removed amount of bicarbonate was significantly greater than that of bromide the released chloride to the water sample should mainly come from ion exchange between bicarbonate and the resin according to the above results a resin dose of 20 ml was applied for further experiments at this resin dose the removal percentages of doc and bromide were 93 7 and 90 respectively and 49 5 mg l of chloride could be released for electrolysis it has been reported that doc could be removed more efficiently from waters with higher suva values in which hydrophobic organic carbon was dominant furthermore high levels of anionic species might compete with nom for exchange sites on the resin thereby impacting nom removal by anion exchange boyer and singer 2005 however in real source waters doc could be more hydrophilic than srnom and other anions such as chloride and sulfate might also be present at significant levels thus we collected two source water samples from two local drinking water treatment plants in september 2019 the suva values of the two samples before resin adsorption were 0 66 and 0 74 l mg m which were much lower than that of srnom the levels of bromide bicarbonate chloride and sulfate in the two samples were 0 32 and 0 43 mg l 97 7 and 95 2 mg l as caco3 21 5 and 25 5 mg l and 43 4 and 41 3 mg l respectively with resin adsorption the doc removal rates in the two samples were 10 2 and 14 5 suggesting that doc is preferably removed in source water samples with higher suva values and lower anion concentrations notably ph of the simulated source water was relatively stable and only showed a slight decrease from 8 2 to 7 5 during resin adsorption fig 1c doc removal in anion exchange resin adsorption should be mainly related to the content of carboxylic acid and aromatic carbon in doc boyer et al 2008 and these components are mainly in their ionized forms at the aforementioned ph göbbels and püttmann 1997 therefore slight ph variations might not affect doc removal during resin adsorption 3 1 2 electrolysis after resin adsorption as shown in fig 2 a during electrolysis of a 100 mg l chloride solution formation of free chlorine increased with an increasing current intensity from 0 05 to 0 8 a at the current intensity of 0 05 a it took about 50 min to generate 5 mg l of free chlorine as the current intensity rose to 0 8 a the required time was shortened to only 2 min electrolysis at a higher current intensity facilitated oxidation of chloride to free chlorine at the anode and in the meantime supplied more electrons at the cathode similarly production of free chlorine was positively correlated to chloride 12 5 100 mg l and bicarbonate levels 0 100 mg l as caco3 in the water solutions fig 2b and c furthermore as indicated by fig 2d and e nom and bromide could also affect free chlorine generation but to a much lesser extent it is because that in a source water sample treated by resin adsorption a majority up to 90 of nom and bromide could be removed and their remaining levels are usually low at sub mg l levels accordingly for a 2 l simulated source water sample treated with 20 ml of resin a current intensity of 0 4 a was applied in the electrolysis process and the free chlorine generation with electrolysis time was depicted in fig 2f to produce 5 mg l free chlorine an electrolysis time of 192 s was required 3 2 control efficiency of halogenated dbps by the new approach for a better evaluation and comparison three simulated source water samples were treated with chemical chlorination alone 5 mg l naocl as cl2 resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination 20 ml resin per 2 l sample 5 mg l naocl as cl2 and the new approach 20 ml resin per 2 l sample electrolysis for 192 s respectively the chlorine contact time for the three samples was 12 h 3 2 1 tox four thms and five haas as displayed in fig 3 a the tox formed in the simulated source water sample treated with chemical chlorination alone was 415 3 μg l as cl and such a high tox level could be significantly decreased to 56 5 μg l as cl in the sample treated by the new approach achieving a removal rate of 86 4 in the simulated source water sample treated with resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination the tox level was also low 60 6 μg l as cl it was found that resin adsorption was very effective in removing precursors of halogenated dbps such as nom and bromide fig s1 and thus the tox reduction by the new approach should be mainly ascribed to the resin adsorption process as shown in fig 3b and c the concentrations of the four thms and five haas formed in the sample with chemical chlorination alone were 360 0 and 103 8 μg l respectively which in total accounted for 45 8 of the tox the new approach substantially decreased the concentrations of four thms and five haas by 98 5 from 360 0 to 5 3 μg l and 93 2 from 103 8 to 7 1 μg l respectively similar decrement was also found in the simulated source water sample treated with resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination suggesting that reduction of the four thms and five haas was mainly ascribed to resin adsorption brominated thms and haas were predominant species formed in the sample with chemical chlorination alone and their levels were greatly reduced during resin adsorption owing to the removal of their precursors i e bromide and nom although the levels of trichloromethane and monochloroacetic acid slightly increased with decreasing bromide concentration their concentrations were too low to affect the overall trend accordingly resin adsorption was effective in controlling the formation of thms and haas in addition higher formation of the four thms and five haas was observed in the sample treated with the new approach compared with the sample treated with resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination which could be ascribed to a more thorough decomposition of intermediate dbps by active species involved in electrolysis process 3 2 2 new phenolic dbps in our previous studies a total of 25 phenolic dbps were newly discovered in chlorinated drinking water with different bromide concentrations from 0 to 4 mg l pan and zhang 2013 huang et al 2018 these new phenolic dbps were classified into four groups according to structures including five halo 4 hydroxybenzaldehydes five halo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids six halosalicylic acids and nine halophenols these new phenolic dbps are of increasing concerns due to their higher growth inhibition and developmental toxicity than many regulated dbps yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 among the 25 new phenolic dbps 23 were detected in the simulated drinking water sample in this study as shown in fig 4 compared with chemical chlorination alone both the new approach and resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination enhanced the levels of these new phenolic dbps it was demonstrated that the new phenolic dbps were intermediate compounds and their formation during chlorination was highly related to bromide concentration in source water pan and zhang 2013 as bromide concentration increased from 0 2 to 2 mg l the fully chlorinated species showed a decreasing trend and the fully brominated and mixed chlorinated brominated species exhibited an increasing followed by decreasing trend the total concentration of the new phenolic dbps was higher at bromide level of 0 2 mg l than that at bromide level of 2 mg l pan and zhang 2013 during resin adsorption process the bromide concentration in the simulated source water sample remained decreasing from 2 to 0 2 mg l fig s1b which should be the main reason for the enhanced formation of the 23 new phenolic dbps in the subsequent chemical chlorination electrolysis although the levels of these phenolic dbps increased after treatment by the new approach their total concentration only accounted for 0 7 of the tox in that sample and thus was suspected not to significantly affect the overall toxicity reduction to verify this comparative cytotoxicity of the samples treated with chemical chlorination alone resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination and the new approach was investigated 3 3 comparative hep g2 cell cytotoxicity the three aforementioned samples simulated source water treated with chemical chlorination alone resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination and the new approach were also prepared and pretreated 104 concentration of the original sample in 100 μl of dmso for the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay this assay was conducted via evaluating percentages of viable cells incubated with the pretreated samples at varying concentration factors by regression analysis r 2 and ec50 values for each curve were determined a higher ec50 value suggested a lower cytotoxicity of a sample multiple comparisons among treatment and control groups were conducted via a one way analysis of variance anova followed by holm sidak multiple comparisons test differences were regarded to be statistically significant at p 0 05 as shown in fig 5 viability of the hep g2 cells treated with all these samples reduced significantly and the reduction was concentration factor dependent one way anova test at p 0 001 the 24 h ec50 values of the three samples followed the rank order of chemical chlorination alone 121 resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination 396 resin adsorption followed by electrolysis 388 compared with the sample treated with chemical chlorination alone cytotoxicity of the sample treated with the new approach was reduced by 68 8 the significant reduction of cytotoxicity matched well with that of tox suggesting that tox reduction should be the main reason for cytotoxicity reduction during treatment with the new approach 3 4 inactivation of microorganisms by the new approach besides control efficiency of dbps and toxicity another important aspect to assess the new disinfection approach was its disinfection ability as shown in fig 6 electrolysis disinfection could achieve 3 36 log10 reductions of all three bacteria within 19 s 0 5 mg l free chlorine was generated in this period e coli was the most vulnerable bacteria and could be removed by over 99 99 in just 3 s 0 1 mg l free chlorine was generated during this period p aeruginosa was second to e coli and showed a 4 44 log10 reduction in 19 s for s aureus there was a clear lag phase in the first 7 s and a 3 36 log10 reduction was observed after 19 s suggesting that s aureus exhibited higher resistance than e coli and p aeruginosa during chemical chlorination disinfection a 3 25 log10 reduction of e coli could be achieved until a free chlorine dose at 0 2 mg l inactivation of p aeruginosa and s aureus proceeded rather slowly and only 3 log10 reductions were observed at a free chlorine dose up to 1 0 mg l notably the comparative experiments clearly demonstrated the advantage of electrolysis disinfection for microorganism inactivation not only for conventional bacteria i e e coli but also for those chlorine resistant bacteria i e p aeruginosa and s aureus for chemical chlorination disinfection the effective species is free chlorine cl2 hocl and clo whereas for electrolysis disinfection the disinfection could occur via 1 direct oxidation of microorganisms on the anode s surface caused by a direct transfer of electrons between the cells and the electrode cotillas et al 2018 as well as 2 indirect oxidation by in situ generation of various oxidants e g cl2 hocl clo oh h2o2 o3 etc jeong et al 2006 bergmann et al 2008 diao et al 2004 suggested the high efficiency of electrolysis disinfection could be provided by energy rich and short lived free radicals such as oh for which the c t value was reported to be approximately 104 times lower than that for chlorine cho et al 2004 liu et al 1997 attributed the mechanism of electrolysis disinfection to its disruption of bacterial membrane integrity and electrolysis of molecules on the cell surface which agreed with results from others wang et al 2010 4 conclusions in this study a new disinfection approach using chloride form anion exchange resin adsorption followed by electrolysis was developed compared with chemical chlorination alone the new approach could substantially decrease the levels of tox and regulated dbps like thms and haas which should be mainly ascribed to the resin adsorption process since similar decrement was also found in the sample treated with resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination although the new approach might enhance the levels of a few phenolic dbps as a result of bromide reduction during resin adsorption the overall cytotoxicity of the water samples was still decreased by 68 8 the electrolysis process in the new approach not only changed trash chloride into treasure free chlorine but also achieved effective inactivation of both common and chlorine resistant bacteria considering the strong oxidation ability of electrolysis concentrations of inorganic dbps that possibly formed in water samples bromate chlorate and chlorite were determined to be far below the u s epa guidelines besides surface water this new approach might also be applied in treatment of most ground water and even swimming pool water with appropriate parameter adjustment and optimization to save electricity during electrolysis process

quenched using 105 of the required na2so3 2 5 sample pretreatment for desalination and concentration the water samples solutions were pretreated following the procedure of a previous study zhang et al

water samples treated with different approaches was evaluated using the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay this assay has been applied to evaluate cytotoxicity of a few environmental pollutants including dbps xia et al 2016 gong et al 2017 procedures for the assay generally followed a previous study gong et al 2017 after rinsing with pbs and trypsinizing the hep g2 cells were transferred into 96 well plates with the cell density of about 2 0 105 cells well the cells in each well were maintained in dmem at 37 c under 5 co2 for 24 h and then exposed to dmem containing different volumes of a

nikon at 450 nm cell viability for each sample concentration was determined by the relative absorbance with six replicates the 50 maximal effect concentration ec50 value of each sample was calculated

attc 8099 pseudomonas aeruginosa attc 15442 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538 were employed as model bacteria which were cultured in luria bertani lb broth br solarbio at 37 c for 20 h after a 2 min centrifugation at 8500 g and re suspending in 1 pbs the bacterial suspensions were used as bacterial stock all disinfection experiments were performed in a beaker in which 2 l aliquots of simulated source water samples with resin adsorption were prepared prior to each experiment a 0 1 1 0 ml of freshly prepared bacterial stock suspension was seeded to the water samples to provide an approximate final concentration of 106 cfu ml and stabilized for 30 min the water samples were either dosed with naocl directly or electrolyzed until required amounts of free chlorine were produced and then kept in darkness at 21 c for a contact time of 10 min after disinfection the bacterial cells were analyzed by plating colony forming units cfu were determined using a spot titer plating assay beck et al 2009 forsyth et al 2013 which could be characterized by dispensing 20 μl droplets of samples on nutrient agar na br solarbio plates 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of the new approach 3 1 1 effect of resin dose on doc bromide and chloride fig 1 a shows the change of doc uv254 and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva with increasing resin dose in the simulated source water as the resin dose increasing from 0 to 20 ml per 2 l of source water sample the removal rate of doc was significantly enhanced from 55 6 to 93 7 a further increase of resin dose from 20 to 30 ml only slightly elevated the doc removal rate from 93 7 to 94 9 at resin doses above 30 ml the doc level began to rise again which might due to inadequate reaction between resin and simulated source water similarly uv254 kept on decreasing with the increasing resin dose as an effective aromatic content indicator of doc as well as dbp formation predictor suva value also showed a significant decrease with the increasing resin dose it is known that water samples with suva values lower than 2 l mg m basically contain non humic hydrophilic substances white et al 1997 indicating that most of the remaining doc components in the simulated source water after resin adsorption were non humic this finding was also supported by previous studies which showed that humic substances are preferentially removed through anion exchange resin adsorption in water samples with relatively high suva values humbert et al 2005 as shown in fig 1b when 20 ml of resin was dosed into 2 l of simulated source water the bromide level declined to 0 2 mg l with a removal rate of 90 meanwhile the released chloride was accumulated to 49 5 mg l when 30 50 ml of resin was added the bromide concentration further decreased from 0 2 to 0 1 mg l with removal rate increased from 90 to 95 and in the meantime the released chloride increased to 56 1 mg l besides nom and bromide the simulated source water contained a large amount 90 mg l as caco3 of bicarbonate as shown in fig 1c with the increasing resin dose the bicarbonate level gradually decreased suggesting that bicarbonate could be removed together with nom and bromide during resin adsorption process it has been pointed out that anions such as carbonate and bicarbonate could compete with bromide for adsorption sites hsu and singer 2010 since the removed amount of bicarbonate was significantly greater than that of bromide the released chloride to the water sample should mainly come from ion exchange between bicarbonate and the resin according to the above results a resin dose of 20 ml was applied for further experiments at this resin dose the removal percentages of doc and bromide were 93 7 and 90 respectively and 49 5 mg l of chloride could be released for electrolysis it has been reported that doc could be removed more efficiently from waters with higher suva values in which hydrophobic organic carbon was dominant furthermore high levels of anionic species might compete with nom for exchange sites on the resin thereby impacting nom removal by anion exchange boyer and singer 2005 however in real source waters doc could be more hydrophilic than srnom and other anions such as chloride and sulfate might also be present at significant levels thus we collected two source water samples from two local drinking water treatment plants in september 2019 the suva values of the two samples before resin adsorption were 0 66 and 0 74 l mg m which were much lower than that of srnom the levels of bromide bicarbonate chloride and sulfate in the two samples were 0 32 and 0 43 mg l 97 7 and 95 2 mg l as caco3 21 5 and 25 5 mg l and 43 4 and 41 3 mg l respectively with resin adsorption the doc removal rates in the two samples were 10 2 and 14 5 suggesting that doc is preferably removed in source water samples with higher suva values and lower anion concentrations notably ph of the simulated source water was relatively stable and only showed a slight decrease from 8 2 to 7 5 during resin adsorption fig 1c doc removal in anion exchange resin adsorption should be mainly related to the content of carboxylic acid and aromatic carbon in doc boyer et al 2008 and these components are mainly in their ionized forms at the aforementioned ph göbbels and püttmann 1997 therefore slight ph variations might not affect doc removal during resin adsorption 3 1 2 electrolysis after resin adsorption as shown in fig 2 a during electrolysis of a 100 mg l chloride solution formation of free chlorine increased with an increasing current intensity from 0 05 to 0 8 a at the current intensity of 0 05 a it took about 50 min to generate 5 mg l of free chlorine as the current intensity rose to 0 8 a the required time was shortened to only 2 min electrolysis at a higher current intensity facilitated oxidation of chloride to free chlorine at the anode and in the meantime supplied more electrons at the cathode similarly production of free chlorine was positively correlated to chloride 12 5 100 mg l and bicarbonate levels 0 100 mg l as caco3 in the water solutions fig 2b and c furthermore as indicated by fig 2d and e nom and bromide could also affect free chlorine generation but to a much lesser extent it is because that in a source water sample treated by resin adsorption a majority up to 90 of nom and bromide could be removed and their remaining levels are usually low at sub mg l levels accordingly for a 2 l simulated source water sample treated with 20 ml of resin a current intensity of 0 4 a was applied in the electrolysis process and the free chlorine generation with electrolysis time was depicted in fig 2f to produce 5 mg l free chlorine an electrolysis time of 192 s was required 3 2 control efficiency of halogenated dbps by the new approach for a better evaluation and comparison three simulated source water samples were treated with chemical chlorination alone 5 mg l naocl as cl2 resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination 20 ml resin per 2 l sample 5 mg l naocl as cl2 and the new approach 20 ml resin per 2 l sample electrolysis for 192 s respectively the chlorine contact time for the three samples was 12 h 3 2 1 tox four thms and five haas as displayed in fig 3 a the tox formed in the simulated source water sample treated with chemical chlorination alone was 415 3 μg l as cl and such a high tox level could be significantly decreased to 56 5 μg l as cl in the sample treated by the new approach achieving a removal rate of 86 4 in the simulated source water sample treated with resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination the tox level was also low 60 6 μg l as cl it was found that resin adsorption was very effective in removing precursors of halogenated dbps such as nom and bromide fig s1 and thus the tox reduction by the new approach should be mainly ascribed to the resin adsorption process as shown in fig 3b and c the concentrations of the four thms and five haas formed in the sample with chemical chlorination alone were 360 0 and 103 8 μg l respectively which in total accounted for 45 8 of the tox the new approach substantially decreased the concentrations of four thms and five haas by 98 5 from 360 0 to 5 3 μg l and 93 2 from 103 8 to 7 1 μg l respectively similar decrement was also found in the simulated source water sample treated with resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination suggesting that reduction of the four thms and five haas was mainly ascribed to resin adsorption brominated thms and haas were predominant species formed in the sample with chemical chlorination alone and their levels were greatly reduced during resin adsorption owing to the removal of their precursors i e bromide and nom although the levels of trichloromethane and monochloroacetic acid slightly increased with decreasing bromide concentration their concentrations were too low to affect the overall trend accordingly resin adsorption was effective in controlling the formation of thms and haas in addition higher formation of the four thms and five haas was observed in the sample treated with the new approach compared with the sample treated with resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination which could be ascribed to a more thorough decomposition of intermediate dbps by active species involved in electrolysis process 3 2 2 new phenolic dbps in our previous studies a total of 25 phenolic dbps were newly discovered in chlorinated drinking water with different bromide concentrations from 0 to 4 mg l pan and zhang 2013 huang et al 2018 these new phenolic dbps were classified into four groups according to structures including five halo 4 hydroxybenzaldehydes five halo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids six halosalicylic acids and nine halophenols these new phenolic dbps are of increasing concerns due to their higher growth inhibition and developmental toxicity than many regulated dbps yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 among the 25 new phenolic dbps 23 were detected in the simulated drinking water sample in this study as shown in fig 4 compared with chemical chlorination alone both the new approach and resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination enhanced the levels of these new phenolic dbps it was demonstrated that the new phenolic dbps were intermediate compounds and their formation during chlorination was highly related to bromide concentration in source water pan and zhang 2013 as bromide concentration increased from 0 2 to 2 mg l the fully chlorinated species showed a decreasing trend and the fully brominated and mixed chlorinated brominated species exhibited an increasing followed by decreasing trend the total concentration of the new phenolic dbps was higher at bromide level of 0 2 mg l than that at bromide level of 2 mg l pan and zhang 2013 during resin adsorption process the bromide concentration in the simulated source water sample remained decreasing from 2 to 0 2 mg l fig s1b which should be the main reason for the enhanced formation of the 23 new phenolic dbps in the subsequent chemical chlorination electrolysis although the levels of these phenolic dbps increased after treatment by the new approach their total concentration only accounted for 0 7 of the tox in that sample and thus was suspected not to significantly affect the overall toxicity reduction to verify this comparative cytotoxicity of the samples treated with chemical chlorination alone resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination and the new approach was investigated 3 3 comparative hep g2 cell cytotoxicity the three aforementioned samples simulated source water treated with chemical chlorination alone resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination and the new approach were also prepared and pretreated 104 concentration of the original sample in 100 μl of dmso for the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay this assay was conducted via evaluating percentages of viable cells incubated with the pretreated samples at varying concentration factors by regression analysis r 2 and ec50 values for each curve were determined a higher ec50 value suggested a lower cytotoxicity of a sample multiple comparisons among treatment and control groups were conducted via a one way analysis of variance anova followed by holm sidak multiple comparisons test differences were regarded to be statistically significant at p 0 05 as shown in fig 5 viability of the hep g2 cells treated with all these samples reduced significantly and the reduction was concentration factor dependent one way anova test at p 0 001 the 24 h ec50 values of the three samples followed the rank order of chemical chlorination alone 121 resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination 396 resin adsorption followed by electrolysis 388 compared with the sample treated with chemical chlorination alone cytotoxicity of the sample treated with the new approach was reduced by 68 8 the significant reduction of cytotoxicity matched well with that of tox suggesting that tox reduction should be the main reason for cytotoxicity reduction during treatment with the new approach 3 4 inactivation of microorganisms by the new approach besides control efficiency of dbps and toxicity another important aspect to assess the new disinfection approach was its disinfection ability as shown in fig 6 electrolysis disinfection could achieve 3 36 log10 reductions of all three bacteria within 19 s 0 5 mg l free chlorine was generated in this period e coli was the most vulnerable bacteria and could be removed by over 99 99 in just 3 s 0 1 mg l free chlorine was generated during this period p aeruginosa was second to e coli and showed a 4 44 log10 reduction in 19 s for s aureus there was a clear lag phase in the first 7 s and a 3 36 log10 reduction was observed after 19 s suggesting that s aureus exhibited higher resistance than e coli and p aeruginosa during chemical chlorination disinfection a 3 25 log10 reduction of e coli could be achieved until a free chlorine dose at 0 2 mg l inactivation of p aeruginosa and s aureus proceeded rather slowly and only 3 log10 reductions were observed at a free chlorine dose up to 1 0 mg l notably the comparative experiments clearly demonstrated the advantage of electrolysis disinfection for microorganism inactivation not only for conventional bacteria i e e coli but also for those chlorine resistant bacteria i e p aeruginosa and s aureus for chemical chlorination disinfection the effective species is free chlorine cl2 hocl and clo whereas for electrolysis disinfection the disinfection could occur via 1 direct oxidation of microorganisms on the anode s surface caused by a direct transfer of electrons between the cells and the electrode cotillas et al 2018 as well as 2 indirect oxidation by in situ generation of various oxidants e g cl2 hocl clo oh h2o2 o3 etc jeong et al 2006 bergmann et al 2008 diao et al 2004 suggested the high efficiency of electrolysis disinfection could be provided by energy rich and short lived free radicals such as oh for which the c t value was reported to be approximately 104 times lower than that for chlorine cho et al 2004 liu et al 1997 attributed the mechanism of electrolysis disinfection to its disruption of bacterial membrane integrity and electrolysis of molecules on the cell surface which agreed with results from others wang et al 2010 4 conclusions in this study a new disinfection approach using chloride form anion exchange resin adsorption followed by electrolysis was developed compared with chemical chlorination alone the new approach could substantially decrease the levels of tox and regulated dbps like thms and haas which should be mainly ascribed to the resin adsorption process since similar decrement was also found in the sample treated with resin adsorption followed by chemical chlorination although the new approach might enhance the levels of a few phenolic dbps as a result of bromide reduction during resin adsorption the overall cytotoxicity of the water samples was still decreased by 68 8 the electrolysis process in the new approach not only changed trash chloride into treasure free chlorine but also achieved effective inactivation of both common and chlorine resistant bacteria considering the strong oxidation ability of electrolysis concentrations of inorganic dbps that possibly formed in water samples bromate chlorate and chlorite were determined to be far below the u s epa guidelines besides surface water this new approach might also be applied in treatment of most ground water and even swimming pool water with appropriate parameter adjustment and optimization to save electricity during electrolysis process solar energy batteries could be a promising power supply mode to be adopted in the new approach in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18391,arsenic contamination threatens the safety of drinking water in many parts of the world especially as ш which is more toxic and more difficult to remove than as ⅴ hence in terms of environmental protection and sustainable development it is very important to remove as ш from the environment to reduce the damage to ecosystems and human health since there is no effective method for removing as ш it is essential to oxidize as ш into easily removable as ⅴ to achieve effective separation herein a novel copper coated mno2 nanowires membrane cu mnm which combines the oxidation properties of mno2 and the catalytic and absorption properties of nanoscale cu nscu was developed based on in situ chemical deposition nscu on the surface of ultralong mno2 nanowires the as prepared cu mnm shows excellent arsenic separation properties with the maximum rejection rate of 96 the results of ph studies indicate that acidic conditions promote the separation of as ш by cu mnm while alkaline conditions are inhibitory due to deprotonation of cu mnm surface enhances electrostatic repulsion the results of the interfering ions show that the phosphate ions have a strong inhibitory effect on arsenic separation in addition cu mnm has been shown to be remarkably recyclable and can still achieve a separation efficiency of 60 after five cycles therefore the prepared cu mnm with the high arsenic retention efficiency and excellent recycling capabilities has the potential to become an excellent candidate for practical application in arsenic separation graphical abstract image 1 keywords as removal oxidation cu nanoparticles membrane process separation mechanism 1 introduction arsenic as is a high toxic and carcinogenic metalloid element widely distributed in drinking water and industrial wastewater it is usually present in the aqueous phase system in the form of arsenite as ш and arsenate as v compared with as v as ш is more toxic because of its high affinity for the sulfhydryl groups of proteins jamshidi gohari et al 2013 wei et al 2019 simultaneously in view of the fact that as ш is more soluble and more mobile than as v therefore it is difficult to be removed from water more importantly long term exposure to arsenic compounds as ш can cause serious and permanent damage to human health and ecological system including genetic toxicity dermal changes and interference with the immune system even neurological disorders which result the world health organization who set the maximum contaminant level mcl of arsenic to 10 μg l kim et al 2015 zhang and fang 2010 however it is estimated that 150 million people in more than 70 countries are at unhealthy level of arsenic due to drinking contaminated water brammer and ravenscroft 2009 hence the efficient arsenite as ш separation with environmentally friendly and simple operation process is still an important challenge to date several broad treatment options for removing arsenic from drinking water are investigated these technologies include chemisorption filtration du et al 2013 biological treatment liu et al 2018 yu et al 2013 adsorption huling et al 2017 szlachta et al 2012 and ion exchange an et al 2011 choi et al 2003 ortega et al 2017 however these methods have limitations for practical applications due to the technical and environmental constrains such as their high cost requiring many tedious and time consuming separation processes among these technologies adsorption technology has received extensive attention in wastewater treatment due to its low cost convenience and high efficiency accordingly a mass of adsorbents which requires high adsorption capacity and an affinity for arsenic has been studied such as zero valent iron su and puls 2001 magnetite fe3o4 chandra et al 2010 fe ti mn composite oxide chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 modified activated carbon chang et al 2010 peng et al 2018 and graphene oxide mnfe2o4 nanohybrids kumar et al 2014 which are commonly used but are complicated by the need for medial regeneration meanwhile the particles used for absorption are often tend to be released into the water after filtration resulting in secondary pollution which greatly limits the practical application therefore novel adsorbent materials and arsenic separation technologies to overcome the above shortcomings are particularly important and functional composite membranes have received more attention in recent years on the other hand membrane separation technologies are a promising arsenic treatment technology with simple operation and low chemical requirements compared with other technologies which has broad application prospects for instance m t uddin et al fabricated thin nanofiltration membrane which is used to remove arsenic from the aqueous solution uddin et al 2007 but the efficiency of removal as ш is poor compared with as v consequently this method cannot meet the mcl stipulated by who and has been greatly restricted in the specific application process to enhance the removal efficiency of as ш ge et al reported the fabrication of hierarchical iron containing γ mno2 oxidizes as ш to as v and then removes it from the water ge et al 2016 also zhang et al reported that the arsenic in the aqueous phase was pretreated with mno2 prior to nanofiltration to oxidize as ш to as v zhang et al 2007 these reports confirm the mno2 pretreated as ш aqueous solution which can achieve excellent removal efficiency more recently α mno2 nanowires with high specific surface area and sufficient contact sites are being used for efficient as ш removal via oxidation or surface adsorption simultaneously according to the previous article α mno2 nanowires have excellent membrane forming properties and can be used as a good substrate membrane to convert as ш to as ⅴ he et al 2019 yue et al 2018a however the passivation phenomenon of the surface of α mno2 nanowires after a period of time and the low adsorption capacity of as ш of mno2 limit its practical application value jamshidi gohari et al 2013 wang et al 2015a hence how to construct the functional membranes with high catalytic oxidation efficiency high rejection rate and environmental compatibility is of great importance in recent years nscu is attracting more and more attention due to its good catalytic capability and low costs gawande et al 2016 for example wang et al reported that copper doped fe3o4 particles can catalyze the oxidation of as ш to as v and significantly enhance the separation efficient of arsenic as compared to bare fe3o4 wang et al 2015b these results suggest the potential of nscu as a promising material for the removal of arsenic from drinking water is very tremendous with these in mind based on the catalytic and adsorbent properties of nscu and the oxidation properties of α mno2 the prepared cu mnm composite membrane can overcome the phenomenon of α mno2 surface passivation so as to achieve the oxidation of as ш to as v and further achieve excellent separation efficiency as such since the surface of α mno2 nanowires has hydroxyl groups and negative charges the nscu can be fixed to the surface through coordination to prevent nscu from breaking out from the surface of the substrate membrane and contaminating the filtered water thence the development of cu mnm with excellent catalyst performance and high separation efficiency are considered to be key factors for arsenic separation the present work was aimed to investigate mno2 nanowire membrane mnm and cu mnm composite membrane for arsenic decontamination in an aqueous solution via membrane filtration separation method herein dynamic cu mnm was fabricated based on in situ chemical deposition nscu on the surface of ultralong mno2 nanowires to self assemble into the composite membrane and the hybrid membranes are further applied to separate arsenic from solution additionally different influencing factors were studied to optimize the experiment conditions such as initial as ш concentrations nscu contents solution ph interfering ions and operating pressure the present work gives a novel route to develop nanowire hybrid membranes with dynamic features high efficiency excellent circulation for the separation of as ш from contaminated aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o 99 0

of mno2 nanowire and nscu as described in our previous study the mno2 nanowires were prepared by a typical hydrothermal method using the mnso4 h2o as precursor qiu et al 2019 yue et al 2018b in a typical synthesis experiment a mixed solution containing 13 g of potassium sulfate 41 g of potassium persulfate and 13 g of manganese sulfate monohydrate was dispersed in a 250 ml beaker containing 130 ml of deionized water under vigorously stirring at room temperature then the mixed solution was transferred into 200 ml stainless steel autoclave and reacted in an oven at 250 c for five days to obtain a bulk mno2 nanowires detail preparation process mno2 nanowires was shown in supplementary information and thus the nscu were prepared by reducing divalent copper with hydrazine hydrate typically 0 75 g of cuso4 5h2o and 3 6 g of naoh were dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water respectively under vigorously magnetic stirring the naoh solution was slowly added into the cuso4 5h2o solution and 2 ml of c2n2h8 was simultaneously slowly added to the solution in addition 2 ml of n2h4 was diluted in 60 ml of deionized water to form a homogeneous solution then the n2h4 solution was added dropwise to the solution prepared above after addition the resulting suspension was stirred continuously for 4 h at 30 c to form uniform nscu suspensions the suspension was centrifuged in anhydrous ethanol for 7 8 times to obtained nscu and the as prepared nscu was stored in anhydrous ethanol before use 2 3 fabrication of dynamic cu mnm the dynamic cu mnm was fabricated by depositing nscu on the surface of mno2 nanowires and then assembling into membrane in a typical procedure 0 16 g of nscu was dispersed in 20 ml of anhydrous ethanol and then treated with ultrasound for 40 min to form a suspension with uniform dispersion subsequently 40 ml of the obtained mno2 nanowire suspension was slowly added to the suspension of uniform nscu and then the nscu was deposited on the surface

the surface of samples were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrophotometer thermo nicolet nexus tm from 400 to 4000 cm 1 surface element composition and chemical valences of cu mnm before and after separation were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps on thermo escalab 250 xi solution sample containing total arsenic were measured by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer optimal 2100dv the content of as iii was determined by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs the concentration of as ⅴ was determined by the difference between the total concentration of arsenic and the concentration of as ш 2 5 batch separation experiment of as ш in this work the performance of cu mnm the diameter is 4 cm was evaluated by using sodium arsenite as the model arsenic source arsenic was extracted from arsenite solution by using nscu as catalyst to accelerate the redox reaction between mno2 and as ш the separation process was shown in scheme 1 the as prepared cu mnm was fixed in a sand core funnel sand core funnel and experimental device are shown in fig s5 and then the liquid passes through the cu mnm under the gravity drive and the properties of the cu mnm in terms of rejection rate for the treatment of aqueous solution containing as ш under different influencing factors such as solution ph as ш concentrations and nscu contents on the surface of cu mnm interfering ions and operate pressures the ph was adjusted by adding 0 1m naoh and hcl finally the separation efficiencies r of as ш was calculated by the following formula r 1 c t c o ⅹ 100 where c o and c t are the concentration of initial arsenic solution and permeate respectively the r represents the rejection rate of arsenic by cu mnm the flux should be kept constant throughout the separation process and the permeate flux f was calculated by the following equation s f v s t where v l s m2 and t h are the volume of permeate solution effective surface of cu mnm and the separation time respectively all batch separation experiments were carried out at 25 c the volume of the initial solution was 50 ml and the separation time for each experiment was 3 h and arsenic separation experiments was replicated three times 2 6 desorption and regeneration study in addition to high removal efficiency the ideal separation materials should have excellent regeneration and recycling performance which is an important factor in the practical application of water purification therefore the reusability of cu mnm for as ш removal was investigated by desorption and regeneration after the as ш separation process was completed the as ш saturated nanocomposite membrane was treated with alkali solution before the nanomaterials could be reused shahrin et al 2018 after separation cu mnm was immersed in naoh solution 0 5 m for 2 h to remove arsenic from the surface and then a layer of nscu was grafted on the surface for the next experiment then the separation study was carried out again to investigate the separation performance of cu mnm after desorption and regeneration process all reusability separation experiment was carried out under the same arsenic separation conditions ph remains at 6 3 concentrations at 40 mg l pressure was maintained at atmospheric pressure at last the removal efficiency of as ш was measured and the reusability process of cu mnm was illustrated in scheme 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology characterization during the separation process in order to study the morphology and structure evolution of specimens before and after arsenic separation the samples were characterized by sem as revealed in fig 1 a the obtained nscu with a very small size can be better deposited on the surface of mno2 nanowires the surface morphology of the mnm can be seen from fig 1b showing the mnm is composed of abundant randomly oriented ultralong nanowires with lengths over 100 μm and nscu can be better distributed on the surface of mnm due to the extra long structure feature fig 1c shows the as prepared cu mnm specimen had a dendritic micro nanostructure with a diameter of several tens of nanometers in addition it was seen that the nscu was well dispersed on the surface of the mno2 nanowires proving that cu mnm was successfully prepared besides to confirm the structure of prepared composites afm characterization were performed fig s1 and fig s2 show the surface roughness and thickness of cu mnm respectively fig s1a and fig s1b presents 3d afm images of the membranes prepared by loading different nscu it is clear from these images that the surface properties of the prepared film depend on the amount of nscu particles added and the roughness of this surface is 6 096 nm and 8 156 nm respectively in addition the afm image further demonstrates that nscu is successfully coated on the surface of the mnm via irregular nscu particles and unrecognized mno2 nanowires furthermore it can be seen from fig s2 that the cu mnm composite film has a thickness of approximately 1 μm which contributes to sufficient contact with the target thereby achieving higher arsenic separation efficiency however compared with cu mnm before separation the nscu on the surface of the separated cu mnm is more clustered together and the results are shown in fig 1d it may be attributed to the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш during the separation process which causes the nscu shedding at the reaction site to be adsorbed by nscu on the surface of the mno2 nanowire which is not involved in the reaction resulting in more aggregation besides it is noteworthy that the thickness of the nscu is slightly increased probably due to the successful sequestration of arsenic on the surface of cu mnm in order to understand the composition of the chemical elements on the surface of the cu mnm the eds analysis was conducted on the as prepared samples before and after separation and the results were illustrated in fig s3 and fig s4 fig s3 shows that the contents of the three elements o mn and cu were 5 47 11 61 and 82 91 respectively implying that the cu mnm was successfully prepared as shown in fig s4 compared with cu mnm before separation arsenic was detected in the sample after separation proving that arsenic was successfully separated additionally the elemental content of nscu only changed slightly indicating that cu mnm has good stability and is not easy to cause secondary pollution to further demonstrate that nscu was successfully coated on the surface of the mnm this sample was characterized by tem as shown in fig 2 fig 2a shows the tem image of mnm from which it can be clearly seen that the mnm composite membrane is composed of smooth monodisperse mno2 nanowires furthermore the smooth surface of mno2 nanowires provides more sites for nscu which helps nscu to successfully coat the surface of mnm the tem image of cu mnm is shown in fig 2b compared to the pure mno2 nanowires the surface of the nscu attached mno2 nanowires changed significantly indicating that cu mnm was successfully coated on the surface of the nanowires the eds spectrum proves that the surface element is nscu and the cu mnm was successfully prepared besides it can be clearly seen that the nscu coated mno2 nanowires resemble a dendritic structure which facilitates sufficient contact with the target to improve the separation efficiency of as ш 3 2 structure characterization for this separation process arsenic in solution usually attached to the surface of samples and the activated adsorption site depends on the specific surface area and pore structure of mnm and cu mnm hence the specific surface area and pore distribution of mnm and cu mnm were investigated by the brunauer emmett teller bet method and barrent joyner halent bjh model and the results are illustrated in fig 3 fig 3a exhibits a typical ⅳ type isotherm and a h3 hysteresis loop in a relatively high p p0 range 0 8 1 indicating the existence of mesoporous structures in mnm and the bet specific surface area value is 9 41 m2 g besides the bjh method is also used to study the pore size distribution of mnm as shown in inset fig 3a the pore size distribution of mnm is concentrated at 2 9 nm and the pore volume of the pore is 0 037 cm3 g testifying that mnm mainly exists in mesoporous structure fig 3b shows that cu mnm has a higher specific surface area and a higher pore volume and the corresponding results are 16 81 m2 g and 0 05 cm3 g respectively this possible reason is attributed to the higher specific surface area of nscu which increases the specific surface area of the cu mnm when it is successfully coated on the surface of the mnm the inset of fig 3b shows the pore size distribution curve revealing that cu mnm has a mesoporous structure and the pore size distributes in the range of 2 5 7 5 nm and this mesoporous structure contributes to the separation of arsenic and has potential application value to investigate the molecular structure evolution and composition of surface functional groups during arsenic separation the mnm and cu mnm before and after arsenic separation were characterized by xrd and ft ir and the corresponding results were shown in fig 4 fig 4a a shows that nscu have strong absorption peaks nearby at 760 23 cm 1 1090 42 cm 1 and 1337 34 cm 1 which could be assigned to bending vibrations of cu o and symmetric stretching vibration of c o and c n respectively manifesting the nscu was successfully prepared fig 4a b shows that three adsorption peaks at 450 34 cm 1 520 16 cm 1 and 720 24 cm 1 are consistent with mn o stretching vibrations indicating mnm was successfully prepared compared to the infrared spectra of nscu and mnm fig 4a c shows both the absorption peak of nscu and the absorption peak of mnm proving that cu mnm was successfully prepared fig 4a d shows that the peak of mno2 was weakened but the as o peak was detected at 504 21 cm 1 and it is attributed to the redox reaction of mno2 and arsenic simultaneously the arsenic is adsorbed on the surface of the membrane in addition considering that the separated arsenic adheres to the surface of nscu may cause the infrared peak of nscu may not be detected in order to further investigate the structural evolution of specimen during arsenite separation the xrd patterns of the nscu α mno2 nanowire cu mnm before and after separation are shown in fig 4b as can be seen from fig 4b a nscu shows sharp and intensity peaks at 2θ of 43 5 50 6 and 74 2 respectively which are consistent with the reported values jcpds no jpsn 85 1236 however the peak of carbon was retrieved at 22 which may be attributed to the fact that carbon containing organics are introduced during the preparation of nscu in addition it should be noticed that the characteristic peak at 2θ of 38 9 is ascribed to the cuo diffraction probably due to the reaction of nscu with dissolved oxygen to produce o2 and cu2 as shown in fig 4b b all of the diffraction peaks of the as prepared mno2 specimen was consistent with those of the pure crystalline phase of α mno2 jpsn 72 1982 and no additional diffraction peaks or other phase were detected indicating the high purity of the mnm the xrd pattern of cu mnm before separation is shown in fig 4b c compared to pure α mno2 it is apparent that a sharp and intensity characteristic peak of nscu can be observed whereas it can be clearly observed from fig 4b c that the peak of mno2 is weakened which may be attributed to nscu loading on the surface of mno2 affects the diffraction of mno2 and cause the characteristic peak of mno2 to decrease compared with the initial cu mnm fig 4b d shown the characteristic reflections peak of mno2 disappears and falls obviously and the peak intensity of nscu only decreases slightly after arsenite separation which may be assumed that mno2 and arsenite undergo redox reactions therefore the characteristic reflection peak of mno2 becomes weaker or partially disappears but due to the adhesion of arsenic to the surface of cu mnm the peak of nscu dropped slightly besides the electrons generated during the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш reduce cu2 to zero valent copper causing the diffraction peak of some cuo to disappear furthermore the amorphous phase of arsenic attached to the surface of cu mnm can be further proved by xps analysis 3 3 mechanisms for arsenic removal by the cu mnm nanocomposites in the process of separation of arsenic the device used is a sand core funnel its diameter is much larger than the target and the separation of arsenic cannot be achieved by using only the core funnel therefore the separation of arsenic is finally achieved by cu mnm the composition and chemical state of solid surface elements can be confirmed by xps providing useful information for the remove mechanism of as ш and the corresponding xps results were displayed in fig 5 in fig 5a the peaks of cu2p binding energy at about 932 5 ev and 949 6 ev are assigned to cu2p2 3 and cu2p2 1 it is obvious that the nscu changed little before and after the separation suggesting that it acted as a catalyst during the whole process of arsenic separation however the apparent peak of cu2 increases after arsenic separation implying nscu reacts with dissolved oxygen to form cu2 and o2 during the separation of arsenic moreover the resulting cu2 act as electron transfer centers accelerating the reaction between mno2 and as ш it should be noted that the bulk material of nscu was still elemental nscu consistent with the low intensity peak of cuo in the xrd spectrum of nscu the mn2p spectra before and after arsenic separation were shown in fig 5b for before arsenic separation the peaks of the mn2p binding energy at about 641 8 ev and 653 8 ev are assigned to mn2p3 2 and mn2p1 2 respectively implying the presence of mn ⅳ however the shift in binding energy of mno2 after arsenic separation indicates that the redox reaction of mno2 and arsenic causes a change in the valence the change of the chemical states of mn could be further demonstrated by the fitting of mn peak of for specimen after arsenic separation the inset in fig 5b in which the presence of mn ⅱ and mn ш could be ascribed to a sharp decrease in mn ⅳ this result indicates that mno2 was involved in the oxidation reaction of as ш according to the binding energy of oxygen the o1s spectra before arsenic separation was assigned to oxygen bonded to metal mn o at 531 6 ev as shown in fig 5c it can be clearly seen that the peak of oxygen has shifted from 531 6 ev to 530 5 ev resulting in the formation of new metal oxygen bonds such as as o bonds this result also proves that arsenic was successfully trapped on the surface of cu mnm moreover fig 5d shows the high resolution xps as3d spectrum of cu mnm after arsenic separation obviously the peak of as3d can be observed on the surface of cu mnm the as3d curve could be fitted with three different peaks at 43 8 ev 45 2 ev and 48 8 ev are assigned to as ш o and as ⅴ o respectively and the proportion of the latter is higher than the former according to the integral area this result indicated that a certain portion of as ш was first oxidized to as ⅴ and then adsorbed on the surface of cu mnm in addition the results also show that as ш can also adsorb on the surface of cu mnm according to the analysis of xps above a probable mechanism shows in scheme 3 for cu mnm removal of as ш was preliminary proposed as follow firstly some of the as ш in the initial solution migrates to the surface of cu mnm secondly the as ш on the surface of cu mnm was in situ oxidized to as ⅴ by mno2 during the filtration process while the mno2 was reduced to mn ш and mn ⅱ as mno2 was reduced and dissolved the preoccupied sites were released leaving new mno2 active sites to continue to oxidized as ш at the same time more nscu atoms were exposed new active site was formed on the surface of cu mnm furthermore the new active site and arsenic form a complex to adsorb arsenic on the surface of cu mnm to achieve the separation of arsenic more importantly in the whole separation process nscu not only acts as an adsorbent to absorb as ш and as ⅴ but also acts as a catalyst to accelerate the oxidation of as ш to as ⅴ by mno2 to avoid the passivation on the surface of mno2 more studies have shown that mno2 oxidizes as ш into as ⅴ in two steps uddin et al 2007 and the reaction proceeds as shown in the following equation 2 m n o 2 h 3 a s o 3 c u 2 m n o o h h 3 a s o 4 2 m n o o h h 3 a s o 3 c u 2 m n o h 3 a s o 4 h 2 o to sum up the obtained cu mnm specimen reveals significantly arsenic removal properties which was attributed to the combination of several advantageous characteristics first of all nscu acts as a catalyst to accelerate the oxidation of as ш into as ⅴ by mno2 enhancing the adsorption capacity of arsenic additionally cu mnm has a higher surface area and abundant surfaces active sites as well as porous characteristics which was beneficial to enhance the oxidative conversion and absorption of as ш 3 3 1 mechanism of nscu accelerated reaction the possible mechanism of nscu accelerating the reaction of mno2 and as ш is proposed to further study the separation process of arsenic wang et al 2015b and han et al 2019 pointed out that copper reacts with dissolved oxygen in the solution to produce cu2 and o2 accelerating the transfer of electrons between the oxidant and the reducing agent to accelerate the reaction rate the specific process is as follows first nscu reacts with dissolved oxygen in the solution to form cu2 and o2 then as the center of electron transfer cu2 and o2 accelerates the reaction between mno2 and as ш to achieve a more efficient conversion of as ш to as ⅴ in order to further confirm the above hypothesis batch adsorption experiments were carried out to study the removal effect of as iii under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and compared with pure mnm and different types of arsenic in the permeate were measured as shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows the removal efficiency of arsenic by pure mnm a and cu mnm under anaerobic b and aerobic c conditions it is found that the pure mnm has only a 20 lower removal efficiency and the removal efficiency of cu mnm under anaerobic conditions is still low however cu mnm can achieve a removal efficiency of 90 in the aerobic condition and achieve adsorption equilibrium in a very short time these results testify that the above assumption that nscu can accelerate the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш to achieve higher removal efficiency fig 6b shows that the content of as ш as ш increased from 7 99 mg l to 17 69 mg l and as ⅴ as ⅴ increased from 1 68 mg l to 4 34 mg l in the permeate shows an increasing trend but eventually stabilizes the final equilibrium can be attributed to the saturation of cu mnm separation of arsenic it can be clearly seen that as ⅴ appears in the permeate indicating that mno2 can oxidize as ш to as ⅴ however the content of as ш is significantly higher than that of as ⅴ suggesting that as ш is oxidized to as ⅴ and then adsorbed on the surface of cu mnm this result is consistent with the results of the xps analysis so the content of as ⅴ in the permeation is very small these results further indicate that cu mnm can oxidize as ш to as ⅴ and then achieve efficient separation of arsenic besides the mechanism of cu mnm separation of arsenic also proved 3 3 2 adsorption behavior of arsenic by nscu in order to verify the adsorption performance of nscu on arsenic static adsorption experiments at different equilibrium concentrations were carried out and the results of different model fitting were shown in fig 7 fig 7 compares langmuir isotherm a and freundlich isotherm b fitting of the results of static adsorption experiments based on the analysis of the fitted curve compared with the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 829 the langmuir isotherm model r2 0 996 is more suitable for the adsorption of arsenic by nscu consistent with the results reported in previous literature the corresponding fitting results of langmuir and freundlich are shown in table s1 luan et al 2019 accordingly the maximum adsorption value of arsenic by nscu is calculated to be 32 97 mg g which is comparable to the previously reported cuo nanoparticles goswami et al 2012 martinson and reddy 2009 this result demonstrated that this potential mechanism contributes to a more efficient separation of arsenic in aqueous solution 3 4 batch separation behaviors in this separation system the rejection rate of the mnm and cu mnm are largely determined by different initial concentrations operation pressure ph and coexisting ions therefore it is necessary to investigate the removal efficiency of different influencing factors of arsenic by mnm and cu mnm and the correspond results are shown in fig 8 the removal efficiency of pure mnm and nscu modified mnm at different concentrations of arsenic can been seen from fig 8a the volume of the solution containing as ш was kept at 50 ml and then the solutions of 20 mg l 40 mg l 60 mg l 80 mg l and 100 mg l were respectively passed through mnm and cu mnm showing that the mnm has a removal efficiency of only 10 30 with an initial concentration of arsenic from 20 mg l to 100 mg l the volume of the initial solution is 50 ml and the separation time for each experiment is 3 h implying that the surface of mno2 is more susceptible to passivation during the oxidation of as ш to as ⅴ with the concentrations increases which causes the as ш is difficult to be immobilized simultaneously as ш has strong fluidity and cannot be fully oxidized into easily immobilized as ⅴ resulting in mnm has a very low arsenic removal efficiency and the result is consistent with previous article reports luo et al 2012 in contrast mnm modified by nscu 78 92 mg m2 can achieve 94 33 arsenic removal efficiency which proves that nscu have a significantly enhancement effect on as ш removal this result is attributed to the fact that nscu can accelerate the oxidation of as ш with high mobility into as ⅴ to achieve better fixation and thus achieving higher removal efficiency however it is noteworthy that the removal efficiency of arsenic decreases with increasing arsenic concentration which is attributed to the concentration of the main factors affecting the separation process at this time and the high concentration makes the mno2 surface more easily passivated and the removal efficiency is reduced on the other hand as the concentration increases the surface of cu mnm is more likely to form a layer of pollutants hindering the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш resulting in cu mnm has a lower removal efficiency of arsenic at high concentrations in the actual separation process of arsenic the pressure often has an important influence so the separation efficiency of arsenic is investigated under different operating pressures and the corresponding results are illustrated in fig 8b the pressure was adjusted by an external three way device fig s5 shows the separation device of the experiment and then the separation efficiencies of mnm and cu mnm at 20 kpa 40 kpa 60 kpa 80 kpa and 100 kpa were tested respectively fig 8b shows that the mnm has a lower rejection rate and the rejection rate almost reaches zero with increasing pressure proving that mnm has a lower separation efficiency of arsenic compared with mnm cu mnm has improved the retention rate of arsenic but still has a low separation efficiency and the rejection rate of cu mnm on arsenic decreased from 28 33 to 2 20 accompanying the operating pressure increased from 20 kpa to 100 kpa implying that the separation process needs to maintain sufficient contact time between cu mnm and arsenic containing solution as the pressure increases the time for the solution to pass through the cu mnm composite membrane becomes faster and faster resulting in insufficient reaction time for mno2 and as ш hence the efficiency of arsenic separation by cu mnm decreases sharply with increasing operating pressure in a specific application the ph of the solution can affect the species of arsenic and the charge on the surface of the filter media as well as the rate of redox reactions it is necessary to investigate the effect of ph on the separation of as ш by mnm and cu mnm during the arsenic separation experiment the solutions of different ph values were passed through mnm and cu mnm under normal pressure conditions then the filtrate was collected and the concentration of the target was tested to study the removal efficiency of mnm and cu mnm the effect of ph on the efficiency of separation of arsenic by mnm and cu mnm were shown in fig 8c testifying that the mnm has a lower separation efficiency indicating that the pure mnm has a lower separation efficiency of arsenic compared with pure mnm cu mnm has higher separation efficiency of arsenic suggesting that nscu has an irreplaceable role in the separation process of arsenic as can be seen from fig 8c the removal of as is obviously dependent on the ph value which can reach the maximum separation efficiency of 96 91 under acidic conditions but decreases sharply with the increase of the ph value of the solution the rejection rate dropped from 96 91 to 29 63 more importantly it is found that cu mnm can achieve a separation efficiency of more than 75 in the ph range of 3 7 which is ascribed to arsenic is mainly present in the form of h2aso4 and h2aso4 2 under the tested ph range simultaneously the acid environment is favorable for mno2 to oxidized as ш into as ⅴ meanwhile the lower ph favors the protonation of the cu mnm membrane surface adsorbent the increase in protonation is believed to increase the positively charged sites and enlarge the attraction force between the surface of cu mnm and as anions and thereby increasing the separation efficiency in the lower ph region however in the high ph range 7 11 it is not conducive to the oxidation of as ш to as ⅴ by mno2 which causes arsenic to exist in solution mainly in the form of h3aso3 and h2aso3 whereas as ш is very difficult to be separated in solution and the result is consistent with previous literature reports han et al 2019 on the other hand the negative charge sites with higher ph values were dominant on the surface of cu mnm and the repulsion effect increased may causes the separation efficiency decreased accordingly usually arsenic contaminated water contains other common anions which may compete with arsenic for the active sites on the surface of cu mnm and thus affect the separation efficiency of arsenic thus five different coexisting anions including so4 2 co3 2 cl no3 and po4 3 were investigated at different concentrations the molar ratio of anion to arsenic is from 1 1 to 2 1 for the separation efficiency of arsenic and the corresponding results are shown in fig 8d during the interfering ion test in addition to the interfering ions the other separation conditions are kept the same and then the arsenic and interfering ions are passed through the mnm and cu mnm respectively fig 8d shows that the presence of cl and no3 has no effect on the removal of arsenic in addition fig 8d shows that sulfate has a slight effect on the separation of arsenic compared to chloride and nitrate and it is attributed to the high negative charge density of sulfate that is more easily absorbed by nscu compared with sulfate carbonate has a significant inhibitory effect on the separation of arsenic and the removal efficiency of arsenic decreased from 72 69 to 63 56 with the increase of concentration this main reason is described to the fact that carbonate has a higher charge density and is more easily absorbed in the meantime carbonate hydrolysis causes the solution to become alkaline and the alkaline environment inhibits the separation efficiency of arsenic which is consistent with the results of ph analysis however among these anions phosphate ions have the greatest negative effect on the separation process of arsenic and the rejection rate decreased from 50 32 to 30 23 as the concentration increases the high inhibition of phosphate in the separation of arsenic may be described to the chemical similarity between phosphate and arsenate both phosphate and arsenic are located in the same main group so phosphate ions have a similar molecular structure to arsenic ions therefore phosphate can compete with arsenic for binding sites available on the surface of cu mnm adverse effects of phosphate on arsenic separation have been reported in previous studies luxton et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 furthermore interference analysis of different anions has important guiding significance in the actual arsenic separation process the stability of the material in the actual separation process and whether there will be particles released into the water to cause secondary pollution are crucial therefore the content of mn in the permeate was monitored by icp to prove that cu mnm would not cause secondly pollution as shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 that the content of mn in the permeate increases gradually during the separation process but eventually approaches the equilibrium state the reason is attributed to the redox reaction between mno2 and as ш during the arsenic separation process which causes mn to be released into the water but only a very small amount is released into the water the maximum content is only 2 34 μg l which is far less than the standard that the content of mn in drinking water is less than 0 1 mg l this result indicates that cu mnm does not cause secondary pollution to the aqueous solution during the separation process of arsenic hence it is a material with broad application prospects in wastewater treatment 3 5 effect of nscu load and reusability of cu mnm in the process of arsenic separation the nscu as active material play an importantly role in the arsenic separation efficiency and the reusability of cu mnm and the results are displayed in fig 10 as shown in fig 10a as the specific nscu loading increased from 23 32 mg m2 to 138 36 mg m2 the removal rete of arsenic by cu mnm increased from 52 30 to 95 32 and finally reached the state of separation equilibrium these results indicate that the mass of nscu in cu mnm composite membrane plays a very important role in the separation of arsenic which may be that with the increase of nscu the passivation phenomenon on the surface of mno2 can be effectively avoided thus promoting the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш to reach the equilibrium state hence nscu have an irreplaceable role in the separation of arsenic apart from the high separation efficiency the ideal separation materials should have excellent recycling and regeneration properties which is a crucial consideration in the development of actual applications of water remediation including reducing the total cost of contaminant removal and promoting sustainable development the effect regeneration property of cu mnm specimen was investigated by continuous absorption and desorption cycles and the results are illustrated in fig 10b as shown in fig 10b the regenerated cu mnm showed a decreased rejection rate on as ш which may be ascribed to the content of mno2 decreases with the increase of cycle times making the as ш difficult to be oxidized into easily removed as ⅴ despite that it is noteworthy that the rejection rate 60 can still be achieved after absorption desorption and regeneration five times indicating that cu mnm is a potential separation material for arsenic table 1 shows the comparison of rejection rate of arsenic by different membranes the separation efficiency of nscu functionalized mnm is much higher than traditional separation membrane such as nanofiltration membrane es10 nanofiltration membrane ntr 7250 and ozonation and ultrafiltration etc and can achieve a maximum separation efficiency of 96 at the same time due to the excellent regenerability of cu mnm it may have greater potential in practical applications 4 conclusions a novel cu mnm separation materials with a high removal rate of as ш were fabricated based on in situ chemical deposition nscu on the surface of ultralong mno2 nanowires to assemble the hybrid membrane the sem maps reveal the changes in morphology of cu mnm before and after separation testifying nscu was successfully loaded on the surface of mnw and arsenic was successfully separated and the obtained mnm and cu mnm with a higher specific surface area 9 41 m2 g and 16 81 m2 g and high pore volumes 0 037 cm3 g and 0 05 cm3 g respectively furthermore xrd and xps spectra confirmed that arsenic was successfully extracted and enriched on the surface of cu mnm in addition the separation mechanism of oxidation and absorption has also been proved and the catalytic acceleration mechanism of nscu has been further explored and experimentally proved in the results of the batch separation experiment the novel cu mnm membrane separation materials has high as ш removal efficiency and can achieve 96 separation efficiency of as ш at the same time it has a higher separation effect under acidic conditions and is inhibited under alkaline conditions resulting in a decrease in separation efficiency furthermore the pressure experiment proves that the separation process must ensure sufficient contact time between the material and the target in addition among the anions tested phosphate ions have a strong inhibitory effect on arsenic separation and the inhibitory effect increased with increasing concentration what s more it should be noted that it is beneficial to the separation of arsenic in a strong acidic environment and the inhibition of arsenic separation in an alkaline environment more importantly cu mnm can still maintain separation efficiency of more than 60 after five cycles indicating that the cu mnm has good recyclability hence the oxidizing properties of cu mnm and its excellent separation properties which make it a

18391,arsenic contamination threatens the safety of drinking water in many parts of the world especially as ш which is more toxic and more difficult to remove than as ⅴ hence in terms of environmental protection and sustainable development it is very important to remove as ш from the environment to reduce the damage to ecosystems and human health since there is no effective method for removing as ш it is essential to oxidize as ш into easily removable as ⅴ to achieve effective separation herein a novel copper coated mno2 nanowires membrane cu mnm which combines the oxidation properties of mno2 and the catalytic and absorption properties of nanoscale cu nscu was developed based on in situ chemical deposition nscu on the surface of ultralong mno2 nanowires the as prepared cu mnm shows excellent arsenic separation properties with the maximum rejection rate of 96 the results of ph studies indicate that acidic conditions promote the separation of as ш by cu mnm while alkaline conditions are inhibitory due to deprotonation of cu mnm surface enhances electrostatic repulsion the results of the interfering ions show that the phosphate ions have a strong inhibitory effect on arsenic separation in addition cu mnm has been shown to be remarkably recyclable and can still achieve a separation efficiency of 60 after five cycles therefore the prepared cu mnm with the high arsenic retention efficiency and excellent recycling capabilities has the potential to become an excellent candidate for practical application in arsenic separation graphical abstract image 1 keywords as removal oxidation cu nanoparticles membrane process separation mechanism 1 introduction arsenic as is a high toxic and carcinogenic metalloid element widely distributed in drinking water and industrial wastewater it is usually present in the aqueous phase system in the form of arsenite as ш and arsenate as v compared with as v as ш is more toxic because of its high affinity for the sulfhydryl groups of proteins jamshidi gohari et al 2013 wei et al 2019 simultaneously in view of the fact that as ш is more soluble and more mobile than as v therefore it is difficult to be removed from water more importantly long term exposure to arsenic compounds as ш can cause serious and permanent damage to human health and ecological system including genetic toxicity dermal changes and interference with the immune system even neurological disorders which result the world health organization who set the maximum contaminant level mcl of arsenic to 10 μg l kim et al 2015 zhang and fang 2010 however it is estimated that 150 million people in more than 70 countries are at unhealthy level of arsenic due to drinking contaminated water brammer and ravenscroft 2009 hence the efficient arsenite as ш separation with environmentally friendly and simple operation process is still an important challenge to date several broad treatment options for removing arsenic from drinking water are investigated these technologies include chemisorption filtration du et al 2013 biological treatment liu et al 2018 yu et al 2013 adsorption huling et al 2017 szlachta et al 2012 and ion exchange an et al 2011 choi et al 2003 ortega et al 2017 however these methods have limitations for practical applications due to the technical and environmental constrains such as their high cost requiring many tedious and time consuming separation processes among these technologies adsorption technology has received extensive attention in wastewater treatment due to its low cost convenience and high efficiency accordingly a mass of adsorbents which requires high adsorption capacity and an affinity for arsenic has been studied such as zero valent iron su and puls 2001 magnetite fe3o4 chandra et al 2010 fe ti mn composite oxide chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 modified activated carbon chang et al 2010 peng et al 2018 and graphene oxide mnfe2o4 nanohybrids kumar et al 2014 which are commonly used but are complicated by the need for medial regeneration meanwhile the particles used for absorption are often tend to be released into the water after filtration resulting in secondary pollution which greatly limits the practical application therefore novel adsorbent materials and arsenic separation technologies to overcome the above shortcomings are particularly important and functional composite membranes have received more attention in recent years on the other hand membrane separation technologies are a promising arsenic treatment technology with simple operation and low chemical requirements compared with other technologies which has broad application prospects for instance m t uddin et al fabricated thin nanofiltration membrane which is used to remove arsenic from the aqueous solution uddin et al 2007 but the efficiency of removal as ш is poor compared with as v consequently this method cannot meet the mcl stipulated by who and has been greatly restricted in the specific application process to enhance the removal efficiency of as ш ge et al reported the fabrication of hierarchical iron containing γ mno2 oxidizes as ш to as v and then removes it from the water ge et al 2016 also zhang et al reported that the arsenic in the aqueous phase was pretreated with mno2 prior to nanofiltration to oxidize as ш to as v zhang et al 2007 these reports confirm the mno2 pretreated as ш aqueous solution which can achieve excellent removal efficiency more recently α mno2 nanowires with high specific surface area and sufficient contact sites are being used for efficient as ш removal via oxidation or surface adsorption simultaneously according to the previous article α mno2 nanowires have excellent membrane forming properties and can be used as a good substrate membrane to convert as ш to as ⅴ he et al 2019 yue et al 2018a however the passivation phenomenon of the surface of α mno2 nanowires after a period of time and the low adsorption capacity of as ш of mno2 limit its practical application value jamshidi gohari et al 2013 wang et al 2015a hence how to construct the functional membranes with high catalytic oxidation efficiency high rejection rate and environmental compatibility is of great importance in recent years nscu is attracting more and more attention due to its good catalytic capability and low costs gawande et al 2016 for example wang et al reported that copper doped fe3o4 particles can catalyze the oxidation of as ш to as v and significantly enhance the separation efficient of arsenic as compared to bare fe3o4 wang et al 2015b these results suggest the potential of nscu as a promising material for the removal of arsenic from drinking water is very tremendous with these in mind based on the catalytic and adsorbent properties of nscu and the oxidation properties of α mno2 the prepared cu mnm composite membrane can overcome the phenomenon of α mno2 surface passivation so as to achieve the oxidation of as ш to as v and further achieve excellent separation efficiency as such since the surface of α mno2 nanowires has hydroxyl groups and negative charges the nscu can be fixed to the surface through coordination to prevent nscu from breaking out from the surface of the substrate membrane and contaminating the filtered water thence the development of cu mnm with excellent catalyst performance and high separation efficiency are considered to be key factors for arsenic separation the present work was aimed to investigate mno2 nanowire membrane mnm and cu mnm composite membrane for arsenic decontamination in an aqueous solution via membrane filtration separation method herein dynamic cu mnm was fabricated based on in situ chemical deposition nscu on the surface of ultralong mno2 nanowires to self assemble into the composite membrane and the hybrid membranes are further applied to separate arsenic from solution additionally different influencing factors were studied to optimize the experiment conditions such as initial as ш concentrations nscu contents solution ph interfering ions and operating pressure the present work gives a novel route to develop nanowire hybrid membranes with dynamic features high efficiency excellent circulation for the separation of as ш from contaminated aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o 99 0

k2s2o8 99 5 and absolute ethanol were all purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all reagents were analytically graded without further purification before use 2 2 preparation of mno2 nanowire and nscu as described in our previous study the mno2 nanowires were prepared by a typical hydrothermal method using the mnso4 h2o as precursor qiu et al 2019 yue et al 2018b in a typical synthesis experiment a mixed solution containing 13 g of potassium sulfate 41 g of potassium persulfate and 13 g of manganese sulfate monohydrate was dispersed in a 250 ml beaker containing 130 ml of deionized water under vigorously stirring at room temperature then the mixed solution was transferred into 200 ml stainless steel autoclave and reacted in an oven at 250 c for five days to obtain a bulk mno2 nanowires detail preparation process mno2 nanowires was shown in supplementary information and thus the nscu were prepared by reducing divalent copper with hydrazine hydrate typically 0 75 g of cuso4 5h2o and 3 6 g of naoh were dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water respectively under vigorously magnetic stirring the naoh solution was slowly added into the cuso4 5h2o solution and 2 ml of c2n2h8 was simultaneously slowly added to the solution in addition 2 ml of n2h4 was diluted in 60 ml of deionized water to form a homogeneous solution then the n2h4 solution was added dropwise to the solution prepared above after addition the resulting suspension was stirred continuously for 4 h at 30 c to form uniform nscu suspensions the suspension was centrifuged in anhydrous ethanol for 7 8 times to obtained nscu and the as prepared nscu was stored in anhydrous ethanol before use 2 3 fabrication of dynamic cu mnm the dynamic cu mnm was fabricated by depositing nscu on the surface of mno2 nanowires and then assembling into membrane in a typical procedure 0 16 g of nscu was dispersed in 20 ml of anhydrous ethanol and then treated with ultrasound for 40 min to form a suspension with uniform dispersion subsequently 40 ml of the obtained mno2 nanowire suspension was slowly added to the suspension of uniform nscu and then the nscu was deposited on the surface of the mno2 nanowires by ultrasound for 1 h during this step ultrasonic dispersion technique was used to achieve a homogeneous suspension of nscu on the surface of mno2 nanowire afterwards the above suspension was vacuum filtered to obtained the dynamic cu mnm and then dried at 60 c for 4 h for further use as shown in scheme 1 2 4 samples characterization the size and morphology of nscu mnm and cu mnm before and after separation were analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta 200 usa and transmission electron microscopy tem tecnai20 and the element contents was detected by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds jem 2100 atomic force microscopy afm characterization further confirmed that nscu was immobilized on the surface of the mnm as well as the thickness of cu mnm the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and pore structure of cu mnm were investigated by a micromeritics asap 3020 volumetric adsorption analyzer the crystal structure of nscu mnm and cu mnm before and after separation were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd jeol jdx 3530 tokyo japan with cu kα radiation with a scanning rate 4 min in the 2θ ranging from 10 to 80 the functional groups on the surface of samples were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrophotometer thermo nicolet nexus tm from 400 to 4000 cm 1 surface element composition and chemical valences of cu mnm before and after separation were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps on thermo escalab 250 xi solution sample containing total arsenic were measured by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer optimal 2100dv the content of as iii was determined by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs the concentration of as ⅴ was determined by the difference between the total concentration of arsenic and the concentration of as ш 2 5 batch separation experiment of as ш in this work the performance of cu mnm the diameter is 4 cm was evaluated by using sodium arsenite as the model arsenic source arsenic was extracted from arsenite solution by using nscu as catalyst to accelerate the redox reaction between mno2 and as ш the separation process was shown in scheme 1 the as prepared cu mnm was fixed in a sand core funnel sand core funnel and experimental device are shown in fig s5 and then the liquid passes through the cu mnm under the gravity drive and the properties of the cu mnm in terms of rejection rate for the treatment of aqueous solution containing as ш under different influencing factors such as solution ph as ш concentrations and nscu contents on the surface of cu mnm interfering ions and operate pressures the ph was adjusted by adding 0 1m naoh and hcl finally the separation efficiencies r of as ш was calculated by the following formula r 1 c t c o ⅹ 100 where c o and c t are the concentration of initial arsenic solution and permeate respectively the r represents the rejection rate of arsenic by cu mnm the flux should be kept constant throughout the separation process and the permeate flux f was calculated by the following equation s f v s t where v l s m2 and t h are the volume of permeate solution effective surface of cu mnm and the separation time respectively all batch separation experiments were carried out at 25 c the volume of the initial solution was 50 ml and the separation time for each experiment was 3 h and arsenic separation experiments was replicated three times 2 6 desorption and regeneration study in addition to high removal efficiency the ideal separation materials should have excellent regeneration and recycling performance which is an important factor in the practical application of water purification therefore the reusability of cu mnm for as ш removal was investigated by desorption and regeneration after the as ш separation process was completed the as ш saturated nanocomposite membrane was treated with alkali solution before the nanomaterials could be reused shahrin et al 2018 after separation cu mnm was immersed in naoh solution 0 5 m for 2 h to remove arsenic from the surface and then a layer of nscu was grafted on the surface for the next experiment then the separation study was carried out again to investigate the separation performance of cu mnm after desorption and regeneration process all reusability separation experiment was carried out under the same arsenic separation conditions ph remains at 6 3 concentrations at 40 mg l pressure was maintained at atmospheric pressure at last the removal efficiency of as ш was measured and the reusability process of cu mnm was illustrated in scheme 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology characterization during the separation process in order to study the morphology and structure evolution of specimens before and after arsenic separation the samples were characterized by sem as revealed in fig 1 a the obtained nscu with a very small size can be better deposited on the surface of mno2 nanowires the surface morphology of the mnm can be seen from fig 1b showing the mnm is composed of abundant randomly oriented ultralong nanowires with lengths over 100 μm and nscu can be better distributed on the surface of mnm due to the extra long structure feature fig 1c shows the as prepared cu mnm specimen had a dendritic micro nanostructure with a diameter of several tens of nanometers in addition it was seen that the nscu was well dispersed on the surface of the mno2 nanowires proving that cu mnm was successfully prepared besides to confirm the structure of prepared composites afm characterization were performed fig s1 and fig s2 show the surface roughness and thickness of cu mnm respectively fig s1a and fig s1b presents 3d afm images of the membranes prepared by loading different nscu it is clear from these images that the surface properties of the prepared film depend on the amount of nscu particles added and the roughness of this surface is 6 096 nm and 8 156 nm respectively in addition the afm image further demonstrates that nscu is successfully coated on the surface of the mnm via irregular nscu particles and unrecognized mno2 nanowires furthermore it can be seen from fig s2 that the cu mnm composite film has a thickness of approximately 1 μm which contributes to sufficient contact with the target thereby achieving higher arsenic separation efficiency however compared with cu mnm before separation the nscu on the surface of the separated cu mnm is more clustered together and the results are shown in fig 1d it may be attributed to the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш during the separation process which causes the nscu shedding at the reaction site to be adsorbed by nscu on the surface of the mno2 nanowire which is not involved in the reaction resulting in more aggregation besides it is noteworthy that the thickness of the nscu is slightly increased probably due to the successful sequestration of arsenic on the surface of cu mnm in order to understand the composition of the chemical elements on the surface of the cu mnm the eds analysis was conducted on the as prepared samples before and after separation and the results were illustrated in fig s3 and fig s4 fig s3 shows that the contents of the three elements o mn and cu were 5 47 11 61 and 82 91 respectively implying that the cu mnm was successfully prepared as shown in fig s4 compared with cu mnm before separation arsenic was detected in the sample after separation proving that arsenic was successfully separated additionally the elemental content of nscu only changed slightly indicating that cu mnm has good stability and is not easy to cause secondary pollution to further demonstrate that nscu was successfully coated on the surface of the mnm this sample was characterized by tem as shown in fig 2 fig 2a shows the tem image of mnm from which it can be clearly seen that the mnm composite membrane is composed of smooth monodisperse mno2 nanowires furthermore the smooth surface of mno2 nanowires provides more sites for nscu which helps nscu to successfully coat the surface of mnm the tem image of cu mnm is shown in fig 2b compared to the pure mno2 nanowires the surface of the nscu attached mno2 nanowires changed significantly indicating that cu mnm was successfully coated on the surface of the nanowires the eds spectrum proves that the surface element is nscu and the cu mnm was successfully prepared besides it can be clearly seen that the nscu coated mno2 nanowires resemble a dendritic structure which facilitates sufficient contact with the target to improve the separation efficiency of as ш 3 2 structure characterization for this separation process arsenic in solution usually attached to the surface of samples and the activated adsorption site depends on the specific surface area and pore structure of mnm and cu mnm hence the specific surface area and pore distribution of mnm and cu mnm were investigated by the brunauer emmett teller bet method and barrent joyner halent bjh model and the results are illustrated in fig 3 fig 3a exhibits a typical ⅳ type isotherm and a h3 hysteresis loop in a relatively high p p0 range 0 8 1 indicating the existence of mesoporous structures in mnm and the bet specific surface area value is 9 41 m2 g besides the bjh method is also used to study the pore size distribution of mnm as shown in inset fig 3a the pore size distribution of mnm is concentrated at 2 9 nm and the pore volume of the pore is 0 037 cm3 g testifying that mnm mainly exists in mesoporous structure fig 3b shows that cu mnm has a higher specific surface area and a higher pore volume and the corresponding results are 16 81 m2 g and 0 05 cm3 g respectively this possible reason is attributed to the higher specific surface area of nscu which increases the specific surface area of the cu mnm when it is successfully coated on the surface of the mnm the inset of fig 3b shows the pore size distribution curve revealing that cu mnm has a mesoporous structure and the pore size distributes in the range of 2 5 7 5 nm and this mesoporous structure contributes to the separation of arsenic and has potential application value to investigate the molecular structure evolution and composition of surface functional groups during arsenic separation the mnm and cu mnm before and after arsenic separation were characterized by xrd and ft ir and the corresponding results were shown in fig 4 fig 4a a shows that nscu have strong absorption peaks nearby at 760 23 cm 1 1090 42 cm 1 and 1337 34 cm 1 which could be assigned to bending vibrations of cu o and symmetric stretching vibration of c o and c n respectively manifesting the nscu was successfully prepared fig 4a b shows that three adsorption peaks at 450 34 cm 1 520 16 cm 1 and 720 24 cm 1 are consistent with mn o stretching vibrations indicating mnm was successfully prepared compared to the infrared spectra of nscu and mnm fig 4a c shows both the absorption peak of nscu and the absorption peak of mnm proving that cu mnm was successfully prepared fig 4a d shows that the peak of mno2 was weakened but the as o peak was detected at 504 21 cm 1 and it is attributed to the redox reaction of mno2 and arsenic simultaneously the arsenic is adsorbed on the surface of the membrane in addition considering that the separated arsenic adheres to the surface of nscu may cause the infrared peak of nscu may not be detected in order to further investigate the structural evolution of specimen during arsenite separation the xrd patterns of the nscu α mno2 nanowire cu mnm before and after separation are shown in fig 4b as can be seen from fig 4b a nscu shows sharp and intensity peaks at 2θ of 43 5 50 6 and 74 2 respectively which are consistent with the reported values jcpds no jpsn 85 1236 however the peak of carbon was retrieved at 22 which may be attributed to the fact that carbon containing organics are introduced during the preparation of nscu in addition it should be noticed that the characteristic peak at 2θ of 38 9 is ascribed to the cuo diffraction probably due to the reaction of nscu with dissolved oxygen to produce o2 and cu2 as shown in fig 4b b all of the diffraction peaks of the as prepared mno2 specimen was consistent with those of the pure crystalline phase of α mno2 jpsn 72 1982 and no additional diffraction peaks or other phase were detected indicating the high purity of the mnm the xrd pattern of cu mnm before separation is shown in fig 4b c compared to pure α mno2 it is apparent that a sharp and intensity characteristic peak of nscu can be observed whereas it can be clearly observed from fig 4b c that the peak of mno2 is weakened which may be attributed to nscu loading on the surface of mno2 affects the diffraction of mno2 and cause the characteristic peak of mno2 to decrease compared with the initial cu mnm fig 4b d shown the characteristic reflections peak of mno2 disappears and falls obviously and the peak intensity of nscu only decreases slightly after arsenite separation which may be assumed that mno2 and arsenite undergo redox reactions therefore the characteristic reflection peak of mno2 becomes weaker or partially disappears but due to the adhesion of arsenic to the surface of cu mnm the peak of nscu dropped slightly besides the electrons generated during the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш reduce cu2 to zero valent copper causing the diffraction peak of some cuo to disappear furthermore the amorphous phase of arsenic attached to the surface of cu mnm can be further proved by xps analysis 3 3 mechanisms for arsenic removal by the cu mnm nanocomposites in the process of separation of arsenic the device used is a sand core funnel its diameter is much larger than the target and the separation of arsenic cannot be achieved by using only the core funnel therefore the separation of arsenic is finally achieved by cu mnm the composition and chemical state of solid surface elements can be confirmed by xps providing useful information for the remove mechanism of as ш and the corresponding xps results were displayed in fig 5 in fig 5a the peaks of cu2p binding energy at about 932 5 ev and 949 6 ev are assigned to cu2p2 3 and cu2p2 1 it is obvious that the nscu changed little before and after the separation suggesting that it acted as a catalyst during the whole process of arsenic separation however the apparent peak of cu2 increases after arsenic separation implying nscu reacts with dissolved oxygen to form cu2 and o2 during the separation of arsenic moreover the resulting cu2 act as electron transfer centers accelerating the reaction between mno2 and as ш it should be noted that the bulk material of nscu was still elemental nscu consistent with the low intensity peak of cuo in the xrd spectrum of nscu the mn2p spectra before and after arsenic separation were shown in fig 5b for before arsenic separation the peaks of the mn2p binding energy at about 641 8 ev and 653 8 ev are assigned to mn2p3 2 and mn2p1 2 respectively implying the presence of mn ⅳ however the shift in binding energy of mno2 after arsenic separation indicates that the redox reaction of mno2 and arsenic causes a change in the valence the change of the chemical states of mn could be further demonstrated by the fitting of mn peak of for specimen after arsenic separation the inset in fig 5b in which the presence of mn ⅱ and mn ш could be ascribed to a sharp decrease in mn ⅳ this result indicates that mno2 was involved in the oxidation reaction of as ш according to the binding energy of oxygen the o1s spectra before arsenic separation was assigned to oxygen bonded to metal mn o at 531 6 ev as shown in fig 5c it can be clearly seen that the peak of oxygen has shifted from 531 6 ev to 530 5 ev resulting in the formation of new metal oxygen bonds such as as o bonds this result also proves that arsenic was successfully trapped on the surface of cu mnm moreover fig 5d shows the high resolution xps as3d spectrum of cu mnm after arsenic separation obviously the peak of as3d can be observed on the surface of cu mnm the as3d curve could be fitted with three different peaks at 43 8 ev 45 2 ev and 48 8 ev are assigned to as ш o and as ⅴ o respectively and the proportion of the latter is higher than the former according to the integral area this result indicated that a certain portion of as ш was first oxidized to as ⅴ and then adsorbed on the surface of cu mnm in addition the results also show that as ш can also adsorb on the surface of cu mnm according to the analysis of xps above a probable mechanism shows in scheme 3 for cu mnm removal of as ш was preliminary proposed as follow firstly some of the as ш in the initial solution migrates to the surface of cu mnm secondly the as ш on the surface of cu mnm was in situ oxidized to as ⅴ by mno2 during the filtration process while the mno2 was reduced to mn ш and mn ⅱ as mno2 was reduced and dissolved the preoccupied sites were released leaving new mno2 active sites to continue to oxidized as ш at the same time more nscu atoms were exposed new active site was formed on the surface of cu mnm furthermore the new active site and arsenic form a complex to adsorb arsenic on the surface of cu mnm to achieve the separation of arsenic more importantly in the whole separation process nscu not only acts as an adsorbent to absorb as ш and as ⅴ but also acts as a catalyst to accelerate the oxidation of as ш to as ⅴ by mno2 to avoid the passivation on the surface of mno2 more studies have shown that mno2 oxidizes as ш into as ⅴ in two steps uddin et al 2007 and the reaction proceeds as shown in the following equation 2 m n o 2 h 3 a s o 3 c u 2 m n o o h h 3 a s o 4 2 m n o o h h 3 a s o 3 c u 2 m n o h 3 a s o 4 h 2 o to sum up the obtained cu mnm specimen reveals significantly arsenic removal properties which was attributed to the combination of several advantageous characteristics first of all nscu acts as a catalyst to accelerate the oxidation of as ш into as ⅴ by mno2 enhancing the adsorption capacity of arsenic additionally cu mnm has a higher surface area and abundant surfaces active sites as well as porous characteristics which was beneficial to enhance the oxidative conversion and absorption of as ш 3 3 1 mechanism of nscu accelerated reaction the possible mechanism of nscu accelerating the reaction of mno2 and as ш is proposed to further study the separation process of arsenic wang et al 2015b and han et al 2019 pointed out that copper reacts with dissolved oxygen in the solution to produce cu2 and o2 accelerating the transfer of electrons between the oxidant and the reducing agent to accelerate the reaction rate the specific process is as follows first nscu reacts with dissolved oxygen in the solution to form cu2 and o2 then as the center of electron transfer cu2 and o2 accelerates the reaction between mno2 and as ш to achieve a more efficient conversion of as ш to as ⅴ in order to further confirm the above hypothesis batch adsorption experiments were carried out to study the removal effect of as iii under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and compared with pure mnm and different types of arsenic in the permeate were measured as shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows the removal efficiency of arsenic by pure mnm a and cu mnm under anaerobic b and aerobic c conditions it is found that the pure mnm has only a 20 lower removal efficiency and the removal efficiency of cu mnm under anaerobic conditions is still low however cu mnm can achieve a removal efficiency of 90 in the aerobic condition and achieve adsorption equilibrium in a very short time these results testify that the above assumption that nscu can accelerate the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш to achieve higher removal efficiency fig 6b shows that the content of as ш as ш increased from 7 99 mg l to 17 69 mg l and as ⅴ as ⅴ increased from 1 68 mg l to 4 34 mg l in the permeate shows an increasing trend but eventually stabilizes the final equilibrium can be attributed to the saturation of cu mnm separation of arsenic it can be clearly seen that as ⅴ appears in the permeate indicating that mno2 can oxidize as ш to as ⅴ however the content of as ш is significantly higher than that of as ⅴ suggesting that as ш is oxidized to as ⅴ and then adsorbed on the surface of cu mnm this result is consistent with the results of the xps analysis so the content of as ⅴ in the permeation is very small these results further indicate that cu mnm can oxidize as ш to as ⅴ and then achieve efficient separation of arsenic besides the mechanism of cu mnm separation of arsenic also proved 3 3 2 adsorption behavior of arsenic by nscu in order to verify the adsorption performance of nscu on arsenic static adsorption experiments at different equilibrium concentrations were carried out and the results of different model fitting were shown in fig 7 fig 7 compares langmuir isotherm a and freundlich isotherm b fitting of the results of static adsorption experiments based on the analysis of the fitted curve compared with the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 829 the langmuir isotherm model r2 0 996 is more suitable for the adsorption of arsenic by nscu consistent with the results reported in previous literature the corresponding fitting results of langmuir and freundlich are shown in table s1 luan et al 2019 accordingly the maximum adsorption value of arsenic by nscu is calculated to be 32 97 mg g which is comparable to the previously reported cuo nanoparticles goswami et al 2012 martinson and reddy 2009 this result demonstrated that this potential mechanism contributes to a more efficient separation of arsenic in aqueous solution 3 4 batch separation behaviors in this separation system the rejection rate of the mnm and cu mnm are largely determined by different initial concentrations operation pressure ph and coexisting ions therefore it is necessary to investigate the removal efficiency of different influencing factors of arsenic by mnm and cu mnm and the correspond results are shown in fig 8 the removal efficiency of pure mnm and nscu modified mnm at different concentrations of arsenic can been seen from fig 8a the volume of the solution containing as ш was kept at 50 ml and then the solutions of 20 mg l 40 mg l 60 mg l 80 mg l and 100 mg l were respectively passed through mnm and cu mnm showing that the mnm has a removal efficiency of only 10 30 with an initial concentration of arsenic from 20 mg l to 100 mg l the volume of the initial solution is 50 ml and the separation time for each experiment is 3 h implying that the surface of mno2 is more susceptible to passivation during the oxidation of as ш to as ⅴ with the concentrations increases which causes the as ш is difficult to be immobilized simultaneously as ш has strong fluidity and cannot be fully oxidized into easily immobilized as ⅴ resulting in mnm has a very low arsenic removal efficiency and the result is consistent with previous article reports luo et al 2012 in contrast mnm modified by nscu 78 92 mg m2 can achieve 94 33 arsenic removal efficiency which proves that nscu have a significantly enhancement effect on as ш removal this result is attributed to the fact that nscu can accelerate the oxidation of as ш with high mobility into as ⅴ to achieve better fixation and thus achieving higher removal efficiency however it is noteworthy that the removal efficiency of arsenic decreases with increasing arsenic concentration which is attributed to the concentration of the main factors affecting the separation process at this time and the high concentration makes the mno2 surface more easily passivated and the removal efficiency is reduced on the other hand as the concentration increases the surface of cu mnm is more likely to form a layer of pollutants hindering the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш resulting in cu mnm has a lower removal efficiency of arsenic at high concentrations in the actual separation process of arsenic the pressure often has an important influence so the separation efficiency of arsenic is investigated under different operating pressures and the corresponding results are illustrated in fig 8b the pressure was adjusted by an external three way device fig s5 shows the separation device of the experiment and then the separation efficiencies of mnm and cu mnm at 20 kpa 40 kpa 60 kpa 80 kpa and 100 kpa were tested respectively fig 8b shows that the mnm has a lower rejection rate and the rejection rate almost reaches zero with increasing pressure proving that mnm has a lower separation efficiency of arsenic compared with mnm cu mnm has improved the retention rate of arsenic but still has a low separation efficiency and the rejection rate of cu mnm on arsenic decreased from 28 33 to 2 20 accompanying the operating pressure increased from 20 kpa to 100 kpa implying that the separation process needs to maintain sufficient contact time between cu mnm and arsenic containing solution as the pressure increases the time for the solution to pass through the cu mnm composite membrane becomes faster and faster resulting in insufficient reaction time for mno2 and as ш hence the efficiency of arsenic separation by cu mnm decreases sharply with increasing operating pressure in a specific application the ph of the solution can affect the species of arsenic and the charge on the surface of the filter media as well as the rate of redox reactions it is necessary to investigate the effect of ph on the separation of as ш by mnm and cu mnm during the arsenic separation experiment the solutions of different ph values were passed through mnm and cu mnm under normal pressure conditions then the filtrate was collected and the concentration of the target was tested to study the removal efficiency of mnm and cu mnm the effect of ph on the efficiency of separation of arsenic by mnm and cu mnm were shown in fig 8c testifying that the mnm has a lower separation efficiency indicating that the pure mnm has a lower separation efficiency of arsenic compared with pure mnm cu mnm has higher separation efficiency of arsenic suggesting that nscu has an irreplaceable role in the separation process of arsenic as can be seen from fig 8c the removal of as is obviously dependent on the ph value which can reach the maximum separation efficiency of 96 91 under acidic conditions but decreases sharply with the increase of the ph value of the solution the rejection rate dropped from 96 91 to 29 63 more importantly it is found that cu mnm can achieve a separation efficiency of more than 75 in the ph range of 3 7 which is ascribed to arsenic is mainly present in the form of h2aso4 and h2aso4 2 under the tested ph range simultaneously the acid environment is favorable for mno2 to oxidized as ш into as ⅴ meanwhile the lower ph favors the protonation of the cu mnm membrane surface adsorbent the increase in protonation is believed to increase the positively charged sites and enlarge the attraction force between the surface of cu mnm and as anions and thereby increasing the separation efficiency in the lower ph region however in the high ph range 7 11 it is not conducive to the oxidation of as ш to as ⅴ by mno2 which causes arsenic to exist in solution mainly in the form of h3aso3 and h2aso3 whereas as ш is very difficult to be separated in solution and the result is consistent with previous literature reports han et al 2019 on the other hand the negative charge sites with higher ph values were dominant on the surface of cu mnm and the repulsion effect increased may causes the separation efficiency decreased accordingly usually arsenic contaminated water contains other common anions which may compete with arsenic for the active sites on the surface of cu mnm and thus affect the separation efficiency of arsenic thus five different coexisting anions including so4 2 co3 2 cl no3 and po4 3 were investigated at different concentrations the molar ratio of anion to arsenic is from 1 1 to 2 1 for the separation efficiency of arsenic and the corresponding results are shown in fig 8d during the interfering ion test in addition to the interfering ions the other separation conditions are kept the same and then the arsenic and interfering ions are passed through the mnm and cu mnm respectively fig 8d shows that the presence of cl and no3 has no effect on the removal of arsenic in addition fig 8d shows that sulfate has a slight effect on the separation of arsenic compared to chloride and nitrate and it is attributed to the high negative charge density of sulfate that is more easily absorbed by nscu compared with sulfate carbonate has a significant inhibitory effect on the separation of arsenic and the removal efficiency of arsenic decreased from 72 69 to 63 56 with the increase of concentration this main reason is described to the fact that carbonate has a higher charge density and is more easily absorbed in the meantime carbonate hydrolysis causes the solution to become alkaline and the alkaline environment inhibits the separation efficiency of arsenic which is consistent with the results of ph analysis however among these anions phosphate ions have the greatest negative effect on the separation process of arsenic and the rejection rate decreased from 50 32 to 30 23 as the concentration increases the high inhibition of phosphate in the separation of arsenic may be described to the chemical similarity between phosphate and arsenate both phosphate and arsenic are located in the same main group so phosphate ions have a similar molecular structure to arsenic ions therefore phosphate can compete with arsenic for binding sites available on the surface of cu mnm adverse effects of phosphate on arsenic separation have been reported in previous studies luxton et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 furthermore interference analysis of different anions has important guiding significance in the actual arsenic separation process the stability of the material in the actual separation process and whether there will be particles released into the water to cause secondary pollution are crucial therefore the content of mn in the permeate was monitored by icp to prove that cu mnm would not cause secondly pollution as shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 that the content of mn in the permeate increases gradually during the separation process but eventually approaches the equilibrium state the reason is attributed to the redox reaction between mno2 and as ш during the arsenic separation process which causes mn to be released into the water but only a very small amount is released into the water the maximum content is only 2 34 μg l which is far less than the standard that the content of mn in drinking water is less than 0 1 mg l this result indicates that cu mnm does not cause secondary pollution to the aqueous solution during the separation process of arsenic hence it is a material with broad application prospects in wastewater treatment 3 5 effect of nscu load and reusability of cu mnm in the process of arsenic separation the nscu as active material play an importantly role in the arsenic separation efficiency and the reusability of cu mnm and the results are displayed in fig 10 as shown in fig 10a as the specific nscu loading increased from 23 32 mg m2 to 138 36 mg m2 the removal rete of arsenic by cu mnm increased from 52 30 to 95 32 and finally reached the state of separation equilibrium these results indicate that the mass of nscu in cu mnm composite membrane plays a very important role in the separation of arsenic which may be that with the increase of nscu the passivation phenomenon on the surface of mno2 can be effectively avoided thus promoting the redox reaction of mno2 and as ш to reach the equilibrium state hence nscu have an irreplaceable role in the separation of arsenic apart from the high separation efficiency the ideal separation materials should have excellent recycling and regeneration properties which is a crucial consideration in the development of actual applications of water remediation including reducing the total cost of contaminant removal and promoting sustainable development the effect regeneration property of cu mnm specimen was investigated by continuous absorption and desorption cycles and the results are illustrated in fig 10b as shown in fig 10b the regenerated cu mnm showed a decreased rejection rate on as ш which may be ascribed to the content of mno2 decreases with the increase of cycle times making the as ш difficult to be oxidized into easily removed as ⅴ despite that it is noteworthy that the rejection rate 60 can still be achieved after absorption desorption and regeneration five times indicating that cu mnm is a potential separation material for arsenic table 1 shows the comparison of rejection rate of arsenic by different membranes the separation efficiency of nscu functionalized mnm is much higher than traditional separation membrane such as nanofiltration membrane es10 nanofiltration membrane ntr 7250 and ozonation and ultrafiltration etc and can achieve a maximum separation efficiency of 96 at the same time due to the excellent regenerability of cu mnm it may have greater potential in practical applications 4 conclusions a novel cu mnm separation materials with a high removal rate of as ш were fabricated based on in situ chemical deposition nscu on the surface of ultralong mno2 nanowires to assemble the hybrid membrane the sem maps reveal the changes in morphology of cu mnm before and after separation testifying nscu was successfully loaded on the surface of mnw and arsenic was successfully separated and the obtained mnm and cu mnm with a higher specific surface area 9 41 m2 g and 16 81 m2 g and high pore volumes 0 037 cm3 g and 0 05 cm3 g respectively furthermore xrd and xps spectra confirmed that arsenic was successfully extracted and enriched on the surface of cu mnm in addition the separation mechanism of oxidation and absorption has also been proved and the catalytic acceleration mechanism of nscu has been further explored and experimentally proved in the results of the batch separation experiment the novel cu mnm membrane separation materials has high as ш removal efficiency and can achieve 96 separation efficiency of as ш at the same time it has a higher separation effect under acidic conditions and is inhibited under alkaline conditions resulting in a decrease in separation efficiency furthermore the pressure experiment proves that the separation process must ensure sufficient contact time between the material and the target in addition among the anions tested phosphate ions have a strong inhibitory effect on arsenic separation and the inhibitory effect increased with increasing concentration what s more it should be noted that it is beneficial to the separation of arsenic in a strong acidic environment and the inhibition of arsenic separation in an alkaline environment more importantly cu mnm can still maintain separation efficiency of more than 60 after five cycles indicating that the cu mnm has good recyclability hence the oxidizing properties of cu mnm and its excellent separation properties which make it a potential application for the removal of as iii from aqueous solutions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18392,the mitigation of microplastic pollution in the environment calls for a better understanding of the sources and transportation especially from land sources to the open ocean we conducted a large scale investigation of microplastic pollution across the greater melbourne area and the western port area australia spanning gradients of land use from un developed catchments in conservation areas to more heavily developed areas microplastics were detected in 94 of water samples and 96 of sediment samples with abundances ranging from 0 06 to 2 5 items l in water and 0 9 to 298 1 items kg in sediment the variation of microplastic abundance in sediments was closely related to that of the overlying waters fiber was the most abundant 89 1 and 68 6 of microplastics in water and sediment respectively and polyester was the dominant polymer in water and sediment the size of more than 40 of all total microplastics observed was less than 1 mm both light and dense polymers of different shapes were more abundant in sediments than those in water indicating that there is microplastic accumulation in sediments the abundance of microplastics was higher near coastal cities than at less densely populated inland areas a spatial analysis of the data suggests that the abundance of microplastics increases downstream in rivers and accumulates in estuaries and the lentic reaches of these rivers correlation and redundancy analysis were used to explore the associations between microplastic pollution and different land use types more microplastics and polymer types were found at areas with large amounts of commercial industrial and transport activities microplastic abundances were also correlated with mean particle size microplastic hotspots within a coastal metropolis might be caused by a combination of natural accumulation via hydrological dynamics and contribution from increasing anthropogenic influences our results strongly suggest that coastal metropolis superimposed on increasing microplastic levels in waterbodies from inland areas to the estuaries and open oceans graphical abstract image 1 a coastal metropolis first receives microplastic inputs from upstream then magnifies its abundance and transportation via urban activities keywords superimposed pollution spatial analysis coastal metropolis land use sink 1 introduction the research into microplastics has increased exponentially since that term was initially proposed as it has had widespread scientific and public media salience for over a decade sutherland et al 2019 thompson et al 2004 although there is yet no internationally agreed upon definition for the cut off size for microplastics it is generally accepted to be those 5 mm frias and nash 2019 law 2017 there are indications that microplastics pose risks to organisms across the full spectrum of biological organization from cellular to population level wright et al 2013 microplastics can also contaminate a wide range of species that are consumed by humans seltenrich 2015 wright and kelly 2017 what is clear is that more scientific field based evidence is needed to steer current debates over the real risks of microplastic pollution burton 2017 kramm et al 2018 sedlak 2017 the rates at which plastics are accumulating in urban and peri urban waste streams have sparked research efforts to better to understand the major sources of microplastics in the environment and help improve management of this pollution for over half a century impacts of plastic pollution to marine environments have been of great public concern carpenter and smith 1972 large scale efforts have been made to map microplastic distributions in global oceans shorelines and marine organisms browne et al 2011 eriksen et al 2014 law et al 2010 marine microplastic dynamics can shed light upon various sources which are predominantly from land based inputs jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 a world scale modeling approach predicted that the amount of plastic waste entering oceans is estimated to be close to three orders of magnitude greater than the current monitoring results of floating marine plastic debris would suggest jambeck et al 2015 many sources of microplastic pollution in land based watersheds have been identified such as discharges of treated wastewater industrial and commercial activities municipal solid waste collection and agricultural activities andrady 2017 he et al 2019 law 2017 mccormick et al 2014 however the relative contribution of these land use activities to microplastic pollution is unknown the spatial distribution of microplastics in water and sediment can help predict their movement and deposition within local aquatic habitats for example vertical profiles of microplastics in waterbodies are greatly influenced by water flow and sediment dynamics nizzetto et al 2016 for sediments some case studies found extremely high concentrations of microplastics 74 800 items kg in freshwater sediment which acted as a temporary or permanent sink wang et al 2018 particle sizes and densities were suggested as key factors governing with microplastic deposition process wagner et al 2019 nevertheless the detailed mechanisms involved in microplastic transportation between sediment and water are not fully understood reportedly high loads of microplastics in freshwaters has sparked interest in better understanding their sources the spatial distribution of microplastics at a catchment scale has been described of some rivers lakes and estuaries kapp and yeatman 2018 schmidt et al 2017 siegfried et al 2017 plot and field studies involving direct monitoring suggest that microplastic pollution is closely related to anthropogenic factors such as population density land use and point source pollution barrows et al 2018 hendrickson et al 2018 klein et al 2015 river systems were suggested as major transport pathways for plastic debris especially in urban catchments atwood et al 2019 mani et al 2015 2019 the dominant role of natural forces like weather and hydrological conditions in microplastic transport dynamics has also been modeled hurley et al 2018 siegfried et al 2017 however it is not clear to what extent and how those factors ultimately determine the fate of microplastic transport from land to the ocean snapshot sampling for microplastic distribution is still an economic way to help gauge microplastic transport pathways from source to sink especially for places where baseline data are relatively insufficient although microplastics have been found on all continents limited reports on their distribution exist for australia s inland water bodies lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 such a knowledge gap limits global estimations of microplastic emissions from land to ocean a better understanding of microplastic sources is required to best address the elimination of the principal sources herein we selected waterbodies in the port phillip and western port catchments which includes the greater melbourne area gma and one of the most populated cities in australia we aim to determine i the spatial distribution of microplastics from inland water bodies to estuaries at a catchment scale ii the environmental factors affecting the variation of microplastic pollution and iii the anthropogenic impacts on the distribution of microplastics in sediment and water 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey area and sample collection the gma supports a population of approximately 4 3 million people covering a watershed area 10 000 km2 victoria 2017 there are numerous streams wetlands and estuaries in the gma that have a variety of land use activities in their catchments sharley et al 2016 the urban sprawl of melbourne stretches around a large area of port phillip bay and a small area of western port bay the yarra maribyrnong and werribee rivers and dandenong creek are the major streams in the port phillip bay catchment fig 1 these rivers and many other smaller streams in this catchment support a diverse community of birds fishes and benthic invertebrates mehler et al 2018 being the largest marine embayment in victoria port phillip bay is surrounded by the extensive coastal communities including the gma and the city of geelong in comparison western port has a more rural catchment although the gma extends into the north western and western areas of the catchment and phillip island located at the mouth of western port is also largely urbanized sediments and surface waters were collected from 54 monitoring sites in the study area between april and may 2018 fig 1 the survey sites were located in estuaries n 15 streams n 24 and wetlands n 15 for details see supplementary material table 1 prior to use all sampling tools were rinsed with ethanol and in situ water water samples were collected first then sediment to avoid collecting suspended solids due to sediment disturbance during sampling a 5 l container was submerged and filled with surface water 0 5 cm in depth at each site in comparison to net and trawl sampling this bottle sampling approach can collect microplastics from a small volume of water kapp and yeatman 2018 sediments were collected close to the shoreline from a maximum water depth of approximately 1 m the top layer top 2 cm was withdrawn using a handheld shovel from three separate and undisturbed surfaces no closer than 5 m apart approximately 500 g of the sediments were collected from each shovel and transferred into an unopened glass jar which was promptly closed once full 2 2 determination of catchments and land use level topographic vector data including elevation as contour lines major catchment polygons and waterway and water body polygon layers were supplied by melbourne water and the land use data was acquired from the australian bureau of statistics abs 2016 sub catchments for all sites were determined topographically using spatial analyst in arcgis 10 3 based on detailed methods outlined in kunapo et al 2009 briefly 10 m flow weighted digital elevation model dem s were derived from 5 m contour layers with flow direction ingrained into the dem by stream layers and wetlands sink holes were removed then flow direction and accumulation drainage layers were created and catchments were derived using the hydrology extension toolbar where existing high resolution stormwater drainage layers were available from local government jurisdictions these were compared against watershed layers with some minor adjustments made ensure alignment with stormwater drains catchment land use was extracted from census mesh block counts from the 2016 australian census abs 2016 land use polygon categories were summed for each catchment then divided by the area in hectares in grouped land uses residential parkland education commercial industrial hospital medical transport primary production other and water for subsequent analysis for details see supplementary material table 2 2 3 isolation of microplastics extraction of microplastics in water and sediment followed our established two step filtration process su et al 2016 2018 for water samples volume was recorded and all material 20 μm in the water was collected on a filter millipore nylon ny2004700 any substances on the filter were washed into a glass jar using 100 ml of naoh solution 2m to digest the biological material cole et al 2014 the jar was then covered and placed into a water bath at 55 c for 48 h once digested the liquid in these jars were filtered and the filter papers were then covered and placed in petri dishes for microplastic inspection before extraction sediments were placed in glass jars and dried in an oven at 55 c for 4 d to reduce the water content approximately 80 g of dry sediment was weighed and mixed with saturated nacl solution 1 2 g ml at a ratio of 1 2 v v in a 600 ml glass beaker the mixture was stirred with a steel spoon and allowed to settle for 24 h the supernatant was collected and filtered and the process was repeated twice all substances on filters were transported into glass jars and digested using sodium hydrate solution 2m following the same method as the water samples 2 4 observation and validation of microplastics a visual inspection was first carried out to quantify and sort the suspected microplastics based on their properties all items suspected to be microplastics 5 mm on the filters were inspected and photographed using a microscope leica m125 with 25 100x magnification microplastics were catalogued as either being fragment small irregular pieces pellet spherical items film thin and small layers or fiber elongated yang et al 2015 the sizes of microplastics was also measured and recorded then these items were examined using micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nicolet in10 mx thermo fisher scientific data were collected from a resolution of 4 cm 1 with a 32 s scan time and spectra were compared with a database from thermo fisher to verify the polymers the spectra matching with a quality index 70 were accepted yang et al 2015 we tried to analyze all suspected items but some particles could not be identified due to poor quality spectra small size or being lost and damaged finally an average percentage of 42 4 and 57 9 of suspected items from water and sediment respectively were successfully verified for the sites which agreed with the recommended quality criteria hermsen et al 2018 non plastic items were removed from the microplastic counts given that a set of visually identified microplastics was not instrumentally confirmed our results may potentially be overestimated 2 5 quality control in order to reduce the risk of microplastic aerial deposition in the field containers were only open once samples were ready to be deposited into them and closed immediately afterwards cotton clothing was worn during field sampling and a cotton laboratory coat was worn during the analytical procedures and preparation of all liquid solutions including tap water sodium hydrate solution 2m and sodium chloride solution 1 2 g ml were filtered prior to use filter pore size 20 μm before use all containers and apparatus were washed thoroughly by filtered tap water to account for process contaminations in experiments procedural blanks consisting of distilled water were run without field water or sediment with every three replicates in the laboratory overall 108 blanks were performed for water and sediment procedural contamination ranged from 0 22 to 0 38 items per filter for water and sediment samples these procedural blanks were at a similar level to our previous work hu et al 2018 all the contamination in blank samples was fiber with mean concentrations of 0 078 items l for water and 3 7 items kg for sediment we subtracted the background from our final results 2 6 data analysis non parametric tests were applied because the data sets are not normally distributed spearman s rank correlation was used to describe the relationships among data sets and the kruskal wallis test was used to compare among groups these non parametric statistical analyses were performed using spss 22 redundancy analysis is a useful tool for the ordination of multiple variance and has been widely used in ecology and environmental sciences legendre and anderson 1999 mcardle and anderson 2001 it was used to explore the correlations between microplastic variance and land use influences the microplastic properties abundance size shape etc were considered as response variables while land use and elevation were considered as explanatory variables a linear ordination method was selected according to detrended correspondence analysis length of the gradient 1 32 all the values were standardized by z scoring before carrying out the analysis redundancy analysis was performed and plotted with r 3 22 3 results 3 1 abundance and spatial distribution of microplastics microplastics were detected in 94 of water samples and 96 sediment samples from the entire sampling area ranging from 0 06 to 2 5 items l in water and 0 9 to 298 1 items kg in sediments fig 2 a and c the mean abundance of microplastics varied from 0 03 to 1 7 items l in water and 4 5 to 172 7 items kg in sediments fig 2 a and c wetlands estuaries and streams respectively contained average microplastic concentrations of 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 items l from water samples sediment samples from the same water bodies contained average microplastic concentrations of 75 5 79 1 and 87 4 items kg respectively no significant difference was found between the three water body types supplementary material fig s1 microplastic abundance variation in sediment and overlying water was closely related p 0 05 the abundance of microplastics was higher near coastal cities than at less densely populated inland areas fig 2 b and d microplastic spatial distribution was highly variable within sampling areas and its concentrations in water and sediment have large coefficients of variation cv up to 82 3 and 88 4 the range of microplastic abundance level spanned one to two orders of magnitudes in contrast microplastic abundance exhibited minor variation between different waterway types cv 7 6 11 1 the elevation of sampling sites ranged from 1 to 213 m above sea level and was negatively correlated with microplastic abundance p 0 05 fig 3 3 2 morphology characteristics and chemical composition microplastic size density was similar between samples from water and sediments fig 4 a the mean size of microplastics in water 1 26 0 93 mm was also close to those found in sediments 1 24 0 84 mm there was no significant difference in size distribution of microplastics in water or sediment between different waterway types supplementary materials fig s2 items 1 mm contributed more than 40 of total microplastic counts in water and sediment supplementary materials fig s2 fibers were the most common shape accounting for 89 1 and 68 6 in water and sediment respectively while the percentage of fragments in sediment was three times higher than those in water fig 4b supplementary materials fig s3 in addition microplastic shape varied significantly between the three waterway types where wetland samples contained the highest amount of fibers in sediment supplementary materials fig s4 in all items verified n 828 synthetic polymers represented 72 4 and 69 8 of items in water and sediment respectively supplementary materials tables s3 and 4 there were 14 kinds of polymer types in water and 19 types in sediment fig 5 polyester was the most common type being present in more than 60 of sampling sites and comprising more than 30 of all synthetic polymers confirmed in both water and sediment fig 5a and b in addition polypropylene polyethylene and polyamide were also commonly found and together comprise 30 abundance of all polymer types found although most polymer distributions were similar between water and sediment polyvinyl chloride was eighteen times more abundant with a frequency of detection four times higher in sediment than in water 3 3 land use in relation to microplastic characteristics land uses were categorized as 10 individual types associated with the catchment for each sampling site supplementary materials table s2 residential 32 5 land use was the most common category found in all sampling catchment followed by primary production 32 0 and parkland 17 4 urban related categories such as transport industrial and commercial land uses are positively correlated p 0 05 fig 6 red text regarding characteristics fig 6 purple text abundance size and polymer diversity were also correlated with transport industrial and commercial land use categories p 0 05 redundancy analysis was used to further understand the role of land use in microplastic spatial patterns and characteristics land use was selected as an environmental variable to explain the variation of microplastic abundance shape distribution mean size and polymer diversity fig 7 a thirty six percent of the variance of microplastic features can be explained by land use the first and second axis represented 91 1 together commercial industrial and transport land uses were significantly associated with an increase in the microplastic abundance and polymer diversity a decrease in the mean particle size the sites which explained the bulk of this variation were located within urbanized areas of port phillip bay red spots in fig 7b interestingly although fiber accounted for more than 70 of microplastics in water and sediments they only correlated with domestic influences such as parkland residential and education land uses 4 discussion 4 1 microplastic pollution in gma and western port catchments concerns are rising about the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the environment this is the first time data have been reported from australian inland waters and estuaries this work enriches the world microplastic pollution map and provide spatial features spanning gradients of land use from un developed catchments in conservation areas to more urbanized areas our studies of microplastic concentrations in the gma and western port catchments show that the abundance of microplastic pollution in water and sediment from these areas is low by global comparison being below 50 and 70 respectively of the mean abundances reported in 55 independent studies measured in terms of microplastic items per liter or kilogram supplementary material fig s5 from the compiled results different methods involved in microplastic sampling and measurement complicate efforts to make rigorous global comparisons hidalgo ruz et al 2012 however the ease to make such comparisons is gradually improving as more studies approach a uniform methodology it is hard to conclude general trends of microplastic shape or size in different studies because the field results are largely determined by regional background pellets can be extremely abundant in specific industrial areas lechner and ramler 2015 while they may be absent from remote waterbodies castaneda et al 2014 free et al 2014 regarding microplastic size the concentrations of small particles may be positively correlated with overall abundances but sometimes samples with high abundance can predominantly contain the larger particles 1 mm zhang et al 2017 in our work there are no spatial patterns of microplastics morphological characteristics except for decreasing sizes suggesting that indicated that diffuse plastic pollution is more predominant in our study area than point source plastic pollution some studies have compared different variations in abundances in different waterway types suggesting lentic waterbodies could be a sink for microplastics due to low flow rates and wave energy hu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 however we found no difference in the amount and type of microplastic pollution between streams wetlands and estuaries supplementary material fig s5 microplastic monitoring for environmental management should ensure site selection does not create bias towards particular water body types or spatial features an unbiased approach will improve the representativeness of natural habitat and the strength of any observations and conclusions 4 2 environmental factors affecting spatial patterns of microplastic buoyant microplastics will accumulate in surface waters but eventually deposit in sediments due to bio fouling and other processes reducing their buoyancy galloway et al 2017 before settling down the dispersion of microplastics in waterbodies is inevitably impacted by natural forces such as current wave and weather conditions browne et al 2010 law et al 2010 in our case the most obvious spatial trend was that microplastic concentrations increased downstream fig 5 current and water flow play a major role in the inventory and transport of microplastics downstream as microplastics behave similarly to particles that are neutrally buoyant in water such as plankton and suspended solids di mauro et al 2017 nizzetto et al 2016 extreme hydrological changes from weather events such as floods can strongly alter the microplastic budget in local habitats hurley et al 2018 estuaries and river mouths receive significant proportions of materials including microplastics sourced from inland parts of catchments and may therefore be considered as natural sinks of microplastic pollution leslie et al 2017 luo et al 2019 microplastics are prone to sedimentation as evidenced by differences in polymer types and shapes shown between sediments and water figs 4 and 5 the differences in microplastic concentrations between sediment and water spanned two orders of magnitudes in our study and can reach over six orders of magnitude in a study on lake fischer et al 2016 it was noteworthy that microplastic size decreased with increasing microplastic concentrations in water and sediments fig 3 according to stokes law small neutral or negatively buoyant particles will take more time to settle than larger ones richardson and zaki 1954 zwanzig 1964 if ideal conditions for this law are met large amounts of small microplastics may be transported far away with current and accumulate downstream into the estuaries and oceans on the other hand small microplastics may be directly generated by the fragmentation of large plastic debris and used as indicators for large plastic waste such particles likely account for the missing microplastic fraction in open oceans once deposited in freshwater sediments wang et al 2018 more efforts should be made to track smaller microplastic particles from freshwaters to oceans in future monitoring schemes 4 3 anthropogenic influences on the spatial patterns of microplastics being anthropogenic in origin microplastic footprints in environments are largely determined by anthropogenic influences for example effluents without appropriate treatments from wastewater treatment plants significantly increased microplastics abundances in water and sediment downstream estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 mccormick et al 2016 vermaire et al 2017 plastic industrial activities directly contributed to the microplastic load downstream and in proximal water bodies castaneda et al 2014 mani et al 2015 wagner et al 2019 recreational activity along urban rivers contributes a considerable amount of plastic litter which is a direct source of microplastic kiessling et al 2019 microplastic shape characteristics size distribution and polymer composition have been suggested as associative links for source identification auta et al 2017 the presence of fibers and pellets are considered as indicators of domestic effluents and plastic industry activities respectively lechner and ramler 2015 mintenig et al 2017 the prevalence of microfibers in our water samples suggested that runoff from urban areas is a major source of microfibers land use analysis provides more specific information regarding source identification and has been commonly used as a predictor variable of microplastic pollution peters and bratton 2016 yonkos et al 2014 in the current study microplastic pollution in water and sediment was closely related with the transport industrial and commercial land use those influences were even stronger than the residential activities fig 6 although regional population size has often been proposed as an indicator of microplastic emission level eriksen et al 2013 yonkos et al 2014 efforts have been made to prioritize major pollution sources and trace possible pathways some studies of urban catchments have demonstrated the role of rivers in microplastic transport from land sources to estuaries and open oceans which include the influences from river water discharge sewer and catchment urbanization barrows et al 2018 eo et al 2019 wagner et al 2019 it remained difficult to pinpoint the particular sources of microplastic pollution in estuaries and large lakes given numerous often interacting factors acting on transportation retention and accumulation 4 4 superimposed microplastic pollution in a coastal metropolis of all the plastics ever created only a small faction has been recycled managing plastic pollution sources might be the only tangible solution to reduce microplastic emissions jambeck et al 2015 it is important to identify and address microplastic pollution hotspots our study suggests that coastal population centers with intensive urban land uses are expected to contain higher levels of microplastic pollution especially at regions located downstream of major waterways several suspected local hotspots of microplastic pollution exist such as shanghai and saigon in asian lahens et al 2018 luo et al 2019 amsterdam and the mediterranean region in europe leslie et al 2017 vianello et al 2013 chicago metropolitan area in north america mccormick et al 2014 south africa s coastline in africa de villiers 2019 estuaries and river deltas can provide buffer zones for microplastics received upstream and adjacent urban areas atwood et al 2019 simon sánchez et al 2019 therefore microplastic hotspots within those areas might be caused by the combination between natural accumulation via hydrological dynamics and contribution from increasing anthropogenic influences in the gma and western port area high abundances of microplastics in the surface waters around cities are related to either great urbanization or treated wastewater discharges while australian urban cities have separate storm water and sewerage systems sewage is not common in our urban waterways except where there treated wastewater is discharged into streams in contrast microplastics were most likely carried by surface runoff and associated with urban non point pollution sources for example traffic emission and road pollution account for a large portion of land based microplastic transport to estuaries unice et al 2019 one preliminary study recovered up to 160 000 microplastics per kg soil from roadside dust dehghani et al 2017 which is almost three order of magnitude higher than what we found in gma s sediments urban soils had been also suggested as suspected sinks for microplastics but more field based evidence is needed rillig 2012 unfortunately current technologies cannot provide a full spectrum of microplastic presence in ecosystems due to the challenges in verifying small size microplastics little is known about those plastic particles that are consumed or destroyed by organisms dawson et al 2018 gigault et al 2018 regardless if non point source pollution is the main source of microplastic in aquatic environment or not the pathways involved in microplastic transportation in coastal cities deserve a better understanding fifty percent of the global population is expected to live within 100 km of coastline by 2030 adger et al 2005 the development of coastal urban communities is driven by human actions that directly increase the local environmental stress adger 1999 as shown in our work melbourne waterways received and accumulated a lot of microplastics from upstream and the city itself was also a major source of this pollution recent large scale efforts have been undertaken on global shorelines and river nets to estimate the mass of microplastics entering the ocean eo et al 2019 van wijnen et al 2019 however before we can fill the knowledge gap between sources and sinks we may need to step back further and take a look at our own coastal cities 5 conclusion we have shown spatial pollution patterns of microplastics in water and sediment in the range of greater melbourne area and western port area the catchments are an important source of microplastics entering the oceans urbanized water bodies in this study were more polluted with microplastics compared to other areas when comparing the results with similar international studies the level of microplastic pollution in these urbanized areas is regarded as low the spatial analysis associated with catchment land use levels suggests that microplastic pollution was strengthened by both hydrological dynamics and anthropogenic influences a coastal metropolis first receives microplastic inputs from upstream areas then magnifies its abundance and transportation via urban activities although the pollution sources are still poorly understood a long term and large scale monitoring of microplastics in coastal metropolitan areas should be considered in further global schemes which are important in understanding microplastics fate during the journey from land to sea declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18392,the mitigation of microplastic pollution in the environment calls for a better understanding of the sources and transportation especially from land sources to the open ocean we conducted a large scale investigation of microplastic pollution across the greater melbourne area and the western port area australia spanning gradients of land use from un developed catchments in conservation areas to more heavily developed areas microplastics were detected in 94 of water samples and 96 of sediment samples with abundances ranging from 0 06 to 2 5 items l in water and 0 9 to 298 1 items kg in sediment the variation of microplastic abundance in sediments was closely related to that of the overlying waters fiber was the most abundant 89 1 and 68 6 of microplastics in water and sediment respectively and polyester was the dominant polymer in water and sediment the size of more than 40 of all total microplastics observed was less than 1 mm both light and dense polymers of different shapes were more abundant in sediments than those in water indicating that there is microplastic accumulation in sediments the abundance of microplastics was higher near coastal cities than at less densely populated inland areas a spatial analysis of the data suggests that the abundance of microplastics increases downstream in rivers and accumulates in estuaries and the lentic reaches of these rivers correlation and redundancy analysis were used to explore the associations between microplastic pollution and different land use types more microplastics and polymer types were found at areas with large amounts of commercial industrial and transport activities microplastic abundances were also correlated with mean particle size microplastic hotspots within a coastal metropolis might be caused by a combination of natural accumulation via hydrological dynamics and contribution from increasing anthropogenic influences our results strongly suggest that coastal metropolis superimposed on increasing microplastic levels in waterbodies from inland areas to the estuaries and open oceans graphical abstract image 1 a coastal metropolis first receives microplastic inputs from upstream then magnifies its abundance and transportation via urban activities keywords superimposed pollution spatial analysis coastal metropolis land use sink 1 introduction the research into microplastics has increased exponentially since that term was initially proposed as it has had widespread scientific and public media salience for over a decade sutherland et al 2019 thompson et al 2004 although there is yet no internationally agreed upon definition for the cut off size for microplastics it is generally accepted to be those 5 mm frias and nash 2019 law 2017 there are indications that microplastics pose risks to organisms across the full spectrum of biological organization from cellular to population level wright et al 2013 microplastics can also contaminate a wide range of species that are consumed by humans seltenrich 2015 wright and kelly 2017 what is clear is that more scientific field based evidence is needed to steer current debates over the real risks of microplastic pollution burton 2017 kramm et al 2018 sedlak 2017 the rates at which plastics are accumulating in urban and peri urban waste streams have sparked research efforts to better to understand the major sources of microplastics in the environment and help improve management of this pollution for over half a century impacts of plastic pollution to marine environments have been of great public concern carpenter and smith 1972 large scale efforts have been made to map microplastic distributions in global oceans shorelines and marine organisms browne et al 2011 eriksen et al 2014 law et al 2010 marine microplastic dynamics can shed light upon various sources which are predominantly from land based inputs jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 a world scale modeling approach predicted that the amount of plastic waste entering oceans is estimated to be close to three orders of magnitude greater than the current monitoring results of floating marine plastic debris would suggest jambeck et al 2015 many sources of microplastic pollution in land based watersheds have been identified such as discharges of treated wastewater industrial and commercial activities municipal solid waste collection and agricultural activities andrady 2017 he et al 2019 law 2017 mccormick et al 2014 however the relative contribution of these land use activities to microplastic pollution is unknown the spatial distribution of microplastics in water and sediment can help predict their movement and deposition within local aquatic habitats for example vertical profiles of microplastics in waterbodies are greatly influenced by water flow and sediment dynamics nizzetto et al 2016 for sediments some case studies found extremely high concentrations of microplastics 74 800 items kg in freshwater sediment which acted as a temporary or permanent sink wang et al 2018 particle sizes and densities were suggested as key factors governing with microplastic deposition process wagner et al 2019 nevertheless the detailed mechanisms involved in microplastic transportation between sediment and water are not fully understood reportedly high loads of microplastics in freshwaters has sparked interest in better understanding their sources the spatial distribution of microplastics at a catchment scale has been described of some rivers lakes and estuaries kapp and yeatman 2018 schmidt et al 2017 siegfried et al 2017 plot and field studies involving direct monitoring suggest that microplastic pollution is closely related to anthropogenic factors such as population density land use and point source pollution barrows et al 2018 hendrickson et al 2018 klein et al 2015 river systems were suggested as major transport pathways for plastic debris especially in urban catchments atwood et al 2019 mani et al 2015 2019 the dominant role of natural forces like weather and hydrological conditions in microplastic transport dynamics has also been modeled hurley et al 2018 siegfried et al 2017 however it is not clear to what extent and how those factors ultimately determine the fate of microplastic transport from land to the ocean snapshot sampling for microplastic distribution is still an economic way to help gauge microplastic transport pathways from source to sink especially for places where baseline data are relatively insufficient although microplastics have been found on all continents limited reports on their distribution exist for australia s inland water bodies lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 such a knowledge gap limits global estimations of microplastic emissions from land to ocean a better understanding of microplastic sources is required to best address the elimination of the principal sources herein we selected waterbodies in the port phillip and western port catchments which includes the greater melbourne area gma and one of the most populated cities in australia we aim to determine i the spatial distribution of microplastics from inland water bodies to estuaries at a catchment scale ii the environmental factors affecting the variation of microplastic pollution and iii the anthropogenic impacts on the distribution of microplastics in sediment and water 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey area and sample collection the gma supports a population of approximately 4 3 million people covering a watershed area 10 000 km2 victoria 2017 there are numerous streams wetlands and estuaries in the gma that have a variety of land use activities in their catchments sharley et al 2016 the urban sprawl of melbourne stretches around a large area of port phillip bay and a small area of western port bay the yarra maribyrnong and werribee rivers and dandenong creek are the major streams in the port phillip bay catchment fig 1 these rivers and many other smaller streams in this catchment support a diverse community of birds fishes and benthic invertebrates mehler et al 2018 being the largest marine embayment in victoria port phillip bay is surrounded by the extensive coastal communities including the gma and the city of geelong in comparison western port has a more rural catchment although the gma extends into the north western and western areas of the catchment and phillip island located at the mouth of western port is also largely urbanized sediments and surface waters were collected from 54 monitoring sites in the study area between april and may 2018 fig 1 the survey sites were located in estuaries n 15 streams n 24 and wetlands n 15 for details see supplementary material table 1 prior to use all sampling tools were rinsed with ethanol and in situ water water samples were collected first then sediment to avoid collecting suspended solids due to sediment disturbance during sampling a 5 l container was submerged and filled with surface water 0 5 cm in depth at each site in comparison to net and trawl sampling this bottle sampling approach can collect microplastics from a small volume of water kapp and yeatman 2018 sediments were collected close to the shoreline from a maximum water depth of approximately 1 m the top layer top 2 cm was withdrawn using a handheld shovel from three separate and undisturbed surfaces no closer than 5 m apart approximately 500 g of the sediments were collected from each shovel and transferred into an unopened glass jar which was promptly closed once full 2 2 determination of catchments and land use level topographic vector data including elevation as contour lines major catchment polygons and waterway and water body polygon layers were supplied by melbourne water and the land use data was acquired from the australian bureau of statistics abs 2016 sub catchments for all sites were determined topographically using spatial analyst in arcgis 10 3 based on detailed methods outlined in kunapo et al 2009 briefly 10 m flow weighted digital elevation model dem s were derived from 5 m contour layers with flow direction ingrained into the dem by stream layers and wetlands sink holes were removed then flow direction and accumulation drainage layers were created and catchments were derived using the hydrology extension toolbar where existing high resolution stormwater drainage layers were available from local government jurisdictions these were compared against watershed layers with some minor adjustments made ensure alignment with stormwater drains catchment land use was extracted from census mesh block counts from the 2016 australian census abs 2016 land use polygon categories were summed for each catchment then divided by the area in hectares in grouped land uses residential parkland education commercial industrial hospital medical transport primary production other and water for subsequent analysis for details see supplementary material table 2 2 3 isolation of microplastics extraction of microplastics in water and sediment followed our established two step filtration process su et al 2016 2018 for water samples volume was recorded and all material 20 μm in the water was collected on a filter millipore nylon ny2004700 any substances on the filter were washed into a glass jar using 100 ml of naoh solution 2m to digest the biological material cole et al 2014 the jar was then covered and placed into a water bath at 55 c for 48 h once digested the liquid in these jars were filtered and the filter papers were then covered and placed in petri dishes for microplastic inspection before extraction sediments were placed in glass jars and dried in an oven at 55 c for 4 d to reduce the water content approximately 80 g of dry sediment was weighed and mixed with saturated nacl solution 1 2 g ml at a ratio of 1 2 v v in a 600 ml glass beaker the mixture was stirred with a steel spoon and allowed to settle for 24 h the supernatant was collected and filtered and the process was repeated twice all substances on filters were transported into glass jars and digested using sodium hydrate solution 2m following the same method as the water samples 2 4 observation and validation of microplastics a visual inspection was first carried out to quantify and sort the suspected microplastics based on their properties all items suspected to be microplastics 5 mm on the filters were inspected and photographed using a microscope leica m125 with 25 100x magnification microplastics were catalogued as either being fragment small irregular pieces pellet spherical items film thin and small layers or fiber elongated yang et al 2015 the sizes of microplastics was also measured and recorded then these items were examined using micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nicolet in10 mx thermo fisher scientific data were collected from a resolution of 4 cm 1 with a 32 s scan time and spectra were compared with a database from thermo fisher to verify the polymers the spectra matching with a quality index 70 were accepted yang et al 2015 we tried to analyze all suspected items but some particles could not be identified due to poor quality spectra small size or being lost and damaged finally an average percentage of 42 4 and 57 9 of suspected items from water and sediment respectively were successfully verified for the sites which agreed with the recommended quality criteria hermsen et al 2018 non plastic items were removed from the microplastic counts given that a set of visually identified microplastics was not instrumentally confirmed our results may potentially be overestimated 2 5 quality control in order to reduce the risk of microplastic aerial deposition in the field containers were only open once samples were ready to be deposited into them and closed immediately afterwards cotton clothing was worn during field sampling and a cotton laboratory coat was worn during the analytical procedures and preparation of all liquid solutions including tap water sodium hydrate solution 2m and sodium chloride solution 1 2 g ml were filtered prior to use filter pore size 20 μm before use all containers and apparatus were washed thoroughly by filtered tap water to account for process contaminations in experiments procedural blanks consisting of distilled water were run without field water or sediment with every three replicates in the laboratory overall 108 blanks were performed for water and sediment procedural contamination ranged from 0 22 to 0 38 items per filter for water and sediment samples these procedural blanks were at a similar level to our previous work hu et al 2018 all the contamination in blank samples was fiber with mean concentrations of 0 078 items l for water and 3 7 items kg for sediment we subtracted the background from our final results 2 6 data analysis non parametric tests were applied because the data sets are not normally distributed spearman s rank correlation was used to describe the relationships among data sets and the kruskal wallis test was used to compare among groups these non parametric statistical analyses were performed using spss 22 redundancy analysis is a useful tool for the ordination of multiple variance and has been widely used in ecology and environmental sciences legendre and anderson 1999 mcardle and anderson 2001 it was used to explore the correlations between microplastic variance and land use influences the microplastic properties abundance size shape etc were considered as response variables while land use and elevation were considered as explanatory variables a linear ordination method was selected according to detrended correspondence analysis length of the gradient 1 32 all the values were standardized by z scoring before carrying out the analysis redundancy analysis was performed and plotted with r 3 22 3 results 3 1 abundance and spatial distribution of microplastics microplastics were detected in 94 of water samples and 96 sediment samples from the entire sampling area ranging from 0 06 to 2 5 items l in water and 0 9 to 298 1 items kg in sediments fig 2 a and c the mean abundance of microplastics varied from 0 03 to 1 7 items l in water and 4 5 to 172 7 items kg in sediments fig 2 a and c wetlands estuaries and streams respectively contained average microplastic concentrations of 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 items l from water samples sediment samples from the same water bodies contained average microplastic concentrations of 75 5 79 1 and 87 4 items kg respectively no significant difference was found between the three water body types supplementary material fig s1 microplastic abundance variation in sediment and overlying water was closely related p 0 05 the abundance of microplastics was higher near coastal cities than at less densely populated inland areas fig 2 b and d microplastic spatial distribution was highly variable within sampling areas and its concentrations in water and sediment have large coefficients of variation cv up to 82 3 and 88 4 the range of microplastic abundance level spanned one to two orders of magnitudes in contrast microplastic abundance exhibited minor variation between different waterway types cv 7 6 11 1 the elevation of sampling sites ranged from 1 to 213 m above sea level and was negatively correlated with microplastic abundance p 0 05 fig 3 3 2 morphology characteristics and chemical composition microplastic size density was similar between samples from water and sediments fig 4 a the mean size of microplastics in water 1 26 0 93 mm was also close to those found in sediments 1 24 0 84 mm there was no significant difference in size distribution of microplastics in water or sediment between different waterway types supplementary materials fig s2 items 1 mm contributed more than 40 of total microplastic counts in water and sediment supplementary materials fig s2 fibers were the most common shape accounting for 89 1 and 68 6 in water and sediment respectively while the percentage of fragments in sediment was three times higher than those in water fig 4b supplementary materials fig s3 in addition microplastic shape varied significantly between the three waterway types where wetland samples contained the highest amount of fibers in sediment supplementary materials fig s4 in all items verified n 828 synthetic polymers represented 72 4 and 69 8 of items in water and sediment respectively supplementary materials tables s3 and 4 there were 14 kinds of polymer types in water and 19 types in sediment fig 5 polyester was the most common type being present in more than 60 of sampling sites and comprising more than 30 of all synthetic polymers confirmed in both water and sediment fig 5a and b in addition polypropylene polyethylene and polyamide were also commonly found and together comprise 30 abundance of all polymer types found although most polymer distributions were similar between water and sediment polyvinyl chloride was eighteen times more abundant with a frequency of detection four times higher in sediment than in water 3 3 land use in relation to microplastic characteristics land uses were categorized as 10 individual types associated with the catchment for each sampling site supplementary materials table s2 residential 32 5 land use was the most common category found in all sampling catchment followed by primary production 32 0 and parkland 17 4 urban related categories such as transport industrial and commercial land uses are positively correlated p 0 05 fig 6 red text regarding characteristics fig 6 purple text abundance size and polymer diversity were also correlated with transport industrial and commercial land use categories p 0 05 redundancy analysis was used to further understand the role of land use in microplastic spatial patterns and characteristics land use was selected as an environmental variable to explain the variation of microplastic abundance shape distribution mean size and polymer diversity fig 7 a thirty six percent of the variance of microplastic features can be explained by land use the first and second axis represented 91 1 together commercial industrial and transport land uses were significantly associated with an increase in the microplastic abundance and polymer diversity a decrease in the mean particle size the sites which explained the bulk of this variation were located within urbanized areas of port phillip bay red spots in fig 7b interestingly although fiber accounted for more than 70 of microplastics in water and sediments they only correlated with domestic influences such as parkland residential and education land uses 4 discussion 4 1 microplastic pollution in gma and western port catchments concerns are rising about the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the environment this is the first time data have been reported from australian inland waters and estuaries this work enriches the world microplastic pollution map and provide spatial features spanning gradients of land use from un developed catchments in conservation areas to more urbanized areas our studies of microplastic concentrations in the gma and western port catchments show that the abundance of microplastic pollution in water and sediment from these areas is low by global comparison being below 50 and 70 respectively of the mean abundances reported in 55 independent studies measured in terms of microplastic items per liter or kilogram supplementary material fig s5 from the compiled results different methods involved in microplastic sampling and measurement complicate efforts to make rigorous global comparisons hidalgo ruz et al 2012 however the ease to make such comparisons is gradually improving as more studies approach a uniform methodology it is hard to conclude general trends of microplastic shape or size in different studies because the field results are largely determined by regional background pellets can be extremely abundant in specific industrial areas lechner and ramler 2015 while they may be absent from remote waterbodies castaneda et al 2014 free et al 2014 regarding microplastic size the concentrations of small particles may be positively correlated with overall abundances but sometimes samples with high abundance can predominantly contain the larger particles 1 mm zhang et al 2017 in our work there are no spatial patterns of microplastics morphological characteristics except for decreasing sizes suggesting that indicated that diffuse plastic pollution is more predominant in our study area than point source plastic pollution some studies have compared different variations in abundances in different waterway types suggesting lentic waterbodies could be a sink for microplastics due to low flow rates and wave energy hu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 however we found no difference in the amount and type of microplastic pollution between streams wetlands and estuaries supplementary material fig s5 microplastic monitoring for environmental management should ensure site selection does not create bias towards particular water body types or spatial features an unbiased approach will improve the representativeness of natural habitat and the strength of any observations and conclusions 4 2 environmental factors affecting spatial patterns of microplastic buoyant microplastics will accumulate in surface waters but eventually deposit in sediments due to bio fouling and other processes reducing their buoyancy galloway et al 2017 before settling down the dispersion of microplastics in waterbodies is inevitably impacted by natural forces such as current wave and weather conditions browne et al 2010 law et al 2010 in our case the most obvious spatial trend was that microplastic concentrations increased downstream fig 5 current and water flow play a major role in the inventory and transport of microplastics downstream as microplastics behave similarly to particles that are neutrally buoyant in water such as plankton and suspended solids di mauro et al 2017 nizzetto et al 2016 extreme hydrological changes from weather events such as floods can strongly alter the microplastic budget in local habitats hurley et al 2018 estuaries and river mouths receive significant proportions of materials including microplastics sourced from inland parts of catchments and may therefore be considered as natural sinks of microplastic pollution leslie et al 2017 luo et al 2019 microplastics are prone to sedimentation as evidenced by differences in polymer types and shapes shown between sediments and water figs 4 and 5 the differences in microplastic concentrations between sediment and water spanned two orders of magnitudes in our study and can reach over six orders of magnitude in a study on lake fischer et al 2016 it was noteworthy that microplastic size decreased with increasing microplastic concentrations in water and sediments fig 3 according to stokes law small neutral or negatively buoyant particles will take more time to settle than larger ones richardson and zaki 1954 zwanzig 1964 if ideal conditions for this law are met large amounts of small microplastics may be transported far away with current and accumulate downstream into the estuaries and oceans on the other hand small microplastics may be directly generated by the fragmentation of large plastic debris and used as indicators for large plastic waste such particles likely account for the missing microplastic fraction in open oceans once deposited in freshwater sediments wang et al 2018 more efforts should be made to track smaller microplastic particles from freshwaters to oceans in future monitoring schemes 4 3 anthropogenic influences on the spatial patterns of microplastics being anthropogenic in origin microplastic footprints in environments are largely determined by anthropogenic influences for example effluents without appropriate treatments from wastewater treatment plants significantly increased microplastics abundances in water and sediment downstream estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 mccormick et al 2016 vermaire et al 2017 plastic industrial activities directly contributed to the microplastic load downstream and in proximal water bodies castaneda et al 2014 mani et al 2015 wagner et al 2019 recreational activity along urban rivers contributes a considerable amount of plastic litter which is a direct source of microplastic kiessling et al 2019 microplastic shape characteristics size distribution and polymer composition have been suggested as associative links for source identification auta et al 2017 the presence of fibers and pellets are considered as indicators of domestic effluents and plastic industry activities respectively lechner and ramler 2015 mintenig et al 2017 the prevalence of microfibers in our water samples suggested that runoff from urban areas is a major source of microfibers land use analysis provides more specific information regarding source identification and has been commonly used as a predictor variable of microplastic pollution peters and bratton 2016 yonkos et al 2014 in the current study microplastic pollution in water and sediment was closely related with the transport industrial and commercial land use those influences were even stronger than the residential activities fig 6 although regional population size has often been proposed as an indicator of microplastic emission level eriksen et al 2013 yonkos et al 2014 efforts have been made to prioritize major pollution sources and trace possible pathways some studies of urban catchments have demonstrated the role of rivers in microplastic transport from land sources to estuaries and open oceans which include the influences from river water discharge sewer and catchment urbanization barrows et al 2018 eo et al 2019 wagner et al 2019 it remained difficult to pinpoint the particular sources of microplastic pollution in estuaries and large lakes given numerous often interacting factors acting on transportation retention and accumulation 4 4 superimposed microplastic pollution in a coastal metropolis of all the plastics ever created only a small faction has been recycled managing plastic pollution sources might be the only tangible solution to reduce microplastic emissions jambeck et al 2015 it is important to identify and address microplastic pollution hotspots our study suggests that coastal population centers with intensive urban land uses are expected to contain higher levels of microplastic pollution especially at regions located downstream of major waterways several suspected local hotspots of microplastic pollution exist such as shanghai and saigon in asian lahens et al 2018 luo et al 2019 amsterdam and the mediterranean region in europe leslie et al 2017 vianello et al 2013 chicago metropolitan area in north america mccormick et al 2014 south africa s coastline in africa de villiers 2019 estuaries and river deltas can provide buffer zones for microplastics received upstream and adjacent urban areas atwood et al 2019 simon sánchez et al 2019 therefore microplastic hotspots within those areas might be caused by the combination between natural accumulation via hydrological dynamics and contribution from increasing anthropogenic influences in the gma and western port area high abundances of microplastics in the surface waters around cities are related to either great urbanization or treated wastewater discharges while australian urban cities have separate storm water and sewerage systems sewage is not common in our urban waterways except where there treated wastewater is discharged into streams in contrast microplastics were most likely carried by surface runoff and associated with urban non point pollution sources for example traffic emission and road pollution account for a large portion of land based microplastic transport to estuaries unice et al 2019 one preliminary study recovered up to 160 000 microplastics per kg soil from roadside dust dehghani et al 2017 which is almost three order of magnitude higher than what we found in gma s sediments urban soils had been also suggested as suspected sinks for microplastics but more field based evidence is needed rillig 2012 unfortunately current technologies cannot provide a full spectrum of microplastic presence in ecosystems due to the challenges in verifying small size microplastics little is known about those plastic particles that are consumed or destroyed by organisms dawson et al 2018 gigault et al 2018 regardless if non point source pollution is the main source of microplastic in aquatic environment or not the pathways involved in microplastic transportation in coastal cities deserve a better understanding fifty percent of the global population is expected to live within 100 km of coastline by 2030 adger et al 2005 the development of coastal urban communities is driven by human actions that directly increase the local environmental stress adger 1999 as shown in our work melbourne waterways received and accumulated a lot of microplastics from upstream and the city itself was also a major source of this pollution recent large scale efforts have been undertaken on global shorelines and river nets to estimate the mass of microplastics entering the ocean eo et al 2019 van wijnen et al 2019 however before we can fill the knowledge gap between sources and sinks we may need to step back further and take a look at our own coastal cities 5 conclusion we have shown spatial pollution patterns of microplastics in water and sediment in the range of greater melbourne area and western port area the catchments are an important source of microplastics entering the oceans urbanized water bodies in this study were more polluted with microplastics compared to other areas when comparing the results with similar international studies the level of microplastic pollution in these urbanized areas is regarded as low the spatial analysis associated with catchment land use levels suggests that microplastic pollution was strengthened by both hydrological dynamics and anthropogenic influences a coastal metropolis first receives microplastic inputs from upstream areas then magnifies its abundance and transportation via urban activities although the pollution sources are still poorly understood a long term and large scale monitoring of microplastics in coastal metropolitan areas should be considered in further global schemes which are important in understanding microplastics fate during the journey from land to sea declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

system has also been widely chosen to activate pds in research reports anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004b rastogi et al 2009 however intrinsic drawbacks exist both in fenton and fe ii pds systems the slow reduction process from fe iii to fe ii leads to the accumulation of fe iii which would inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species ros and result in the formation of ferric oxide sludge pignatello et al 2006 rastogi et al 2009 to solve this problem some reductants have been introduced to the system to promote the reduction of fe iii the first reductant being introduced is hydroxylamine and it significantly enhances the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii h2o2 and fe ii pms systems chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 further research studies have proven that hydroxylamine also displays remarkable facilitation on the degradation of various organic pollutants dyes pesticides and antibiotics in iron based heterogeneous fenton like systems fukuchi et al 2014 hou et al 2017 besides hydroxylamine exhibits significant promotion of the restoration of cu i from cu ii which would accelerate the production of ros from reactions between cu i and h2o2 or o2 kim et al 2015 lee et al 2016 significant enhancement of degradation of pollutants with hydroxylamine has also been achieved in iron activated pds systems tan et al 2012 han et al 2014 bu et al 2017 peng et al 2017 jin et al 2018 decolorization of orange g was improved dramatically with hydroxylamine in fe ii edds pds system at ph 7 0 han et al 2014 more than 95 of ibuprofen could be degraded after 60 min in fe ii nta hydroxylamine pds system while no efficient degradation was achieved without hydroxylamine jin et al 2018 despite the improvement of degradation efficiency detailed reaction schemes of hydroxylamine in those acceleration processes were rarely provided in fe ii pds systems research studies have proven that degradation of pollutants exhibits two stage reaction kinetics fast at the beginning and followed by a slow stage liang et al 2004 chen et al 2011 tan et al 2012 however this two stage reaction kinetics was seldom reported in the case of hydroxylamine in previous research studies zou et al 2013 han et al 2014 bu et al 2017 peng et al 2017 jin et al 2018 in fact detailed kinetic studies of organics degradation with hydroxylamine are still limited since degradation kinetics are external embodiment of the interaction of various reactions in the system it is necessary to conduct a deeper study of kinetic rules for organics degradation with hydroxylamine and compare it with the two stage kinetics in fe ii pds system this can provide a better understanding of the functions and reaction schemes associated with the role of hydroxylamine in accelerating degradation of organics in fe ii pds system in recent years mathematical simulation has been used in research studies of oxidation systems to verify the proposed kinetic model or reaction mechanisms qian et al 2016 predict degradation of organics or generation of products and obtain kinetic constants of reactions zhou et al 2018a b since free radicals such as oh and so4 are in low steady state concentrations normally 1 10 10 12 m yang et al 2014 and difficult to be detected directly mathematical simulation has become an effective way to provide a clear description of the complex chain reaction process of radicals in aops yang built a kinetic model to predict steady state concentrations of hydroxyl radicals sulfate radicals and halide radicals in uv h2o2 and uv pds systems with different water matrix yang et al 2014 qian simulated the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid and the formation of by products in uv pds system with ultrapure and field water qian et al 2016 in fenton or fenton like systems da laat successfully simulated the reaction kinetics of fe iii and h2o2 in the presence of chloride or sulfate ions de laat and le truong 2005 de laat and le 2006 duesterberg simulated the oxidation of p hydroxybenzoic acid and the acceleration effects of quinone in fenton system duesterberg and waite 2007 wu built a kinetic model describing the degradation of 4 tert butylphenol in fe iii edds pds system with the absence or presence of chloride ions wu et al 2015 however compared with h2o2 system kinetic simulation research studies are relatively fewer and no kinetic models has been provided including possible reaction schemes of hydroxylamine in pds system catalyzed by iron species in this study degradation processes of organics in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system were initially investigated with different dosages and adding modes of hydroxylamine to elucidate the effect of hydroxylamine on degradation kinetics of organics to further investigate the detailed reaction schemes a kinetic model capable of simulating the degradation of compounds with hydroxylamine was built and fe ii ascorbic acid pds system was chosen as another typical system accelerated by reductants for comparing simulation investigation to eliminate other distractions the primary fe ii pds systems were used without additional chelating agents benzoic acid was chosen as the main model target compound for its simple structure and high reaction rate constants with so4 neta et al 1988 and oh buxton et al 1988 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sodium persulfate pds benzoic acid n n diethyl p phenylenediamine sulfate salt dpd and peroxidase pod from horseradish were purchased from sigma aldrich inc ferrous sulfate ferric sulfate perchloric acid and sodium hydroxide were supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd nitrobenzene and ascorbic acid h2a were purchased from tianjin guangfu technology development co ltd hydroxylamine sulfate was purchased from j k scientific ltd methanol supplied by tedia was of hplc grade and other chemicals were at least of analytical grade if not specially explained all of these chemicals were used as received without further purification and all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water 2 2 experimental procedures batch scale experiments were conducted at the volume of 100 ml in 150 ml triangular flasks with a constant stirring rate of 600 r min at 25 0 5 c reactions were initiated by adding oxidants pds into the solution containing a desired concentration of target compounds benzoic acid or nitrobenzene fe ii and reductants hydroxylamine or ascorbic acid the solutions were not buffered and initial ph values were adjusted to 3 0 by hclo4 and naoh just before starting the reaction during the whole reaction process the value of ph changed less than 0 4 samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and quenched by excess methanol before analysis to investigate the effect of hydroxylamine addition modes on degradation kinetics of benzoic acid hydroxylamine was divided equally and added periodically with same time intervals during the predetermined reaction time 30 min for experiments focusing on the changes of fe iii concentrations methanol was used as a substitute target compound of benzoic acid and samples were measured immediately without quenching all experiments were conducted in duplicates or triplicates and average values along with one standard deviation less than 5 were performed in figures shown below 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of benzoic acid and nitrobenzene were measured by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 with a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm waters the mobile phase consisted of methanol and water 1 acetic acid and mixed at a ratio of 60 40 v v for nitrobenzene and 45 55 v v for benzoic acid at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the detection wavelengths were 227 nm for benzoic acid and 263 nm for nitrobenzene to measure the concentration of hydroxylamine acetone was added to generate acetone oxime by reacting with hydroxylamine acetone oxime could be further measured by the ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters at 220 nm the mobile phase consisted of methanol and water 0 2 formic acid and mixed at a ratio of 30 70 v v with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 the concentration of total nitrogen tn was measured by a multi n c 3100 analyzer with a total nitrogen detector jena tnm 1 germany the ph value was measured by a ph meter ultrabasic 7 from denver instrument the concentration of pds was measured with a modified dpd pod method at 551 nm fukushima and tatsumi 1998 2005 and the concentration of fe iii was measured directly at 300 nm with 10 cm quartz sampling cells scharf 1971 chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 the uv visible spectrometer used for measuring pds and fe iii concentrations was from hach dr 5000 2 4 distribution calculation and kinetic simulations speciation of fe ii and fe iii were calculated with visual minteq and kinetic simulations for the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe ii ascorbic acid pds systems were performed by kintecus v 6 51 ianni 2018 acid base and complex equilibrium reactions for fe ii and fe iii were considered to be fast and written as forward and reverse reactions separately in the model de laat and le truong 2005 reaction rate constants used were obtained from the literature directly or assumed based on similar reactions or interpreted with experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of benzoic acid with and without hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system degradation profiles of benzoic acid were studied with and without hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system and degradation kinetics of the two systems were compared in fe ii pds system benzoic acid was quickly oxidized in the first 60 s and the degradation rate slowed down during the rest of time after 1200 s 45 of benzoic acid was removed more than 97 of which was degraded within the first 60 s fig 1 a c thus the overall degradation process of benzoic acid could be divided into two stages by an inflection point 60 s an initial and short stage for swiftly decreasing and then a long and slow stage for gradually decreasing or even reaching a plateau liang et al 2004 chen et al 2011 tan et al 2012 this degradation process was in accordance with the two stage reaction kinetic profiles found in previous research studies in fe ii h2o2 and fe ii pds systems in the presence of hydroxylamine the oxidation of benzoic acid was accelerated significantly after 1200 s of reaction more than 60 of benzoic acid was removed 1 37 times of that without hydroxylamine and the reaction was still going on fig 1a c besides the initial concentration of fe ii 10 μm was only 1 of that in fe ii pds system if 10 μm of fe ii was used in fe ii pds system without hydroxylamine less than 10 of benzoic acid would be removed si figure s1 the significant promotion of benzoic acid degradation was in accordance with previous studies in fe ii hydroxylamine h2o2 and fe ii hydroxylamine pms systems chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 indicating that hydroxylamine could effectively accelerate the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii pds system as well furthermore degradation kinetics of benzoic acid with hydroxylamine was obviously different from the two stage reaction kinetics in fe ii pds system fig 1b in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system the degradation rate of benzoic acid decreased gradually in the whole reaction process no obvious inflection points appeared on the degradation profile to divide reaction stages since experiments were conducted under pseudo first order reaction conditions the concentration of pds was at least 25 times higher than that of benzoic acid and less than 20 of pds was consumed during the reaction according to si figure s2 the pseudo first order kinetic model was adopted to describe the degradation process surprisingly the model showed a poorer correlation results r2 0 974 compared with the binomial regression fitting model r2 0 997 fig 1b this result indicated that addition of hydroxylamine not only accelerated the degradation efficiency of benzoic acid but also influenced the degradation kinetic profiles at the same time previous studies claimed that intermediates produced from the degradation of target compounds may influence the reaction kinetics for example self catalysis of phenol when degraded by peroxymonosulfate was resulted from the production of quinine zhou et al 2017 to test whether intermediates of benzoic acid influenced the degradation kinetics with hydroxylamine a different target compound was selected to replace benzoic acid under the same experimental conditions nitrobenzene has different substitute groups from benzoic acid and different oxidation intermediates of the two substances were reported hydroxybenzoic acids for benzoic acid and nitrophenols for nitrobenzene in fenton or fenton like reactions where pds was activated by fe ii species carlos et al 2008 santos et al 2016 rayaroth et al 2017 sun et al 2019 however similar kinetic trends and interpretation results as benzoic acid were observed for the degradation of nitrobenzene in both fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe iii hydroxylamine pds systems si figure s3 thus influence of intermediates of target compounds could be excluded from the major reason for the variation of degradation kinetics with hydroxylamine in addition since initial concentrations of pds and fe ii kept constant in different experiments it could be deduced that hydroxylamine instead of other reagents might play a crucial role in the variation of degradation kinetics thus the function and detailed reaction schemes of hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system were further explored 3 2 exploring the function of hydroxylamine on reaction kinetics benzoic acid could be effectively oxidized by so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and oh 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 rather than metal oxo oxidants such as mn species and fe species 80 m 1 s 1 based on the comparisons of reaction rate constants buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 jacobsen et al 1998 thus it could be used as an indicator to study the function of oh so4 and fe species in relevant oxidation systems similarly nitrobenzene has been commonly used as an indicator of oh with high reaction rate constant 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 while it reacts slowly with so4 less than 106 m 1 s 1 and fe species 1 05 103 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 mártire et al 2002 thus rapid degradation of benzoic acid and nitrobenzene in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system indicated that so4 and oh were the main oxidation species fig 1 and si figure s3 for this degradation process as a reductant hydroxylamine may have double roles during the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii pds system 1 hydroxylamine competitively reacts with so4 and oh and retards the degradation of target compounds 2 hydroxylamine reduces fe iii species into fe ii species and thus facilitates the restoration of fe ii excluding the competition effect for radicals the competition effect for radicals of hydroxylamine was studied first benzoic acid with high initial concentration 100 μm was added in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system and degradation kinetics were explored with different hydroxylamine dosages at the same time with concentrations of hydroxylamine increasing from 0 1 to 0 7 mm oxidation efficiency of benzoic acid increased fig 2 a but the instantaneous reaction rate the slope of the curve ln c c0 t at each point decreased with time in all three experiments fig 2b which was similar to experiment results in section 3 1 besides the decrease was more significant and inflection points appeared on the curve with lower initial concentrations of hydroxylamine similar inflection points were reported on the removal curves of orange g in fe ii edds hydroxylamine pds system and the occurrence time of inflection points changed with different concentration ratios of hydroxylamine to persulfate han et al 2014 explanations provided by the author were that hydroxylamine would consume radicals and lead to insufficient oxidation of orange g however calculations shown below could exclude the scavenging effect of hydroxylamine under our experimental conditions the initial value of ph was 3 0 and it dropped slightly after the reaction si figure s4 so hydroxylamine mainly exists as nh3oh pk a1 5 96 during the reaction process robinson and bower 1961 only 9 4 of benzoic acid exists as dissociated benzoic acid pk a 4 2 zou et al 2013 which was ignored in the follow up calculation the production of the concentration and the reaction rate constant ck was used to evaluate the competitive capacity of hydroxylamine and benzoic acid against the same radical zou et al 2014 under our experiment conditions the initial concentration of benzoic acid kept the same 100 μm in three experiments thus the ck of benzoic acid kept constant on the other hand the initial concentrations of hydroxylamine were varied when hydroxylamine was under the highest initial concentration of 0 7 mm the ck of hydroxylamine was the maximum representing the largest competitive capacity of hydroxylamine compared to benzoic acid the ck of hydroxylamine and benzoic acid for so4 could be calculated as follows with initial concentration of 0 7 mm and 100 μm respectively k so4 hydroxylamine 1 5 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 k so4 benzoic acid 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 ck so4 hydroxylamine 1 05 104 s 1 ck so4 benzoic acid 1 2 105 s 1 based on the above calculations ck of benzoic acid was more than 10 times larger than that of hydroxylamine even at the highest hydroxylamine concentration thus the competitive capacity of hydroxylamine could be ignored for so4 the main active radical during the degradation of benzoic acid in all three experiments similar calculation could be made for oh and the ck of benzoic acid was larger than that of hydroxylamine in all three experiments as well this calculation indicated that scavenging effects of hydroxylamine on so4 and oh were not intense under our experimental conditions and had little competitive impact on the degradation of benzoic acid thus being different from the degradation of orange g in fe ii edds hydroxylamine pds system mentioned before reactions between hydroxylamine and radicals hardly influenced the degradation kinetics of the target compound in our experiment and were not the main cause of the difference in degradation kinetics between fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe ii pds system verification of the acceleration effect on fe ii restoration previous studies reported that the two stage reaction kinetics in fe ii pds system was caused by the variation of fe ii contents and high contents of fe ii could facilitate the oxidation of target pollutant under certain initial concentration ranges liang et al 2004 kambhu et al 2017 in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system the content of fe ii is influenced by reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine the second role of hydroxylamine in the system whether hydroxylamine has an effect on the oxidation kinetics of benzoic acid by influencing the content of fe ii in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system has not yet been clarified to study the effect of the second role of hydroxylamine on benzoic acid oxidation kinetics different hydroxylamine addition modes were used to control the concentrations of fe ii when all amount of hydroxylamine was added at once into the reaction system at the initial stage certain amount of fe ii would be produced one time by reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine if hydroxylamine was divided into several aliquots and added at different time intervals the process of producing fe ii would change with time hydroxylamine 1 4 mm was split into 1 2 5 or 10 aliquots and added during the reaction process 30 min with same time intervals with the increase of divided hydroxylamine aliquots the degradation rate of benzoic acid decreased but the concentration of fe iii turned stable after the first 1 5 min of reaction fig 3 a c the reason was that the concentration of fe iii was determined by the fe iii fe ii cycle in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system fe iii was produced by reactions between fe ii and pds and was consumed by hydroxylamine han et al 2014 with the increase of divided hydroxylamine aliquots lower initial concentrations of hydroxylamine were added into the system leading to less restoration of fe ii and more accumulation of fe iii in the first 1 5 min during the rest of the reaction process the concentration of fe iii kept increasing with sustained consumption of hydroxylamine when hydroxylamine was added at once at the initial stage while for multiple addition modes hydroxylamine could be compensated with additions during the rest reaction processes thus the consumption rate of fe iii was more constant and the concentration of fe ii kept relatively stable with no severe changes since the total concentration of fe ii and fe iii did not change during the whole reaction process the constant concentrations of fe ii indicated that the fe iii concentration was constant with time as well besides oxidation profiles of benzoic acid ln c c0 t also turned straight and were highly correlated with pseudo first order kinetic model with the increase of aliquots n 1 r2 0 950 n 2 r2 0 971 n 5 r2 0 989 n 10 r2 0 995 fig 3b this coincident relationship between uniform degradation kinetics and constant fe ii concentrations in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system was similar to that in fe ii pds system where degradation rates decreased rapidly with sharp consumption of fe ii forming the two stage reaction kinetics for the whole reaction process in the fast reaction stage plenty of fe ii was rapidly consumed by pds which caused the degradation of target pollutants and consumption of fe ii species at a high speed after fe ii was consumed the formation of reactive species was hindered leading to a follow up slow oxidation stage of organics anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004a the consistent relationship between the variation of fe ii concentrations and reaction kinetics suggested that the second role of hydroxylamine to reduce fe iii was the critical factor influencing the oxidation kinetics of benzoic acid in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system 3 3 exploring reaction schemes of hydroxylamine by kinetic simulation to obtain more exact functions of hydroxylamine on reaction kinetics detailed reaction schemes between hydroxylamine and fe iii need to be carefully investigated based on previous results major reactions taking place in the presence of hydroxylamine during the degradation of benzoic acid could be summarized in table 1 previous research studies indicated that the initial reaction step between fe iii and hydroxylamine to form a precursor complex fe nh2oh 3 r1 is fast and prior to the rate limiting step r4 bengtsson et al 2002 besides the complex would go through a rapid reversible redox reaction to produce nh2o r2 which finally forms n2 r3 bengtsson et al 2002 or reacts with fe iii to produce hno when fe iii is in large excess r6 bengtsson et al 2002 under the latter condition the final products might be the mixture of nitrogen oxide and n2 to reduce side reactions and facilitate simulation analysis the initial concentration of hydroxylamine was 140 times higher than that of fe ii in our experiments concentrations of the total nitrogen and hydroxylamine were measured with time and the decomposition ratios of the two were nearly the same after the reaction si figure s5 s6 indicating that hydroxylamine mainly transformed into the gas phase during the reaction thus the reaction between fe iii and nh2o r6 was ignored so that nh2o was the major intermediate and n2 was the only final product of hydroxylamine in the model the following equations would be obtained when the steady state approximation was used for stimulating the formation of nh2o 1 d nh 2 o dt k 1 fe nh 2 oh 3 k 3 so 4 nh 2 oh k 4 oh nh 2 oh k 1 fe ii nh 2 o h k 2 nh 2 o 2 0 by combing eq 1 with r1 and r2 in table 1 fe nh2oh 3 and nh2o could be eliminated and eq 2 was obtained 2 k 3 so 4 k 4 oh k 2 β 1 2 k 1 2 fe iii 2 nh 2 oh fe ii 2 h 2 for the oxidation of benzoic acid in the system 3 d benzoic acid dt k so 4 so 4 benzoic acid k oh oh benzoic acid k obs benzoic acid at ph 3 0 so4 was produced from pds activation anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004a and oh was mainly produced from the reaction between so4 and h2o in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system buxton et al 1988 which implied the concentration of oh was related to the concentration of so4 by combining eqs 2 and 3 it could be deduced that the value of k obs is positively correlated to the value of fe iii 2 hydroxylamine fe ii h 2 since the concentrations of fe ii and hydroxylamine decreased and the concentrations of fe iii and h increased during reaction processes the value of k obs could not keep constant with the degradation of benzoic acid which was consistent with our experiment results based on the reactions listed in table 1 a detailed kinetic model including 47 reactions was established si table s1 since so4 2 was introduced by hydroxylamine sulfate and its initial concentration was 70 times larger than fe ii the distributions of fe ii and fe iii species with changes of ph and addition of so4 2 were calculated si figure s7 s8 though values of ph decreased for 0 35 units during the reaction process the major specie of fe iii was always feso4 si figure s7 and the major species of fe ii were fe2 and feso4 si figure s8 thus complexation reactions between iron species and sulfate ions and acid base equilibrium reactions of fe ii and fe iii were taken into consideration in the model together with reactions involving radicals and benzoic acid simulation results of reactions including hydroxylamine are listed in table 2 to better verify the proposed schemes in table 1 fast equilibrium reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine were written as forward and reversed reactions r7 r10 in table 2 and all of the reversed rate constants were assumed larger than the reaction rate constant of nh2o r13 in table 2 to ensure the rate limiting step the degradation of benzoic acid with reaction time was simulated by the model under the variation of fe ii benzoic acid or pds concentrations and results were all highly correlated with experimental data r2 0 99 fig 4 the accurate simulation by the model further supported the proposed mechanisms r1 r5 in table 1 in which reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine were fast equilibrium reactions r1 r2 according to the simulation results reaction rate constants of hydroxylamine and radicals were 1 5 107 m 1 s 1 for so4 and 1 15 108 m 1 s 1 for oh r11 r12 both smaller than the reaction rate constant 2 8 108 m 1 s 1 of the rate limiting step between fe iii and hydroxylamine r13 thus major reactions hydroxylamine participated were reactions with fe iii to produce fe ii instead of reacting with radicals in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system concentrations of hydroxylamine showed the same decreasing trends during reactions with or without benzoic acid si figure s6 which further proved that so4 was mainly consumed by other reagents instead of hydroxylamine with the addition of hydroxylamine fe ii was continuously restored to react with pds and so4 was produced to keep pollutants degrading thus the reaction kinetics had no obvious inflections points being different from the two stage kinetics without hydroxylamine this simulation was in accordance with previous experiment results that reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine were the main cause of the kinetic changes 3 4 degradation kinetics of benzoic acid in fe ii ascorbic acid pds system besides hydroxylamine other reductants such as thiosulfate liang et al 2004 s ii zhao et al 2017 and ascorbic acid lei et al 2015 have also been introduced to accelerate degradation of pollutants in fe ii pds systems in previous research studies and degradation kinetics were found to be similar to the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system oh et al 2009 lei et al 2015 miao et al 2015 peng et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 based on the discussion above reactions between hydroxylamine and fe iii were the main cause of the changes of degradation kinetics in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system thus a hypothesis could be proposed that reactants with similar acceleration effects as that exhibited by hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system might yield similar degradation kinetics of organic compounds to verify this hypothesis ascorbic acid was chosen to replace hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system and the degradation of benzoic acid was measured with different ascorbic acid concentrations fig 5 a when the concentration of ascorbic acid was 1 4 mm degradation kinetics of benzoic acid exhibited the same trend as that in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system and polynomial regression analysis also showed a high correlation coefficient fig 5b which was consistent with the hypothesis above however when the concentration of ascorbic acid was 0 6 or 1 0 mm degradation kinetics exhibited a different trend from that in the presence of hydroxylamine instead the degradation kinetics had more similarity to the two stages degradation kinetics in fe ii pds system which deviated from our hypothesis to further explain the degradation kinetics in fe ii ascorbic acid pds system detailed reaction schemes between fe iii and ascorbic acid were explored as well based on previous literature ascorbic acid mainly acted as a reducing and chelating agent in fe iii ascorbic acid pds systems lei et al 2015 supposed reaction schemes between ascorbic acid and fe iii are summarized in table 3 where a fe iii ascorbic acid complex is formed at first and then ascorbyl radicals and fe ii are obtained during reduction xu and jordan 1990 to simplify the analysis only mono fe iii ascorbic acid complexes were considered and reactions between complexes and fe iii as well as fe iii and ascorbyl radicals were ignored under experimental conditions of excess ascorbic acid at ph 3 0 the concentration of unionized ascorbic acid h2a was about ten times of that of deprotonated ascorbic acid ha pk a1 4 2 gorman and clydesdale 1983 and both of them were taken into the consideration in the reaction schemes evidence from previous research studies indicated that the colored fe iii ascorbic acid complexes were rapidly formed and existed for milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds by spectrum detection r15 r17 and redox steps to form fe ii r18 r19 were slow xu and jordan 1990 bánsch further found fe3 and feoh2 went through different reaction mechanisms with ascorbic acid under conditions of excess ascorbic acid bansch et al 1991 which was similar to our experiments thus a kinetic model based on reactions in table 3 but including the variety of fe iii species acid base equilibrium reactions of fe iii and reactions of ascorbyl radicals was built with 49 reactions in total si table s2 reactions including ascorbic acid of the model are listed in table 4 the concentration of so4 2 was smaller in fe ii ascorbic acid pds system than that in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system because no hydroxylamine sulfate was introduced and so4 2 was only provided by feso4 and the decomposition of pds under this condition the equilibrium and complexation reactions between so4 2 and fe ii were ignored because nearly 100 of fe ii existed in the form of fe2 in fe ii ascorbic acid pds system si figure s9 the equilibrium reactions between fe iii and ascorbic acid were considered fast and written as forward and reversed reactions r21 r23 in table 4 to verify the proposed schemes in table 3 other reactions including so4 and oh as well as benzoic acid were the same as the reactions used in the kinetic model of hydroxylamine the model was adopted to simulate the experimental data with changes of ascorbic acid concentrations by kintecus v 6 51 fig 6 and all three simulation results had good correlation coefficients r2 0 95 the differentiation between simulation results and experimental data might come from differences of reaction rate constants between experimental and literature conditions this simulation could further support the reaction schemes in table 3 where a fe iii ascorbic acid complex reversibly formed at first and fe ii and ascorbyl radicals were then produced 3 5 comparison of reaction schemes between hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid during the degradation of benzoic acid by comparing the simulated reaction schemes between fe iii ascorbic acid and fe iii hydroxylamine the kinetic difference of benzoic acid degradation in fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe ii ascorbic acid pds system with 0 6 or 1 0 mm ascorbic acid could be explained fe ii was produced by two fast equilibrium reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine r1 r2 in table 1 with a total equilibrium constant of 2 6 10 9 m2 the production of β1 and k 1 lind and merényi 2006 while in the system of fe iii and ascorbic acid fe ii was formed by a two stage reaction process in the first stage of equilibrium reactions r15 r17 in table 3 the fe iii ascorbic complex was formed with an equilibrium constant of 2 08 m 1 k 15 in table 3 bansch et al 1991 even larger than the total equilibrium constant between fe3 and hydroxylamine based on the simulation results the rate constant of the follow up reduction process to produce fe ii was 108 m 1 s 1 for fe h2a 3 r18 r19 in table 3 which was in the same order as the reaction rate constant of nh2o r3 in table 1 the rate limiting step of reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine thus fe iii reacted significantly faster with hydroxylamine than with ascorbic acid moreover ascorbic acid had larger reaction rate constants with so4 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and oh 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 compared with hydroxylamine 1 5 107 m 1 s 1 for so4 and 1 15 108 m 1 s 1 for oh at experimental conditions zhou et al 2018a when in small concentrations as 0 6 or 1 0 mm ascorbic acid was mainly consumed by reacting with radicals instead of reducing fe iii thus the degradation kinetics was decided by the initial concentration of fe ii and the reaction would quickly slow down when fe ii was consumed and fe iii was accumulated then fe ii was gradually produced by reactions between accumulated fe iii and ascorbic acid leading to slow degradation of benzoic acid and the formation of the two stage degradation kinetics with increase in ascorbic acid concentrations the influence of side reactions became weaker fe ii was restored by reactions between ascorbic acid and fe iii as hydroxylamine did and the degradation kinetics exhibited the same trend possible reaction schemes of fe iii hydroxylamine and fe iii ascorbic acid during benzoic acid degradation process were summarized in fig 7 4 conclusions in this work kinetic models were developed and successfully simulated the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe ii ascorbic acid pds system the model provided a detailed description of oxidation processes of organic pollutants it could help to assess the extent of each reaction s contribution to organics degradation and identify the critical reaction step different reaction schemes of hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid were found by investigating models and degradation kinetics of organics both hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid formed intermediate complexes with fe iii but the reduction step to produce fe ii was faster for the complex formed with hydroxylamine resulting in sustained degradation of organics instead of the two stage kinetics as ascorbic acid added in small concentrations since introducing compounds capable of accelerating fe iii fe ii cycle has been a research direction to promote pollutant degradation and reduce sludge production in fenton or fenton like system this comparison of reaction schemes and kinetic models of two common reductants could be a useful reference to provide information on the role of influence factors that should be considered in choosing efficient chemicals with similar

18393,hydroxylamine showed an outstanding performance on enhancing the oxidation of pollutants in fe ii involved advanced oxidation processes while the detailed reaction schemes have not been fully revealed specific functions of hydroxylamine in the oxidation of benzoic acid with fe ii persulfate pds system were explored with the addition of hydroxylamine degradation kinetics of benzoic acid deviated from both two stage kinetics and pseudo first order kinetics but could be interpreted well with binomial regression analysis degradation rate constant k obs of benzoic acid was calculated and showed the same variation trend with hydroxylamine fe iii 2 fe ii h 2 the value of which was changed during reaction processes a detailed kinetic model for simulating the degradation profile of benzoic acid with hydroxylamine acceleration was proposed for the first time and indicated that interactions of hydroxylamine and fe iii were fast equilibrium reactions which was a dominant factor influencing the oxidation kinetics of benzoic acid in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system comparative study showed that when 1 4 mm of ascorbic acid was added into fe ii pds system degradation kinetics of benzoic acid was similar to that enhanced by hydroxylamine however when 0 6 mm or 1 0 mm of ascorbic acid was added oxidation kinetics still presented as the two stage profile kinetic simulations indicated that fe ii was produced slower from fe iii ascorbic acid complexes than that with hydroxylamine which caused the difference in oxidation kinetics this study could improve our understanding about the effect of hydroxylamine and other reductants in promoting pollutants elimination in fe ii pds system graphical abstract image 1 keywords kinetic model advanced oxidation process

2006 tsitonaki et al 2010 yang et al 2016 guan et al 2018 besides hydrogen peroxide persulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms are drawn increasing attention because of the ability to produce sulfate radicals so4 chan and chu 2009 tsitonaki et al 2010 long et al 2014 compared with hydroxyl radical oh so4 has longer half life period and better selectivity for contaminants degradation showing a promising application prospect in soil and groundwater remediation xie et al 2015 yang et al 2016 so4 could be produced by activating pds in various ways heat uv base transition metals and ultrasound anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004a furman et al 2010 xu et al 2015 wei et al 2017 guan et al 2018 among these means of activation fe ii an environmental friendly and cost effective catalyst in fenton system has also been widely chosen to activate pds in research reports anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004b rastogi et al 2009 however intrinsic drawbacks exist both in fenton and fe ii pds systems the slow reduction process from fe iii to fe ii leads to the accumulation of fe iii which would inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species ros and result in the formation of ferric oxide sludge pignatello et al 2006 rastogi et al 2009 to solve this problem some reductants have been introduced to the system to promote the reduction of fe iii the first reductant being introduced is hydroxylamine and it significantly enhances the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii h2o2 and fe ii pms systems chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 further research studies have proven that hydroxylamine also displays remarkable facilitation on the degradation of various organic pollutants dyes pesticides and antibiotics in iron based heterogeneous fenton like systems fukuchi et al 2014 hou et al 2017 besides hydroxylamine exhibits significant promotion of the restoration of cu i from cu ii which would accelerate the production of ros from reactions between cu i and h2o2 or o2 kim et al 2015 lee et al 2016 significant enhancement of degradation of pollutants with hydroxylamine has also been achieved in iron activated pds systems tan et al 2012 han et al 2014 bu et al 2017 peng et al 2017 jin et al 2018 decolorization of orange g was improved dramatically with hydroxylamine in fe ii edds pds system at ph 7 0 han et al 2014 more than 95 of ibuprofen could be degraded after 60 min in fe ii nta hydroxylamine pds system while no efficient degradation was achieved without hydroxylamine jin et al 2018 despite the improvement of degradation efficiency detailed reaction schemes of hydroxylamine in those acceleration processes were rarely provided in fe ii pds systems research studies have proven that degradation of pollutants exhibits two stage reaction kinetics fast at the beginning and followed by a slow stage liang et al 2004 chen et al 2011 tan et al 2012 however this two stage reaction kinetics was seldom reported in the case of hydroxylamine in previous research studies zou et al 2013 han et al 2014 bu et al 2017 peng et al 2017 jin et al 2018 in fact detailed kinetic studies of organics degradation with hydroxylamine are still limited since degradation kinetics are external embodiment of the interaction of various reactions in the system it is necessary to conduct a deeper study of kinetic rules for organics degradation with hydroxylamine and compare it with the two stage kinetics in fe ii pds system this can provide a better understanding of the functions and reaction schemes associated with the role of hydroxylamine in accelerating degradation of organics in fe ii pds system in recent years mathematical simulation has been used in research studies of oxidation systems to verify the proposed kinetic model or reaction mechanisms qian et al 2016 predict degradation of organics or generation of products and obtain kinetic constants of reactions zhou et al 2018a b since free radicals such as oh and so4 are in low steady state concentrations normally 1 10 10 12 m yang et al 2014 and difficult to be detected directly mathematical simulation has become an effective way to provide a clear description of the complex chain reaction process of radicals in aops yang built a kinetic model to predict steady state concentrations of hydroxyl radicals sulfate radicals and halide radicals in uv h2o2 and uv pds systems with different water matrix yang et al 2014 qian simulated the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid and the formation of by products in uv pds system with ultrapure and field water qian et al 2016 in fenton or fenton like systems da laat successfully simulated the reaction kinetics of fe iii and h2o2 in the presence of chloride or sulfate ions de laat and le truong 2005 de laat and le 2006 duesterberg simulated the oxidation of p hydroxybenzoic acid and the acceleration effects of quinone in fenton system duesterberg and waite 2007 wu built a kinetic model describing the degradation of 4 tert butylphenol in fe iii edds pds system with the absence or presence of chloride ions wu et al 2015 however compared with h2o2 system kinetic simulation research studies are relatively fewer and no kinetic models has been provided including possible reaction schemes of hydroxylamine in pds system catalyzed by iron species in this study degradation processes of organics in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system were initially investigated with different dosages and adding modes of hydroxylamine to elucidate the effect of hydroxylamine on degradation kinetics of organics to further investigate the detailed reaction schemes a kinetic model capable of simulating the degradation of compounds with hydroxylamine was built and fe ii ascorbic acid pds system was chosen as another typical system accelerated by reductants for comparing simulation investigation to eliminate other distractions the primary fe ii pds systems were used without additional chelating agents benzoic acid was chosen as the main model target compound for its simple structure and high reaction rate constants with so4 neta et al 1988 and oh buxton et al 1988 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sodium persulfate pds benzoic acid n n diethyl p phenylenediamine sulfate salt dpd and peroxidase pod from horseradish were purchased from sigma aldrich inc ferrous sulfate ferric sulfate perchloric acid and sodium hydroxide were supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd nitrobenzene and ascorbic acid h2a were purchased from tianjin guangfu technology development co ltd hydroxylamine sulfate was purchased from j k scientific ltd methanol supplied by tedia was of hplc grade and other chemicals were at least of analytical grade if not specially explained all of these chemicals were used as received without further purification and all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water 2 2 experimental procedures batch scale experiments were conducted at the volume of 100 ml in 150 ml triangular flasks with a constant stirring rate of 600 r min at 25 0 5 c reactions were initiated by adding oxidants pds into the solution containing a desired concentration of target compounds benzoic acid or nitrobenzene fe ii and reductants hydroxylamine or ascorbic acid the solutions were not buffered and initial ph values were adjusted to 3 0 by hclo4 and naoh just before starting the reaction during the whole reaction process the value of ph changed less than 0 4 samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and quenched by excess methanol before analysis to investigate the effect of hydroxylamine addition modes on degradation kinetics of benzoic acid hydroxylamine was divided equally and added periodically with same time intervals during the predetermined reaction time 30 min for experiments focusing on the changes of fe iii concentrations methanol was used as a substitute target compound of benzoic acid and samples were measured immediately without quenching all experiments were conducted in duplicates or triplicates and average values along with one standard deviation less than 5 were performed in figures shown below 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of benzoic acid and nitrobenzene were measured by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 with a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm waters the mobile phase consisted of methanol and water 1 acetic acid and mixed at a ratio of 60 40 v v for nitrobenzene and 45 55 v v for benzoic acid at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the detection wavelengths were 227 nm for benzoic acid and 263 nm for nitrobenzene to measure the concentration of hydroxylamine acetone was added to generate acetone oxime by reacting with hydroxylamine acetone oxime could be further measured by the ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters at 220 nm the mobile phase consisted of methanol and water 0 2 formic acid and mixed at a ratio of 30 70 v v with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 the concentration of total nitrogen tn was measured by a multi n c 3100 analyzer with a total nitrogen detector jena tnm 1 germany the ph value was measured by a ph meter ultrabasic 7 from denver instrument the concentration of pds was measured with a modified dpd pod method at 551 nm fukushima and tatsumi 1998 2005 and the concentration of fe iii was measured directly at 300 nm with 10 cm quartz sampling cells scharf 1971 chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 the uv visible spectrometer used for measuring pds and fe iii concentrations was from hach dr 5000 2 4 distribution calculation and kinetic simulations speciation of fe ii and fe iii were calculated with visual minteq and kinetic simulations for the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe ii ascorbic acid pds systems were performed by kintecus v 6 51 ianni 2018 acid base and complex equilibrium reactions for fe ii and fe iii were considered to be fast and written as forward and reverse reactions separately in the model de laat and le truong 2005 reaction rate constants used were obtained from the literature directly or assumed based on similar reactions or interpreted with experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of benzoic acid with and without hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system degradation profiles of benzoic acid were studied with and without hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system and degradation kinetics of the two systems were compared in fe ii pds system benzoic acid was quickly oxidized in the first 60 s and the degradation rate slowed down during the rest of time after 1200 s 45 of benzoic acid was removed more than 97 of which was degraded within the first 60 s fig 1 a c thus the overall degradation process of benzoic acid could be divided into two stages by an inflection point 60 s an initial and short stage for swiftly decreasing and then a long and slow stage for gradually decreasing or even reaching a plateau liang et al 2004 chen et al 2011 tan et al 2012 this degradation process was in accordance with the two stage reaction kinetic profiles found in previous research studies in fe ii h2o2 and fe ii pds systems in the presence of hydroxylamine the oxidation of benzoic acid was accelerated significantly after 1200 s of reaction more than 60 of benzoic acid was removed 1 37 times of that without hydroxylamine and the reaction was still going on fig 1a c besides the initial concentration of fe ii 10 μm was only 1 of that in fe ii pds system if 10 μm of fe ii was used in fe ii pds system without hydroxylamine less than 10 of benzoic acid would be removed si figure s1 the significant promotion of benzoic acid degradation was in accordance with previous studies in fe ii hydroxylamine h2o2 and fe ii hydroxylamine pms systems chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 indicating that hydroxylamine could effectively accelerate the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii pds system as well furthermore degradation kinetics of benzoic acid with hydroxylamine was obviously different from the two stage reaction kinetics in fe ii pds system fig 1b in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system the degradation rate of benzoic acid decreased gradually in the whole reaction process no obvious inflection points appeared on the degradation profile to divide reaction stages since experiments were conducted under pseudo first order reaction conditions the concentration of pds was at least 25 times higher than that of benzoic acid and less than 20 of pds was consumed during the reaction according to si figure s2 the pseudo first order kinetic model was adopted to describe the degradation process surprisingly the model showed a poorer correlation results r2 0 974 compared with the binomial regression fitting model r2 0 997 fig 1b this result indicated that addition of hydroxylamine not only accelerated the degradation efficiency of benzoic acid but also influenced the degradation kinetic profiles at the same time previous studies claimed that intermediates produced from the degradation of target compounds may influence the reaction kinetics for example self catalysis of phenol when degraded by peroxymonosulfate was resulted from the production of quinine zhou et al 2017 to test whether intermediates of benzoic acid influenced the degradation kinetics with hydroxylamine a different target compound was selected to replace benzoic acid under the same experimental conditions nitrobenzene has different substitute groups from benzoic acid and different oxidation intermediates of the two substances were reported hydroxybenzoic acids for benzoic acid and nitrophenols for nitrobenzene in fenton or fenton like reactions where pds was activated by fe ii species carlos et al 2008 santos et al 2016 rayaroth et al 2017 sun et al 2019 however similar kinetic trends and interpretation results as benzoic acid were observed for the degradation of nitrobenzene in both fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe iii hydroxylamine pds systems si figure s3 thus influence of intermediates of target compounds could be excluded from the major reason for the variation of degradation kinetics with hydroxylamine in addition since initial concentrations of pds and fe ii kept constant in different experiments it could be deduced that hydroxylamine instead of other reagents might play a crucial role in the variation of degradation kinetics thus the function and detailed reaction schemes of hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system were further explored 3 2 exploring the function of hydroxylamine on reaction kinetics benzoic acid could be effectively oxidized by so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and oh 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 rather than metal oxo oxidants such as mn species and fe species 80 m 1 s 1 based on the comparisons of reaction rate constants buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 jacobsen et al 1998 thus it could be used as an indicator to study the function of oh so4 and fe species in relevant oxidation systems similarly nitrobenzene has been commonly used as an indicator of oh with high reaction rate constant 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 while it reacts slowly with so4 less than 106 m 1 s 1 and fe species 1 05 103 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 mártire et al 2002 thus rapid degradation of benzoic acid and nitrobenzene in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system indicated that so4 and oh were the main oxidation species fig 1 and si figure s3 for this degradation process as a reductant hydroxylamine may have double roles during the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii pds system 1 hydroxylamine competitively reacts with so4 and oh and retards the degradation of target compounds 2 hydroxylamine reduces fe iii species into fe ii species and thus facilitates the restoration of fe ii excluding the competition effect for radicals the competition effect for radicals of hydroxylamine was studied first benzoic acid with high initial concentration 100 μm was added in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system and degradation kinetics were explored with different hydroxylamine dosages at the same time with concentrations of hydroxylamine increasing from 0 1 to 0 7 mm oxidation efficiency of benzoic acid increased fig 2 a but the instantaneous reaction rate the slope of the curve ln c c0 t at each point decreased with time in all three experiments fig 2b which was similar to experiment results in section 3 1 besides the decrease was more significant and inflection points appeared on the curve with lower initial concentrations of hydroxylamine similar inflection points were reported on the removal curves of orange g in fe ii edds hydroxylamine pds system and the occurrence time of inflection points changed with different concentration ratios of hydroxylamine to persulfate han et al 2014 explanations provided by the author were that hydroxylamine would consume radicals and lead to insufficient oxidation of orange g however calculations shown below could exclude the scavenging effect of hydroxylamine under our experimental conditions the initial value of ph was 3 0 and it dropped slightly after the reaction si figure s4 so hydroxylamine mainly exists as nh3oh pk a1 5 96 during the reaction process robinson and bower 1961 only 9 4 of benzoic acid exists as dissociated benzoic acid pk a 4 2 zou et al 2013 which was ignored in the follow up calculation the production of the concentration and the reaction rate constant ck was used to evaluate the competitive capacity of hydroxylamine and benzoic acid against the same radical zou et al 2014 under our experiment conditions the initial concentration of benzoic acid kept the same 100 μm in three experiments thus the ck of benzoic acid kept constant on the other hand the initial concentrations of hydroxylamine were varied when hydroxylamine was under the highest initial concentration of 0 7 mm the ck of hydroxylamine was the maximum representing the largest competitive capacity of hydroxylamine compared to benzoic acid the ck of hydroxylamine and benzoic acid for so4 could be calculated as follows with initial concentration of 0 7 mm and 100 μm respectively k so4 hydroxylamine 1 5 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 k so4 benzoic acid 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 ck so4 hydroxylamine 1 05 104 s 1 ck so4 benzoic acid 1 2 105 s 1 based on the above calculations ck of benzoic acid was more than 10 times larger than that of hydroxylamine even at the highest hydroxylamine concentration thus the competitive capacity of hydroxylamine could be ignored for so4 the main active radical during the degradation of benzoic acid in all three experiments similar calculation could be made for oh and the ck of benzoic acid was larger than that of hydroxylamine in all three experiments as well this calculation indicated that scavenging effects of hydroxylamine on so4 and oh were not intense under our experimental conditions and had little competitive impact on the degradation of benzoic acid thus being different from the degradation of orange g in fe ii edds hydroxylamine pds system mentioned before reactions between hydroxylamine and radicals hardly influenced the degradation kinetics of the target compound in our experiment and were not the main cause of the difference in degradation kinetics between fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe ii pds system verification of the acceleration effect on fe ii restoration previous studies reported that the two stage reaction kinetics in fe ii pds system was caused by the variation of fe ii contents and high contents of fe ii could facilitate the oxidation of target pollutant under certain initial concentration ranges liang et al 2004 kambhu et al 2017 in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system the content of fe ii is influenced by reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine the second role of hydroxylamine in the system whether hydroxylamine has an effect on the oxidation kinetics of benzoic acid by influencing the content of fe ii in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system has not yet been clarified to study the effect of the second role of hydroxylamine on benzoic acid oxidation kinetics different hydroxylamine addition modes were used to control the concentrations of fe ii when all amount of hydroxylamine was added at once into the reaction system at the initial stage certain amount of fe ii would be produced one time by reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine if hydroxylamine was divided into several aliquots and added at different time intervals the process of producing fe ii would change with time hydroxylamine 1 4 mm was split into 1 2 5 or 10 aliquots and added during the reaction process 30 min with same time intervals with the increase of divided hydroxylamine aliquots the degradation rate of benzoic acid decreased but the concentration of fe iii turned stable after the first 1 5 min of reaction fig 3 a c the reason was that the concentration of fe iii was determined by the fe iii fe ii cycle in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system fe iii was produced by reactions between fe ii and pds and was consumed by hydroxylamine han et al 2014 with the increase of divided hydroxylamine aliquots lower initial concentrations of hydroxylamine were added into the system leading to less restoration of fe ii and more accumulation of fe iii in the first 1 5 min during the rest of the reaction process the concentration of fe iii kept increasing with sustained consumption of hydroxylamine when hydroxylamine was added at once at the initial stage while for multiple addition modes hydroxylamine could be compensated with additions during the rest reaction processes thus the consumption rate of fe iii was more constant and the concentration of fe ii kept relatively stable with no severe changes since the total concentration of fe ii and fe iii did not change during the whole reaction process the constant concentrations of fe ii indicated that the fe iii concentration was constant with time as well besides oxidation profiles of benzoic acid ln c c0 t also turned straight and were highly correlated with pseudo first order kinetic model with the increase of aliquots n 1 r2 0 950 n 2 r2 0 971 n 5 r2 0 989 n 10 r2 0 995 fig 3b this coincident relationship between uniform degradation kinetics and constant fe ii concentrations in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system was similar to that in fe ii pds system where degradation rates decreased rapidly with sharp consumption of fe ii forming the two stage reaction kinetics for the whole reaction process in the fast reaction stage plenty of fe ii was rapidly consumed by pds which caused the degradation of target pollutants and consumption of fe ii species at a high speed after fe ii was consumed the formation of reactive species was hindered leading to a follow up slow oxidation stage of organics anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004a the consistent relationship between the variation of fe ii concentrations and reaction kinetics suggested that the second role of hydroxylamine to reduce fe iii was the critical factor influencing the oxidation kinetics of benzoic acid in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system 3 3 exploring reaction schemes of hydroxylamine by kinetic simulation to obtain more exact functions of hydroxylamine on reaction kinetics detailed reaction schemes between hydroxylamine and fe iii need to be carefully investigated based on previous results major reactions taking place in the presence of hydroxylamine during the degradation of benzoic acid could be summarized in table 1 previous research studies indicated that the initial reaction step between fe iii and hydroxylamine to form a precursor complex fe nh2oh 3 r1 is fast and prior to the rate limiting step r4 bengtsson et al 2002 besides the complex would go through a rapid reversible redox reaction to produce nh2o r2 which finally forms n2 r3 bengtsson et al 2002 or reacts with fe iii to produce hno when fe iii is in large excess r6 bengtsson et al 2002 under the latter condition the final products might be the mixture of nitrogen oxide and n2 to reduce side reactions and facilitate simulation analysis the initial concentration of hydroxylamine was 140 times higher than that of fe ii in our experiments concentrations of the total nitrogen and hydroxylamine were measured with time and the decomposition ratios of the two were nearly the same after the reaction si figure s5 s6 indicating that hydroxylamine mainly transformed into the gas phase during the reaction thus the reaction between fe iii and nh2o r6 was ignored so that nh2o was the major intermediate and n2 was the only final product of hydroxylamine in the model the following equations would be obtained when the steady state approximation was used for stimulating the formation of nh2o 1 d nh 2 o dt k 1 fe nh 2 oh 3 k 3 so 4 nh 2 oh k 4 oh nh 2 oh k 1 fe ii nh 2 o h k 2 nh 2 o 2 0 by combing eq 1 with r1 and r2 in table 1 fe nh2oh 3 and nh2o could be eliminated and eq 2 was obtained 2 k 3 so 4 k 4 oh k 2 β 1 2 k 1 2 fe iii 2 nh 2 oh fe ii 2 h 2 for the oxidation of benzoic acid in the system 3 d benzoic acid dt k so 4 so 4 benzoic acid k oh oh benzoic acid k obs benzoic acid at ph 3 0 so4 was produced from pds activation anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004a and oh was mainly produced from the reaction between so4 and h2o in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system buxton et al 1988 which implied the concentration of oh was related to the concentration of so4 by combining eqs 2 and 3 it could be deduced that the value of k obs is positively correlated to the value of fe iii 2 hydroxylamine fe ii h 2 since the concentrations of fe ii and hydroxylamine decreased and the concentrations of fe iii and h increased during reaction processes the value of k obs could not keep constant with the degradation of benzoic acid which was consistent with our experiment results based on the reactions listed in table 1 a detailed kinetic model including 47 reactions was established si table s1 since so4 2 was introduced by hydroxylamine sulfate and its initial concentration was 70 times larger than fe ii the distributions of fe ii and fe iii species with changes of ph and addition of so4 2 were calculated si figure s7 s8 though values of ph decreased for 0 35 units during the reaction process the major specie of fe iii was always feso4 si figure s7 and the major species of fe ii were fe2 and feso4 si figure s8 thus complexation reactions between iron species and sulfate ions and acid base equilibrium reactions of fe ii and fe iii were taken into consideration in the model together with reactions involving radicals and benzoic acid simulation results of reactions including hydroxylamine are listed in table 2 to better verify the proposed schemes in table 1 fast equilibrium reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine were written as forward and reversed reactions r7 r10 in table 2 and all of the reversed rate constants were assumed larger than the reaction rate constant of nh2o r13 in table 2 to ensure the rate limiting step the degradation of benzoic acid with reaction time was simulated by the model under the variation of fe ii benzoic acid or pds concentrations and results were all highly correlated with experimental data r2 0 99 fig 4 the accurate simulation by the model further supported the proposed mechanisms r1 r5 in table 1 in which reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine were fast equilibrium reactions r1 r2 according to the simulation results reaction rate constants of hydroxylamine and radicals were 1 5 107 m 1 s 1 for so4 and 1 15 108 m 1 s 1 for oh r11 r12 both smaller than the reaction rate constant 2 8 108 m 1 s 1 of the rate limiting step between fe iii and hydroxylamine r13 thus major reactions hydroxylamine participated were reactions with fe iii to produce fe ii instead of reacting with radicals in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system concentrations of hydroxylamine showed the same decreasing trends during reactions with or without benzoic acid si figure s6 which further proved that so4 was mainly consumed by other reagents instead of hydroxylamine with the addition of hydroxylamine fe ii was continuously restored to react with pds and so4 was produced to keep pollutants degrading thus the reaction kinetics had no obvious inflections points being different from the two stage kinetics without hydroxylamine this simulation was in accordance with previous experiment results that reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine were the main cause of the kinetic changes 3 4 degradation kinetics of benzoic acid in fe ii ascorbic acid pds system besides hydroxylamine other reductants such as thiosulfate liang et al 2004 s ii zhao et al 2017 and ascorbic acid lei et al 2015 have also been introduced to accelerate degradation of pollutants in fe ii pds systems in previous research studies and degradation kinetics were found to be similar to the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system oh et al 2009 lei et al 2015 miao et al 2015 peng et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 based on the discussion above reactions between hydroxylamine and fe iii were the main cause of the changes of degradation kinetics in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system thus a hypothesis could be proposed that reactants with similar acceleration effects as that exhibited by hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system might yield similar degradation kinetics of organic compounds to verify this hypothesis ascorbic acid was chosen to replace hydroxylamine in fe ii pds system and the degradation of benzoic acid was measured with different ascorbic acid concentrations fig 5 a when the concentration of ascorbic acid was 1 4 mm degradation kinetics of benzoic acid exhibited the same trend as that in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system and polynomial regression analysis also showed a high correlation coefficient fig 5b which was consistent with the hypothesis above however when the concentration of ascorbic acid was 0 6 or 1 0 mm degradation kinetics exhibited a different trend from that in the presence of hydroxylamine instead the degradation kinetics had more similarity to the two stages degradation kinetics in fe ii pds system which deviated from our hypothesis to further explain the degradation kinetics in fe ii ascorbic acid pds system detailed reaction schemes between fe iii and ascorbic acid were explored as well based on previous literature ascorbic acid mainly acted as a reducing and chelating agent in fe iii ascorbic acid pds systems lei et al 2015 supposed reaction schemes between ascorbic acid and fe iii are summarized in table 3 where a fe iii ascorbic acid complex is formed at first and then ascorbyl radicals and fe ii are obtained during reduction xu and jordan 1990 to simplify the analysis only mono fe iii ascorbic acid complexes were considered and reactions between complexes and fe iii as well as fe iii and ascorbyl radicals were ignored under experimental conditions of excess ascorbic acid at ph 3 0 the concentration of unionized ascorbic acid h2a was about ten times of that of deprotonated ascorbic acid ha pk a1 4 2 gorman and clydesdale 1983 and both of them were taken into the consideration in the reaction schemes evidence from previous research studies indicated that the colored fe iii ascorbic acid complexes were rapidly formed and existed for milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds by spectrum detection r15 r17 and redox steps to form fe ii r18 r19 were slow xu and jordan 1990 bánsch further found fe3 and feoh2 went through different reaction mechanisms with ascorbic acid under conditions of excess ascorbic acid bansch et al 1991 which was similar to our experiments thus a kinetic model based on reactions in table 3 but including the variety of fe iii species acid base equilibrium reactions of fe iii and reactions of ascorbyl radicals was built with 49 reactions in total si table s2 reactions including ascorbic acid of the model are listed in table 4 the concentration of so4 2 was smaller in fe ii ascorbic acid pds system than that in fe ii hydroxylamine pds system because no hydroxylamine sulfate was introduced and so4 2 was only provided by feso4 and the decomposition of pds under this condition the equilibrium and complexation reactions between so4 2 and fe ii were ignored because nearly 100 of fe ii existed in the form of fe2 in fe ii ascorbic acid pds system si figure s9 the equilibrium reactions between fe iii and ascorbic acid were considered fast and written as forward and reversed reactions r21 r23 in table 4 to verify the proposed schemes in table 3 other reactions including so4 and oh as well as benzoic acid were the same as the reactions used in the kinetic model of hydroxylamine the model was adopted to simulate the experimental data with changes of ascorbic acid concentrations by kintecus v 6 51 fig 6 and all three simulation results had good correlation coefficients r2 0 95 the differentiation between simulation results and experimental data might come from differences of reaction rate constants between experimental and literature conditions this simulation could further support the reaction schemes in table 3 where a fe iii ascorbic acid complex reversibly formed at first and fe ii and ascorbyl radicals were then produced 3 5 comparison of reaction schemes between hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid during the degradation of benzoic acid by comparing the simulated reaction schemes between fe iii ascorbic acid and fe iii hydroxylamine the kinetic difference of benzoic acid degradation in fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe ii ascorbic acid pds system with 0 6 or 1 0 mm ascorbic acid could be explained fe ii was produced by two fast equilibrium reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine r1 r2 in table 1 with a total equilibrium constant of 2 6 10 9 m2 the production of β1 and k 1 lind and merényi 2006 while in the system of fe iii and ascorbic acid fe ii was formed by a two stage reaction process in the first stage of equilibrium reactions r15 r17 in table 3 the fe iii ascorbic complex was formed with an equilibrium constant of 2 08 m 1 k 15 in table 3 bansch et al 1991 even larger than the total equilibrium constant between fe3 and hydroxylamine based on the simulation results the rate constant of the follow up reduction process to produce fe ii was 108 m 1 s 1 for fe h2a 3 r18 r19 in table 3 which was in the same order as the reaction rate constant of nh2o r3 in table 1 the rate limiting step of reactions between fe iii and hydroxylamine thus fe iii reacted significantly faster with hydroxylamine than with ascorbic acid moreover ascorbic acid had larger reaction rate constants with so4 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and oh 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 compared with hydroxylamine 1 5 107 m 1 s 1 for so4 and 1 15 108 m 1 s 1 for oh at experimental conditions zhou et al 2018a when in small concentrations as 0 6 or 1 0 mm ascorbic acid was mainly consumed by reacting with radicals instead of reducing fe iii thus the degradation kinetics was decided by the initial concentration of fe ii and the reaction would quickly slow down when fe ii was consumed and fe iii was accumulated then fe ii was gradually produced by reactions between accumulated fe iii and ascorbic acid leading to slow degradation of benzoic acid and the formation of the two stage degradation kinetics with increase in ascorbic acid concentrations the influence of side reactions became weaker fe ii was restored by reactions between ascorbic acid and fe iii as hydroxylamine did and the degradation kinetics exhibited the same trend possible reaction schemes of fe iii hydroxylamine and fe iii ascorbic acid during benzoic acid degradation process were summarized in fig 7 4 conclusions in this work kinetic models were developed and successfully simulated the degradation of benzoic acid in fe ii hydroxylamine pds and fe ii ascorbic acid pds system the model provided a detailed description of oxidation processes of organic pollutants it could help to assess the extent of each reaction s contribution to organics degradation and identify the critical reaction step different reaction schemes of hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid were found by investigating models and degradation kinetics of organics both hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid formed intermediate complexes with fe iii but the reduction step to produce fe ii was faster for the complex formed with hydroxylamine resulting in sustained degradation of organics instead of the two stage kinetics as ascorbic acid added in small concentrations since introducing compounds capable of accelerating fe iii fe ii cycle has been a research direction to promote pollutant degradation and reduce sludge production in fenton or fenton like system this comparison of reaction schemes and kinetic models of two common reductants could be a useful reference to provide information on the role of influence factors that should be considered in choosing efficient chemicals with similar

is not only the surface ocean but also the deep sea woodall et al 2014 including the most remote trenches jamieson et al 2019 although the density of certain types of plastic debris is lighter than seawater which leads to their initial accumulation in surface water it is likely that the breakdown of plastic debris causes the formation of microplastics and sinking within the water columns sinking factors include not only density of plastic polymers but also biofouling that leads to the sinking of almost every category of commercial plastics to the seafloor engler 2012 photodegradation may cause plastics to progressively break down and a loss of microplastics smaller than 1 mm at the open ocean surface was observed cozar et al 2014 compared to model estimation lebreton et al 2012 indicating mechanisms quickly transferring microplastics from surface to the deep must be at play even buoyant polymers like polyethylene when incorporated into marine snow have been shown to sink at a rate of 818 m day 1 porter et al 2018 however the vertical change of microplastics in water column from sea surface to the ocean floor remains unknown the hadal zone is the deepest part of the ocean 6000 11 000 m which accounts for 45 of the depth range of the ocean jamieson et al 2010 while most studies on microplastics in seabed sediments have mostly been undertaken in coastal areas and continental shelves very few studies have been done on sediments in the deep sea or the hadal zone it has been shown that marine litter is widespread on the deep sea floor with plastics often being the most common type of marine litter encountered mordecai et al 2011 compared to microplastics larger marine debris in deep sea environments is more frequently reported in deep diving expeditions deep sea trawls in the gulf of mexico at a depth between 250 and 3650 m revealed that most man made waste on the seabed were plastics wei et al 2012 the majority of marine debris in the ryukyu trench were plastics especially fragmented plastic bags shimanaga and yanagi 2016 based on a video database over 22 years schlining et al 2013 found that anthropic marine debris accumulated on the steepest slopes of the monterey canyons was mostly plastics by reviewing images and video clips from deep sea debris database developed by jamstec chiba et al 2018 found increasing marine debris in the abyss over the past 30 years with the deepest record of one plastic bag at 10 890 m from mariana trench miyake et al 2011 reviewed video surveys of submersible dives in japan trench and ryukyu trench down to 7216 m and noted plastics were the most common marine debris using photographic time series surveys to investigate the change in concentration of marine litter on seafloor from 2002 to 2014 at depth of 2500 m in the arctic there were more litter on the seafloor than at the surface tekman et al 2017 those findings all support the theory that portions of plastic debris at the sea surface eventually sink to the seafloor increasing the likelihood of deposition at the deepest and remotest corner of the ocean to investigate to what degree microplastics have transported to the hadal zone and to understand the fate of missing microplastics from sea surface this study investigated microplastics in sediment samples collected from abyssal plain and some of the deepest trenches in the hadal zone reviewed the potential cascading processes that transport microplastics to remote hadal trenches and proposed hadal trenches will be the ultimate sink for a significant proportion of the microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sediment samples from abyssal plain and hadal trenches were collected by lander sites except e3 or a box corer site e3 during sea trials of autonomous and remotely operated vehicle arv rainbowfish in december 2016 fig 1 the 4800 tonnes scientific research ship zhang jian is the main supporting vessel for rainbowfish samples were collected from one abyssal plain near the philippines 4800 m the challenger deep in the mariana trench 10 890 m marceau trench 7190 m and the new britain trench 5800 m 8225 m 8930 m detailed information on geographical coordinates sediment description and grain size distribution of sediment samples can be found in table 1 landers were equipped with a multitude of deep sea apparatuses which took samples of hadal settings including water sediment and macro organisms tubes are equipped on the lander to collect hadal sediment samples only top layers of samples from each sampling sites were taken for microplastic analysis refer to fig s1 for photos of sampling tools back in the mobile hadal science laboratory sediment samples were carefully wrapped with aluminum foil after which they were put into clean lunch boxes and stored at 80 c in the fridge 2 2 density separation and numeration for each site about 500 g wet weight sediment were used for the analysis of microplastics samples were firstly weighted using analytical balance tb 2002 denver instrument usa freeze dried at 80 c using christ alpha 1 4 ldplus germany and dry weight was determined an aliquot of 25 g dry weight sediment per sample from six sites 3 replicates for each site were utilized for density separation 18 samples in total microplastics were extracted from the sediments according to peng et al 2017 saturated sodium iodide solution nai 1 8 g ml 1 was applied for density separation to improve extraction efficiency the solution was added to a beaker with 25 g dry sediment stirred for 2 min with a clean glass rod and settled down for 24 h the supernatant was filtered using a vacuum pump and microplastic particles were collected onto a filter membrane rawp04700 mf millipore membrane filter 1 2 μm pore size the filter was dried in room temperature until constant weight the filter was then observed under dissecting microscopes leica m165 fc germany for numeration shape size and color of microplastics were categorized 2 3 microplastic identification because only thin particles can be compressed in the diamond cell for the μ ft ir instrument one fragment was too big and was tested using the ft ir instrument fig 2 c all the other particles were identified by μ ft ir atr mode of μ ft ir instrument thermo fisher nicolet in10 were used to identify microplastic polymer types and transmittance mode of ft ir instrument thermo fisher nicolet is5 was applied in one big particle based on different size limit for the two types of ft ir instruments grain size distribution was performed using laser particle analyzer coulter ls13 320 field emission scanning electron microscopy sem fei sirion 200 was used to characterize morphology of microplastics 2 4 qa qc quality assurance and quality control must follow the strictest procedures to prevent any contamination especially airborne contamination woodall et al 2014 all analyses were conducted in a laminar flow cabinet airtech sw cj 1fd all the glassware and metal utensils were muffled at 450 c for 3 h before usage to prevent microfiber contamination chemicals and milli q water were filtered prior to usage filter membranes were examined under microscopes to check for possible contamination before usage procedural blanks were performed at each step of density separation of each single sample blank 1 was set during the preparation of saturated nai solution blank 2 was set during the filtration of each sediment sample blank 3 was set for the same volume of milli q water during density separation in all the 24 procedural blanks during the experiment no fiber or other contamination was found under microscopic inspection 2 5 recovery rate and statistical analysis recovery rate experiments were conducted using commercial pp resin pellets 4 37 0 29 mm lab made pp fibers 1 66 0 59 mm and lab made pet fibers 1 07 0 52 mm this consideration of particle shape and size used for recovery test took environmental abundance microplastic size and actual polymer composition into consideration pp resin pellets lab made pp and pet fibers were spiked into soft hadal sediments collected where microplastics had been removed using density separation statistical analysis was done using ibm spss statistics 22 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of microplastics in hadal trenches microplastics were found at all six sampling sites in hadal trenches and abyssal plain in total 32 microplastic particles were extracted from the 3 kg sediment samples wet weight and the average abundance of microplastics in sediments was 1 78 items per 25 g dry weight sediment i e 71 1 items per kg dry weight sediment assuming the density of sediments from the mariana trench to be 1 26 g cm 3 glud et al 2013 the average abundance by volume was 89 6 items per l dry weight sediment the highest abundance was found at e1 in the new britain trench with 3 33 items per 25 g dry weight sediment i e 133 3 items per kg dry weight sediment the lowest abundance was 0 67 items per 25 g dry weight at station d1 in the marceau trench i e 26 7 items per kg dry weight sediment the properties of the microplastics excluding rayon from six sites are shown in table 2 rayon fibers and fragments from six sites were also identified table s1 and because procedural blanks indicated no microfiber contamination occurred rayon fibers are listed in the result as a reference recognizing the debate on whether rayon should be classified as microplastics peeken et al 2018 transparent particles excluding rayon constituted 64 3 of total particles followed by red particles 21 4 and blue particles 14 3 fibers excluding rayon were the major shape of microplastics constituting of 57 1 of all the particles while fragments constituted 42 8 of total microplastics a significant higher percentage than those in coastal sediments frias et al 2016 size of microplastics ranged from 73 to 12 376 μm table 2 the most prevalent type of polymers was polyester 50 only one polypropylene pp fragment fig 2c from a1 had to be identified by ft ir due to its relatively larger size which led to the slightly different spectrum compared to other polymer spectra obtained by μ ft ir fig 2a the surface texture of this pp fragment was characterized by sem analysis fig 3 and shows attached organic matter and apparent signs of degradation suggesting that plastic particles may sink due to biofouling and continue to fragment into microplastics through ingestion dawson et al 2018 even in the deep sea floor in this study recovery rates for pp pellets pp fibers and pet fibers were 100 94 4 4 8 and 89 8 5 8 mean sd n 3 ci 95 respectively table s2 3 2 microplastic abundance this study found that microplastics were present in sediments from some of the deepest corners on earth including the mariana trench marceau trench and new britain trench at depths from 4900 to 10 890 m the highest abundance of microplastics was 133 3 items per kg dry weight sediment the high concentration of microplastics in three deepest hadal trenches of the planet suggests that microplastics pollution has reached the full ocean depth and deposit at a high concentration making hadal trenches the major depositories and ultimate sink for microplastics high hydrostatic pressure and extreme environments make hadal trenches out of reach by most human activities except anthropogenic pollutants while some deep sea surveys have visually identified marine litter on the deep sea floor miyake et al 2011 few have successfully sampled and quantified microplastics due to the technical challenges of collection and retrieval of samples from the hadal zone below 6500 m cui et al 2014 e g the development of full ocean depth rov arv hov and the collection and preservation of hadal samples under 110 mpa therefore sinking mechanisms for microplastics entering the hadal environment remain largely unknown due to limited research on microplastic distribution in the deep sea and hadal environments and lack of knowledge on hadal science here we propose sources and potential pathways for microplastics to enter the hadal trenches from land and sea based sources which contributing to microplastics export to the seafloor making hadal trenches as major depositories and ultimate sink for microplastics our results illustrate that microplastics in sediments from hadal trenches are even higher than those identified from the conventional deep sea microplastic particles have been found in sediments in the atlantic ocean at depth from 1100 to 5000 m with an average abundance of 0 5 items per 25 cm2 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 in the kuril kamchatka trench in the north west pacific fiber was the dominant type of microplastics in sediment samples at depth from 4869 to 5766 m fischer et al 2015 deep sea cores from the mediterranean south west indian ocean and north east atlantic ocean at a depth down to 3500 m revealed that the abundance of microplastic fibers in sediments was several orders of magnitude higher than that in surface waters woodall et al 2014 recently microplastics were also found in water and sediment samples in the mariana trench according to peng et al 2018 microplastic abundance reached as high as 13 51 pieces l 1 in bottom waters and 2200 pieces l 1 in sediments they compared microplastic abundance at 10 903 m with 8 other studies and found that the abundance is four times higher than that in the offshore waters near vancouver and twenty times higher than deep sea sediments from atlantic peng et al 2018 this may be an example of hadal trenches as the sink for microplastics however compared to the abundance in our study which collected samples from several hadal trenches with larger sample quantity 500 g wet weight from each site such high concentration may attribute to direct conversion from 5 ml to 1000 ml for each sediment sample in their study peng et al 2018 while studies attempt to make comparisons among microplastic abundance worldwide comparison should be made among studies with same sampling method and reporting units as stressed in gesamp wg40 report gesamp 2016 3 3 sources and sinks we propose cascading processes that transport microplastics on their journey from land and oceanic gyres through intermediate waters to the deepest corners of the ocean fig 4 making hadal trenches the ultimate sink for plastic pollution the most significant source of all sizes of plastic debris is the input from land based sources especially river discharge and concentration of microplastics positively correlates with the amount of mismanaged plastic waste in river catchments lebreton et al 2017 papua new guinea in the west pacific a region regarded as major plastic waste input into the ocean in the world jambeck et al 2015 was more populated in recent years putting pressure on the waste treatment facilities in growing informal settlements in coastal cities smith 2012 this may explain the higher abundance of microplastics found in new britain trench in this study a recently identified source of marine microplastics is atmospheric fallout dris et al 2016 through wind transfer airborne microfibers may account for 7 of marine microplastic pollution boucher and friot 2017 the heavily populated nw pacific and the rapidly expanding great pacific garbage patch gpgp may contribute to the quantity of microplastics at the ocean surface moore et al 2001 lebreton et al 2018 ocean based sources including maritime activities aquaculture and fishery still contribute to a great portion of plastic marine debris although dumping at sea has been banned by marpol annex ⅴ since 1988 borrelle et al 2017 although an increasing amount of plastics was found accumulating at the surface lebreton et al 2018 the eventual fate of microplastics however still lacks investigation the mechanisms that assist vertical transport of microplastics from the surface to the deep ocean has only been investigated under lab conditions long et al 2015 or in the shallow seas katija et al 2017 it is likely the high concentrations of microplastics in this study indicate that the deep ocean woodall et al 2014 especially the hadal trenches jamieson et al 2019 may be a significant resting ground for microplastics pouring into the ocean but how do they get there direct sinking of microplastic particles alone may take hundreds or thousands of years to reach the hadal trenches the presence of microplastics in the hadal zone requires there to be mechanisms that promote the rapid descent from surface to full ocean depth it cannot be gravitational sinking spherical microplastics may spend 10 15 years in the euphotic zone before sinking while for fibers it is 6 8 months chubarenko et al 2016 biofouling will increase the density of microplastics leading to loss of buoyancy and vertical transportation to the seafloor chubarenko et al 2016 marine snow or particulate organic matter pom synthesized in the euphotic zone is the main food supply of life in hadal environments long et al 2015 taylor et al 2016 and an important component of biological pump miyake et al 2011 as microplastics are detected in marine snow zhao et al 2017 the pathways and fluxes of marine snow from ocean surface to the deeper waters can predict possible mechanisms of microplastic occurrence even in the deepest hadal trenches ichino et al 2015 based on the equations from laboratory tests long et al 2015 we calculated the time for microplastics incorporated into marine aggregates to reach the hadal sediments in our study fig s2 a minimum of 14 days is enough for a polypropylene fragment to reach 4900 m if aggregated in phytoplankton aggregates once marine snow is removed to the deep its quantity and quality is reduced by large extent jamieson et al 2010 a video showcasing marine snow at 8930 m in the new britain trench was recorded during sample collection movie s1 a possible mechanism for microplastics to reach the seafloor may be the formation of ecocorona which increases the density of microplastics galloway et al 2017 the formation of ecocorona on the surface of microplastics by macromolecules or microorganisms alters the size hydrophobicity and other chemical properties of microplastics rillig et al 2017 this has been proven by the high concentration of nitrogen n on microplastics collected from surface waters as n is not a content for consumer plastics but crucial proxy for biomass morét ferguson et al 2010 using sem analysis we found organic matter attached to the surface of microplastics fig 3 supplementary data related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2019 115121 the following is the

thompson 2015 from herbivores e g zooplankton moore et al 2001 cole et al 2013 frias et al 2014 hall et al 2015 sun et al 2017 frydkjær et al 2017 primary carnivores e g bivalves taylor et al 2016

2015 alomar and deudero 2017 transfer of microplastics in food webs had been proven in both field and lab experiments including the transfer within planktonic food web from mesozooplankton to macrozooplankton setälä et al 2014 natural transfer from mussels to crabs farrell and nelson 2013 and from fish to top predators nelms et al 2018 microplastics were found in stranded whales lusher et al 2015 and whale fall could support significant food source in deep sea floor smith and baco 2003 giant larvaceans transport microplastics and carbon into deep sea either by sinking of fecal pellets or discarded mucus houses at rates of 300 m day 1 and 800 m day 1 respectively katija et al 2017 microplastic particles with increased density due to biofouling will sink to deeper layers in the ocean by transferring through marine food webs aggregating into marine snows fecal pellets or animal carcasses microplastics are vertically transported to the deeper layers but export from the surface and intermediate ocean does not explain fully why the microplastics are focused in the trenches microplastic abundance in different layers has distinct distribution patterns with the surface layer and the deep water at higher concentrations la daana et al 2018 indicating vertical change in microplastics in water columns trenches are well ventilated due to the overflow of dense water currents johnson 1998 which brings in oxygen and nutrition ichino et al 2015 as well as some pollutants jamieson et al 2017 the unique topography of trenches increases the likelihood of microplastic accumulation similar to submarine canyons funneling mechanism of trenches tend to accumulate organic matter and other substances in the hadal ecosystem with little opportunity for dispersal steep slope of trenches and occasional seismic activity accelerate the accumulation of substances along the trench axis or trench resource accumulation depth jamieson et al 2010 the atacama trench at 7800 m functions as a deep oceanic trap or a depocentre for organic matter which accelerates benthic microbial processes in hadal environment danovaro et al 2003 microplastics that undergo the funneling effects will eventually sink to the bottom along the axis of a trench compared to gravity driven transport of marine snow bottom currents play a greater role in the transport of organic matter and leads to higher biomass along the axis of a trench ichino et al 2015 the maximum of current velocity at 10 890 m can reach 8 1 cm s 1 johnson 1998 making the lateral transport of sediments dissolved oxygen and other substances possible within the trench in this study microplastics showed a relatively high abundance in surface sediments in hadal trenches which may reflect accumulation along the axis of hadal trenches thus more sampling efforts should be focused in this area 3 4 ecological effects ecological theory for littoral zones is applicable for characteristics in trench communities albeit the elevated hydrostatic pressure jamieson et al 2010 the ecological effects of microplastics include acting as trojan horse for hydrophobic organic chemicals hocs in food webs diepens and koelmans 2018 and as carrier for foreign species miyake et al 2011 different accumulation patterns for biomagnification of pcbs and pahs were revealed by feeding zooplankton fish and top predators in arctic food web with hocs contaminated microplastics diepens and koelmans 2018 in six deepest trenches including the mariana trench three species of amphipod were found to ingest microplastics indicating microplastics are bioavailable in hadal ecosystems jamieson et al 2019 with the discovery of pops in hadal amphipod species jamieson et al 2017 similar trojan horse effect may apply to hadal food webs once entering the hadal food webs microplastics might be perpetually locked in the trophic cycling due to both surface derived carcasses and hadal derived amphipod as food sources by amphipods jamieson et al 2010 at the deepest corner on earth amphipods are hungry necrophages cannibals detritivores and carnivores which ingest nutrient poor pom from above jamieson et al 2010 dawson et al 2018 found a new pathway for plastics to transfer in biogeochemical cycling ingested microplastics may fragment into nanoparticles and pass physical barriers of krill or other marine species it is very likely that hadal species facilitate microplastic fragmentation through ingestion and translocation thus securing microplastics and nanoplastics in the hadal zone making hadal trenches the ultimate sink for plastics however even comprehensive understanding of ecological impact of plastic pollution in coastal area is still lacking more research efforts are required for the risk assessment of microplastics in the hadal zone to inform policy makers 4 conclusions microplastics found in sediments in the three deepest hadal trenches show that microplastics are already accumulating at the bottom of deepest corners on the planet with an average abundance of 71 1 items per kg dry weight sediment i e 89 6 items per l dry weight our study provides essential baseline data on microplastic pollution in hadal environments down to 10 890 m which confirms that microplastics have reached full ocean depth the potential cascading processes that transport microplastics to hadal trenches provides an answer to how microplastics are transported from sea surface to seafloor including land and ocean based input sources e g maritime activities ingestion by marine biota and trophic transfer biological interactions with microplastics e g marine snow and physical processes e g deep water currents in the hadal trenches these processes make the hadal trenches major

cause plastics to progressively break down and a loss of microplastics smaller than 1 mm at the open ocean surface was observed cozar et al 2014 compared to model estimation lebreton et al 2012 indicating mechanisms quickly transferring microplastics from surface to the deep must be at play even buoyant polymers like polyethylene when incorporated into marine snow have been shown to sink at a rate of 818 m day 1 porter et al 2018 however the vertical change of microplastics in water column from sea surface to the ocean floor remains unknown the hadal zone is the deepest part of the ocean 6000 11 000 m which accounts for 45 of the depth range of the ocean jamieson et al 2010 while most studies on microplastics in seabed sediments have mostly been undertaken in coastal areas and continental shelves very few studies have been done on sediments in the deep sea or the hadal zone it has been shown that marine litter is widespread on the deep sea floor with plastics often being the most common type of marine litter encountered mordecai et al 2011 compared to microplastics larger marine debris in deep sea environments is more frequently reported in deep diving expeditions deep sea trawls in the gulf of mexico at a depth between 250 and 3650 m revealed that most man made waste on the seabed were plastics wei et al 2012 the majority of marine debris in the ryukyu trench were plastics especially fragmented plastic bags shimanaga and yanagi 2016 based on a video database over 22 years schlining et al 2013 found that anthropic marine debris accumulated on the steepest slopes of the monterey canyons was mostly plastics by reviewing images and video clips from deep sea debris database developed by jamstec chiba et al 2018 found increasing marine debris in the abyss over the past 30 years with the deepest record of one plastic bag at 10 890 m from mariana trench miyake et al 2011 reviewed video surveys of submersible dives in japan trench and ryukyu trench down to 7216 m and noted plastics were the most common marine debris using photographic time series surveys to investigate the change in concentration of marine litter on seafloor from 2002 to 2014 at depth of 2500 m in the arctic there were more litter on the seafloor than at the surface tekman et al 2017 those findings all support the theory that portions of plastic debris at the sea surface eventually sink to the seafloor increasing the likelihood of deposition at the deepest and remotest corner of the ocean to investigate to what degree microplastics have transported to the hadal zone and to understand the fate of missing microplastics from sea surface this study investigated microplastics in sediment samples collected from abyssal plain and some of the deepest trenches in the hadal zone reviewed the potential cascading processes that transport microplastics to remote hadal trenches and proposed hadal trenches will be the ultimate sink for a significant proportion of the microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sediment samples from abyssal plain and hadal trenches were collected by lander sites except e3 or a box corer site e3 during sea trials of autonomous and remotely operated vehicle arv rainbowfish in december 2016 fig 1 the 4800 tonnes scientific research ship zhang jian is the main supporting vessel for rainbowfish samples were collected from one abyssal plain near the philippines 4800 m the challenger deep in the mariana trench 10 890 m marceau trench 7190 m and the new britain trench 5800 m 8225 m 8930 m detailed information on geographical coordinates sediment description and grain size distribution of sediment samples can be found in table 1 landers were equipped with a multitude of deep sea apparatuses which took samples of hadal settings including water sediment and macro organisms tubes are equipped on the lander to collect hadal sediment samples only top layers of samples from each sampling sites were taken for microplastic analysis refer to fig s1 for photos of sampling tools back in the mobile hadal science laboratory sediment samples were carefully wrapped with aluminum foil after which they were put into clean lunch boxes and stored at 80 c in the fridge 2 2 density separation and numeration for each site about 500 g wet weight sediment were used for the analysis of microplastics samples were firstly weighted using analytical balance tb 2002 denver instrument usa freeze dried at 80 c using christ alpha 1 4 ldplus germany and dry weight was determined an aliquot of 25 g dry weight sediment per sample from six sites 3 replicates for each site were utilized for density separation 18 samples in total microplastics were extracted from the sediments according to peng et al 2017 saturated sodium iodide solution nai 1 8 g ml 1 was applied for density separation to improve extraction efficiency the solution was added to a beaker with 25 g dry sediment stirred for 2 min with a clean glass rod and settled down for 24 h the supernatant was filtered using a vacuum pump and microplastic particles were collected onto a filter membrane rawp04700 mf millipore membrane filter 1 2 μm pore size the filter was dried in room temperature until constant weight the filter was then observed under dissecting microscopes leica m165 fc germany for numeration shape size and color of microplastics were categorized 2 3 microplastic identification because only thin particles can be compressed in the diamond cell for the μ ft ir instrument one fragment was too big and was tested using the ft ir instrument fig 2 c all the other particles were identified by μ ft ir atr mode of μ ft ir instrument thermo fisher nicolet in10 were used to identify microplastic polymer types and transmittance mode of ft ir instrument thermo fisher nicolet is5 was applied in one big particle based on different size limit for the two types of ft ir instruments grain size distribution was performed using laser particle analyzer coulter ls13 320 field emission scanning electron microscopy sem fei sirion 200 was used to characterize morphology of microplastics 2 4 qa qc quality assurance and quality control must follow the strictest procedures to prevent any contamination especially airborne contamination woodall et al 2014 all analyses were conducted in a laminar flow cabinet airtech sw cj 1fd all the glassware and metal utensils were muffled at 450 c for 3 h before usage to prevent microfiber contamination chemicals and milli q water were filtered prior to usage filter membranes were examined under microscopes to check for possible contamination before usage procedural blanks were performed at each step of density separation of each single sample blank 1 was set during the preparation of saturated nai solution blank 2 was set during the filtration of each sediment sample blank 3 was set for the same volume of milli q water during density separation in all the 24 procedural blanks during the experiment no fiber or other contamination was found under microscopic inspection 2 5 recovery rate and statistical analysis recovery rate experiments were conducted using commercial pp resin pellets 4 37 0 29 mm lab made pp fibers 1 66 0 59 mm and lab made pet fibers 1 07 0 52 mm this consideration of particle shape and size used for recovery test took environmental abundance microplastic size and actual polymer composition into consideration pp resin pellets lab made pp and pet fibers were spiked into soft hadal sediments collected where microplastics had been removed using density separation statistical analysis was done using ibm spss statistics 22 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of microplastics in hadal trenches microplastics were found at all six sampling sites in hadal trenches and abyssal plain in total 32 microplastic particles were extracted from the 3 kg sediment samples wet weight and the average abundance of microplastics in sediments was 1 78 items per 25 g dry weight sediment i e 71 1 items per kg dry weight sediment assuming the density of sediments from the mariana trench to be 1 26 g cm 3 glud et al 2013 the average abundance by volume was 89 6 items per l dry weight sediment the highest abundance was found at e1 in the new britain trench with 3 33 items per 25 g dry weight sediment i e 133 3 items per kg dry weight sediment the lowest abundance was 0 67 items per 25 g dry weight at station d1 in the marceau trench i e 26 7 items per kg dry weight sediment the properties of the microplastics excluding rayon from six sites are shown in table 2 rayon fibers and fragments from six sites were also identified table s1 and because procedural blanks indicated no microfiber contamination occurred rayon fibers are listed in the result as a reference recognizing the debate on whether rayon should be classified as microplastics peeken et al 2018 transparent particles excluding rayon constituted 64 3 of total particles followed by red particles 21 4 and blue particles 14 3 fibers excluding rayon were the major shape of microplastics constituting of 57 1 of all the particles while fragments constituted 42 8 of total microplastics a significant higher percentage than those in coastal sediments frias et al 2016 size of microplastics ranged from 73 to 12 376 μm table 2 the most prevalent type of polymers was polyester 50 only one polypropylene pp fragment fig 2c from a1 had to be identified by ft ir due to its relatively larger size which led to the slightly different spectrum compared to other polymer spectra obtained by μ ft ir fig 2a the surface texture of this pp fragment was characterized by sem analysis fig 3 and shows attached organic matter and apparent signs of degradation suggesting that plastic particles may sink due to biofouling and continue to fragment into microplastics through ingestion dawson et al 2018 even in the deep sea floor in this study recovery rates for pp pellets pp fibers and pet fibers were 100 94 4 4 8 and 89 8 5 8 mean sd n 3 ci 95 respectively table s2 3 2 microplastic abundance this study found that microplastics were present in sediments from some of the deepest corners on earth including the mariana trench marceau trench and new britain trench at depths from 4900 to 10 890 m the highest abundance of microplastics was 133 3 items per kg dry weight sediment the high concentration of microplastics in three deepest hadal trenches of the planet suggests that microplastics pollution has reached the full ocean depth and deposit at a high concentration making hadal trenches the major depositories and ultimate sink for microplastics high hydrostatic pressure and extreme environments make hadal trenches out of reach by most human activities except anthropogenic pollutants while some deep sea surveys have visually identified marine litter on the deep sea floor miyake et al 2011 few have successfully sampled and quantified microplastics due to the technical challenges of collection and retrieval of samples from the hadal zone below 6500 m cui et al 2014 e g the development of full ocean depth rov arv hov and the collection and preservation of hadal samples under 110 mpa therefore sinking mechanisms for microplastics entering the hadal environment remain largely unknown due to limited research on microplastic distribution in the deep sea and hadal environments and lack of knowledge on hadal science here we propose sources and potential pathways for microplastics to enter the hadal trenches from land and sea based sources which contributing to microplastics export to the seafloor making hadal trenches as major depositories and ultimate sink for microplastics our results illustrate that microplastics in sediments from hadal trenches are even higher than those identified from the conventional deep sea microplastic particles have been found in sediments in the atlantic ocean at depth from 1100 to 5000 m with an average abundance of 0 5 items per 25 cm2 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 in the kuril kamchatka trench in the north west pacific fiber was the dominant type of microplastics in sediment samples at depth from 4869 to 5766 m fischer et al 2015 deep sea cores from the mediterranean south west indian ocean and north east atlantic ocean at a depth down to 3500 m revealed that the abundance of microplastic fibers in sediments was several orders of magnitude higher than that in surface waters woodall et al 2014 recently microplastics were also found in water and sediment samples in the mariana trench according to peng et al 2018 microplastic abundance reached as high as 13 51 pieces l 1 in bottom waters and 2200 pieces l 1 in sediments they compared microplastic abundance at 10 903 m with 8 other studies and found that the abundance is four times higher than that in the offshore waters near vancouver and twenty times higher than deep sea sediments from atlantic peng et al 2018 this may be an example of hadal trenches as the sink for microplastics however compared to the abundance in our study which collected samples from several hadal trenches with larger sample quantity 500 g wet weight from each site such high concentration may attribute to direct conversion from 5 ml to 1000 ml for each sediment sample in their study peng et al 2018 while studies attempt to make comparisons among microplastic abundance worldwide comparison should be made among studies with same sampling method and reporting units as stressed in gesamp wg40 report gesamp 2016 3 3 sources and sinks we propose cascading processes that transport microplastics on their journey from land and oceanic gyres through intermediate waters to the deepest corners of the ocean fig 4 making hadal trenches the ultimate sink for plastic pollution the most significant source of all sizes of plastic debris is the input from land based sources especially river discharge and concentration of microplastics positively correlates with the amount of mismanaged plastic waste in river catchments lebreton et al 2017 papua new guinea in the west pacific a region regarded as major plastic waste input into the ocean in the world jambeck et al 2015 was more populated in recent years putting pressure on the waste treatment facilities in growing informal settlements in coastal cities smith 2012 this may explain the higher abundance of microplastics found in new britain trench in this study a recently identified source of marine microplastics is atmospheric fallout dris et al 2016 through wind transfer airborne microfibers may account for 7 of marine microplastic pollution boucher and friot 2017 the heavily populated nw pacific and the rapidly expanding great pacific garbage patch gpgp may contribute to the quantity of microplastics at the ocean surface moore et al 2001 lebreton et al 2018 ocean based sources including maritime activities aquaculture and fishery still contribute to a great portion of plastic marine debris although dumping at sea has been banned by marpol annex ⅴ since 1988 borrelle et al 2017 although an increasing amount of plastics was found accumulating at the surface lebreton et al 2018 the eventual fate of microplastics however still lacks investigation the mechanisms that assist vertical transport of microplastics from the surface to the deep ocean has only been investigated under lab conditions long et al 2015 or in the shallow seas katija et al 2017 it is likely the high concentrations of microplastics in this study indicate that the deep ocean woodall et al 2014 especially the hadal trenches jamieson et al 2019 may be a significant resting ground for microplastics pouring into the ocean but how do they get there direct sinking of microplastic particles alone may take hundreds or thousands of years to reach the hadal trenches the presence of microplastics in the hadal zone requires there to be mechanisms that promote the rapid descent from surface to full ocean depth it cannot be gravitational sinking spherical microplastics may spend 10 15 years in the euphotic zone before sinking while for fibers it is 6 8 months chubarenko et al 2016 biofouling will increase the density of microplastics leading to loss of buoyancy and vertical transportation to the seafloor chubarenko et al 2016 marine snow or particulate organic matter pom synthesized in the euphotic zone is the main food supply of life in hadal environments long et al 2015 taylor et al 2016 and an important component of biological pump miyake et al 2011 as microplastics are detected in marine snow zhao et al 2017 the pathways and fluxes of marine snow from ocean surface to the deeper waters can predict possible mechanisms of microplastic occurrence even in the deepest hadal trenches ichino et al 2015 based on the equations from laboratory tests long et al 2015 we calculated the time for microplastics incorporated into marine aggregates to reach the hadal sediments in our study fig s2 a minimum of 14 days is enough for a polypropylene fragment to reach 4900 m if aggregated in phytoplankton aggregates once marine snow is removed to the deep its quantity and quality is reduced by large extent jamieson et al 2010 a video showcasing marine snow at 8930 m in the new britain trench was recorded during sample collection movie s1 a possible mechanism for microplastics to reach the seafloor may be the formation of ecocorona which increases the density of microplastics galloway et al 2017 the formation of ecocorona on the surface of microplastics by macromolecules or microorganisms alters the size hydrophobicity and other chemical properties of microplastics rillig et al 2017 this has been proven by the high concentration of nitrogen n on microplastics collected from surface waters as n is not a content for consumer plastics but crucial proxy for biomass morét ferguson et al 2010 using sem analysis we found organic matter attached to the surface of microplastics fig 3 supplementary data related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2019 115121 the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 microplastic and plastic debris have been shown to be ingested and entangled by 395 marine species gall and thompson 2015 from herbivores e g zooplankton moore et al 2001 cole et al 2013 frias et al 2014 hall et al 2015 sun et al 2017 frydkjær et al 2017 primary carnivores e g bivalves taylor et al 2016

2015 alomar and deudero 2017 transfer of microplastics in food webs had been proven in both field and lab experiments including the transfer within planktonic food web from mesozooplankton to macrozooplankton setälä et al 2014 natural transfer from mussels to crabs farrell and nelson 2013 and from fish to top predators nelms et al 2018 microplastics were found in stranded whales lusher et al 2015 and whale fall could support significant food source in deep sea floor smith and baco 2003 giant larvaceans transport microplastics and carbon into deep sea either by sinking of fecal pellets or discarded mucus houses at rates of 300 m day 1 and 800 m day 1 respectively katija et al 2017 microplastic particles with increased density due to biofouling will sink to deeper layers in the ocean by transferring through marine food webs aggregating into marine snows fecal pellets or animal carcasses microplastics are vertically transported to the deeper layers but export from the surface and intermediate ocean does not explain fully why the microplastics are focused in the trenches microplastic abundance in different layers has distinct distribution patterns with the surface layer and the deep water at higher concentrations la daana et al 2018 indicating vertical change in microplastics in water columns trenches are well ventilated due to the overflow of dense water currents johnson 1998 which brings in oxygen and nutrition ichino et al 2015 as well as some pollutants jamieson et al 2017 the unique topography of trenches increases the likelihood of microplastic accumulation similar to submarine canyons funneling mechanism of trenches tend to accumulate organic matter and other substances in the hadal ecosystem with little opportunity for dispersal steep slope of trenches and occasional seismic activity accelerate the accumulation of substances along the trench axis or trench resource accumulation depth jamieson et al 2010 the atacama trench at 7800 m functions as a deep oceanic trap or a depocentre for organic matter which accelerates benthic microbial processes in hadal environment danovaro et al 2003 microplastics that undergo the funneling effects will eventually sink to the bottom along the axis of a trench compared to gravity driven transport of marine snow bottom currents play a greater role in the transport of organic matter and leads to higher biomass along the axis of a trench ichino et al 2015 the maximum of current velocity at 10 890 m can reach 8 1 cm s 1 johnson 1998 making the lateral transport of sediments dissolved oxygen and other substances possible within the trench in this study microplastics showed a relatively high abundance in surface sediments in hadal trenches which may reflect accumulation along the axis of hadal trenches thus more sampling efforts should be focused in this area 3 4 ecological effects ecological theory for littoral zones is applicable for characteristics in trench communities albeit the elevated hydrostatic pressure jamieson et al 2010 the ecological effects of microplastics include acting as trojan horse for hydrophobic organic chemicals hocs in food webs diepens and koelmans 2018 and as carrier for foreign species miyake et al 2011 different accumulation patterns for biomagnification of pcbs and pahs were revealed by feeding zooplankton fish and top predators in arctic food web with hocs contaminated microplastics diepens and koelmans 2018 in six deepest trenches including the mariana trench three species of amphipod were found to ingest microplastics indicating microplastics are bioavailable in hadal ecosystems jamieson et al 2019 with the discovery of pops in hadal amphipod species jamieson et al 2017 similar trojan horse effect may apply to hadal food webs once entering the hadal food webs microplastics might be perpetually locked in the trophic cycling due to both surface derived carcasses and hadal derived amphipod as food sources by amphipods jamieson et al 2010 at the deepest corner on earth amphipods are hungry necrophages cannibals detritivores and carnivores which ingest nutrient poor pom from above jamieson et al 2010 dawson et al 2018 found a new pathway for plastics to transfer in biogeochemical cycling ingested microplastics may fragment into nanoparticles and pass physical barriers of krill or other marine species it is very likely that hadal species facilitate microplastic fragmentation through ingestion and translocation thus securing microplastics and nanoplastics in the hadal zone making hadal trenches the ultimate sink for plastics however even comprehensive understanding of ecological impact of plastic pollution in coastal area is still lacking more research efforts are required for the risk assessment of microplastics in the hadal zone to inform policy makers 4 conclusions microplastics found in sediments in the three deepest hadal trenches show that microplastics are already accumulating at the bottom of deepest corners on the planet with an average abundance of 71 1 items per kg dry weight sediment i e 89 6 items per l dry weight our study provides essential baseline data on microplastic pollution in hadal environments down to 10 890 m which confirms that microplastics have reached full ocean depth the potential cascading processes that transport microplastics to hadal trenches provides an answer to how microplastics are transported from sea surface to seafloor including land and ocean based input sources e g maritime activities ingestion by marine biota and trophic transfer biological interactions with microplastics e g marine snow and physical processes e g deep water currents in the hadal trenches these processes make the hadal trenches major depositories and the ultimate sink for microplastics the understanding of sinking mechanisms and ecological effects of microplastics in the hadal zone will hopefully enhance the understanding for the
