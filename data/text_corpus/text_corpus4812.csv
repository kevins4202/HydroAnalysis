24060,a depth independent isotropic gent mcwilliams gm transport parameter κ is diagnosed from an idealized eddy resolving primitive equation simulation the optimal depth independent isotropic gm parameterization is only able to model less than 50 of the diagnosed total tendency of temperature induced by unresolved mesoscale eddies a spatio temporal stochastic model of the gm parameter is developed based on the diagnosed values the graphical lasso is used to estimate the spatial correlation structure the stochastic model is used as a stochastic parameterization in low resolution model simulations the low resolution stochastic simulation does a poor job of reproducing the temporal mean of large scale temperature deterministic gm parameterizations and multiplicative stochastic gm parameterizations with unrealistic structure result in significantly more accurate large scale temperature in the low resolution simulations these results suggest that either the depth independence or the isotropy of the gm parameterization are unrealistic as models of the eddy tracer transport or that a stochastic gm parameterization should include an additive component keywords stochastic parameterization mesoscale parameterization gent mcwilliams 1 introduction global ocean models hereinafter gcms general circulation models are used for a variety of purposes including centennial climate forecasts shorter term ensemble forecasting or reanalysis scenarios and paleoclimate research for these particular purposes the computational cost associated with coupled ensemble simulations long term simulations or simulations with many online tracers e g biogeochemistry precludes the use of spatial resolution fine enough to represent the ocean mesoscale the models used for these purposes typically have horizontal spatial resolution on the order of 1 or larger and will be referred to hereafter as coarse gcms the inability to resolve mesoscale eddies is one of the foremost obstacles to developing accurate coarse gcms the primary impact of unresolved dynamics in coarse gcms is the transport of tracers and momentum in gcms where mesoscale eddy dynamics are completely unresolved the primary subgrid scale transport is of tracers rather than momentum grooms et al 2011 the dominant parameterization paradigm for mesoscale tracer transport is the gent mcwilliams framework gm gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 which essentially codifies the fact that mesoscale eddies typically transport tracers along isopycnals in such a way as to reduce potential energy by flattening isopycnals mesoscale eddies also mix tracers along isopycnal directions this effect is parameterized separately from gm usually by some form of redi parameterization redi 1982 the gm parameterization is deterministic in the sense that subgrid scale tracer fluxes are modeled as deterministic functions of the resolved model variables this approach would lead to realistic parameterizations if the ocean mesoscale were much smaller and faster than the dynamics resolved by the gcm scale separation assumptions of this kind are made in multiscale asymptotic analyses of ocean eddy dynamics grooms et al 2011 2012 but in coarse gcms with grid scales on the order of 1 or larger mesoscale eddies are not significantly smaller than the grid as a result the true subgrid scale tracer fluxes are not completely determined by the resolved scale variables the large variability in tracer flux that remains even after averaging over square cells of width approximately 85 km was demonstrated by grooms 2016 the turbulent mesoscale dynamics generate chaotic fluxes that are spatially and temporally correlated and are dependent on but not entirely determined by the large scale flow the fact that the subgrid scale tracer fluxes are chaotic implies that parameterizations should be stochastic the idea of using random numbers in numerical climate models goes back at least to lorenz 1975 a major development in the practical use of stochastic parameterizations in atmospheric and oceanic gcms came when a stochastic parameterization was implemented in the operational ecmwf ensemble prediction system buizza et al 1999 since then stochastic parameterizations have been adopted by operational centers almost exclusively for use in atmospheric ensemble prediction systems because they increase ensemble spread leading to better calibrated probabilistic forecasts berner et al 2017 leutbecher et al 2017 many stochastic parameterizations too numerous to list have been developed for both atmosphere and ocean applications but operational use of stochastic parameterizations has been dominated by the style of parameterization advocated by buizza et al 1999 buizza et al 1999 advocated taking the terms in tracer and momentum budgets that are associated with parameterizations the parameterization tendencies and multiplying them perturbing them by 1 e where e is a random field with zero mean this approach has come to be called stochastically perturbed parameterization tendencies sppt christensen et al 2017 recently explored an alternative whereby different parameterizations are multiplied by different independent random fields in an approach called indepdent sppt isppt sppt is not conservative of tracers or momentum and it has recently been found to dry out the atmosphere in long running simulations davini et al 2017 conservation within the context of sppt can be enforced using a method proposed by leutbecher et al 2017 as an alternative the parameters within a parameterization can be perturbed rather than the tendency produced by the parameterization and this approach is called stochastically perturbed parameters spp grooms 2016 used spp but incorrectly called it sppt sppt and spp have recently been applied to coarse gcms in ocean only and coupled simulations brankart et al 2015 and andrejczuk et al 2016 used sppt in a coarse gcm but only applied the perturbations to mixing parameterizations and not to the gm parameterization juricke et al 2017 and juricke et al 2018 used spp with the gm parameterization there are a few other stochastic parameterizations for coarse gcms that are not based on spp or sppt these include the stochastic equation of state developed by brankart 2013 and the addition of stochastic noise forcing to the temperature equation of a gcm by williams et al 2016 grooms 2016 developed a framework for stochastic gm parameterizations and developed a preliminary non gaussian stochastic gm parameterization albeit in an idealized model the goal of the present investigation is to push the spp approach to gm parameterization to its limits by choosing the multiplicative perturbation structure to be as realistic as possible recall that the spp approach requires specifying the structure of the random field e where 1 e is used to perturb the parameter of interest the random field is usually specified via some sort of pattern generator with tunable time and length scales see e g leutbecher et al 2017 for examples in the present investigation the parameter κ in the standard isotropic gm parameterization is estimated directly from eddy resolving simulations and is allowed to vary in time and horizontally in space the results are then used to develop a random field model for κ which is equivalent to modeling the perturbation e in the spp approach this model is then used in an implementation of a stochastic gm parameterization which is compared to deterministic gm parameterizations and to a less realistic spp gm parameterization we begin in section 2 by diagnosing the gm parameter from an eddy resolving simulation in an idealized domain this section includes a description of the results of the diagnosis while the next section section 3 develops the stochastic model for κ section 4 briefly describes the configuration of parameterized coarse model simulations and then compares the results of various coarse model simulations with deterministic and stochastic gm parameterizations results are discussed in section 5 and conclusions are offered in section 6 2 diagnosing the gm parameter 2 1 gent mcwilliams background before detailing the method used to diagnose the gm parameter we begin with a brief review of the deterministic gm framework gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 in the gm framework the divergence of the subgrid scale tracer flux is parameterized by a bolus velocity advection 1 u τ u τ throughout this section resolved scale variables have no primes and subgrid scale variables are denoted by a prime the overbar denotes a spatial average to the coarse grid scale in the above expression τ denotes a tracer concentration and the bolus velocity is 2 u ψ where ψ ψ x ψ y 0 t is a vector streamfunction eq 2 guarantees that the bolus velocity is incompressible which is a key property of the gm framework namely that the flux is non mixing i e adiabatic in the standard isotropic version of the gm parameterization the vector streamfunction ψ is linearly related to the local isopycnal slope s h ρ z ρ where h x y t and ρ is the density 3 ψ x κ s y ψ y κ s x when using a nonlinear equation of state s should be replaced by the slope of neutral surfaces mcdougall 1987 when κ 0 eq 3 guarantees that the parameterization acts to remove potential energy by tilting isopycnal surfaces towards horizontal gent et al 1995 there are two difficulties associated with this formulation of the gm parameterization how to deal with unstratified or convectively unstable regions z ρ 0 and how to guarantee that the vertical part of the bolus velocity w is zero at the ocean surface or floor the vertical bolus velocity is w x ψ y y ψ x the vertical component of the bolus velocity can be set to zero at a given depth by setting ψ 0 at that depth ferrari et al 2010 proposed a simple and elegant approach that simultaneously ensures impenetrability at the ocean surface and deals with unstratified or convectively unstable regions the vector streamfunction is specified as the solution of the following two point boundary value problem 4 c 2 z 2 g z ρ ρ 0 ψ y κ g ρ 0 x ρ 5 c 2 z 2 g z ρ ρ 0 ψ x κ g ρ 0 y ρ with boundary conditions ψ x ψ y 0 when c 2 is chosen appropriately the streamfunction approximates 3 and the solutions smoothly transition through unstratified and convectively unstable regions in practice the density gradient z ρ that appears in these equations is truncated to negative values here the value of n 2 z g z ρ ρ 0 is truncated for values less than 10 24 s 2 ferrari et al 2010 chose the following specification for c 6 c max c min π 1 0 h n z d z where the ocean depth is h and c min is a tunable parameter here set to 1 m s 2 2 eddy resolving model configuration the eddy resolving simulation uses the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 with a linear equation of state based solely on temperature no salinity the expansion coefficient for temperature is α t 1 5 10 4 k 1 the model domain is 3 200 km square and 4 km deep a cartesian tangent plane approximation is used with the coriolis parameter taking the value f 0 5 10 5 s 1 at the southern edge of the domain and increasing to 10 4 s 1 at the northern edge the vertical viscosity is a v 10 3 m2 s and the horizontal biharmonic viscosity is a 4 h 2 10 10 m4 s the momentum boundary conditions are no slip at the sides and bottom with a rigid lid the vertical diffusivity is κ v 10 4 m2 s except in regions where z t 0 in which case it increases to 10 m2 s the horizontal diffusivity of temperature is set to κ h 50 m2 s the model is forced by an asymmetric double gyre zonal wind stress of the form 0 2 sin π y l y π 6 n m2 and by an interactive heat flux out of the ocean equal to γ t t 0 where γ 35 w m2k 1 and t 0 is a half period cosine varying from 22 c at the southern boundary to 2 c at the northern boundary the heat flux is converted to a temperature flux using a heat capacity of 4000 j k 1 kg 1 no heat flux is allowed through the bottom or side boundaries the initial condition was taken from an equilibrated solution of the deterministic gm model described in grooms 2016 which has grid size of 40 km and 61 vertical levels with depths varying linearly from 25 m at the surface to 106 m at depth this low resolution equilibrated state was interpolated to the eddy resolving resolution of 8 km the circulation exhibits a large subtropical gyre and a weaker subpolar gyre with strong eddies along the western boundary and into the interior very similar to the simulations of henning and vallis 2004 a snapshot of the sea surface temperature and the sea surface height anomaly in the statistically steady state are shown in fig 1 2 3 diagnosing the gm parameter the gm parameter κ is diagnosed by minimizing the integral of the square of the error between the true eddy density flux divergence and the modeled divergence 7 κ arg min u ρ u ρ u ρ 2 d x where the notation arg min indicates that κ is the value that minimizes this expression the integral is over the volume and κ is allowed to vary horizontally but not vertically the restriction that κ is depth independent is perhaps overly severe cf abernathey et al 2013 but it significantly reduces the size and computational cost of the optimization problem limitations of the model are discussed further below minimizing the error in the flux divergence avoids problems related to gauge freedom that would arise if one instead minimized the error in the flux itself mak et al 2016 because the bolus velocity u depends linearly on κ this is a linear least squares problem solving the least squares problem requires computing the true eddy density flux divergence which requires defining a low pass spatial filter this was implemented as a moving average with a gaussian kernel u x y z t 1 z e x ξ 2 y η 2 2 l 2 u ξ η z t d ξ d η z e ξ 2 η 2 2 l 2 d ξ d η the kernel width l was 60 km and z is a normalization constant values outside the boundaries were computed using periodic extensions of the interior values of the fields the density and vertical velocity used even extensions at all boundaries the zonal velocity used even extensions at the northern and southern boundaries and odd extensions at the eastern and western boundaries while the meridional velocity used odd extensions at the northern and southern boundaries and even extensions at the eastern and western boundaries a kernel length scale of 60 km is arguably close enough to typical eddy length scales that it is possible that it fails to make a clear separation between the eddies and the scales resolvable by the coarse model though one could argue that the length scale is actually 2 60 km 85 km which is comparable to a typical eddy radius repeating the analysis with a variety of filter widths involves prohibitive computational expense so as an alternate way to test this the power spectral density of the filtered large scale part of temperature was computed over a period from the 98th year of the eddy resolving simulation to the 208th year with data taken every tenth day the power spectral density of sea surface temperature at a point 380 km west of the eastern boundary and 1580 km north of the southern boundary at the location marked a in fig 5 is shown as a function of the oscillation period in fig 2 most of the power is clearly associated with long time scales on the order of 10 weeks or longer this slow variability is characteristic of location and depth where the power spectral density was computed eddy variability dominates the total variability and is expected to occur on timescales of at most a few weeks so the fact that the temporal variability of the large scale part of temperature occurs on much longer time scales implies that the low pass spatial filter is effective at removing eddy length scales the eddy resolving simulation was allowed to run for 200 years after initializing from the low resolution model before taking the data used to compute κ the fields in eq 7 were computed on the coarse model grid of 40 km and the optimal value of κ was computed by solving the normal equations the results are extremely rough the left panel of fig 3 shows the optimal κ computed at a single time it may be the case that the extreme values of κ evident in the left panel of fig 3 result from locations where the gm model predicts a near zero flux divergence e g in regions of small isopycnal slope while the true flux divergence is large and κ becomes large to compensate regardless of their origin extreme values of κ on the order of 105 m2 s would necessitate extremely small time steps to avoid numerical instability in a low resolution model in order to avoid such extremely rough solutions a term was added to the least squares problem that penalizes the gradient of κ 8 κ arg min u ρ u ρ u ρ 2 ϵ h κ 2 d x after some investigation a value of ϵ 5 10 17 was deemed sufficient to improving the smoothness of κ without overly damaging the accuracy the center panel of fig 3 shows the value obtained from the penalty smoothed least squares problem the optimal value of κ was computed every 10 days for 1590 days approximately 4 36 years both with and without the smoothing penalty term negative values of κ appear in the smoothed results almost everywhere excepting only in the extreme north end of the domain and negative values occur on average in various parts of the domain there are mathematical difficulties with partial differential equations pdes with negative viscosity and one might want to impose a non negativity condition on the least squares problem to avoid this numerically solving a pde with negative viscosity is problematic because the computed solution depends strongly on the discretization and need not converge as the grid is refined durran 2010 on the other hand the negative viscosity exists here because a specific fixed coarse resolution and associated spatial filter was chosen for the diagnosis of κ and it would not make sense to use that same negative value of κ with increased resolution and decreased filter scale there are no mathematical problems with the discretized model with negative viscosity at fixed coarse resolution so negative values are retained here to make the gm parameterization as accurate as possible the optimal value of κ reduces the norm of the error technically the residual on the right hand side of eq 7 below the value it would have if κ 0 one can measure the goodness of fit using the relative residual the norm of the error in eq 7 using the optimal value of κ divided by the norm of the error with κ 0 this relative residual is shown as a function of time for both the original and penalty smoothed versions of κ in the right panel of fig 3 in the penalty smoothed relative residual the penalty term is not included in the error so that the comparison to the original least squares problem is more precise and physically relevant the un smoothed κ has errors of about 60 on average while the smoothed κ has errors of about 72 on average neither of these is very accuate which suggests that the isotropic depth independent gm parameterization is simply a poor model of the true eddy density flux divergence this should not be overly surprising since abernathey et al 2013 directly diagnosed the gm parameter κ in a differently configured simulation and observed significant vertical variation smith and marshall 2009 and bachman and fox kemper 2013 and others have similarly observed depth dependent isopycnal and diapycnal mixing parameters 3 a random field model for κ this section describes the construction of a random field model for κ based on the diagnosed values described in the preceeding section fig 4 shows the median upper row and standard deviation lower row of the diagnosed values of κ using the un smoothed results of eq 7 left column and the smoothed results from eq 8 right column there is clearly large variability in κ particularly for the un smoothed results which is why the median is used as a central estimator for the field instead of the mean the median is much less than one standard deviation from the mean and is robust to outliers also the median is somewhat smoother spatially than the mean not shown the grainy quality of the median and standard deviation of the un smoothed κ suggest that these statistics are hard to estimate accurately from the time series of 159 points this consideration together with the extreme roughness of the un smoothed fields shown in the left panel of fig 3 motivates us to focus henceforth on the smoothed version of κ in both the smoothed and unsmoothed versions of κ the increased variability shown in the lower row of fig 3 is associated with and presumably driven by the increased eddy energy along the western boundary we will develop a random field model for the smoothed version of κ the mean and standard deviation will be given by the values shown in the right column of fig 4 the following two sections study the spatial and temporal correlation structure of the smoothed version of κ 3 1 temporal structure the temporal structure in particular is hard to accurately estimate with a time series with spacing of 10 days in particular the correlation drops to 0 in less than 10 days near the western boundary because of the increased eddy energy and variability in that region so the eddy resolving simulation was extended by a further 201 days keeping daily snapshots the left panel of fig 5 shows the largest time lag for which the temporal autocorrelation of κ is greater than 0 5 in this section κ should be understood to be the smoothed version computed from eq 8 the center panel of fig 5 shows the empirical autocorrelation function at the location marked a in the left panel and the right panel shows the empirical autocorrelation function at the location marked b in the left panel the autocorrelation function in the right panel of fig 5 was estimated using the original time series of length 1590 days with 10 day gaps there is clearly huge variability in the temporal correlation structure of κ with decorrelation times on the order of a few days near the center of the subtropical gyre and decorrelation times longer than 3 weeks in the northeast corner of the domain it is doubtful that the slow behavior seen in the northeast corner is eddy driven since eddies presumably decorrelate far more rapidly instead this low frequency variability in κ may instead be reflecting low frequency variability in the large scale structure of the density field itself such low frequency variability is not uncommon in this kind of model arzel et al 2006 3 2 spatial structure to investigate the spatial correlation structure of κ in this section κ should be understood to be the smoothed version computed from eq 8 we first subtract the pointwise time average and divide by the standard deviation to achieve a centered field with unit variance this is called the centered scaled version of κ and it is the subject of analysis in this section the spatial structure is estimated using the original time series of length 159 with 10 day spacing plus every tenth day of the time series of length 201 with 1 day spacing this yields a time series of length 180 with 10 day spacing as noted in the previous section κ displays low frequency variability in the northeast corner of the domain that is probably not directly the result of eddy variability to avoid modeling this low frequency variability a high pass time filter is applied to κ before examining the spatial structure this high pass filter simply consists in removing a moving average from the data with weights 0 25 0 5 0 25 and the first and last points are removed leaving a time series of length 178 since the time series has a 10 day spacing and most of the variability in κ has time scales on the order of 10 days or less left panel of fig 5 the high pass filter only removes time scales significantly longer than 10 days and leaves the primary eddy variability intact the centered scaled field is anisotropic and highly inhomogeneous and cannot be described by any of the standard homogeneous random field models i e it cannot be accurately modeled using the kinds of pattern generators typically used for spp leutbecher et al 2017 a standard technique for dealing with inhomogeneous fields is to compute empirical orthogonal functions eofs eofs are approximations to the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the field and are obtained through a singular value decomposition of the data each eof explains a component of the total variance of the field and eof analysis is particularly useful when a small number of eofs describe most of the variance unfortunately as shown in fig 6 each eof accounts for only a small amount of the total variance of the centered scaled field the leading eof only accounts for 6 of the total variance moreover an eof based model for κ would have at most 177 degrees of freedom while the field itself on the 80 80 coarse grid has 6400 degrees of freedom the graphical lasso friedman et al 2008 is a method to estimate the precision matrix of a set of variables the precision matrix is the inverse of the covariance matrix it generates a sparse approximation to the precision matrix by minimizing a cost function that is the sum of a rank deficient l 2 term measuring the mismatch between the precision matrix and the data and an l 1 penalty term that regularizes the problem and enhances sparsity of the result in the statistical literature it is well known that the precision matrix inverse covariance matrix encodes a graphical structure on the random field and is typically expected to be a sparse matrix that relays information on a conditional dependence structure rue and held 2005 a penalty parameter λ 0 determines the sparsity of the estimate large λ leads to a very sparse but less accurate approximation while small λ leads to a more dense estimate λ 0 results in the un penalized empirical covariance estimate in particular we use the graphical lasso to estimate a random field model as it imposes no assumptions of homogeneity a key benefit of the graphical lasso is that the precision matrix that it produces is invertible i e full rank unlike the sample covariance matrix associated with eof analysis while the eof analysis produces 177 spatial patterns of variability eofs from a time series of length 178 the graphical lasso produces a complete set of 6400 spatial patterns of variability the spatial patterns associated with the graphical lasso are the eigenvectors of the precision matrix these are not the same as the eofs but they are approximating the same thing the eigenvectors of the true covariance matrix fig 7 shows that the first two eofs are essentially the same as the corresponding eigenvectors of the graphical lasso precision matrix with penalty parameter λ 0 01 like in eof analysis each of the graphical lasso spatial patterns explains a component of the total variance the amount of variance explained is the inverse of the eigenvalue of the precision matrix associated with the spatial pattern fig 6 shows the percentage of the total variance that is explained by each spatial pattern for the eof analysis and for the graphical lasso analysis with both λ 0 1 and λ 0 01 the variances associated with the leading patterns of variability are equal in the two approaches and for both values of λ but while the eof analysis fits the total variance into 177 spatial patterns the graphical lasso pushes much of the variance into 6400 separate spatial patterns at λ 0 1 the graphical lasso underestimates the variance in several of the leading patterns of variability and instead puts this variance into the long tail of patterns that is associated with spatially incoherent noise as λ decreases the estimation becomes more accurate and the graphical lasso agrees with the eof analysis for most of the leading patterns of variability nevertheless at λ 0 01 some of the total variance is associated with a long tail of patterns that is associated with spatially incoherent noise the eof and graphical lasso agree at large scales but by forcing all the variance into 177 global spatial patterns the eof analysis attributes too much long range spatial coherence to the noise at small scales 3 3 a stochastic model for κ this section formulates a stochastic model that attempts to approximate the spatial and temporal structure discussed in the preceeding two sections the approach is similar to that used by berloff 2005 we begin with the spatial structure the graphical lasso yields a spatial precision matrix p c 1 where c is an approximation to the spatial covariance matrix let l l t p be the cholesky decomposition of p and let x be a vector of zero mean unit variance independent random variables then z l t x is a vector with covariance matrix c this shows how to construct a random field with a spatial correlation structure that mimics κ compute the cholesky factorization of the precision matrix computed by the graphical lasso and use it to give spatial correlation to a field of independent random variables a simple approach to modeling the temporal correlation structure is to construct an ar 1 first order autoregressive process at each spatial location on the coarse grid ar 1 processes are unable to model negative correlations but the autocorrelation functions diagnosed across the domain are all similar to those shown in the center and left panels of fig 5 i e they are monotonically decreasing until they become statistically insignificant in a more general setting ar 2 or higher processes could be used the decorrelation time of this process can be tuned to match the observed decorrelation time of κ it is not straightforward to combine the two foregoing ideas cholesky plus ar 1 processes into a model that accurately reflects the full spatiotemporal correlation structure of the true field κ our model takes the following form at each point of the coarse grid the centered scaled version of κ is modeled as an ar 1 process in the form 9 κ n 1 r κ n 1 r 2 χ n where χn are unit variance zero mean random variables that are independent from one time to the next the subscript n indicates time and r governs the local decorrelation time specifically r is chosen so that the ar 1 process reaches a correlation of 50 at a lag time given by the 50 lag time shown in the left panel of fig 5 with one caveat the times shown in fig 5 are in one day increments which leads to sharp jumps in the decorrelation time the field shown in fig 5 is therefore smoothed by applying a moving average with weights 0 25 0 5 0 25 in each direction before being used to set r for the ar 1 processes spatial structure is given to the centered scaled κ by endowing the innovations χn with spatial correlation this is achieved using the cholesky method described above with the precision matrix produced by the graphical lasso with λ 0 01 the final value of κ is obtained by multiplying the scaled centered version κ by the standard deviation shown in the lower right panel of fig 4 and then adding the median shown in the upper right panel of fig 4 4 coarse model simulations coarse model simulations are configured as in grooms 2016 and using parameter values from section 2 2 with the following exceptions the horizontal grid size is 40 km and diffusion of temperature is accomplished by a third order upwind scheme rather than by an explicit diffusivity the horizontal viscosity is laplacian rather than biharmonic the value 8000 m2 s is applied to the baroclinic part of the flow and the value 1000 m2 s is applied to the barotropic part different values are used in an effort to make the barotropic and baroclinic viscous boundary layers both have widths on the order of one grid cell the time mean state of the large scale part of the eddy resolving simulation described in section 2 2 was used as an initial condition for the coarse model simulations we run simulations with a constant value of κ 6000 m2 s for comparison to the stochastic gm scheme described in the preceeding section this simulation is called the deterministic gm simulation in addition we run simulations where the gm parameter κ is perturbed by multiplying by 1 e where e is a unit variance zero mean gaussian random field the temporal structure of e is an ar 1 process with decorrelation time of 10 days and the spatial structure results from applying a moving average with weights 0 25 0 5 0 25 in each direction to an uncorrelated field see grooms 2016 for more details this simulation is called the spp gm simulation the simulation using the model described in section 3 is simply called the stochastic gm simulation the temperature field in the coarse model simulations is compared to the large scale part of the temperature field from the eddy resolving simulation described in section 2 2 the large scale part of the temperature is obtained by the gaussian kernel smoother described in section 2 3 it was computed every 10 days starting in year 98 of the eddy resolving simulation and ending in year 208 a 110 year time series fig 8 shows the time mean sea surface temperature sst from the eddy resolving simulation top left from the deterministic gm simulation top right from the spp gm simulation lower left and from the stochastic gm simulation lower right the deterministic and spp gm schemes provide reasonably accurate predictions for the mean sst while the tuned stochastic gm simulation is badly incorrect the true sst has a steady decrease of sst with latitude with very little zonal variability the stochastic gm simulation has a plume of warm water originating near the southwest corner of the domain and extending north and east up through the center of the domain the mean temperature structure in the spp gm simulation is similarly inaccurate throughout the main thermocline not shown in view of the very poor accuracy of the optimized stochastic gm parameterization that is the primary focus of the investigation there is little point in proceeding to test whether the scheme generates accurate variability or in tuning other parameters of the deterministic and spp gm simulations 5 discussion the ultimate goal of this research is to formulate a gm parameterization that produces an accurate coarse model simulation and there are two routes to achieve this one route not taken here involves tuning the parameterization by running repeated coarse model simulations and comparing the results to known reference data this process is costly because of the infinite number of possible ways to tune the parameterization the other route taken here involves studying the process or quantity that is being parameterized and attempting to build an accurate model thereof this route is based on the assumption that a parameterization that accurately models the true eddy flux divergence should result in an accurate coarse model simulation the primary result of the foregoing section is the fact that a simulation using a stochastic gm parameterization that is configured to match as closely as possible the gm parameter diagnosed from a high resolution reference experiment yields significantly worse results than a basic simulation with a constant value for κ if the underlying assumption is true then the contrapositive must also be true a parameterization that yields an inaccurate coarse model simulation must be an inaccurate model of the true eddy flux divergence the stochastic gm parameterization derived in section 3 must therefore be an inaccurate model of the true eddy flux divergence the converse i e if a parameterization yields an accurate simulation then it must also be an accurate model of the true eddy flux divergence is clearly false since section 2 shows that constant κ gives a less accurate model of the eddy flux divergence while section 4 shows that constant κ yields a more accurate coarse model simulation there are many ways in which the stochastic gm model developed in section 3 might be inaccurate for example as with all spp stochastic parameterizations the modeled variations in κ are independent of the large scale temperature whereas the real variations in κ might depend on the large scale temperature alternatively it might be the case that despite the care taken in developing a model with realistic spatial and temporal variabilty some crucial aspect of the true variability of κ has been missed in the stochastic model of κ but the results of section 2 indicate a more fundamental problem the isotropic gm parameterization with depth independent κ yields a very poor fit to the true eddy flux divergence so that no matter how well the diagnosed κ is represented with a stochastic model it will never be an accurate model of the true eddy flux divergence recall that the optimal κ computed using this configuration reduced the error between the parameterized eddy tracer flux divergence and the true eddy tracer flux divergence by only 30 to 40 as compared to κ 0 see fig 3 it is possible that an anisotropic formulation smith and gent 2004 or a depth dependent κ abernathey et al 2013 might yield a better fit to the flux divergence in particular allowing arbitrary depth dependence would significantly increase the number of degrees of freedom available for fitting the true eddy flux divergence but at a more general level it may be the case that it is simply not possible to model the true eddy flux divergence purely by varying κ or the flux tensor in anisotropic gm in a gm parameterization recall that the advective formulation of the gm parameterization implies that the gm parameterization models the eddy tracer flux divergence as u τ u τ where u τ is the gm advective flux griffies 1998 demonstrated that one can alternatively parameterize the eddy tracer flux divergence by the divergence of skew flux that equals the advective flux u τ plus a non divergent gauge the gm skew flux has the form 10 f skew ψ τ for a standard isotropic configuration of gm the horizontal part of the skew flux of density has the form 11 f skew x κ x ρ f skew y κ y ρ grooms 2016 showed that stochastic gm parameterizations could be built by producing stochastic parameterizations of the skew flux of density denoting a stochastic parameterization of the horizontal density flux by f stoch one can invert eq 10 to obtain the corresponding stochastic parameterization of the gm vector streamfunction 12 ψ stoch y f stoch x z ρ ψ stoch x f stoch y z ρ the stochastic gm model developed in section 3 as well as the spp gm approach of juricke et al 2017 2018 fits within this framework in these parameterizations the stochastic parameterization of the skew flux takes the form of eq 11 with a stochastic κ as shown in section 2 a stochastic gm model of this form does not fit the diagnosed eddy flux divergences well a more successful approach to building a stochastic gm parameterization that accurately models the eddy flux divergence might need to break out of this paradigm of randomizing κ for example one might find more success in both fitting the true eddy flux divergence and in coarse model simulations by using the following more general form for the eddy skew flux of density 13 f stoch x κ x ρ χ x f stoch y κ y ρ χ y where χx and χy are components of a random eddy flux this type of parameterization has both a multiplicative component associated with κ and an additive component associated with the random eddy flux such a parameterization would for example easily generate an eddy flux in regions with small isopycnal slope whereas the multiplicative approach requires large κ to generate eddy fluxes in regions of small isopycnal slopes the additive terms are qualitatively similar to the nonlocal transport term in the kpp parameterization large et al 1994 williams et al 2016 developed an additive stochastic parameterization in the temperature tendency of an ocean gcm the additive terms above would have a similar effect but would guarantee that the parameterization remains adiabatic by remaining within the gm framework the development of the details of such a parameterization is beyond the scope of this article though preliminary strides in that direction were made by grooms 2016 6 conclusions this paper addresses the question of parameterizing the tracer flux divergence associated with unresolved mesoscale eddies in non eddying ocean models we begin by diagnosing the parameter κ in an isotropic gent mcwilliams parameterization gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 by comparing to eddy resolving simulations rather than estimate κ by comparing the diagnosed fluxes to the parameterized fluxes cf eden et al 2007 bachman and fox kemper 2013 we use a least squares approach to fit the parameterized eddy flux divergence to the diagnosed eddy flux divergence cf mak et al 2016 the diagnosed κ displays huge variability with values as large as 30 000 m2 s crucially the optimal value of κ leads to a parameterization that only accounts for less than 50 of the diagnosed eddy flux divergence a stochastic model is developed that carefully models the spatial and temporal structure of the diagnosed κ coarse model simulations are then run using the new stochastic model for κ constant κ and constant κ perturbed by simple stochastic noise the coarse model simulations with constant κ and with the simple stochastic model are far more accurate than simulations with the new stochastic model we argue that the poor agreement of the optimal diagnosed κ with the diagnosed eddy flux divergence explains the failure of the new stochastic model to produce accurate coarse model simulations and suggest that future gm parameterizations might be more successful both in terms of modeling the true eddy flux divergence and in terms of producing realistic coarse model simulations if they include an additive component to the skew flux rather than relying solely on variations in κ of course the κ diagnosed here was constrained to be depth independent and significant improvements might still be obtained by allowing depth dependence or anisotropy smith and gent 2004 abernathey et al 2013 these results demonstrate that accurate coarse model simulations can be produced using parameterizations that are not accurate models of the true eddy flux divergence it may therefore be possible to improve coarse model simulations with a stochastically perturbed gm parameter κ by tuning the structure of the perturbations of κ as in juricke et al 2017 2018 but these improvements to the coarse model simulations will not come as a result of making the modeled eddy flux divergence

24060,a depth independent isotropic gent mcwilliams gm transport parameter κ is diagnosed from an idealized eddy resolving primitive equation simulation the optimal depth independent isotropic gm parameterization is only able to model less than 50 of the diagnosed total tendency of temperature induced by unresolved mesoscale eddies a spatio temporal stochastic model of the gm parameter is developed based on the diagnosed values the graphical lasso is used to estimate the spatial correlation structure the stochastic model is used as a stochastic parameterization in low resolution model simulations the low resolution stochastic simulation does a poor job of reproducing the temporal mean of large scale temperature deterministic gm parameterizations and multiplicative stochastic gm parameterizations with unrealistic structure result in significantly more accurate large scale temperature in the low resolution simulations these results suggest that either the depth independence or the isotropy of the gm parameterization are unrealistic as models of the eddy tracer transport or that a stochastic gm parameterization should include an additive component keywords stochastic parameterization mesoscale parameterization gent mcwilliams 1 introduction global ocean models hereinafter gcms general circulation models are used for a variety of purposes including centennial climate forecasts shorter term ensemble forecasting or reanalysis scenarios and paleoclimate research for these particular purposes the computational cost associated with coupled ensemble simulations long term simulations or simulations with many online tracers e g biogeochemistry precludes the use of spatial resolution fine enough to represent the ocean mesoscale the models used for these purposes typically have horizontal spatial resolution on the order of 1 or larger and will be referred to hereafter as coarse gcms the inability to resolve mesoscale eddies is one of the foremost obstacles to developing accurate coarse gcms the primary impact of unresolved dynamics in coarse gcms is the transport of tracers and momentum in gcms where mesoscale eddy dynamics are completely unresolved the primary subgrid scale transport is of tracers rather than momentum grooms et al 2011 the dominant parameterization paradigm for mesoscale tracer transport is the gent mcwilliams framework gm gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 which essentially codifies the fact that mesoscale eddies typically transport tracers along isopycnals in such a way as to reduce potential energy by flattening isopycnals mesoscale eddies also mix tracers along isopycnal directions this effect is parameterized separately from gm usually by some form of redi parameterization redi 1982 the gm parameterization is deterministic in the sense that subgrid scale tracer fluxes are modeled as deterministic functions of the resolved model variables this approach would lead to realistic parameterizations if the ocean mesoscale were much smaller and faster than the dynamics resolved by the gcm scale separation assumptions of this kind are made in multiscale asymptotic analyses of ocean eddy dynamics grooms et al 2011 2012 but in coarse gcms with grid scales on the order of 1 or larger mesoscale eddies are not significantly smaller than the grid as a result the true subgrid scale tracer fluxes are not completely determined by the resolved scale variables the large variability in tracer flux that remains even after averaging over square cells of width approximately 85 km was demonstrated by grooms 2016 the turbulent mesoscale dynamics generate chaotic fluxes that are spatially and temporally correlated and are dependent on but not entirely determined by the large scale flow the fact that the subgrid scale tracer fluxes are chaotic implies that parameterizations should be stochastic the idea of using random numbers in numerical climate models goes back at least to lorenz 1975 a major development in the practical use of stochastic parameterizations in atmospheric and oceanic gcms came when a stochastic parameterization was implemented in the operational ecmwf ensemble prediction system buizza et al 1999 since then stochastic parameterizations have been adopted by operational centers almost exclusively for use in atmospheric ensemble prediction systems because they increase ensemble spread leading to better calibrated probabilistic forecasts berner et al 2017 leutbecher et al 2017 many stochastic parameterizations too numerous to list have been developed for both atmosphere and ocean applications but operational use of stochastic parameterizations has been dominated by the style of parameterization advocated by buizza et al 1999 buizza et al 1999 advocated taking the terms in tracer and momentum budgets that are associated with parameterizations the parameterization tendencies and multiplying them perturbing them by 1 e where e is a random field with zero mean this approach has come to be called stochastically perturbed parameterization tendencies sppt christensen et al 2017 recently explored an alternative whereby different parameterizations are multiplied by different independent random fields in an approach called indepdent sppt isppt sppt is not conservative of tracers or momentum and it has recently been found to dry out the atmosphere in long running simulations davini et al 2017 conservation within the context of sppt can be enforced using a method proposed by leutbecher et al 2017 as an alternative the parameters within a parameterization can be perturbed rather than the tendency produced by the parameterization and this approach is called stochastically perturbed parameters spp grooms 2016 used spp but incorrectly called it sppt sppt and spp have recently been applied to coarse gcms in ocean only and coupled simulations brankart et al 2015 and andrejczuk et al 2016 used sppt in a coarse gcm but only applied the perturbations to mixing parameterizations and not to the gm parameterization juricke et al 2017 and juricke et al 2018 used spp with the gm parameterization there are a few other stochastic parameterizations for coarse gcms that are not based on spp or sppt these include the stochastic equation of state developed by brankart 2013 and the addition of stochastic noise forcing to the temperature equation of a gcm by williams et al 2016 grooms 2016 developed a framework for stochastic gm parameterizations and developed a preliminary non gaussian stochastic gm parameterization albeit in an idealized model the goal of the present investigation is to push the spp approach to gm parameterization to its limits by choosing the multiplicative perturbation structure to be as realistic as possible recall that the spp approach requires specifying the structure of the random field e where 1 e is used to perturb the parameter of interest the random field is usually specified via some sort of pattern generator with tunable time and length scales see e g leutbecher et al 2017 for examples in the present investigation the parameter κ in the standard isotropic gm parameterization is estimated directly from eddy resolving simulations and is allowed to vary in time and horizontally in space the results are then used to develop a random field model for κ which is equivalent to modeling the perturbation e in the spp approach this model is then used in an implementation of a stochastic gm parameterization which is compared to deterministic gm parameterizations and to a less realistic spp gm parameterization we begin in section 2 by diagnosing the gm parameter from an eddy resolving simulation in an idealized domain this section includes a description of the results of the diagnosis while the next section section 3 develops the stochastic model for κ section 4 briefly describes the configuration of parameterized coarse model simulations and then compares the results of various coarse model simulations with deterministic and stochastic gm parameterizations results are discussed in section 5 and conclusions are offered in section 6 2 diagnosing the gm parameter 2 1 gent mcwilliams background before detailing the method used to diagnose the gm parameter we begin with a brief review of the deterministic gm framework gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 in the gm framework the divergence of the subgrid scale tracer flux is parameterized by a bolus velocity advection 1 u τ u τ throughout this section resolved scale variables have no primes and subgrid scale variables are denoted by a prime the overbar denotes a spatial average to the coarse grid scale in the above expression τ denotes a tracer concentration and the bolus velocity is 2 u ψ where ψ ψ x ψ y 0 t is a vector streamfunction eq 2 guarantees that the bolus velocity is incompressible which is a key property of the gm framework namely that the flux is non mixing i e adiabatic in the standard isotropic version of the gm parameterization the vector streamfunction ψ is linearly related to the local isopycnal slope s h ρ z ρ where h x y t and ρ is the density 3 ψ x κ s y ψ y κ s x when using a nonlinear equation of state s should be replaced by the slope of neutral surfaces mcdougall 1987 when κ 0 eq 3 guarantees that the parameterization acts to remove potential energy by tilting isopycnal surfaces towards horizontal gent et al 1995 there are two difficulties associated with this formulation of the gm parameterization how to deal with unstratified or convectively unstable regions z ρ 0 and how to guarantee that the vertical part of the bolus velocity w is zero at the ocean surface or floor the vertical bolus velocity is w x ψ y y ψ x the vertical component of the bolus velocity can be set to zero at a given depth by setting ψ 0 at that depth ferrari et al 2010 proposed a simple and elegant approach that simultaneously ensures impenetrability at the ocean surface and deals with unstratified or convectively unstable regions the vector streamfunction is specified as the solution of the following two point boundary value problem 4 c 2 z 2 g z ρ ρ 0 ψ y κ g ρ 0 x ρ 5 c 2 z 2 g z ρ ρ 0 ψ x κ g ρ 0 y ρ with boundary conditions ψ x ψ y 0 when c 2 is chosen appropriately the streamfunction approximates 3 and the solutions smoothly transition through unstratified and convectively unstable regions in practice the density gradient z ρ that appears in these equations is truncated to negative values here the value of n 2 z g z ρ ρ 0 is truncated for values less than 10 24 s 2 ferrari et al 2010 chose the following specification for c 6 c max c min π 1 0 h n z d z where the ocean depth is h and c min is a tunable parameter here set to 1 m s 2 2 eddy resolving model configuration the eddy resolving simulation uses the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 with a linear equation of state based solely on temperature no salinity the expansion coefficient for temperature is α t 1 5 10 4 k 1 the model domain is 3 200 km square and 4 km deep a cartesian tangent plane approximation is used with the coriolis parameter taking the value f 0 5 10 5 s 1 at the southern edge of the domain and increasing to 10 4 s 1 at the northern edge the vertical viscosity is a v 10 3 m2 s and the horizontal biharmonic viscosity is a 4 h 2 10 10 m4 s the momentum boundary conditions are no slip at the sides and bottom with a rigid lid the vertical diffusivity is κ v 10 4 m2 s except in regions where z t 0 in which case it increases to 10 m2 s the horizontal diffusivity of temperature is set to κ h 50 m2 s the model is forced by an asymmetric double gyre zonal wind stress of the form 0 2 sin π y l y π 6 n m2 and by an interactive heat flux out of the ocean equal to γ t t 0 where γ 35 w m2k 1 and t 0 is a half period cosine varying from 22 c at the southern boundary to 2 c at the northern boundary the heat flux is converted to a temperature flux using a heat capacity of 4000 j k 1 kg 1 no heat flux is allowed through the bottom or side boundaries the initial condition was taken from an equilibrated solution of the deterministic gm model described in grooms 2016 which has grid size of 40 km and 61 vertical levels with depths varying linearly from 25 m at the surface to 106 m at depth this low resolution equilibrated state was interpolated to the eddy resolving resolution of 8 km the circulation exhibits a large subtropical gyre and a weaker subpolar gyre with strong eddies along the western boundary and into the interior very similar to the simulations of henning and vallis 2004 a snapshot of the sea surface temperature and the sea surface height anomaly in the statistically steady state are shown in fig 1 2 3 diagnosing the gm parameter the gm parameter κ is diagnosed by minimizing the integral of the square of the error between the true eddy density flux divergence and the modeled divergence 7 κ arg min u ρ u ρ u ρ 2 d x where the notation arg min indicates that κ is the value that minimizes this expression the integral is over the volume and κ is allowed to vary horizontally but not vertically the restriction that κ is depth independent is perhaps overly severe cf abernathey et al 2013 but it significantly reduces the size and computational cost of the optimization problem limitations of the model are discussed further below minimizing the error in the flux divergence avoids problems related to gauge freedom that would arise if one instead minimized the error in the flux itself mak et al 2016 because the bolus velocity u depends linearly on κ this is a linear least squares problem solving the least squares problem requires computing the true eddy density flux divergence which requires defining a low pass spatial filter this was implemented as a moving average with a gaussian kernel u x y z t 1 z e x ξ 2 y η 2 2 l 2 u ξ η z t d ξ d η z e ξ 2 η 2 2 l 2 d ξ d η the kernel width l was 60 km and z is a normalization constant values outside the boundaries were computed using periodic extensions of the interior values of the fields the density and vertical velocity used even extensions at all boundaries the zonal velocity used even extensions at the northern and southern boundaries and odd extensions at the eastern and western boundaries while the meridional velocity used odd extensions at the northern and southern boundaries and even extensions at the eastern and western boundaries a kernel length scale of 60 km is arguably close enough to typical eddy length scales that it is possible that it fails to make a clear separation between the eddies and the scales resolvable by the coarse model though one could argue that the length scale is actually 2 60 km 85 km which is comparable to a typical eddy radius repeating the analysis with a variety of filter widths involves prohibitive computational expense so as an alternate way to test this the power spectral density of the filtered large scale part of temperature was computed over a period from the 98th year of the eddy resolving simulation to the 208th year with data taken every tenth day the power spectral density of sea surface temperature at a point 380 km west of the eastern boundary and 1580 km north of the southern boundary at the location marked a in fig 5 is shown as a function of the oscillation period in fig 2 most of the power is clearly associated with long time scales on the order of 10 weeks or longer this slow variability is characteristic of location and depth where the power spectral density was computed eddy variability dominates the total variability and is expected to occur on timescales of at most a few weeks so the fact that the temporal variability of the large scale part of temperature occurs on much longer time scales implies that the low pass spatial filter is effective at removing eddy length scales the eddy resolving simulation was allowed to run for 200 years after initializing from the low resolution model before taking the data used to compute κ the fields in eq 7 were computed on the coarse model grid of 40 km and the optimal value of κ was computed by solving the normal equations the results are extremely rough the left panel of fig 3 shows the optimal κ computed at a single time it may be the case that the extreme values of κ evident in the left panel of fig 3 result from locations where the gm model predicts a near zero flux divergence e g in regions of small isopycnal slope while the true flux divergence is large and κ becomes large to compensate regardless of their origin extreme values of κ on the order of 105 m2 s would necessitate extremely small time steps to avoid numerical instability in a low resolution model in order to avoid such extremely rough solutions a term was added to the least squares problem that penalizes the gradient of κ 8 κ arg min u ρ u ρ u ρ 2 ϵ h κ 2 d x after some investigation a value of ϵ 5 10 17 was deemed sufficient to improving the smoothness of κ without overly damaging the accuracy the center panel of fig 3 shows the value obtained from the penalty smoothed least squares problem the optimal value of κ was computed every 10 days for 1590 days approximately 4 36 years both with and without the smoothing penalty term negative values of κ appear in the smoothed results almost everywhere excepting only in the extreme north end of the domain and negative values occur on average in various parts of the domain there are mathematical difficulties with partial differential equations pdes with negative viscosity and one might want to impose a non negativity condition on the least squares problem to avoid this numerically solving a pde with negative viscosity is problematic because the computed solution depends strongly on the discretization and need not converge as the grid is refined durran 2010 on the other hand the negative viscosity exists here because a specific fixed coarse resolution and associated spatial filter was chosen for the diagnosis of κ and it would not make sense to use that same negative value of κ with increased resolution and decreased filter scale there are no mathematical problems with the discretized model with negative viscosity at fixed coarse resolution so negative values are retained here to make the gm parameterization as accurate as possible the optimal value of κ reduces the norm of the error technically the residual on the right hand side of eq 7 below the value it would have if κ 0 one can measure the goodness of fit using the relative residual the norm of the error in eq 7 using the optimal value of κ divided by the norm of the error with κ 0 this relative residual is shown as a function of time for both the original and penalty smoothed versions of κ in the right panel of fig 3 in the penalty smoothed relative residual the penalty term is not included in the error so that the comparison to the original least squares problem is more precise and physically relevant the un smoothed κ has errors of about 60 on average while the smoothed κ has errors of about 72 on average neither of these is very accuate which suggests that the isotropic depth independent gm parameterization is simply a poor model of the true eddy density flux divergence this should not be overly surprising since abernathey et al 2013 directly diagnosed the gm parameter κ in a differently configured simulation and observed significant vertical variation smith and marshall 2009 and bachman and fox kemper 2013 and others have similarly observed depth dependent isopycnal and diapycnal mixing parameters 3 a random field model for κ this section describes the construction of a random field model for κ based on the diagnosed values described in the preceeding section fig 4 shows the median upper row and standard deviation lower row of the diagnosed values of κ using the un smoothed results of eq 7 left column and the smoothed results from eq 8 right column there is clearly large variability in κ particularly for the un smoothed results which is why the median is used as a central estimator for the field instead of the mean the median is much less than one standard deviation from the mean and is robust to outliers also the median is somewhat smoother spatially than the mean not shown the grainy quality of the median and standard deviation of the un smoothed κ suggest that these statistics are hard to estimate accurately from the time series of 159 points this consideration together with the extreme roughness of the un smoothed fields shown in the left panel of fig 3 motivates us to focus henceforth on the smoothed version of κ in both the smoothed and unsmoothed versions of κ the increased variability shown in the lower row of fig 3 is associated with and presumably driven by the increased eddy energy along the western boundary we will develop a random field model for the smoothed version of κ the mean and standard deviation will be given by the values shown in the right column of fig 4 the following two sections study the spatial and temporal correlation structure of the smoothed version of κ 3 1 temporal structure the temporal structure in particular is hard to accurately estimate with a time series with spacing of 10 days in particular the correlation drops to 0 in less than 10 days near the western boundary because of the increased eddy energy and variability in that region so the eddy resolving simulation was extended by a further 201 days keeping daily snapshots the left panel of fig 5 shows the largest time lag for which the temporal autocorrelation of κ is greater than 0 5 in this section κ should be understood to be the smoothed version computed from eq 8 the center panel of fig 5 shows the empirical autocorrelation function at the location marked a in the left panel and the right panel shows the empirical autocorrelation function at the location marked b in the left panel the autocorrelation function in the right panel of fig 5 was estimated using the original time series of length 1590 days with 10 day gaps there is clearly huge variability in the temporal correlation structure of κ with decorrelation times on the order of a few days near the center of the subtropical gyre and decorrelation times longer than 3 weeks in the northeast corner of the domain it is doubtful that the slow behavior seen in the northeast corner is eddy driven since eddies presumably decorrelate far more rapidly instead this low frequency variability in κ may instead be reflecting low frequency variability in the large scale structure of the density field itself such low frequency variability is not uncommon in this kind of model arzel et al 2006 3 2 spatial structure to investigate the spatial correlation structure of κ in this section κ should be understood to be the smoothed version computed from eq 8 we first subtract the pointwise time average and divide by the standard deviation to achieve a centered field with unit variance this is called the centered scaled version of κ and it is the subject of analysis in this section the spatial structure is estimated using the original time series of length 159 with 10 day spacing plus every tenth day of the time series of length 201 with 1 day spacing this yields a time series of length 180 with 10 day spacing as noted in the previous section κ displays low frequency variability in the northeast corner of the domain that is probably not directly the result of eddy variability to avoid modeling this low frequency variability a high pass time filter is applied to κ before examining the spatial structure this high pass filter simply consists in removing a moving average from the data with weights 0 25 0 5 0 25 and the first and last points are removed leaving a time series of length 178 since the time series has a 10 day spacing and most of the variability in κ has time scales on the order of 10 days or less left panel of fig 5 the high pass filter only removes time scales significantly longer than 10 days and leaves the primary eddy variability intact the centered scaled field is anisotropic and highly inhomogeneous and cannot be described by any of the standard homogeneous random field models i e it cannot be accurately modeled using the kinds of pattern generators typically used for spp leutbecher et al 2017 a standard technique for dealing with inhomogeneous fields is to compute empirical orthogonal functions eofs eofs are approximations to the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the field and are obtained through a singular value decomposition of the data each eof explains a component of the total variance of the field and eof analysis is particularly useful when a small number of eofs describe most of the variance unfortunately as shown in fig 6 each eof accounts for only a small amount of the total variance of the centered scaled field the leading eof only accounts for 6 of the total variance moreover an eof based model for κ would have at most 177 degrees of freedom while the field itself on the 80 80 coarse grid has 6400 degrees of freedom the graphical lasso friedman et al 2008 is a method to estimate the precision matrix of a set of variables the precision matrix is the inverse of the covariance matrix it generates a sparse approximation to the precision matrix by minimizing a cost function that is the sum of a rank deficient l 2 term measuring the mismatch between the precision matrix and the data and an l 1 penalty term that regularizes the problem and enhances sparsity of the result in the statistical literature it is well known that the precision matrix inverse covariance matrix encodes a graphical structure on the random field and is typically expected to be a sparse matrix that relays information on a conditional dependence structure rue and held 2005 a penalty parameter λ 0 determines the sparsity of the estimate large λ leads to a very sparse but less accurate approximation while small λ leads to a more dense estimate λ 0 results in the un penalized empirical covariance estimate in particular we use the graphical lasso to estimate a random field model as it imposes no assumptions of homogeneity a key benefit of the graphical lasso is that the precision matrix that it produces is invertible i e full rank unlike the sample covariance matrix associated with eof analysis while the eof analysis produces 177 spatial patterns of variability eofs from a time series of length 178 the graphical lasso produces a complete set of 6400 spatial patterns of variability the spatial patterns associated with the graphical lasso are the eigenvectors of the precision matrix these are not the same as the eofs but they are approximating the same thing the eigenvectors of the true covariance matrix fig 7 shows that the first two eofs are essentially the same as the corresponding eigenvectors of the graphical lasso precision matrix with penalty parameter λ 0 01 like in eof analysis each of the graphical lasso spatial patterns explains a component of the total variance the amount of variance explained is the inverse of the eigenvalue of the precision matrix associated with the spatial pattern fig 6 shows the percentage of the total variance that is explained by each spatial pattern for the eof analysis and for the graphical lasso analysis with both λ 0 1 and λ 0 01 the variances associated with the leading patterns of variability are equal in the two approaches and for both values of λ but while the eof analysis fits the total variance into 177 spatial patterns the graphical lasso pushes much of the variance into 6400 separate spatial patterns at λ 0 1 the graphical lasso underestimates the variance in several of the leading patterns of variability and instead puts this variance into the long tail of patterns that is associated with spatially incoherent noise as λ decreases the estimation becomes more accurate and the graphical lasso agrees with the eof analysis for most of the leading patterns of variability nevertheless at λ 0 01 some of the total variance is associated with a long tail of patterns that is associated with spatially incoherent noise the eof and graphical lasso agree at large scales but by forcing all the variance into 177 global spatial patterns the eof analysis attributes too much long range spatial coherence to the noise at small scales 3 3 a stochastic model for κ this section formulates a stochastic model that attempts to approximate the spatial and temporal structure discussed in the preceeding two sections the approach is similar to that used by berloff 2005 we begin with the spatial structure the graphical lasso yields a spatial precision matrix p c 1 where c is an approximation to the spatial covariance matrix let l l t p be the cholesky decomposition of p and let x be a vector of zero mean unit variance independent random variables then z l t x is a vector with covariance matrix c this shows how to construct a random field with a spatial correlation structure that mimics κ compute the cholesky factorization of the precision matrix computed by the graphical lasso and use it to give spatial correlation to a field of independent random variables a simple approach to modeling the temporal correlation structure is to construct an ar 1 first order autoregressive process at each spatial location on the coarse grid ar 1 processes are unable to model negative correlations but the autocorrelation functions diagnosed across the domain are all similar to those shown in the center and left panels of fig 5 i e they are monotonically decreasing until they become statistically insignificant in a more general setting ar 2 or higher processes could be used the decorrelation time of this process can be tuned to match the observed decorrelation time of κ it is not straightforward to combine the two foregoing ideas cholesky plus ar 1 processes into a model that accurately reflects the full spatiotemporal correlation structure of the true field κ our model takes the following form at each point of the coarse grid the centered scaled version of κ is modeled as an ar 1 process in the form 9 κ n 1 r κ n 1 r 2 χ n where χn are unit variance zero mean random variables that are independent from one time to the next the subscript n indicates time and r governs the local decorrelation time specifically r is chosen so that the ar 1 process reaches a correlation of 50 at a lag time given by the 50 lag time shown in the left panel of fig 5 with one caveat the times shown in fig 5 are in one day increments which leads to sharp jumps in the decorrelation time the field shown in fig 5 is therefore smoothed by applying a moving average with weights 0 25 0 5 0 25 in each direction before being used to set r for the ar 1 processes spatial structure is given to the centered scaled κ by endowing the innovations χn with spatial correlation this is achieved using the cholesky method described above with the precision matrix produced by the graphical lasso with λ 0 01 the final value of κ is obtained by multiplying the scaled centered version κ by the standard deviation shown in the lower right panel of fig 4 and then adding the median shown in the upper right panel of fig 4 4 coarse model simulations coarse model simulations are configured as in grooms 2016 and using parameter values from section 2 2 with the following exceptions the horizontal grid size is 40 km and diffusion of temperature is accomplished by a third order upwind scheme rather than by an explicit diffusivity the horizontal viscosity is laplacian rather than biharmonic the value 8000 m2 s is applied to the baroclinic part of the flow and the value 1000 m2 s is applied to the barotropic part different values are used in an effort to make the barotropic and baroclinic viscous boundary layers both have widths on the order of one grid cell the time mean state of the large scale part of the eddy resolving simulation described in section 2 2 was used as an initial condition for the coarse model simulations we run simulations with a constant value of κ 6000 m2 s for comparison to the stochastic gm scheme described in the preceeding section this simulation is called the deterministic gm simulation in addition we run simulations where the gm parameter κ is perturbed by multiplying by 1 e where e is a unit variance zero mean gaussian random field the temporal structure of e is an ar 1 process with decorrelation time of 10 days and the spatial structure results from applying a moving average with weights 0 25 0 5 0 25 in each direction to an uncorrelated field see grooms 2016 for more details this simulation is called the spp gm simulation the simulation using the model described in section 3 is simply called the stochastic gm simulation the temperature field in the coarse model simulations is compared to the large scale part of the temperature field from the eddy resolving simulation described in section 2 2 the large scale part of the temperature is obtained by the gaussian kernel smoother described in section 2 3 it was computed every 10 days starting in year 98 of the eddy resolving simulation and ending in year 208 a 110 year time series fig 8 shows the time mean sea surface temperature sst from the eddy resolving simulation top left from the deterministic gm simulation top right from the spp gm simulation lower left and from the stochastic gm simulation lower right the deterministic and spp gm schemes provide reasonably accurate predictions for the mean sst while the tuned stochastic gm simulation is badly incorrect the true sst has a steady decrease of sst with latitude with very little zonal variability the stochastic gm simulation has a plume of warm water originating near the southwest corner of the domain and extending north and east up through the center of the domain the mean temperature structure in the spp gm simulation is similarly inaccurate throughout the main thermocline not shown in view of the very poor accuracy of the optimized stochastic gm parameterization that is the primary focus of the investigation there is little point in proceeding to test whether the scheme generates accurate variability or in tuning other parameters of the deterministic and spp gm simulations 5 discussion the ultimate goal of this research is to formulate a gm parameterization that produces an accurate coarse model simulation and there are two routes to achieve this one route not taken here involves tuning the parameterization by running repeated coarse model simulations and comparing the results to known reference data this process is costly because of the infinite number of possible ways to tune the parameterization the other route taken here involves studying the process or quantity that is being parameterized and attempting to build an accurate model thereof this route is based on the assumption that a parameterization that accurately models the true eddy flux divergence should result in an accurate coarse model simulation the primary result of the foregoing section is the fact that a simulation using a stochastic gm parameterization that is configured to match as closely as possible the gm parameter diagnosed from a high resolution reference experiment yields significantly worse results than a basic simulation with a constant value for κ if the underlying assumption is true then the contrapositive must also be true a parameterization that yields an inaccurate coarse model simulation must be an inaccurate model of the true eddy flux divergence the stochastic gm parameterization derived in section 3 must therefore be an inaccurate model of the true eddy flux divergence the converse i e if a parameterization yields an accurate simulation then it must also be an accurate model of the true eddy flux divergence is clearly false since section 2 shows that constant κ gives a less accurate model of the eddy flux divergence while section 4 shows that constant κ yields a more accurate coarse model simulation there are many ways in which the stochastic gm model developed in section 3 might be inaccurate for example as with all spp stochastic parameterizations the modeled variations in κ are independent of the large scale temperature whereas the real variations in κ might depend on the large scale temperature alternatively it might be the case that despite the care taken in developing a model with realistic spatial and temporal variabilty some crucial aspect of the true variability of κ has been missed in the stochastic model of κ but the results of section 2 indicate a more fundamental problem the isotropic gm parameterization with depth independent κ yields a very poor fit to the true eddy flux divergence so that no matter how well the diagnosed κ is represented with a stochastic model it will never be an accurate model of the true eddy flux divergence recall that the optimal κ computed using this configuration reduced the error between the parameterized eddy tracer flux divergence and the true eddy tracer flux divergence by only 30 to 40 as compared to κ 0 see fig 3 it is possible that an anisotropic formulation smith and gent 2004 or a depth dependent κ abernathey et al 2013 might yield a better fit to the flux divergence in particular allowing arbitrary depth dependence would significantly increase the number of degrees of freedom available for fitting the true eddy flux divergence but at a more general level it may be the case that it is simply not possible to model the true eddy flux divergence purely by varying κ or the flux tensor in anisotropic gm in a gm parameterization recall that the advective formulation of the gm parameterization implies that the gm parameterization models the eddy tracer flux divergence as u τ u τ where u τ is the gm advective flux griffies 1998 demonstrated that one can alternatively parameterize the eddy tracer flux divergence by the divergence of skew flux that equals the advective flux u τ plus a non divergent gauge the gm skew flux has the form 10 f skew ψ τ for a standard isotropic configuration of gm the horizontal part of the skew flux of density has the form 11 f skew x κ x ρ f skew y κ y ρ grooms 2016 showed that stochastic gm parameterizations could be built by producing stochastic parameterizations of the skew flux of density denoting a stochastic parameterization of the horizontal density flux by f stoch one can invert eq 10 to obtain the corresponding stochastic parameterization of the gm vector streamfunction 12 ψ stoch y f stoch x z ρ ψ stoch x f stoch y z ρ the stochastic gm model developed in section 3 as well as the spp gm approach of juricke et al 2017 2018 fits within this framework in these parameterizations the stochastic parameterization of the skew flux takes the form of eq 11 with a stochastic κ as shown in section 2 a stochastic gm model of this form does not fit the diagnosed eddy flux divergences well a more successful approach to building a stochastic gm parameterization that accurately models the eddy flux divergence might need to break out of this paradigm of randomizing κ for example one might find more success in both fitting the true eddy flux divergence and in coarse model simulations by using the following more general form for the eddy skew flux of density 13 f stoch x κ x ρ χ x f stoch y κ y ρ χ y where χx and χy are components of a random eddy flux this type of parameterization has both a multiplicative component associated with κ and an additive component associated with the random eddy flux such a parameterization would for example easily generate an eddy flux in regions with small isopycnal slope whereas the multiplicative approach requires large κ to generate eddy fluxes in regions of small isopycnal slopes the additive terms are qualitatively similar to the nonlocal transport term in the kpp parameterization large et al 1994 williams et al 2016 developed an additive stochastic parameterization in the temperature tendency of an ocean gcm the additive terms above would have a similar effect but would guarantee that the parameterization remains adiabatic by remaining within the gm framework the development of the details of such a parameterization is beyond the scope of this article though preliminary strides in that direction were made by grooms 2016 6 conclusions this paper addresses the question of parameterizing the tracer flux divergence associated with unresolved mesoscale eddies in non eddying ocean models we begin by diagnosing the parameter κ in an isotropic gent mcwilliams parameterization gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 by comparing to eddy resolving simulations rather than estimate κ by comparing the diagnosed fluxes to the parameterized fluxes cf eden et al 2007 bachman and fox kemper 2013 we use a least squares approach to fit the parameterized eddy flux divergence to the diagnosed eddy flux divergence cf mak et al 2016 the diagnosed κ displays huge variability with values as large as 30 000 m2 s crucially the optimal value of κ leads to a parameterization that only accounts for less than 50 of the diagnosed eddy flux divergence a stochastic model is developed that carefully models the spatial and temporal structure of the diagnosed κ coarse model simulations are then run using the new stochastic model for κ constant κ and constant κ perturbed by simple stochastic noise the coarse model simulations with constant κ and with the simple stochastic model are far more accurate than simulations with the new stochastic model we argue that the poor agreement of the optimal diagnosed κ with the diagnosed eddy flux divergence explains the failure of the new stochastic model to produce accurate coarse model simulations and suggest that future gm parameterizations might be more successful both in terms of modeling the true eddy flux divergence and in terms of producing realistic coarse model simulations if they include an additive component to the skew flux rather than relying solely on variations in κ of course the κ diagnosed here was constrained to be depth independent and significant improvements might still be obtained by allowing depth dependence or anisotropy smith and gent 2004 abernathey et al 2013 these results demonstrate that accurate coarse model simulations can be produced using parameterizations that are not accurate models of the true eddy flux divergence it may therefore be possible to improve coarse model simulations with a stochastically perturbed gm parameter κ by tuning the structure of the perturbations of κ as in juricke et al 2017 2018 but these improvements to the coarse model simulations will not come as a result of making the modeled eddy flux divergence

24061,rhythmic hydroelastic oscillations of ice shelves are a key mechanism believed to affect several phenomena observed in polar regions such as the disintegration of ice shelves due to ocean wave impact or even the formation of localised distinctive atmospheric waves the fundamental and lower hydroelastic modes of an ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity configuration can be studied by coupling shallow water theory and flexure dynamics of a slender floating cantilever beam a crucial aspect of the analysis is the selection of appropriate boundary conditions at the grounding line of the ice shelf and at the freely floating end the present study aims to determine appropriate and realistic homogeneous boundary conditions for eigenproblems of resonant ice shelf vibrations through the formulation and solution of a wave impact reflection transmission problem frequencies that maximise specific norms of the ice shelf response are identified it is established that homogeneous conditions on the sub ice shelf cavity wave potential value applied at the front of an ice shelf produce eigenfrequencies that in general match the norm maximisation frequencies the methodology is employed for the prediction of characteristic periods of the ross and larsen c ice shelves keywords ice shelf resonances hydroelastic interactions finite elements ross ice shelf larsen c ice shelf 1 introduction the interaction of ocean waves with ice shelves and ice tongues is considered a key mechanism that affects several phenomena observed in polar regions waves from the open ocean propagate towards the ice shelves through the marginal ice zone miz and wave energy eventually reaching the ice shelves could be responsible for catastrophic large scale disintegration events as recently presented and discussed by massom et al 2018 the energy carried by ocean waves also contributes to the breaking of sea ice montiel and squire 2017 inducing greater lateral melt and more vigorous stirring of the upper ocean from air drag and floe motion zhang et al 2015 the feedback between wave induced sea ice breakup and melt in polar regions which is connected with possible increase of wave energy that reaches the ice shelves is demonstrated by roach et al 2018 using images from drifting buoys the above processes could further result in the rise of sea water level coastal erosion and acceleration of global warming effects thomson et al 2017 notably a new satellite mission skim has been proposed by ardhuin et al 2017 for measuring currents ice drift and waves providing enhanced quality data worldwide including arctic and antarctic marginal seas numerous studies on the stability and disintegration of ice shelves focus on vibrations due to the action of sea swell bromirski et al 2010 this type of periodic long wave action can induce intense flexural stress fields inside a floating bulk of ice and might thus lead to the expansion of pre existing rifts bromirski et al 2010 holdsworth 1969 sergienko 2010 squire and williams 2008 vinogradov and holdsworth 1985 the impact of tsunami and infra gravity waves has also been identified as a possible source of iceberg calving and potential ice shelf collapse events bromirski and stephen 2012 bromirski et al 2010 2015 2017 brunt et al 2011 in brunt et al 2011 evidence supports the claim that the calving of the sultzberg ice shelf sis in 2011 is triggered by the tsunami generated by the tohoku earthquake in japan attempts to model the hydroelastic response of ice shelves and ice tongues under long wave excitation have been made by many authors a dynamic finite element model simulating long wave impact on a floating cantilever representing the sis has been presented by papathanasiou et al 2015 vibrations of ice shelves might also be related to the presence of persistent atmospheric waves in the antarctic region these localised atmospheric waves observed at mcmurdo fig 1 have periods ranging between 3 to 10 hours chen et al 2016 the origin of such waves might be attributed to the fundamental and low order modes of the ross ice shelf resonant vibration as discussed by godin and zabotin 2016 insight into the complex phenomena of ice shelf resonant flexural response can be gained from mathematical modelling accounting for the hydroelastic interactions of ice shelves while retaining a simple form of the governing equations the large span of ice shelves and ice tongues along with the non dispersive nature of very long water waves provide a basis for the development of such models indeed several authors have employed these assumptions and developed models based on the kirchhoff approximation for thin plates interacting with long ocean waves e g godin and zabotin 2016 meylan et al 2017 papathanasiou et al 2015 sergienko 2010 2013 2017 an efficient coupled hydroelastic model for the estimation of eigenfrequencies and normal modes of a resonating ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity system was proposed by sergienko 2013 subsequently meylan et al 2017 presented a correction for the complex roots of the characteristic equation in sergienko s model and reported differences between the former results and the outputs of their proposed scheme these differences manifest primarily in the first two eigenfrequencies longer periods and less in higher order modes in both sergienko 2013 and meylan et al 2017 it was assumed that at resonance conditions no mass transport occurs through the vertical interface of the ice shelf and the open sea this assumption leads to zero velocity or equivalently zero velocity potential gradient at the interface on a different front the analysis of harbour resonances is a problem in the core of coastal engineering and bears similarities with the analysis of ice shelf resonant vibration modelling this is because specific boundary conditions have to be applied at the interface between the region of interest ice shelf or harbour and the open sea it is customary in the analysis of harbour resonances to assume that a nodal line exists at the harbour opening this implies that the upper surface elevation or equivalently in shallow water theory the velocity potential is zero on the ficticious line however this condition is only approximate and depending on the geometric characteristics of the harbour the actual nodal line might be located slightly outside the harbour opening see rabinovitch 2009 and the references therein the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of this boundary condition at the interface between the ocean and the ice shelf it is expected that the resulting eigenperiods and eigenmodes will be significantly different than those corresponding to the zero velocity condition no flux furthermore this study aims to determine which boundary condition at the interface zero velocity potential or zero velocity potential gradient is more appropriate in order to do that the problem of ice shelf vibrations due to long wave impact will be analysed from a different perspective in particular the matching boundary conditions imposing continuity for the velocity potential function and its normal derivative will be applied at the interface between the edge of the ice shelf and the open ocean these interface conditions have been used by several authors including papathanasiou et al 2015 godin and zabotin 2016 and ilyas et al 2018 the key concepts of the proposed methodology are a apply general interface conditions instead of boundary conditions at the ice shelf ocean interface and analyse ice shelf vibrations as a reflection transmission problem that is to analyse the magnitude of the reflected wave at the ice shelf front and the response generated by the amount of energy actually entering the ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity region b in this setting identify frequencies characteristic frequencies that maximise certain norms of the response and c compare them with the eigenfrequencies corresponding to different boundary conditions at the sub ice shelf cavity ocean interface the present analysis verifies that the use of the zero velocity potential condition at the front of the ice shelf produces much larger eigenperiods furthermore it indicates that the zero velocity potential condition is more appropriate at least for the fundamental and lower resonant modes as it maximises several norms of the ice shelf response the present paper is structured as follows in section 2 the governing equations of the ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity system are presented subsequently in section 3 the ice shelf hydroelastic vibrations are initially modelled as a wave reflection transmission problem for the solution of the above problem the variational formulation of the governing equations is presented and the hydroelastic finite elements developed in papathanasiou et al 2014 are employed the aim is to predict the characteristic periods dictated by the response of the system and the maximisation of certain response norms next in section 4 the eigenvalue problems corresponding to each of the homogeneous boundary conditions imposed at the open end of the cavity are considered in section 5 the eigenperiods of the numerically solved problems are shown to correspond to either maxima or minima of the reflection transmission problem solution when seen as a function of the forcing wave period several cases of large and smaller ice shelves are analysed including also the coriolis effects of ice shelves in polar regions it is demonstrated that the employment of the zero velocity potential condition at the ice shelf front provides good predictions concerning the characteristic frequencies of the system finally in section 6 the applicability of some simple approximation formulas for the eigenperiods of ice shelves are assessed 2 governing equations the present study focuses on the response of ice shelves to long wave forcing and the possibility of long period resonant vibrations of the ice shelf ice shelf cavity system a schematic representation of the considered configuration is shown in fig 2 to facilitate the analysis monochromatic waves and uniform conditions along the y axis will be considered water waves of large wavelength compared to the depth of the basin can be efficiently modelled using the linearised shallow water equations thus the equations governing the evolution of small amplitude long waves are 1 ζ t b u x b v y 0 2 u t f v g ζ x 0 3 v t f u g ζ y 0 where ζ u v represent the upper surface elevation the horizontal velocity along the x and y axes respectively the bathymetry function is denoted by b while f g denote the coriolis frequency and the acceleration of gravity respectively assuming uniform conditions along the y direction and employing the velocity potential ψ such that u ψ x the three equations reduce to one equation for the velocity potential 4 ψ t t g b ψ x x f 2 ψ 0 the nondimensional variables x x l t t g l ψ g 1 2 l 3 2 ψ are introduced l being the length of the ice shelf using the nondimensional variables and assuming time periodic solutions of the form ψ x e iωt eq 4 can be written after dropping tildes as 5 b ψ x x ω 2 f 2 ψ 0 where the nondimensional angular frequency ω ω l g and the nondimensional coriolis frequency f f l g appear for constant bathymetry b and constant coriolis frequency f the general solution of eq 5 assuming a wave of unit amplitude propagating towards the ice shelf is 6 ψ x exp i ω 2 f 2 b x r exp i ω 2 f 2 b x where r represents the amplitude of the reflected wave by the ice shelf since the incoming wave has amplitude equal to one r coincides with the reflection coefficient of the system see also fig 2 the above equations are applicable only for frequency ω above the cut off frequency f since propagating waves cannot be defined in the water subregion for ω f the model proposed by sergienko 2013 will be used for the hydroelastic vibrations of ice shelves due to the very large span of ice shelves compared to their thickness thin plate models can be employed as a first approximation the density of ice is denoted as ρ i and that of water as ρ w the deflection of the ice shelf coinciding with the water elevation inside the cavity region is denoted as η x e iωt and the velocity potential of the water in the cavity is φ x e iωt using the same nondimensional variables as before the continuity equation for the fluid motion inside the ice shelf cavity is 7 i ω η b m φ x x 0 where b b l and m ρ i h ρ w l h being the ice shelf thickness in the nondimensional setting adopted the ice shelf extends from x 1 to x 0 the transition from land to the ocean that defines the grounding line takes place in a finite region and is not pointwise fricker and padman 2006 this region termed the hinge zone ranges typically from approximately 1 to 10 km for ice shelves with large lengths the transition will be assumed to occur only at point x 1 away from the hinge zone the hydrostatic equilibrium archimedes principle produces a depth reduction equal to the draft of the ice shelf d ρ i h ρ w hence the ice shelf cavity depth in the nondimensional setting becomes b m b l d l the dynamic equation governing the vibrations of the ice shelf reads 8 ω 2 m η k η x x x x η i ω 1 f ω 2 φ 0 and expresses the conservation of linear momentum for the ice shelf the nondimensional flexural rigidity k that appears in eq 8 is defined as k e h 3 12 1 v 2 ρ w g l 4 where e is young modulus and ν poisson s ratio the same equation including the coriolis effect has been derived by sturova 2007 for the study of fluid oscillations in ice covered closed basins the main aim of this work is to determine appropriate simplified conditions at the ice shelf cavity open sea interface able to provide good prediction of the resonant frequencies as a first step results are presented and discussed without the effect of the coriolis acceleration and thus f 0 will be considered in the first part of the present analysis in this specific case the above eqs 7 and 8 reduce to the ones already employed for studying ice shelf vibrations by sergienko 2013 and meylan et al 2017 however the inclusion of coriolis effects in the model is expected to produce signifficant changes of the ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity system eigenperiods especially near the polar regions see godin and zabotin 2016 section 5 this effect will be further illustrated in sections 5 2 and 5 3 for specific sites in the antarctic following the works of sergienko 2013 and meylan et al 2017 the ice shelf will be assumed to be clamped at one edge furthermore the bedrock below the ice shelf at x 1 will be assumed impregnable and thus the velocity of the fluid motion will be set to zero at this point it is thus 9 η 0 η x 0 and φ x 0 at x 1 at the free end of the ice shelf no bending moment and no shear force conditions imply that 10 η xx 0 and η xxx 0 at x 0 it remains to define conditions for the flow velocity at x 0 in the most general setting interface conditions expressing conservation of mass and momentum should be applied for the shallow water model adopted these can be written as 11 φ ψ and b m φ x b ψ x at x 0 the above interface conditions are compatible with the formulation of a reflection transmission problem and will be considered in the following section however the problem of resonant vibrations can be formulated as an eigenvalue problem as well in that case one of the two following conditions needs to be applied instead of eq 11 i the dirichlet condition φ 0 0 or ii the neumann condition φ x 0 these conditions will be considered in section 4 remark 1 it is evident that at x 1 a fully reflective boundary is assumed in more realistic situations a part of the hydroelastic wave from the ice shelf cavity region is expected to be transmitted as a purely flexural wave considering the ice shelf soil as a beam on an elastic foundation however the stiffness of the soil is typically very large and the transmitted flexural wave is expected to be of low amplitude remark 2 the present ideal hydroelastic model is based on the shallow water equations eqs 1 3 in the presence of an elastic floating plate as a termination upper boundary extensions of the present model could be considered by coupling it with atmospheric baroclinic model in the upper half space in conjunction with matching conditions at the floating plate with application to the study of resonant vibrations of large ice shelves and the induced atmospheric perturbations the latter are shown to be important especially concerning the fundamental and low order resonances of large ice shelves by godin and zabotin 2016 also the present system does not account for damping due to dissipation macayeal et al 2015 these effects in modelling real inhomogeneous ice shelves will be studied in future work 3 ice shelf response as a reflection transmission problem in this section the resonant vibrations of an ice shelf under the action of long ocean waves will be studied as a reflection transmission problem fig 2 a wave field of the form 6 will be assumed at the open sea region and interface conditions expressing the conservation of mass and momentum will be applied at the interface with the floating ice shelf in that manner the flexural vibrations of the ice shelf will be studied as a function of the impacting wave characteristics the solution will be pursued through the discretisation of the variational form of the problem using high order finite elements the variational form for the above system eqs 7 8 with the coriolis effect is 12 ω 2 1 0 m x v η dx 1 0 k x v xx η xx dx v k x η xx x 1 0 v x k x η

conserved in this model the above result is examined as a possible indicator of the resonant frequencies of the considered hydroelastic system it will be shown in the examples presented in section 5 that the π ω zero values agree well with the eigenfrequencies of the ice shelf ice shelf cavity configuration calculated by using two different types of simplified homogeneous boundary conditions at the cavity ocean basin interface namely φ 0 0 or φ x x 0 0 furthermore it will be demonstrated that the former dirichlet condition provides reasonable predictions of the characteristic periods of the system the hydroelastic finite element helfem 4 5 is employed for the solution of the resulting reflection transmission variational problem papathanasiou et al 2014 based on the increased degree of interpolation of the above element the convergence properties of the present numerical scheme are very good denoting by hk 1 0 c the space of complex functions with lebesgue square integrable kth

the resonant vibrations of an ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity system as an eigenvalue problem homogeneous conditions at the water interface between the open ocean and the ice shelf cavity are applied i e φ 0 0 or φ x 0 0 using the latter dirichlet or neumann conditions in eqs 11 and 6 it is 24 ψ 0 r 1 0 r 1 or 25 ψ x x 0 i ω 2 f 2 b 0 1 r r 1 condition 25 is the one employed by sergienko 2013 and meylan et al 2017 for the study of normal modes of ice shelves sergienko 2013 justifies this selection based on the argument that no mass exchange must occur between the water in the cavity and the open ocean during the resonant vibrations of the ice shelf note that in both cases r 1 and r 1 it is 26 k η x x l 2 2 η l 2 2 ω 2 m η l 2 2 1 f ω 2 b m u l 2 2 2 ω 1 f ω 2 3 2 b 0 im r 0 the objective of this section is to formulate both eigenvalue problems in order to compare the eigenperiods with the characteristic periods obtained by the response of the ice shelf when the more realistic interface conditions are applied the solution of the eigenvalue problems corresponding to conditions 24 or 25 can be performed analytically or obtained numerically by means of the finite element method the advantage of finite elements is that it can handle problems with variable seabed topography or ice shelf thickness as well remark in the examined shallow water hydroelastic case contrary to the case of a shallow basin without ice cover the condition φ 0 0 does not imply that the elevation ice shelf deflection is zero at this point it is noted that when r 1 we have 27 u 0 b 0 b 0 m 0 ψ x x 0 2 i b 0 b 0 m 0 ω 2 f 2 this velocity corresponds to the maximum amplitude out charge towards the water region or in charge towards the hydroelastic region flow values attained 5 numerical results and applications several cases will be presented and discussed in this section first two illustrative examples will be considered for an ice shelf of relatively large length 150 km and shorter one with length 50 km in both cases the depth of the oceanic basin at the free end of the ice shelf is b 500 m while the ice shelf thickness is h 300 m the ice water density ratio is ρ i ρ w 0 9 and the young s modulus of ice is taken as e 11 gpa this value is used by meylan et al 2017 and is close to the range 8 10 gpa which schulson and duval 2009 predicted by lab experiments it should be noted that smaller values of young s modulus 1 gpa have been also used by several authors e g vaughan 1995 a more detailed discussion regarding young s modulus values for ice shelves can be found in lescarmontier et al 2012 and lee et al 2018 in all cases it is expected that young s modulus values will not affect the hydroelastic response of large ice shelves significantly at least when the fundamental and lower modes are considered godin and zabotin 2016 the response of the ice shelf will be evaluated using the potential energy norm 28 η e η l 2 2 k η x x l 2 2 1 2 and the chebyshev maximum type norm 29 η c 0 k η x x c 0 where q c 0 max x 1 0 q the norm in eq 28 represents the potential energy of the ice shelf in particular the second term is the strain energy the norm in eq 29 combines the maximum value of the deflection and the maximum value of the bending moment in the non dimensional setting these two norms will be calculated using the solution of the reflection transmission problem and will be plotted against the period of the impacting waves along with these two norms the eigenperiods of the ice shelf cavity system td as predicted using the dirichlet condition φ x 0 0 and tn as predicted using the homogeneous neumann condition φ x x 0 0 will be plotted the objective is to examine whether td or tn better predict the local maxima of the ice shelf response especially as the principal low order modes are concerned since we are interested in long wave forcing only the first 20 characteristic periods will be examined at this stage in all cases 500 hydroelastic elements were used and convergence for the first 100 modes for meshes with more than 300 has been verified using extensive numerical experiments next the effects of main geometrical parameters on the first two characteristic periods will be examined and the predictive capability of simplified dirichlet boundary conditions at the ice water interface will be demonstrated finally the present model will be applied to the cases of simplified models of the ross and larsen c ice shelves examining also the effect of coriolis frequency on the resonant frequencies for these antarctic regions 5 1 illustrative examples a ice shelf with length l 150 km a relatively large ice shelf of length l 150 km is examined first the ice shelf response along with the td and tn eigenperiods are plotted in fig 3 as a function of the wave forcing period the thick blue line corresponds to the ice shelf potential energy norm and the thick red line corresponds to norm defined by eq 29 the eigenperiods td are depicted using thick continuous vertical lines and the eigenperiods tn using thin dashed vertical lines this is expected since the energy flow to the ice shelf cavity system has been found to be proportional to ω im r the latter is proportional to the frequency of the impacting wave and also contains the oscillatory term 1 im r 1 which creates several local maxima and minima in the response indicators for higher frequency the energy norm exhibits a more regular behaviour than chebyshev maximum type norm examining the relation between the eigenperiods of the system and the response quantified by the potential energy norm it is evident that td values correspond to local maxima locations of the response while tn values correspond to locations of local minima this interesting observation holds for the first eigenperiods and is verified by the response in the maximum type norm as well the approximation of the first local maximum by td zoom box in fig 3 is not as accurate as that corresponding to the following peaks of the response still the td value provides a considerably better approximation than tn in the case of the maximum type norm red line the response pattern becomes more irregular for periods less than approximately 20 min indicated by a vertical arrow in fig 3 for higher modes tn values coincide with localised maxima of small amplitude but again the highest local peaks are determined by eigenperiods calculated using the dirichlet condition φ 0 in fig 4 the real and imaginary part of the reflection coefficient as computed using the finite element method is depicted the results shown verify that eigenperiods td vertical solid black lines are characterised by re r 1 and eigenperiods tn vertical dashed black lines correspond to re r 1 in both cases td and tn it is im r 0 the π t term defined in eq 19 is plotted in fig 4 c as a function of the period of the incoming waves the eigenperiods td and tn are plotted again as vertical lines the horizontal axis is in logarithmic scale the local minima corresponding to zero values of this quantity predict all the eigenperiods whether homogeneous dirichlet or neumann conditions are employed this is compatible with the fact that at these periods it is im r 0 and no energy enters or leaves the ice shelf region according to the energy balance in eq 18 finally the response of the ice shelf as predicted by the reflection transmission model for forcing periods corresponding to the first three predictions of dirichlet and neumann models is shown in fig 5 the left column presents the real part and the right column the imaginary part of the normalised upper surface elevation η η max t η t c 0 where the maximum in the denominator is taken over the range of periods examined as expected the response becomes more oscillatory as the period of the incoming waves drops the interesting observation is that when the forcing corresponds to a td eigenperiod the amplitude of the real part is several orders of magnitude larger than the amplitude of the imaginary part conversely when the forcing corresponds to tn eigenperiods the situation is reversed and it is the amplitude of the imaginary part that is several orders of magnitude larger a ice shelf with length l 50 km in this example a smaller ice shelf with length l 50 km is studied fig 6 depicts the response of this ice shelf using the same quantities and definitions as before the spectrum of the shorter ice shelf is of course shifted to lower periods again in the case of the shorter ice shelf the td values correlate better that tn with the local maxima of the ice shelf response however this good correlation is only observed for the first 10 eigenperiods when the potential energy norm is considered the deviation between the td values and the peaks of the maximum type norm occurs after the sixth eigenperiod for larger eigenperiods the tn eigenvalues appear to correspond to local minima locations of the potential energy norm it can thus be stated that the use of the dirichlet condition φ 0 at the free end is preferable it is furthermore interesting to note that for small period values the td values approximate again better the norm peaks however in these shorter wavelengths the gaps defined by the succession of td and tn values become narrower and both eigenvalue models are ultimately expected to provide good approximation provided that the long wave assumption still holds again the approximation of the first local maximum by td zoom box in fig 6 is not as accurate as that corresponding to the following peaks of the response still it provides a much better prediction of the first peak in the potential norm response than the first tn eigenperiod fig 7 depicts the real and imaginary part of the reflection coefficient as computed using the finite element method the π t term defined in eq 19 is plotted in fig 4 c as a function of the period of the incoming waves again the minimisation of this quantity holds for both td and tn eigenperiods where the value attained is zero according the prediction of eq 18 finally the theoretical prediction that td values correspond to re r 1 and tn values correspond to re r 1 while in both cases it is im r 0 is verified by the numerical results for the reflection coefficient shown in fig 7 the deflection of the ice shelf as predicted by the reflection transmission model for forcing periods corresponding to the first three predictions of dirichlet and neumann models is shown in fig 8 again the real part left column and the imaginary part right column of the normalised upper surface elevation η η max t η t c 0 is plotted similarly to the case l 150 km when the forcing corresponds to a td eigenperiod the amplitude of the real part is several orders of magnitude larger than the amplitude of the imaginary part conversely when the forcing corresponds to tn eigenperiods the situation is reversed and it is the amplitude of the imaginary part that is several orders of magnitude larger 5 2 systematic investigation of the main geometrical parameters in fig 9 results from systematic investigation are presented in order to illustrate the effects of main geometrical parameters as the ice shelf length its thickness and the water depth on the predicted eigensolution in the case of an ice shelf water system in particular contour plots of the first and second characteristic periods are shown in non dimensional form 10 3 t 1 2 l g with respect to ice shelf length over water depth l b ranging from 50 to 500 and thickness ratio h b taking values from 0 1 to 0 6 respectively for calculations the ice water density ratio considered is ρ i ρ w 0 9 and the young s modulus of ice is e 11 gpa while the water depth is set to 500 m results obtained by the maximization of the considered norms are shown by solid lines while predictions based on the application of dirichlet boundary condition are plotted by using dashed lines in general dirichlet boundary conditions are capable of providing quite reasonable predictions of the most important first two characteristic periods differences reaching 10 15 with the values obtained by the maximization of responses by the considered norms are observed especially as the ice shelf thickness and length substantially increase also we note that as the mode index increases the observed differences become smaller finally the dependence of the characteristic periods derived from maximum responses on the examined parameters is clearly more complex than the corresponding dirichlet eigenperiods this feature could be due to effects associated with the specific norms used eqs 28 and 29 and is left to be more thoroughly investigated in future work 5 3 a model for the ross ice shelf the response of an ice shelf with length l 550 km and thickness h 300 m will be studied these values have also been used by godin and zabotin 2016 to analyse the eigenperiods of the ross ice shelf the bathymetric profile described by fretwell et al 2013 and also depicted in brominski et al 2015 for a cross section of the ice shelf water cavity geometry along a transect approximately orthogonal to the ross ice shelf front will be used in particular the depth profile will be set to 30 b x 700 10000 x l 2 1 x l 6 m which yields a reasonable approximation of the variable seabed topography a satellite image of the ross ice shelf is shown in fig 10 a with the considered cross section denoted by a thick green line fig 10 b shows the basic geometry and seabed topography characteristics of the model a more sophisticated model of the ross ice shelf has been recently presented by sergienko 2017 the ice shelf response in the potential energy and maximum type norm is shown in fig 11 the first 20 eigenperiods td and tn are also plotted again the local maxima of the response coincide with the eigenperiods td the largest eigenperiod t d1 9 60 hours is approximately twice the corresponding one t n1 4 99 hours the value t d1 9 60 hours is very close to the value 9 8 hours obtained by godin and zabotin 2016 in the latter work it is pointed out that this resonance value is very close to the largest period of the persistent atmospheric waves observed in the ross ice shelf region 10 hours and the very interesting theory that the two phenomena could be interrelated is proposed in their analysis godin and zabotin 2016 used a constant bathymetry profile in order to derive a homogenised environment for the present hydroelastic analysis the mean depth 31 1 0 700 10000 x 6 1 x 2 d x 660 32 m will be considered keeping all other parameters the same and solving for the constant depth bm 660 m the response depicted in fig 12 occurs in this case the first observed characteristic periods indicated by the maxima of the norms eqs 28 and 29 are approximately 8 00 3 05 1 92 hours it is observed that the relative difference between the eigenperiods predicted by the variable bathymetry and constant bathymetry based on the mean depth is small regarding the first 50 modes the relative difference between the two models is always less than 2 5 with the largest deviations appearing in the first two modes based on the above results the approximate use of an averaged depth in cases characterised by mild seabed variations is expected to provide reasonably good approximations next in fig 13 the coriolis effect on the calculated characteristic periods is presented for the above constant depth idealized model of the ross ice shelf we consider a mean value of coriolis frequency which at latitude 80 deg south is estimated to be 1 432 10 4 r a d sec corresponding to 12 2 hours the changes are substantial and the first three resonant characteristic periods corresponding to the peaks of the norms in fig 12 are approximately 6 60 3 00 and 1 90 hours respectively moreover it is observed that the homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions are able to provide reasonable predictions concluding this section it is interesting to note that when the coriolis acceleration is included the present model is able to provide reasonable predictions above the cut off frequency also for large domains the present fem model supports the study of additional effects due to spatial variability of the coriolis frequency and this is left to be presented in future work 5 4 a model for the larsen c ice shelf the response of an ice shelf with length l 200 km and thickness h 300 m will studied in this section the uniform depth is set to b 500 m this particular set of values are chosen to represent in the mean the characteristics of the larsen c ice shelf along the transect depicted in fig 14 a by the green line griggs and bamber 2009 the ice shelf density for this case is ρ i 917 kg m 3 and the water density ρ w 1027 kg m 3 as before the value for young s modulus is set to e 11 gpa fig 14 a is a satellite image of the larsen c ice shelf where the cross section considered is shown approximately with a solid green line the geometric characteristics of the adopted model namely average thickness and seabed topography are shown in fig 14 b the response of the present model used for the simulation of larsen c hydroelastic resonant behaviour without coriolis effects is illustrated in fig 15 the potential energy norm and maximum type norm curves are quite similar to those corresponding to the ice shelf with length 150 km as the bathymetric and thickness profile are the same in both cases and the span is comparable the first 3 characteristic periods identified by the maxima of the norms defined by eqs 28 and 29 are approximately 3 90 1 51 0 91 hours respectively the first td eigenperiods using the zero velocity potential condition at the cavity below the ice shelf front are again found in very good match with the local maxima of the potential and maximum type norms of the cantilever response the fundamental eigenperiod is now t d1 4 61 hours while the second eigenperiod is calculated at t d2 1 54 hours these values are slightly less than half of the respective values of the ross ice shelf model finally for the above model of the larsen c ice shelf the coriolis effect on the characteristic periods is presented in fig 16 we consider a mean value of coriolis frequency which at a mean latitude 67 5 deg south is estimated to be 1 344 10 4 r a d sec corresponding to approximately 13 hours in this case the first three resonant periods which can be observed now by the present model are approximately 3 60 1 51 0 91 hours respectively the changes are smaller than the ones observed in the case of the ross ice shelve model which is justified by the smaller value of latitude of the larsen c ice shelve model similarly as before the dirichlet boundary conditions are able to provide quite reasonable predictions 6 approximate prediction of eigenperiods simple formulas for the approximation of the hydroelastic eigenperiods can be derived in homogeneous environments if the cavity basin without the ice shelf is considered or if the ice shelf is modelled as a simple cantilever euler bernoulli beam vibrating in vacuum see fig 17 in fact using eqs 7 and 8 it is observed that for small ω and small values of k that are typical for ice shelves the above system reduces to shallow water equations in the case of the cavity basin an appropriate depth reduction can be applied to take into account the ice shelf draft as shown in fig 14 on the other hand for larger values of ω and thus highly oscillatory responses kη xx xx also becomes significant and the above system reduces to the thin plate model in both cases the effects of the grounding line are assumed to be localised in the sense that the hinge zone is considered very small compared to the length of the ice shelf and can therefore be ignored the same simplification has been applied to the hydroelastic model as well considering the eigenanalysis of the cavity basin a problem in the linearised shallow water theory occurs the velocity at the grounding line and the velocity potential at the basin front are set to zero resulting in the nondimensional setting in the formula 32 ω a n π n 1 2 b m n 0 1 2 which by incorporating the coriolis effect results in the form ω c n ω α n 2 f 2 in conformity with godin and zabotin 2016 eq 41 hence using the dirichlet condition φ 0 at the ice shelf cavity ocean interface the eigenperiods can be approximated as follows approximation using cavity basin eigenanalysis 33 t n a 1 1800 n 1 2 2 1 ρ i ρ w h b f 2 l 2 gb l gb hrs it is noted here that the above equation contains the effect of reduced water depth under the ice shelf as it accounts for its draft the latter however being dependent on the ice mass distribution includes the inertia characteristics of the ice shelf it will be demonstrated in the sequel that the above formula produces reasonably accurate results that are close to those of the full hydroelastic model particularly for ice shelves of large length the effectiveness of formula 33 is first assessed with respect to its capability to reproduce the characteristic periods occurring from the potential energy norm maximisation compared to the predictions td in particular in fig 18 the characteristic periods of the ross ice shelf first row and the larsen c ice shelf second row are plotted against the eigenperiods obtained by eq 33 and those predicted using the dirichlet condition on the wave potential φ 0 namely td the t n a eigenperiods are denoted by circles and the td eigenperiods using crosses the results of the right column include the coriolis effect in all cases the 15 first characteristic periods and eigenperiods are shown if the eigenanalysis models were capable of exactly reproducing the characteristic frequencies all the results would lie on the principal diagonal this is the case for periods larger than the second characteristic one the predictions of formula 33 are excellent for the second characteristic period as well the accuracy deteriorates when the fundamental eigenperiod is considered however the accuracy of eq 33 is still comparable to that of the hydroelastic eigenperiods td using now the eigenperiods of a cantilever beam the following result is obtained approximation using cantilever beam eigenanalysis 34 t n b π l 2 1800 β n 2 h 12 1 v 2 ρ i e hrs where β n are the roots of the transcendental equation 1 cos β n cosh β n 0 a comparison of formulae 33 and 34 with the hydroelastic eigenperiods td for the examples analysed in section 5 1 and the ross and larsen c ice shelves without the coriolis effect is shown in fig 19 both axes are in logarithmic scale it is observed that the free basin approximation t n a is very robust for the fundamental and lower modes as the mode number increases the quality of this approximation deteriorates this is more evident in the case of smaller length ice shelves while for very large ones the free basin approximation is very good even for higher modes a total of 100 modes are examined in fig 19 as the number of modes increases and the length of the ice shelf decreases the hydroelastic eigenperiods are better approximated by those of the euler bernoulli beam namely t n b asymptotically as n it is t n a 1 n and t n b 1 n 2 notably for all examined ice shelf lengths there was a set of modes for which neither model was proven accurate this stresses the importance of employing hydroelastic eigenanalysis for the study of the resonant response of ice shelves in all cases caution is needed to ensure that the assumptions of shallow water theory remain valid for the eigenstates corresponding to large mode numbers since the free basin approximation of the eigenperiods yields quite accurate results for the fundamental and lower order modes it is worthwhile investigating this approximation further fig 20 shows the relative difference of the basin eigenperiods t n a and the hydroelastic eigenperiods td tn as a function of the mode number for different ice shelf lengths and different thickness to depth ratios the cases l 25 50 150 300 km are examined the coriolis effect is not included in this specific comparison it is observed that the quality of the approximation deteriorates as the length of the ice shelf decreases and the thickness to depth ratio h b increases 7 conclusions in the present work the resonant hydroelastic vibrations of an ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity configuration are studied by employing shallow water theory in conjunction with a thin plate model the hydroelastic problem is formulated and solved as a wave reflection transmission one using higher order fe that enable a fast and accurate computation of characteristic periods the latter are considered as the forcing periods that maximise specific norms of the ice shelf response the above numerical results are compared to solutions derived using specific homogeneous boundary conditions for eigenproblems of resonant ice shelf vibrations we establish that appropriate homogeneous conditions on the wave potential applied at the ice shelf front produce eigenfrequencies that in general agree well with the norm maximisation frequencies also in the low frequency regime subsequently the present methodology is applied to the prediction of characteristic periods of the ross and larsen c ice shelves providing eigenperiods in agreement with previously derived results by godin and zabotin 2016 the following key observations summarise the basic findings i the resonant behaviour of ice shelves when the interaction with the surrounding ocean wave field is taken into account is dominated by characteristic periods that maximise specific norms of the ice shelf oscillatory response ii a homogeneous dirichlet condition for the wave potential at the ice shelf front was found to be the more accurate for hydroelastic eigenproblems this result could be very significant when more elaborate 2d horizontal models for ice shelves of complex geophysical characteristics are considered in this case the reflection transmission problem is very computationally demanding and the use of a homogeneous boundary condition at the ice shelf front significantly facilitates the numerical solution and analysis iii approximate formulas for the hydroelastic eigenproblem of either a basin without the ice cover or only the ice shelf modelled as an elastic cantilever work well at different frequency bands at small frequencies the basin approximation is better especially when large ice shelves are considered of particular interest is the possibility to employ shallow water models already used for harbours and semi enclosed basins in the study of ice shelves by ignoring the ice cover as a first approximation the present work suggests that this could be a reasonable approach for the estimation of the fundamental and lower order modes and will be exploited in future studies focusing on the eigenanalysis of realistic ice shelf configurations finally the coriolis acceleration could have important effects concerning the resonant modes of ice shelves in polar regions in particular the present model is shown to provide useful information for frequencies higher than the coriolis frequency and that the use of homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition at the ice shelf front is still able to provide good predictions 
24061,rhythmic hydroelastic oscillations of ice shelves are a key mechanism believed to affect several phenomena observed in polar regions such as the disintegration of ice shelves due to ocean wave impact or even the formation of localised distinctive atmospheric waves the fundamental and lower hydroelastic modes of an ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity configuration can be studied by coupling shallow water theory and flexure dynamics of a slender floating cantilever beam a crucial aspect of the analysis is the selection of appropriate boundary conditions at the grounding line of the ice shelf and at the freely floating end the present study aims to determine appropriate and realistic homogeneous boundary conditions for eigenproblems of resonant ice shelf vibrations through the formulation and solution of a wave impact reflection transmission problem frequencies that maximise specific norms of the ice shelf response are identified it is established that homogeneous conditions on the sub ice shelf cavity wave potential value applied at the front of an ice shelf produce eigenfrequencies that in general match the norm maximisation frequencies the methodology is employed for the prediction of characteristic periods of the ross and larsen c ice shelves keywords ice shelf resonances hydroelastic interactions finite elements ross ice shelf larsen c ice shelf 1 introduction the interaction of ocean waves with ice shelves and ice tongues is considered a key mechanism that affects several phenomena observed in polar regions waves from the open ocean propagate towards the ice shelves through the marginal ice zone miz and wave energy eventually reaching the ice shelves could be responsible for catastrophic large scale disintegration events as recently presented and discussed by massom et al 2018 the energy carried by ocean waves also contributes to the breaking of sea ice montiel and squire 2017 inducing greater lateral melt and more vigorous stirring of the upper ocean from air drag and floe motion zhang et al 2015 the feedback between wave induced sea ice breakup and melt in polar regions which is connected with possible increase of wave energy that reaches the ice shelves is demonstrated by roach et al 2018 using images from drifting buoys the above processes could further result in the rise of sea water level coastal erosion and acceleration of global warming effects thomson et al 2017 notably a new satellite mission skim has been proposed by ardhuin et al 2017 for measuring currents ice drift and waves providing enhanced quality data worldwide including arctic and antarctic marginal seas numerous studies on the stability and disintegration of ice shelves focus on vibrations due to the action of sea swell bromirski et al 2010 this type of periodic long wave action can induce intense flexural stress fields inside a floating bulk of ice and might thus lead to the expansion of pre existing rifts bromirski et al 2010 holdsworth 1969 sergienko 2010 squire and williams 2008 vinogradov and holdsworth 1985 the impact of tsunami and infra gravity waves has also been identified as a possible source of iceberg calving and potential ice shelf collapse events bromirski and stephen 2012 bromirski et al 2010 2015 2017 brunt et al 2011 in brunt et al 2011 evidence supports the claim that the calving of the sultzberg ice shelf sis in 2011 is triggered by the tsunami generated by the tohoku earthquake in japan attempts to model the hydroelastic response of ice shelves and ice tongues under long wave excitation have been made by many authors a dynamic finite element model simulating long wave impact on a floating cantilever representing the sis has been presented by papathanasiou et al 2015 vibrations of ice shelves might also be related to the presence of persistent atmospheric waves in the antarctic region these localised atmospheric waves observed at mcmurdo fig 1 have periods ranging between 3 to 10 hours chen et al 2016 the origin of such waves might be attributed to the fundamental and low order modes of the ross ice shelf resonant vibration as discussed by godin and zabotin 2016 insight into the complex phenomena of ice shelf resonant flexural response can be gained from mathematical modelling accounting for the hydroelastic interactions of ice shelves while retaining a simple form of the governing equations the large span of ice shelves and ice tongues along with the non dispersive nature of very long water waves provide a basis for the development of such models indeed several authors have employed these assumptions and developed models based on the kirchhoff approximation for thin plates interacting with long ocean waves e g godin and zabotin 2016 meylan et al 2017 papathanasiou et al 2015 sergienko 2010 2013 2017 an efficient coupled hydroelastic model for the estimation of eigenfrequencies and normal modes of a resonating ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity system was proposed by sergienko 2013 subsequently meylan et al 2017 presented a correction for the complex roots of the characteristic equation in sergienko s model and reported differences between the former results and the outputs of their proposed scheme these differences manifest primarily in the first two eigenfrequencies longer periods and less in higher order modes in both sergienko 2013 and meylan et al 2017 it was assumed that at resonance conditions no mass transport occurs through the vertical interface of the ice shelf and the open sea this assumption leads to zero velocity or equivalently zero velocity potential gradient at the interface on a different front the analysis of harbour resonances is a problem in the core of coastal engineering and bears similarities with the analysis of ice shelf resonant vibration modelling this is because specific boundary conditions have to be applied at the interface between the region of interest ice shelf or harbour and the open sea it is customary in the analysis of harbour resonances to assume that a nodal line exists at the harbour opening this implies that the upper surface elevation or equivalently in shallow water theory the velocity potential is zero on the ficticious line however this condition is only approximate and depending on the geometric characteristics of the harbour the actual nodal line might be located slightly outside the harbour opening see rabinovitch 2009 and the references therein the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of this boundary condition at the interface between the ocean and the ice shelf it is expected that the resulting eigenperiods and eigenmodes will be significantly different than those corresponding to the zero velocity condition no flux furthermore this study aims to determine which boundary condition at the interface zero velocity potential or zero velocity potential gradient is more appropriate in order to do that the problem of ice shelf vibrations due to long wave impact will be analysed from a different perspective in particular the matching boundary conditions imposing continuity for the velocity potential function and its normal derivative will be applied at the interface between the edge of the ice shelf and the open ocean these interface conditions have been used by several authors including papathanasiou et al 2015 godin and zabotin 2016 and ilyas et al 2018 the key concepts of the proposed methodology are a apply general interface conditions instead of boundary conditions at the ice shelf ocean interface and analyse ice shelf vibrations as a reflection transmission problem that is to analyse the magnitude of the reflected wave at the ice shelf front and the response generated by the amount of energy actually entering the ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity region b in this setting identify frequencies characteristic frequencies that maximise certain norms of the response and c compare them with the eigenfrequencies corresponding to different boundary conditions at the sub ice shelf cavity ocean interface the present analysis verifies that the use of the zero velocity potential condition at the front of the ice shelf produces much larger eigenperiods furthermore it indicates that the zero velocity potential condition is more appropriate at least for the fundamental and lower resonant modes as it maximises several norms of the ice shelf response the present paper is structured as follows in section 2 the governing equations of the ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity system are presented subsequently in section 3 the ice shelf hydroelastic vibrations are initially modelled as a wave reflection transmission problem for the solution of the above problem the variational formulation of the governing equations is presented and the hydroelastic finite elements developed in papathanasiou et al 2014 are employed the aim is to predict the characteristic periods dictated by the response of the system and the maximisation of certain response norms next in section 4 the eigenvalue problems corresponding to each of the homogeneous boundary conditions imposed at the open end of the cavity are considered in section 5 the eigenperiods of the numerically solved problems are shown to correspond to either maxima or minima of the reflection transmission problem solution when seen as a function of the forcing wave period several cases of large and smaller ice shelves are analysed including also the coriolis effects of ice shelves in polar regions it is demonstrated that the employment of the zero velocity potential condition at the ice shelf front provides good predictions concerning the characteristic frequencies of the system finally in section 6 the applicability of some simple approximation formulas for the eigenperiods of ice shelves are assessed 2 governing equations the present study focuses on the response of ice shelves to long wave forcing and the possibility of long period resonant vibrations of the ice shelf ice shelf cavity system a schematic representation of the considered configuration is shown in fig 2 to facilitate the analysis monochromatic waves and uniform conditions along the y axis will be considered water waves of large wavelength compared to the depth of the basin can be efficiently modelled using the linearised shallow water equations thus the equations governing the evolution of small amplitude long waves are 1 ζ t b u x b v y 0 2 u t f v g ζ x 0 3 v t f u g ζ y 0 where ζ u v represent the upper surface elevation the horizontal velocity along the x and y axes respectively the bathymetry function is denoted by b while f g denote the coriolis frequency and the acceleration of gravity respectively assuming uniform conditions along the y direction and employing the velocity potential ψ such that u ψ x the three equations reduce to one equation for the velocity potential 4 ψ t t g b ψ x x f 2 ψ 0 the nondimensional variables x x l t t g l ψ g 1 2 l 3 2 ψ are introduced l being the length of the ice shelf using the nondimensional variables and assuming time periodic solutions of the form ψ x e iωt eq 4 can be written after dropping tildes as 5 b ψ x x ω 2 f 2 ψ 0 where the nondimensional angular frequency ω ω l g and the nondimensional coriolis frequency f f l g appear for constant bathymetry b and constant coriolis frequency f the general solution of eq 5 assuming a wave of unit amplitude propagating towards the ice shelf is 6 ψ x exp i ω 2 f 2 b x r exp i ω 2 f 2 b x where r represents the amplitude of the reflected wave by the ice shelf since the incoming wave has amplitude equal to one r coincides with the reflection coefficient of the system see also fig 2 the above equations are applicable only for frequency ω above the cut off frequency f since propagating waves cannot be defined in the water subregion for ω f the model proposed by sergienko 2013 will be used for the hydroelastic vibrations of ice shelves due to the very large span of ice shelves compared to their thickness thin plate models can be employed as a first approximation the density of ice is denoted as ρ i and that of water as ρ w the deflection of the ice shelf coinciding with the water elevation inside the cavity region is denoted as η x e iωt and the velocity potential of the water in the cavity is φ x e iωt using the same nondimensional variables as before the continuity equation for the fluid motion inside the ice shelf cavity is 7 i ω η b m φ x x 0 where b b l and m ρ i h ρ w l h being the ice shelf thickness in the nondimensional setting adopted the ice shelf extends from x 1 to x 0 the transition from land to the ocean that defines the grounding line takes place in a finite region and is not pointwise fricker and padman 2006 this region termed the hinge zone ranges typically from approximately 1 to 10 km for ice shelves with large lengths the transition will be assumed to occur only at point x 1 away from the hinge zone the hydrostatic equilibrium archimedes principle produces a depth reduction equal to the draft of the ice shelf d ρ i h ρ w hence the ice shelf cavity depth in the nondimensional setting becomes b m b l d l the dynamic equation governing the vibrations of the ice shelf reads 8 ω 2 m η k η x x x x η i ω 1 f ω 2 φ 0 and expresses the conservation of linear momentum for the ice shelf the nondimensional flexural rigidity k that appears in eq 8 is defined as k e h 3 12 1 v 2 ρ w g l 4 where e is young modulus and ν poisson s ratio the same equation including the coriolis effect has been derived by sturova 2007 for the study of fluid oscillations in ice covered closed basins the main aim of this work is to determine appropriate simplified conditions at the ice shelf cavity open sea interface able to provide good prediction of the resonant frequencies as a first step results are presented and discussed without the effect of the coriolis acceleration and thus f 0 will be considered in the first part of the present analysis in this specific case the above eqs 7 and 8 reduce to the ones already employed for studying ice shelf vibrations by sergienko 2013 and meylan et al 2017 however the inclusion of coriolis effects in the model is expected to produce signifficant changes of the ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity system eigenperiods especially near the polar regions see godin and zabotin 2016 section 5 this effect will be further illustrated in sections 5 2 and 5 3 for specific sites in the antarctic following the works of sergienko 2013 and meylan et al 2017 the ice shelf will be assumed to be clamped at one edge furthermore the bedrock below the ice shelf at x 1 will be assumed impregnable and thus the velocity of the fluid motion will be set to zero at this point it is thus 9 η 0 η x 0 and φ x 0 at x 1 at the free end of the ice shelf no bending moment and no shear force conditions imply that 10 η xx 0 and η xxx 0 at x 0 it remains to define conditions for the flow velocity at x 0 in the most general setting interface conditions expressing conservation of mass and momentum should be applied for the shallow water model adopted these can be written as 11 φ ψ and b m φ x b ψ x at x 0 the above interface conditions are compatible with the formulation of a reflection transmission problem and will be considered in the following section however the problem of resonant vibrations can be formulated as an eigenvalue problem as well in that case one of the two following conditions needs to be applied instead of eq 11 i the dirichlet condition φ 0 0 or ii the neumann condition φ x 0 these conditions will be considered in section 4 remark 1 it is evident that at x 1 a fully reflective boundary is assumed in more realistic situations a part of the hydroelastic wave from the ice shelf cavity region is expected to be transmitted as a purely flexural wave considering the ice shelf soil as a beam on an elastic foundation however the stiffness of the soil is typically very large and the transmitted flexural wave is expected to be of low amplitude remark 2 the present ideal hydroelastic model is based on the shallow water equations eqs 1 3 in the presence of an elastic floating plate as a termination upper boundary extensions of the present model could be considered by coupling it with atmospheric baroclinic model in the upper half space in conjunction with matching conditions at the floating plate with application to the study of resonant vibrations of large ice shelves and the induced atmospheric perturbations the latter are shown to be important especially concerning the fundamental and low order resonances of large ice shelves by godin and zabotin 2016 also the present system does not account for damping due to dissipation macayeal et al 2015 these effects in modelling real inhomogeneous ice shelves will be studied in future work 3 ice shelf response as a reflection transmission problem in this section the resonant vibrations of an ice shelf under the action of long ocean waves will be studied as a reflection transmission problem fig 2 a wave field of the form 6 will be assumed at the open sea region and interface conditions expressing the conservation of mass and momentum will be applied at the interface with the floating ice shelf in that manner the flexural vibrations of the ice shelf will be studied as a function of the impacting wave characteristics the solution will be pursued through the discretisation of the variational form of the problem using high order finite elements the variational form for the above system eqs 7 8 with the coriolis effect is 12 ω 2 1 0 m x v η dx 1 0 k x v xx η xx dx v k x η xx x 1 0 v x k x η

conserved in this model the above result is examined as a possible indicator of the resonant frequencies of the considered hydroelastic system it will be shown in the examples presented in section 5 that the π ω zero values agree well with the eigenfrequencies of the ice shelf ice shelf cavity configuration calculated by using two different types of simplified homogeneous boundary conditions at the cavity ocean basin interface namely φ 0 0 or φ x x 0 0 furthermore it will be demonstrated that the former dirichlet condition provides reasonable predictions of the characteristic periods of the system the hydroelastic finite element helfem 4 5 is employed for the solution of the resulting reflection transmission variational problem papathanasiou et al 2014 based on the increased degree of interpolation of the above element the convergence properties of the present numerical scheme are very good denoting by hk 1 0 c the space of complex functions with lebesgue square integrable kth

the resonant vibrations of an ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity system as an eigenvalue problem homogeneous conditions at the water interface between the open ocean and the ice shelf cavity are applied i e φ 0 0 or φ x 0 0 using the latter dirichlet or neumann conditions in eqs 11 and 6 it is 24 ψ 0 r 1 0 r 1 or 25 ψ x x 0 i ω 2 f 2 b 0 1 r r 1 condition 25 is the one employed by sergienko 2013 and meylan et al 2017 for the study of normal modes of ice shelves sergienko 2013 justifies this selection based on the argument that no mass exchange must occur between the water in the cavity and the open ocean during the resonant vibrations of the ice shelf note that in both cases r 1 and r 1 it is 26 k η x x l 2 2 η l 2 2 ω 2 m η l 2 2 1 f ω 2 b m u l 2 2 2 ω 1 f ω 2 3 2 b 0 im r 0 the objective of this section is to formulate both eigenvalue problems in order to compare the eigenperiods with the characteristic periods obtained by the response of the ice shelf when the more realistic interface conditions are applied the solution of the eigenvalue problems corresponding to conditions 24 or 25 can be performed analytically or obtained numerically by means of the finite element method the advantage of finite elements is that it can handle problems with variable seabed topography or ice shelf thickness as well remark in the examined shallow water hydroelastic case contrary to the case of a shallow basin without ice cover the condition φ 0 0 does not imply that the elevation ice shelf deflection is zero at this point it is noted that when r 1 we have 27 u 0 b 0 b 0 m 0 ψ x x 0 2 i b 0 b 0 m 0 ω 2 f 2 this velocity corresponds to the maximum amplitude out charge towards the water region or in charge towards the hydroelastic region flow values attained 5 numerical results and applications several cases will be presented and discussed in this section first two illustrative examples will be considered for an ice shelf of relatively large length 150 km and shorter one with length 50 km in both cases the depth of the oceanic basin at the free end of the ice shelf is b 500 m while the ice shelf thickness is h 300 m the ice water density ratio is ρ i ρ w 0 9 and the young s modulus of ice is taken as e 11 gpa this value is used by meylan et al 2017 and is close to the range 8 10 gpa which schulson and duval 2009 predicted by lab experiments it should be noted that smaller values of young s modulus 1 gpa have been also used by several authors e g vaughan 1995 a more detailed discussion regarding young s modulus values for ice shelves can be found in lescarmontier et al 2012 and lee et al 2018 in all cases it is expected that young s modulus values will not affect the hydroelastic response of large ice shelves significantly at least when the fundamental and lower modes are considered godin and zabotin 2016 the response of the ice shelf will be evaluated using the potential energy norm 28 η e η l 2 2 k η x x l 2 2 1 2 and the chebyshev maximum type norm 29 η c 0 k η x x c 0 where q c 0 max x 1 0 q the norm in eq 28 represents the potential energy of the ice shelf in particular the second term is the strain energy the norm in eq 29 combines the maximum value of the deflection and the maximum value of the bending moment in the non dimensional setting these two norms will be calculated using the solution of the reflection transmission problem and will be plotted against the period of the impacting waves along with these two norms the eigenperiods of the ice shelf cavity system td as predicted using the dirichlet condition φ x 0 0 and tn as predicted using the homogeneous neumann condition φ x x 0 0 will be plotted the objective is to examine whether td or tn better predict the local maxima of the ice shelf response especially as the principal low order modes are concerned since we are interested in long wave forcing only the first 20 characteristic periods will be examined at this stage in all cases 500 hydroelastic elements were used and convergence for the first 100 modes for meshes with more than 300 has been verified using extensive numerical experiments next the effects of main geometrical parameters on the first two characteristic periods will be examined and the predictive capability of simplified dirichlet boundary conditions at the ice water interface will be demonstrated finally the present model will be applied to the cases of simplified models of the ross and larsen c ice shelves examining also the effect of coriolis frequency on the resonant frequencies for these antarctic regions 5 1 illustrative examples a ice shelf with length l 150 km a relatively large ice shelf of length l 150 km is examined first the ice shelf response along with the td and tn eigenperiods are plotted in fig 3 as a function of the wave forcing period the thick blue line corresponds to the ice shelf potential energy norm and the thick red line corresponds to norm defined by eq 29 the eigenperiods td are depicted using thick continuous vertical lines and the eigenperiods tn using thin dashed vertical lines this is expected since the energy flow to the ice shelf cavity system has been found to be proportional to ω im r the latter is proportional to the frequency of the impacting wave and also contains the oscillatory term 1 im r 1 which creates several local maxima and minima in the response indicators for higher frequency the energy norm exhibits a more regular behaviour than chebyshev maximum type norm examining the relation between the eigenperiods of the system and the response quantified by the potential energy norm it is evident that td values correspond to local maxima locations of the response while tn values correspond to locations of local minima this interesting observation holds for the first eigenperiods and is verified by the response in the maximum type norm as well the approximation of the first local maximum by td zoom box in fig 3 is not as accurate as that corresponding to the following peaks of the response still the td value provides a considerably better approximation than tn in the case of the maximum type norm red line the response pattern becomes more irregular for periods less than approximately 20 min indicated by a vertical arrow in fig 3 for higher modes tn values coincide with localised maxima of small amplitude but again the highest local peaks are determined by eigenperiods calculated using the dirichlet condition φ 0 in fig 4 the real and imaginary part of the reflection coefficient as computed using the finite element method is depicted the results shown verify that eigenperiods td vertical solid black lines are characterised by re r 1 and eigenperiods tn vertical dashed black lines correspond to re r 1 in both cases td and tn it is im r 0 the π t term defined in eq 19 is plotted in fig 4 c as a function of the period of the incoming waves the eigenperiods td and tn are plotted again as vertical lines the horizontal axis is in logarithmic scale the local minima corresponding to zero values of this quantity predict all the eigenperiods whether homogeneous dirichlet or neumann conditions are employed this is compatible with the fact that at these periods it is im r 0 and no energy enters or leaves the ice shelf region according to the energy balance in eq 18 finally the response of the ice shelf as predicted by the reflection transmission model for forcing periods corresponding to the first three predictions of dirichlet and neumann models is shown in fig 5 the left column presents the real part and the right column the imaginary part of the normalised upper surface elevation η η max t η t c 0 where the maximum in the denominator is taken over the range of periods examined as expected the response becomes more oscillatory as the period of the incoming waves drops the interesting observation is that when the forcing corresponds to a td eigenperiod the amplitude of the real part is several orders of magnitude larger than the amplitude of the imaginary part conversely when the forcing corresponds to tn eigenperiods the situation is reversed and it is the amplitude of the imaginary part that is several orders of magnitude larger a ice shelf with length l 50 km in this example a smaller ice shelf with length l 50 km is studied fig 6 depicts the response of this ice shelf using the same quantities and definitions as before the spectrum of the shorter ice shelf is of course shifted to lower periods again in the case of the shorter ice shelf the td values correlate better that tn with the local maxima of the ice shelf response however this good correlation is only observed for the first 10 eigenperiods when the potential energy norm is considered the deviation between the td values and the peaks of the maximum type norm occurs after the sixth eigenperiod for larger eigenperiods the tn eigenvalues appear to correspond to local minima locations of the potential energy norm it can thus be stated that the use of the dirichlet condition φ 0 at the free end is preferable it is furthermore interesting to note that for small period values the td values approximate again better the norm peaks however in these shorter wavelengths the gaps defined by the succession of td and tn values become narrower and both eigenvalue models are ultimately expected to provide good approximation provided that the long wave assumption still holds again the approximation of the first local maximum by td zoom box in fig 6 is not as accurate as that corresponding to the following peaks of the response still it provides a much better prediction of the first peak in the potential norm response than the first tn eigenperiod fig 7 depicts the real and imaginary part of the reflection coefficient as computed using the finite element method the π t term defined in eq 19 is plotted in fig 4 c as a function of the period of the incoming waves again the minimisation of this quantity holds for both td and tn eigenperiods where the value attained is zero according the prediction of eq 18 finally the theoretical prediction that td values correspond to re r 1 and tn values correspond to re r 1 while in both cases it is im r 0 is verified by the numerical results for the reflection coefficient shown in fig 7 the deflection of the ice shelf as predicted by the reflection transmission model for forcing periods corresponding to the first three predictions of dirichlet and neumann models is shown in fig 8 again the real part left column and the imaginary part right column of the normalised upper surface elevation η η max t η t c 0 is plotted similarly to the case l 150 km when the forcing corresponds to a td eigenperiod the amplitude of the real part is several orders of magnitude larger than the amplitude of the imaginary part conversely when the forcing corresponds to tn eigenperiods the situation is reversed and it is the amplitude of the imaginary part that is several orders of magnitude larger 5 2 systematic investigation of the main geometrical parameters in fig 9 results from systematic investigation are presented in order to illustrate the effects of main geometrical parameters as the ice shelf length its thickness and the water depth on the predicted eigensolution in the case of an ice shelf water system in particular contour plots of the first and second characteristic periods are shown in non dimensional form 10 3 t 1 2 l g with respect to ice shelf length over water depth l b ranging from 50 to 500 and thickness ratio h b taking values from 0 1 to 0 6 respectively for calculations the ice water density ratio considered is ρ i ρ w 0 9 and the young s modulus of ice is e 11 gpa while the water depth is set to 500 m results obtained by the maximization of the considered norms are shown by solid lines while predictions based on the application of dirichlet boundary condition are plotted by using dashed lines in general dirichlet boundary conditions are capable of providing quite reasonable predictions of the most important first two characteristic periods differences reaching 10 15 with the values obtained by the maximization of responses by the considered norms are observed especially as the ice shelf thickness and length substantially increase also we note that as the mode index increases the observed differences become smaller finally the dependence of the characteristic periods derived from maximum responses on the examined parameters is clearly more complex than the corresponding dirichlet eigenperiods this feature could be due to effects associated with the specific norms used eqs 28 and 29 and is left to be more thoroughly investigated in future work 5 3 a model for the ross ice shelf the response of an ice shelf with length l 550 km and thickness h 300 m will be studied these values have also been used by godin and zabotin 2016 to analyse the eigenperiods of the ross ice shelf the bathymetric profile described by fretwell et al 2013 and also depicted in brominski et al 2015 for a cross section of the ice shelf water cavity geometry along a transect approximately orthogonal to the ross ice shelf front will be used in particular the depth profile will be set to 30 b x 700 10000 x l 2 1 x l 6 m which yields a reasonable approximation of the variable seabed topography a satellite image of the ross ice shelf is shown in fig 10 a with the considered cross section denoted by a thick green line fig 10 b shows the basic geometry and seabed topography characteristics of the model a more sophisticated model of the ross ice shelf has been recently presented by sergienko 2017 the ice shelf response in the potential energy and maximum type norm is shown in fig 11 the first 20 eigenperiods td and tn are also plotted again the local maxima of the response coincide with the eigenperiods td the largest eigenperiod t d1 9 60 hours is approximately twice the corresponding one t n1 4 99 hours the value t d1 9 60 hours is very close to the value 9 8 hours obtained by godin and zabotin 2016 in the latter work it is pointed out that this resonance value is very close to the largest period of the persistent atmospheric waves observed in the ross ice shelf region 10 hours and the very interesting theory that the two phenomena could be interrelated is proposed in their analysis godin and zabotin 2016 used a constant bathymetry profile in order to derive a homogenised environment for the present hydroelastic analysis the mean depth 31 1 0 700 10000 x 6 1 x 2 d x 660 32 m will be considered keeping all other parameters the same and solving for the constant depth bm 660 m the response depicted in fig 12 occurs in this case the first observed characteristic periods indicated by the maxima of the norms eqs 28 and 29 are approximately 8 00 3 05 1 92 hours it is observed that the relative difference between the eigenperiods predicted by the variable bathymetry and constant bathymetry based on the mean depth is small regarding the first 50 modes the relative difference between the two models is always less than 2 5 with the largest deviations appearing in the first two modes based on the above results the approximate use of an averaged depth in cases characterised by mild seabed variations is expected to provide reasonably good approximations next in fig 13 the coriolis effect on the calculated characteristic periods is presented for the above constant depth idealized model of the ross ice shelf we consider a mean value of coriolis frequency which at latitude 80 deg south is estimated to be 1 432 10 4 r a d sec corresponding to 12 2 hours the changes are substantial and the first three resonant characteristic periods corresponding to the peaks of the norms in fig 12 are approximately 6 60 3 00 and 1 90 hours respectively moreover it is observed that the homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions are able to provide reasonable predictions concluding this section it is interesting to note that when the coriolis acceleration is included the present model is able to provide reasonable predictions above the cut off frequency also for large domains the present fem model supports the study of additional effects due to spatial variability of the coriolis frequency and this is left to be presented in future work 5 4 a model for the larsen c ice shelf the response of an ice shelf with length l 200 km and thickness h 300 m will studied in this section the uniform depth is set to b 500 m this particular set of values are chosen to represent in the mean the characteristics of the larsen c ice shelf along the transect depicted in fig 14 a by the green line griggs and bamber 2009 the ice shelf density for this case is ρ i 917 kg m 3 and the water density ρ w 1027 kg m 3 as before the value for young s modulus is set to e 11 gpa fig 14 a is a satellite image of the larsen c ice shelf where the cross section considered is shown approximately with a solid green line the geometric characteristics of the adopted model namely average thickness and seabed topography are shown in fig 14 b the response of the present model used for the simulation of larsen c hydroelastic resonant behaviour without coriolis effects is illustrated in fig 15 the potential energy norm and maximum type norm curves are quite similar to those corresponding to the ice shelf with length 150 km as the bathymetric and thickness profile are the same in both cases and the span is comparable the first 3 characteristic periods identified by the maxima of the norms defined by eqs 28 and 29 are approximately 3 90 1 51 0 91 hours respectively the first td eigenperiods using the zero velocity potential condition at the cavity below the ice shelf front are again found in very good match with the local maxima of the potential and maximum type norms of the cantilever response the fundamental eigenperiod is now t d1 4 61 hours while the second eigenperiod is calculated at t d2 1 54 hours these values are slightly less than half of the respective values of the ross ice shelf model finally for the above model of the larsen c ice shelf the coriolis effect on the characteristic periods is presented in fig 16 we consider a mean value of coriolis frequency which at a mean latitude 67 5 deg south is estimated to be 1 344 10 4 r a d sec corresponding to approximately 13 hours in this case the first three resonant periods which can be observed now by the present model are approximately 3 60 1 51 0 91 hours respectively the changes are smaller than the ones observed in the case of the ross ice shelve model which is justified by the smaller value of latitude of the larsen c ice shelve model similarly as before the dirichlet boundary conditions are able to provide quite reasonable predictions 6 approximate prediction of eigenperiods simple formulas for the approximation of the hydroelastic eigenperiods can be derived in homogeneous environments if the cavity basin without the ice shelf is considered or if the ice shelf is modelled as a simple cantilever euler bernoulli beam vibrating in vacuum see fig 17 in fact using eqs 7 and 8 it is observed that for small ω and small values of k that are typical for ice shelves the above system reduces to shallow water equations in the case of the cavity basin an appropriate depth reduction can be applied to take into account the ice shelf draft as shown in fig 14 on the other hand for larger values of ω and thus highly oscillatory responses kη xx xx also becomes significant and the above system reduces to the thin plate model in both cases the effects of the grounding line are assumed to be localised in the sense that the hinge zone is considered very small compared to the length of the ice shelf and can therefore be ignored the same simplification has been applied to the hydroelastic model as well considering the eigenanalysis of the cavity basin a problem in the linearised shallow water theory occurs the velocity at the grounding line and the velocity potential at the basin front are set to zero resulting in the nondimensional setting in the formula 32 ω a n π n 1 2 b m n 0 1 2 which by incorporating the coriolis effect results in the form ω c n ω α n 2 f 2 in conformity with godin and zabotin 2016 eq 41 hence using the dirichlet condition φ 0 at the ice shelf cavity ocean interface the eigenperiods can be approximated as follows approximation using cavity basin eigenanalysis 33 t n a 1 1800 n 1 2 2 1 ρ i ρ w h b f 2 l 2 gb l gb hrs it is noted here that the above equation contains the effect of reduced water depth under the ice shelf as it accounts for its draft the latter however being dependent on the ice mass distribution includes the inertia characteristics of the ice shelf it will be demonstrated in the sequel that the above formula produces reasonably accurate results that are close to those of the full hydroelastic model particularly for ice shelves of large length the effectiveness of formula 33 is first assessed with respect to its capability to reproduce the characteristic periods occurring from the potential energy norm maximisation compared to the predictions td in particular in fig 18 the characteristic periods of the ross ice shelf first row and the larsen c ice shelf second row are plotted against the eigenperiods obtained by eq 33 and those predicted using the dirichlet condition on the wave potential φ 0 namely td the t n a eigenperiods are denoted by circles and the td eigenperiods using crosses the results of the right column include the coriolis effect in all cases the 15 first characteristic periods and eigenperiods are shown if the eigenanalysis models were capable of exactly reproducing the characteristic frequencies all the results would lie on the principal diagonal this is the case for periods larger than the second characteristic one the predictions of formula 33 are excellent for the second characteristic period as well the accuracy deteriorates when the fundamental eigenperiod is considered however the accuracy of eq 33 is still comparable to that of the hydroelastic eigenperiods td using now the eigenperiods of a cantilever beam the following result is obtained approximation using cantilever beam eigenanalysis 34 t n b π l 2 1800 β n 2 h 12 1 v 2 ρ i e hrs where β n are the roots of the transcendental equation 1 cos β n cosh β n 0 a comparison of formulae 33 and 34 with the hydroelastic eigenperiods td for the examples analysed in section 5 1 and the ross and larsen c ice shelves without the coriolis effect is shown in fig 19 both axes are in logarithmic scale it is observed that the free basin approximation t n a is very robust for the fundamental and lower modes as the mode number increases the quality of this approximation deteriorates this is more evident in the case of smaller length ice shelves while for very large ones the free basin approximation is very good even for higher modes a total of 100 modes are examined in fig 19 as the number of modes increases and the length of the ice shelf decreases the hydroelastic eigenperiods are better approximated by those of the euler bernoulli beam namely t n b asymptotically as n it is t n a 1 n and t n b 1 n 2 notably for all examined ice shelf lengths there was a set of modes for which neither model was proven accurate this stresses the importance of employing hydroelastic eigenanalysis for the study of the resonant response of ice shelves in all cases caution is needed to ensure that the assumptions of shallow water theory remain valid for the eigenstates corresponding to large mode numbers since the free basin approximation of the eigenperiods yields quite accurate results for the fundamental and lower order modes it is worthwhile investigating this approximation further fig 20 shows the relative difference of the basin eigenperiods t n a and the hydroelastic eigenperiods td tn as a function of the mode number for different ice shelf lengths and different thickness to depth ratios the cases l 25 50 150 300 km are examined the coriolis effect is not included in this specific comparison it is observed that the quality of the approximation deteriorates as the length of the ice shelf decreases and the thickness to depth ratio h b increases 7 conclusions in the present work the resonant hydroelastic vibrations of an ice shelf sub ice shelf cavity configuration are studied by employing shallow water theory in conjunction with a thin plate model the hydroelastic problem is formulated and solved as a wave reflection transmission one using higher order fe that enable a fast and accurate computation of characteristic periods the latter are considered as the forcing periods that maximise specific norms of the ice shelf response the above numerical results are compared to solutions derived using specific homogeneous boundary conditions for eigenproblems of resonant ice shelf vibrations we establish that appropriate homogeneous conditions on the wave potential applied at the ice shelf front produce eigenfrequencies that in general agree well with the norm maximisation frequencies also in the low frequency regime subsequently the present methodology is applied to the prediction of characteristic periods of the ross and larsen c ice shelves providing eigenperiods in agreement with previously derived results by godin and zabotin 2016 the following key observations summarise the basic findings i the resonant behaviour of ice shelves when the interaction with the surrounding ocean wave field is taken into account is dominated by characteristic periods that maximise specific norms of the ice shelf oscillatory response ii a homogeneous dirichlet condition for the wave potential at the ice shelf front was found to be the more accurate for hydroelastic eigenproblems this result could be very significant when more elaborate 2d horizontal models for ice shelves of complex geophysical characteristics are considered in this case the reflection transmission problem is very computationally demanding and the use of a homogeneous boundary condition at the ice shelf front significantly facilitates the numerical solution and analysis iii approximate formulas for the hydroelastic eigenproblem of either a basin without the ice cover or only the ice shelf modelled as an elastic cantilever work well at different frequency bands at small frequencies the basin approximation is better especially when large ice shelves are considered of particular interest is the possibility to employ shallow water models already used for harbours and semi enclosed basins in the study of ice shelves by ignoring the ice cover as a first approximation the present work suggests that this could be a reasonable approach for the estimation of the fundamental and lower order modes and will be exploited in future studies focusing on the eigenanalysis of realistic ice shelf configurations finally the coriolis acceleration could have important effects concerning the resonant modes of ice shelves in polar regions in particular the present model is shown to provide useful information for frequencies higher than the coriolis frequency and that the use of homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition at the ice shelf front is still able to provide good predictions 
24062,the impact of tides on the spreading of the mediterranean outflow waters mow in the gulf of cadiz is investigated through a series of targeted numerical experiments using an ocean general circulation model the full ephimeridic luni solar tidal potential is included as forcing the model grid is global with a strong zoom around the iberian peninsula thus the interaction of processes of different space and time scales which are involved in the mow spreading is enabled this is of particular importance in the strait of gibraltar and the gulf of cádiz where the width of the mow plume is a few tens of km the experiment with enabled tides successfully simulates the main tidal features of the north atlantic and in the gulf of cádiz and the strait of gibraltar the comparison of the fields from simulations with and without tidal forcing shows drastically different mow pathways in the gulf of cádiz the experiment without tides shows an excessive southwestward spreading of mediterranean waters along the north african slope whereas the run with tides is closer to climatology a detailed analysis indicates that tidal residual currents in the gulf of cádiz are the main cause for these differences 1 introduction the narrow 14 km and rather shallow 300 m at the main sill strait of gibraltar sog is the only connection between the mediterranean sea and the north atlantic na ocean lighter atlantic waters enter the mediterranean sea as a surface flow and spread out through the western and eastern mediterranean basins while being modified gradually by mixing with the underlying waters the density of these surface waters increases due to evaporation and cooling finally they form the saline and warm intermediate and deep mediterranean waters which in turn flow into the atlantic ocean as an undercurrent through the sog at a rate of approximately 1 sv 106 m3 s 1 once in the gulf of cadiz goc the mediterranean outflow water mow descends gradually to its equilibrium depth 1000 m flowing westward along the iberian continental slope while entraining overlying north atlantic central waters nacw the result is the formation of the mediterranean water that finally spreads into the interior of the na forming the most prominent basin scale thermohaline anomaly at mid depths the mediterranean salt tongue fig 1 in this work we will focus primarily in the goc therefore we will use the acronym mow independently of the degree of transformation of the pure outflow water the fate of mow involves a wide range of spatial and temporal scales this is most evident at the sog and in the goc where the mow core has a width of just a few tens of km changes in the characteristics of atlantic and or mediterranean water masses could affect the exchange flows through the sog and also the fluxes of salt heat and other properties these changes may be induced by atmospheric disturbances e g garrett et al 1989 candela et al 1989 seasonal cycles bormans et al 1986 and interannual decadal or longer climate variability brandt et al 2004 superimposed on these exchange flows a strong tidal forcing acts in the sog candela et al 1990 this substantially modifies the amount of exchanged salt and water due to the high correlation over the tidal period between the depth of the interface and the strength of the inflowing currents bryden et al 1994 this oscillatory flow in turn interacts with the main sill of the strait creating an internal bore of high amplitude which further propagates and disintegrates into a train of internal solitary waves e g brandt et al 1996 izquierdo et al 2001 sánchez garrido et al 2008 2011 vlasenko et al 2009 these internal waves provide energy for mixing in the sog and they are likely to determine to some extent the volume and characteristics of the mow in the goc the local scale processes also are supposed to play an important role for example through the effect of submarine canyons and banks over the mow undercurrent serra et al 2005 these bottom topography features also interact with the tidal flow generating internal waves and affecting tidally induced mixing and residual currents bruno et al 2006 quaresma and pichon 2013 a recent analysis of near bottom high resolution ctd and velocity data at the goc sánchez leal et al 2017 shows the impact of mean flow topography interaction on the fate of mow along the goc but to our knowledge the impact of the tide topography interaction on the mow undercurrent has been never considered based on observational evidence there is a good understanding of the behaviour of the mow in the vicinity of the goc the general picture excellently summarized by iorga and lozier 1999a is that mow moves westward as a wall bounded undercurrent by the iberian continental slope most mow passes through the gateway between s vicente spur and gorringe bank e g zenk and armi 1990 daniault et al 1994 iorga and lozier 1999a 1999b bower et al 2002 carracedo et al 2014 and then moves northward as a poleward eastern boundary undercurrent another branch of mow recirculates cyclonically in the goc daniault et al 1994 iorga and lozier 1999a b bower et al 2002 see fig 1 meddies or mediterranean eddies isolated rotating lenses of warm salty mediterranean water play also an important role for the propagation of mow properties to the ocean interior bower et al 2002 this transport is directed generally towards southwest richardson et al 1991 iorga and lozier 1999a bower et al 2002 most of the modelling work on mow has been done with limited area models in the vicinity of the sog and the goc starting from the pioneering works by jungclaus and mellor 2000 who used the pom model for a mow process study excluding any external forcing and johnson and stevens 2000 and johnson et al 2002 who used a model based on mom modular ocean model pacanowski et al 1990 specifying barotropic streamfunction and partly tracer relaxation at open boundaries however none of them included tides as a factor with possible influence in mow spreading in the goc the relevance of flow topography interaction in the goc for mow spreading has been established sánchez leal et al 2017 but the tidal contribution to topographically induced processes has been disregarded from the point of view of tidal dynamics the goc is a very interesting region as it is influenced by the different tidal regimes of the na and the sog quaresma and pichon 2013 found small scale variability of the tidal harmonic solutions over the shelf and over nearby seamounts caused by the generation of diurnal continental shelf waves and topographic modulation of the semi diurnal tidal ellipses along shelf the semi diurnal velocities show higher spatial variability than the amplitudes of sea surface elevation over the major shelf width anomalies as submarine canyons and promontories the tidal current is magnified and changes the rotation sense to anti cyclonic the same behaviour is observed around cape s vicente as well as over the nearby seamounts gorringe quaresma and pichon 2013 also reported strong internal tide activity in some located hotspots the goal of this paper is to investigate the role of tides for the spreading of the mow in the gulf of cadiz and along the southwestern iberian margin in order to do so we apply a global ocean model with a strong focus on the region of interest the paper is organized as follows the model setup is presented in section 2 the numerical experiments and results are provided in section 3 while section 4 contains the discussion of the results 2 model setup we employ a special setup of the max planck institute ocean model mpiom developed at the max planck institute for meteorology maier reimer 1997 marsland et al 2003 jungclaus et al 2013 which allows us to use a global model with a strong zoom on the sog and the goc mpiom is a free surface primitive equations ocean model which uses the boussinesq and incompressibility approximations the model is formulated on an orthogonal curvilinear arakawa c grid with vertical discretization on z levels the curvilinear grid allows for the placement of the poles over land thus removing the numerical singularity associated with convergence of meridians at the geographical poles one important advantage of the curvilinear grid is that high resolution in the region of interest can be reached by adequate positioning of the model grid poles while maintaining a global domain vertical mixing and diffusion are formulated depending on the richardson number according to pacanowski and philander 1981 a simple mixed layer scheme is included convection in case of unstable stratification is treated by enhanced vertical diffusion marsland et al 2003 a bottom boundary layer bbl slope convection scheme was included which allows for a better representation of the flow of statically unstable dense water masses over sills and off shelves marsland et al 2003 lateral diffusion of the tracer fields is done using an isopycnal scheme griffies 1998 unresolved eddy induced tracer transport has been included by the implementation of a gent and mcwilliams style parameterization gent et al 1995 advection of scalar tracers is computed with a second order total variation diminishing scheme sweby 1984 tides can be calculated by prescribing the full ephimeridic luni solar tidal potential thomas et al 2001 2 1 grid configuration as this study focuses on the mow and its spreading from the sog along the southwestern iberian margin the model grid has very high resolution along the coast of the iberian peninsula and gradually decreasing resolution elsewhere the model is global which allows us to combine the high spatial resolution required in key regions for the mediterranean overflow and subsequent spreading in the goc and the large scales required for the subsequent spreading in the na this approach avoids one of the most prominent problems of regional ocean models the specification of boundary values in the ocean interior the grid configuration used in this study span10 fig 2 places one pole in the iberian peninsula at 4 7 w and 39 25 n the other in south america 4 s 89 w allowing 4 km resolution at the sog formal mean global resolution 1 0 the span10 setup combines the explicit exchange through a realistic sog and tidal forcing as well as a realistic representation of the most relevant topographic features in the sog and the goc fig 2 essential for the spreading of the mow sánchez leal et al 2017 the model has 80 vertical levels with level thickness increasing with depth centered at 8 21 31 41 51 61 71 81 91 101 111 121 131 141 151 161 171 181 191 201 211 221 231 242 254 267 281 296 312 329 347 366 386 407 429 452 476 501 527 554 582 611 641 672 704 737 771 806 842 879 918 959 1002 1047 1094 1143 1196 1253 1316 1383 1458 1543 1638 1743 1858 1983 2118 2263 2423 2598 2783 2978 3188 3423 3683 3968 4293 4668 5093 and 5568 m depth allowing a fair vertical resolution and keeping the implicit vertical numerical diffusivity small for an accurate temporal resolution of the tidal oscillations and to guarantee numerical stability the model time step was 432 s the coefficients of horizontal friction tracer diffusion in the model are formulated spatially varying depending on local grid resolution the vertical mixing in the standard version was tuned to yield an optimal representation of the hydrography in the north atlantic therefore we have decided to keep all model parameters near the standard values without fine tuning the model as our main objective is to study the effect of tides on the spreading of mow surface forcing was similar as described in marsland et al 2003 the omip climatology röske 2001 was used for the atmospheric surface forcing this data set combines the advantages of using the same forcing for every model year while maintaining a realistic short term variability on daily time scale heat fluxes and evaporation are calculated using bulk formula with prescribed atmospheric quantities and actual model sea surface temperature sst the only direct restoring term used in this model setup is surface salinity restoring to the phc 2 1 climatology steele et al 2001 the ocean initial state was taken from the same climatology the parameter values employed in the mpiom span10 runs are listed in table 1 3 results 3 1 baseline experiments two baseline experiments have been performed with the span10 setup in experiment tide the full ephimeridic luni solar tidal potential was activated in experiment notide it was not this is the only difference between these two experiments both experiments were integrated for 13 years this turned out to be sufficient to ensure that the oceanographic fields in the eastern na reflect the model physics and not the initial conditions a list of experiments can be found in table 2 3 2 tides in the global span10 müller et al 2010 already demonstrated the ability of the global mpiom to properly simulate ocean tides the span10 configuration of mpiom also succeeds in depicting a satisfactory representation of the main tidal waves in the na for validation purposes we performed a least square harmonic analysis of sea level on a 1 year long chunk of model output from experiment tide fig 3 a presents the simulated m2 partial tide which is the dominant tidal component in the north atlantic the agreement between mpiom span10 m2 tide and that obtained from accurate tidal models is reasonable in the na for a climate model this can be observed comparing the m2 cotidal chart simulated by mpiom span10 fig 3a to that obtained from the global high resolution tidal model hamtide taguchi et al 2014 with data assimilation shown in fig 3b the m2 tide travels as a sort of kelvin wave rotating counter clockwise around the central na amphidromic point the increase in amplitude towards the northwestern european shelf and the labrador sea is properly represented the amphidromic systems are well captured especially in the central north atlantic the 3 major amphidromic systems of the north sea southern bight german bight and southwest norwegian coast the iceland faroe rise the denmark strait the baffin bay west of greenland and the gulf of st lawrence some of the amphidromic points are slightly shifted the central north atlantic is displaced to the northwest causing in some cases their degeneration baffin bay and denmark strait at the same time mpiom span10 simulates key features of the tides in the goc and the sog in a realistic manner fig 4 shows a detailed m2 cotidal chart reproducing the two main features noted by candela et al 1990 from bottom pressure observations in the sog i the m2 amplitude decreases by more than 50 from the atlantic to the mediterranean side but it is otherwise uniform across the strait and ii in contrast the lines of constant phase cotidal lines are mostly oriented east west along the channel those features were confirmed by the high resolution models of tejedor et al 1998 1999 and sannino et al 2004 they found a two fold west to east decrease in amplitudes and a southwestward propagation within the sog with a nearly 20 phase difference between gibraltar and cape espartel from ne to sw across the strait and a 10 north to south phase difference at the atlantic side therefore the mpiom span10 m2 spatial structure fig 4 is very close to that well known from tidal gauge data and tidal local models candela et al 1990 already noticed that the m2 phase propagation observed in gibraltar is in clear opposition to the north atlantic deep water tide west of the strait which propagates northward raising the question on the matching between both tidal patterns in our results the sog acts as a source point but its influence is limited to the easternmost goc an area of nearly constant phases and amplitudes characterizes the central goc to the west of the goc the m2 tide becomes more progressive diffracting around cape s vicente and retaining maximum amplitude values at the head of the goc in accordance with quaresma and pichon 2013 fig 5 displays a comparison of the simulated m2 tidal current ellipse parameters with those obtained from two vertical arrays of four current meters moored at the goc instituto español de oceanografía indamar ieo es in the framework of the european project canigo two mooring arrays were located to the south of cape s vicente at 36 29 n 8 51 w and 36 22 n 8 49 w with a water depth of 2030 and 2880 m respectively see fig 6 the full time series covers a period from 14 06 1997 to 21 08 1998 with hourly resolution sufficient to perform a harmonic analysis for the characterization of the main tidal components mpiom span10 reasonably well simulates the observed vertical structure of the m2 tidal currents it slightly underestimates their small amplitude but it properly reproduces the eccentricity of the tidal current ellipses ratio of the semi minor and semi major axes the sense of rotation given by the sign of the semi minor axis negative clockwise and their vertical structure with minimum amplitudes and an abrupt change of phases at intermediate mow depths in general the model simulation adequately represents the effect of stratification on the vertical structure of the observed m2 current velocities fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the modelled depth averaged m2 tidal current ellipses in the goc along strait large amplitude tidal currents are found in the sog in agreement with observations candela et al 1990 and local tidal models e g tejedor et al 1998 1999 sannino et al 2004 west of the sog there is an interesting transitional pattern between the na goc and the sog tidal regimes with a strong decrease in tidal current amplitude and a veering in the orientation of the tidal current ellipses in the goc the wavy pattern of the current ellipses field is easily noticeable this interesting feature has been first noticed by quaresma and pichon 2013 using a regional 32 0 to 46 0 n and from 16 0 to 1 0 w barotropic version of hycom bleck 2002 they interpret these wave like structures as a consequence of along shelf tidal wave modulation by evenly spaced bathymetry features the interaction of the barotropic tide with these bottom topography features leads to the generation of internal tides müller et al 2012 demonstrated using a 0 1 resolution mpiom configuration stormtide that with the inclusion of tidal forcing in a global ogcm the model was capable of simulating mode 1 internal tides in the world ocean li et al 2015 showed that this holds also for mode 2 internal tides with a shorter wave length of 45 80 km camarinal sill the main sill of the sog represents one of the most extreme examples of internal tide generation e g morozov et al 2002 these oscillations are more evident at the transition layer between the atlantic and mediterranean waters which is often identified with an isohaline between 37 0 and 37 5 psu bray et al 1990 1995 bryden et al 1994 a hovmøller diagram of model salinity fig 7 at camarinal sill shows that the model places the mean interface contoured lines show 37 0 white and 37 5 black isohalines around 120 m depth e g bray et al 1990 1995 sannino et al 2002 and reproduces the spring neap cycle and diurnal inequality of the large tidal vertical oscillations of the atlantic mediterranean interface the modelled mean depths and standard deviations of the 37 0 and 37 5 isohalines at camarinal sill are 106 27 m and 130 30 m respectively these results are in good agreement with those obtained from previous modelling studies e g wang 1993 izquierdo et al 2001 sannino et al 2004 vlasenko et al 2009 sánchez garrido et al 2011 and observational campaigns for comparison bray et al 1990 identified the atlantic mediterranean interface with the 37 5 psu isohaline on the basis of observational data from the gibraltar experiment 1985 1986 kinder and bryden 1987 at camarinal sill they reported a mean interface depth of around 120 m with m2 oscillation amplitudes ranging from 30 to 50 m increasing from north to south using the same data set bryden et al 1994 chose the 37 0 psu isohaline as the interface at camarinal sill and found that it oscillated vertically with a standard deviation value of 47 m bray et al 1995 placed the mean interface depth at camarinal sill between 100 and 125 m corresponding to the 37 2 psu isohaline using five cross strait hydrographic sections repeated several times and also belonging to the gibraltar experiment 1985 1986 this comparison shows that the model simulates properly the internal tide in the sog however the horizontal resolution is too poor to generate the existing short period large amplitude internal waves mpiom span10 also reproduces the existence of internal tides in the goc generated mostly at gorringe bank and s vicente spur fig 8 in full agreement with the location of hotspots for the generation of the m2 internal tide reported by quaresma and pichon 2013 3 3 effect of tides on the ocean climate in the goc fig 9 shows five salinity sections from east to west across the sog and goc as indicated in fig 2 displayed is the annual mean salinity of the last year of experiment tide at the eastern side of the sog fig 9a the atlantic mediterranean interface is placed at the correct depth shallower at the north due to coriolis acceleration in agreement with observations e g bryden et al 1994 bray et al 1995 to the west the mediterranean outflow becomes less salty due to mixing and entrainment with ambient waters and sinks gradually to an equilibrium depth of 1100 m at c santa maria first as a bottom current and finally as a slope bounded undercurrent the mediterranean undercurrent which turns north after passing the cape of s vicente the results from experiment tide on both mow location and properties in the sog and the goc are in good agreement with the climatological data from the world ocean data base supp mat fig s1a and with previously published salinity sections in the eastern goc ochoa and bray 1991 baringer and price 1997 in contrast results from experiment notide show clear differences to climatological data already in the eastern goc section c in supp mat fig s1b the differences increase substantially towards the west a similar behaviour is observed for temperatures fig s2 direct comparison of the results from experiments tide and notide reveals the effect of tides figs 10 a and b show the salinity field at approximately the mow depth 1143 m for both experiments in year 13 starting from the same initial conditions both experiments reproduce the mow salinity anomaly in the eastern na both experiments show a finer structure than the lower resolution 0 25 climatology fig 10c and somewhat higher salinities in the western periphery off the iberian peninsula however while the fields from experiment tide better resemble the climatological salinity distribution experiment notide shows a too salty tongue from the goc to the southwest fig 10b which is at odds with the pathways of mow spreading derived from observations or climatological data analysis e g zenk and armi 1990 daniault et al 1994 iorga lozier 1999a bower et al 2002 carracedo et al 2014 see also our scheme in fig 1 baringer and price 1997 and iorga and lozier 1999 used the 36 25 psu isohaline as the minimum limit for defining the mow outflow in the goc and estimated the maximum width of the mow plume as 65 and 50 km respectively in very good agreement with experiment tide result fig 10 black isohaline the origin of this excessive southward salt flux in experiment notide is related to a gradual increase in the salinity of the goc at mow depths during the course of the simulation the goc becomes saltier and the salinity surplus propagates southwestward as a mid depth salinity front a meridional cross section through the goc at 8 w fig 11 further illustrates the differences between the tide fig 11a and notide fig 11b experiments in this area in both runs the mow core depth of 1100 m is slightly too shallow compared to observations fig 11c and the double salinity core is not reproduced these are caveats common to other mow simulations e g treguier et al 2003 jia et al 2007 and in our case they are likely related to an excessive entrainment favoured by the staircase topography treguier et al 2003 papadakis et al 2003 demonstrated that a shallower mediterranean undercurrent produces higher meddy activity and artale et al 2003 concluded that the vertical position of mw could have an impact on the structure of amoc however ivanovic et al 2013 showed that for a proper amoc simulation it is necessary to attain a mow plume centered at 1000 m as long as the mow depth is similar in both experiments and around 1100 m this misrepresentation will have no impact on our evaluation of the role of tides in mow spreading remarkably in experiment notide the mow plume is not a wall bounded gravity current spreading along the iberian continental slope but rather a mid depth salinity anomaly extending to the south of the goc fig 11b this striking difference between the experiments in the pattern of mow spreading into the na is fully attributable to the inclusion of the tidal potential in the tide control experiment temperature sections fig s3 reproduce the same patterns as salinity there are two potential non exclusive causes for this effect of tides on the ocean climate in the goc the first and well known cause is that tides have a strong effect both on the properties and on the amount of mow exiting the sog due to the intense tidal mixing and the correlation between horizontal tidal currents and interface vertical excursions see fig 7 apparently the effect of tidally induced mixing in the sog on mow properties was first proposed by seidler 1968 and has been studied in several papers and shown to be of considerable importance bryden et al 1994 report an important contribution of tidal fluctuations at the sog to the mean exchange flows which has an estimated mean value in the range from 0 67 to 1 78 sv bryden et al 1994 in our experiments the inclusion of tides produces an increase in the mean water exchange at camarinal sill section sog from 0 9 sv notide to 1 5 sv tide and a decrease of the salt transport to the goc from 1 21 psu sv notide to 1 10 psu sv tide table 3 this result agrees with the modelling study of sannino et al 2004 who found that the effect of the semidiurnal tide is to increment the mean transport by about 30 the second potential cause for the differences between the two experiments is the effect of tides on the spreading of the mow within the goc indeed there are clear differences in the time mean velocity fields at 1143 m depth between the tide and notide experiments fig 12 that are consistent with the respective salinity distribution shown in fig 10 experiment tide fig 12a presents an open cyclonic circulation with westward currents at the iberian slope and increasing velocities between cape s vicente and gorringe bank guaranteeing an efficient export of mow to the tagus abyssal plain mostly through the gap between s vicente spur and gorringe bank bower et al 2002 estimated mean velocities between 0 1 0 2 m s 1 in this area on the basis of rafos floats similar values have been reported by barbosa et al 2015 from adcp measurements taken during semane2000 campaing section 04 at 8 44 w further the mow core meanders west and northwest propagating the themohaline anomaly at intermediate depths along the african slope the flow is mostly poleward supplying fresher antarctic intermediate water aaiw barton 1989 machín and pelegrí 2009 this circulation pattern is close to the classical view e g zenk and armi 1990 daniault et al 1994 iorga and lozier 1999b that has been confirmed by more recent studies e g carracedo et al 2014 the notide fig 12b experiment depicts a very different velocity field with much less small scale structure and a dominant southwestward flow which is in disagreement with all observational and climatological evidence there is a clear correspondence between the velocity and the salinity fields in both experiments and it is evident that the tide solution is much better than the notide one however it is not obvious what ruins the notide solution does the difference in water and salt exchanges through the sog drive the circulation changes in the goc or do tidally induced differences in the goc circulation generate a different mow spreading pattern in the remainder of this paper we will address this question by performing a set of additional experiments where we exclude the effect of changes in amount and properties of mow transport through the sog 3 4 closed strait fixed water source experiments the difference between experiments tide and notide shows the effect of tides both in the sog as well as in the goc to be able to isolate the effect of tides in the goc a new set of experiments was carried out with a closed sog and a fixed water source fws a continuous water source 0 8 sv 38 5 psu 13 c was placed at the bottom of the first cell 354 m depth in the atlantic side of the sog in order to easier trace the spreading of the fws water a passive tracer was included in these simulations marking the prescribed mow source water this setup guarantees that we have identical salt water and tracer flow into the goc for the fws tide and fws notide experiments and that the only differences between these two experiments are due to tidally induced effects outside the sog especially in the goc the bathymetry file was modified to artificially close the sog as spin up the closed strait model configuration was run for 1 year without prescribed source of mow starting from year 13 of experiment tide this procedure removed the mow from the goc starting from this second spin up state two experiments were integrated for 8 years with prescribed fws with fws tide and without tidal forcing fws notide following we present results averaged over the last year of the fws experiments the fws experiments show the same mow spreading pattern as those with an open sog baseline while the source water tracer field in the fws tide experiment fig 13 a reproduces the accepted mow spreading pathways fig 1 the results from experiment fws notide fig 13b indicate a clearly unrealistic southward salt flux the goc gets gradually saltier at mid depths and the salinity excess propagates to the southwest the correspondence between the fws tracer fields and the baseline salinity fields fig 10 is more than evident the results from the two fws experiments clearly indicate that the modification of the mean water exchange flows by intense tidal mixing and tidal rectification in the sog is not decisive for the changes in the mow spreading pattern between the tide and notide experiments moreover differences in tracer fields from fws tide and fws notide fig 13 are closely related to changes in the circulation pattern within the goc fig 14 the velocity fields in experiments fws tide and fws notide to a large extent mimic those of the tide and notide baseline experiments resulting in the tidal cases in a further westward transport of mow along the iberian slope this demonstrates that tidally induced processes within the goc are causing the differences in the spreading of mow in the goc between experiments tide and notide additionally the time evolution of the source water plume in fws tide and fws notide see animation 1 in supp mat is closely linked to the velocity fields and shows differences already at initial stages when it is too early for changes in density field to cause a substantial impact on the dynamics notide experiments with increased values of vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity show an impact on mow vertical structure but do not change the preference for a southwestward spreading this points toward tidally induced circulation changes as cause of the difference in advective tracer transport the prime suspect is tidally induced residual current in the following section we will investigate this mechanism 3 5 tidally induced residual currents in the goc the advective transport mechanism in order to test the hypothesis that the changes in the spreading of mow due to inclusion of tides are dominated by advection through the tidally induced residual currents we determined the residual currents from two short additional sensitivity experiments we run the closed sog span10 configuration without any water source no water source experiments nws with and without tidal forcing experiments were started from the same spin up as fws experiments and then the model was run for 13 months with and without tidal forcing without any water source nws tide and nws notide from the last 12 months of these experiments we calculated the tidal residual velocity and sea surface height ssh fields fig 15 shows the depth integrated tidal residual velocity between the sea surface and 1858 m depth and tidal residual ssh in the goc the modelled tidal residual velocity field is closely related to the contours of tidal residual ssh which in turn are linked to bottom topography see fig 16 a the tidal residual ssh field is characterized by two depressions right south of cape s vicente and east of gorringe bank see d1 and d2 in fig 16a each associated with a corresponding depth integrated cyclonic residual circulation in the upper 1858 m fig 15 the largest tidal residual currents at 1143 m depth up to 3 cm s 1 are located at the slopes of gorringe bank gb and around s vicente spur svs west of portimao valley see fig 2 or fig 16a for locations thus these tidally induced residual currents might be responsible for the differences in mow spreading in the tide and notide control experiments they provide a more efficient advective export of mow to the na from the goc in the tide experiment conversely the lack of this tidal residual transport causes an accumulation of mow in the goc which results in gradually increasing salinity at mid depths ultimately this salinity anomaly will propagate as a salinity front to the southwest following the north african slope to check the validity of the proposed mechanism as initial trigger we used the high frequency 3456 s output of the first 2 years of fws tide and fws notide the fixed water source as 0 8 sv 38 5 psu 13 c tracer 1 0 to calculate offline the advective tracer transport fti across northwestern and southwestern boundaries enclosing the goc fig 16a 1 f t i 0 l h ζ v i t r i d z d s i t f w s t i d e i n t f w s n o t i d e where v i and tri are velocity and tracer concentration l is the length of the boundary and h and ζ are the local depth and free surface elevation respectively the zonal across the solid line i e between gorringe bank gb and s vicente spur svs and meridional dotted line tracer transports fig 16a show clear differences between the fws tide black line and fws notide red line runs with the fws tide tracer exiting the goc mainly through the gb svs section positive values indicate fluxes out from the goc as reported from observations bower et al 2002 report that most of the amuse floats 60 exited the goc through the gb svs section over the two years presented the evolution of the advective tracer transports shows a clear seasonality indicative of the importance of the atmospheric forcing in the goc circulation at depth carracedo et al 2014 tracer export from the goc is more efficient in the fws tide case being always larger across the northwestern boundary than across the southwestern conversely fws notide tracer transport is larger across the southwestern boundary and very small across the western boundary indicative of artificial southwestward spreading of mow in the goc eventually fws notide simulates negative tracer transport across the gb svs section pointing to a recirculation of mow exiting through the southwestern boundary the radical difference in mow spreading pathways from the goc is readily seen in fig 17 showing the fws tide fws notide difference in tracer concentration averaged over year 2 along de goc box boundaries we have also recalculated the fws notide tracer transport adding the constant 3d tidal residual velocity field obtained from the nws experiments vres to the time varying fws notide velocity vnt fig 13b c grey lines and using the fws notide tracer fields tr nt according to eq 2 2 f t r 0 l h ζ v res v nt t r n t d z d s the result approaches the transport calculated from fws tide with a preferred pathway between gb and svs this convergence is more evident after the first year when the tracer concentration along the boundaries is larger this confirms that advection with the tidal residual currents is the main contributor to the observed differences in mow spreading in the goc between our tidal and no tidal experiments the fws experiments were repeated for different source water properties denser and lighter source waters different water source production rates from 0 5 sv to 1 2 sv and with varying viscosity diffusion and bottom friction coefficients in all tested cases the results remain at large unchanged when tidal forcing is not present the goc gets extremely saltier at mid depths and mow flows in excess to the southwest along the north african shelf slope this unrealistic behaviour is corrected when tidal forcing is included this set of additional experiments not shown confirmed our hypothesis that the difference in the spreading of mow in the goc in experiments tide and notide is essentially determined by tidally induced processes in the goc 4 discussion the strong effect of tides on the exchange through the sog by enhanced mixing and tidal rectification has been widely recognized recently sannino et al 2015 investigated the role of tides in the mediterranean thermohaline circulation by means of a pair tide no tide of numerical experiments with an eddy resolving mitgcm configuration the results suggest that the inclusion of explicit tidal forcing in an eddy resolving mediterranean model has non negligible effects on the simulated circulation besides the intensification of local mixing processes however the influence of tides on the spreading of mow in the goc has been much disregarded despite the fact that mow flows as a narrow slope undercurrent in the mesotidal goc where the continental shelf and slope change abruptly direction and present marked bathymetric irregularities which can trigger strong nonlinear interactions on the other hand the importance of topography interaction and mixing on the mow plume adjustment in the goc e g price and baringer 1994 peliz et al 2007 sánchez el al 2017 is well established the inclusion of tides obviously improves the simulated spreading of mow in the goc and the na advection by the residual currents contributes to this improvement as our fws sensitivity experiments clearly demonstrate tidal impact on mean circulation has been observed at a basin scale in other mpiom configurations sein et al 2015 weber and thomas 2017 using a pure barotropic model quaresma and pichon 2013 also identified gorringe bank and s vicente spur as the locations with larger m2 tidal residual currents in the goc their residual currents are smaller than those we present here however it is known that in case of stratification tidal rectification and tidal mixing intensify the residual currents maas and zimmerman 1989 chen et al 1995 indeed recent studies report the existence of tidal residual currents of significant magnitude kurapov et al 2010 in a process study with the regional ocean modelling system roms demonstrated that moderate internal tides horizontal velocities o 10 1 ms 1 can induce differences in the subinertial velocity field of the same order of magnitude through the changes in the bottom boundary layer variability resulting in a larger bottom stress and divergence in the reynolds stresses associated with the baroclinic tidal flow more recently musgrave et al 2017 reported the generation of time mean flows by tides of up to 0 15 ms 1 in some regions of the mendocino ridge with complex topography and even hypothesized that such tidally induced circulations may play a role in the lateral spreading of water masses from the ridge crest into the ocean s interior the unrealistic southwestward spreading of mow in the goc and in the na found in the notide experiments is a problem found in several global or basin scale models without tides jia et al 2007 investigated an explicit mediterranean atlantic exchange through a wide open sog in the global occam model they focused on the behaviour of mow in the na and remarkably their bias pattern of the salinity field at mow depths closely resembles that of our notide experiment with salinities as high as 36 5 g kg at 30 n off the north african coast their fig 10a gary et al 2011 also observed a similar anomalous presence of mediterranean waters between 25 n and 40 n in the eastern atlantic in the 1 12 flame output according to our results it starts with a less efficient evacuation of mow through the western boundary of the goc this produces a mow accumulation with a subsequent southwestward spreading along the north african coast which finally triggers the collapse of a poleward fresher flow along the african coast barton 1989 and blocks the northward penetration of aaiw whose core is slightly shallower the importance of an adequate supply of fresher aaiw for a proper mediterranean water formation at the goc is supported by the analysis of hydrographic data provided by iorga and lozier 1999a b by the cluster analysis data presented by machín and pelegrí 2009 and by the climatologically based study of carracedo et al 2014 cutting the freshwater supply that would entrain underlying salty mow at the goc iorga and lozier 1999a b leads to an additional gradual salinification in the goc and a disruption of the water mass structure and circulation in the eastern boundary na however limited area models have been able to properly simulate the spreading of mow along the sw iberian margin while simulating a realistic water exchange through the sog without accounting for tides e g papadakis et al 2003 drillet et al 2005 serra et al 2005 2010 peliz et al 2007 2013 xu et al 2007 bozec et al 2011 barbosa et al 2015 this apparent contradiction seems to indicate that an appropriate choice of open boundaries conditions close to the gulf of cádiz and or the use of variable horizontal mixing bottom friction relaxation or restoring can play a role similar to that of the explicit inclusion of tidal forcing in our experiments this is compatible with the causal chain that according to our results leads to the degeneracy of the solution in the notide experiment 1 less efficient mow export through the western boundary of the goc 2 gradual increase of salinity in the goc 3 southwestward propagation of the salinity anomaly 4 suppression of the poleward flow supplying fresher water to the goc 5 further salinity increase in the goc limited area models offer a number of options to avoid any of the first three steps of this causal chain among them prescribing parameterizing the outflow through the sog reducing the mow inflow into the goc or enhancing the westward export of mow via varying bottom friction or horizontal diffusivity restoring salinity to climatology or by the open boundary conditions sponge zones in the limited area models therefore limited area models can be successful without explicitly including tides our results demonstrate that in our model setup the inclusion of explicit tidal forcing alone is able to correct the excessive southwestward spreading of mow reducing the biases in the northeast atlantic using a global ocean model we ensure that the model results in the goc are not affected by information provided through the open boundary conditions tides may affect mow spreading and properties through enhanced mixing or tidally induced residual currents indeed mixing between the mediterranean outflow and the atlantic ambient waters takes place over a small distance a few tens of km and depends strongly on bottom topography price and baringer 1994 jungclaus and mellor 2000 however according to quaresma and pichon 2013 and to our modelling results topography does not only have an influence on mixing but also on the spatial structure of the tidal wave and the residual currents which in turn might be originated by tidal mixing e g chen et al 1995 this is evident in fig 6 where a pivotal point in the field of m2 tidal current ellipse parameters is located in the portimao valley this divergence in the orientation of the semimajor axes fig 6 is also observed in tidal modelling results of quaresma and pichon 2013 where it is accompanied by a nearly 180 phase difference in maximum m2 tidal velocities from west to east of the portimao valley this is exactly the area with the largest values of the tidally induced residual current velocities which closely follow the sea surface height residual field fig 15 the tracer transport calculations fig 16 point out that the tidal residual currents play a lead role 5 summary and conclusions mow spreads as a basin scale salinity anomaly at about 1000 1200 m depth through the na forming the mediterranean salinity tongue after exiting from the sog it transits as a narrow slope bounded gravity plume the complex topography of the goc therefore small scale processes and local scale nonlinear interaction with tides and topography may have an impact on the mow properties and its further spreading pattern in the na to investigate the impact of tides on the mow spreading it is necessary to take into account a wide range of spatial and temporal scales which we have done by simultaneously resolving the local scale processes at the sog and the goc and the larger scale processes which may influence the na climate by means of using a highly zoomed setup of the global mpiom with explicit simulation of tides the mpiom simulation of the mow is successful in the sense that the depth and properties of the mow core are properly reproduced after the 13 year long baseline experiments while the experiment including tides resemble better the climatology and the established mow spreading pathways the experiment without tidal forcing simulates an excess of salinity at mow depths in the goc which triggers a non realistic southward salt flux this spreading of mow along the african slope suppresses the supply of fresher aaiw by the poleward undercurrent on the eastern boundary this feedback further enhances the salinity increase and the southwestward spreading of mow the resulting salinity bias pattern is common to some other global or basin scale models that do not include tides a series of process study targeted numerical experiments was designed in order to reveal the mechanisms responsible for such differences in the mow simulations with and without tides from a detailed analysis of the experiments high frequency output we were able to conclude that the tidal residual currents likely generated by the interaction of tides with local scale topography play a major role in the spreading of mow in the goc according to our results tidal residual currents contribute to the advection of mow west from the goc allowing them to pass the gap between s vicente spur and gorringe bank the zenk and armi 1990 mediterranean gateway as supported by observations this is not happening in the runs without tidal forcing instead the reduced efficiency in the evacuation of mow from the goc results in a gradual salinity increase at mow depths which sets up the already mentioned southwestward salt flux additional support to our conclusions is given by the model skills to properly reproduce different aspects of the tidal dynamics in the goc the surface tide tidal currents and internal wave generation and propagation have been satisfactorily compared to observations therefore to properly understand the impact that local processes acting on mow in the goc and the sog have on the larger scale it is necessary to study the mediterranean sea and the north atlantic ocean as a unique system accounting for relevant local and small scale processes and also for the atmospheric feedbacks which is considered as a milestone challenge artale et al 2006 legg et al 2009 in all our experiments the tidal runs show a more northward

24062,the impact of tides on the spreading of the mediterranean outflow waters mow in the gulf of cadiz is investigated through a series of targeted numerical experiments using an ocean general circulation model the full ephimeridic luni solar tidal potential is included as forcing the model grid is global with a strong zoom around the iberian peninsula thus the interaction of processes of different space and time scales which are involved in the mow spreading is enabled this is of particular importance in the strait of gibraltar and the gulf of cádiz where the width of the mow plume is a few tens of km the experiment with enabled tides successfully simulates the main tidal features of the north atlantic and in the gulf of cádiz and the strait of gibraltar the comparison of the fields from simulations with and without tidal forcing shows drastically different mow pathways in the gulf of cádiz the experiment without tides shows an excessive southwestward spreading of mediterranean waters along the north african slope whereas the run with tides is closer to climatology a detailed analysis indicates that tidal residual currents in the gulf of cádiz are the main cause for these differences 1 introduction the narrow 14 km and rather shallow 300 m at the main sill strait of gibraltar sog is the only connection between the mediterranean sea and the north atlantic na ocean lighter atlantic waters enter the mediterranean sea as a surface flow and spread out through the western and eastern mediterranean basins while being modified gradually by mixing with the underlying waters the density of these surface waters increases due to evaporation and cooling finally they form the saline and warm intermediate and deep mediterranean waters which in turn flow into the atlantic ocean as an undercurrent through the sog at a rate of approximately 1 sv 106 m3 s 1 once in the gulf of cadiz goc the mediterranean outflow water mow descends gradually to its equilibrium depth 1000 m flowing westward along the iberian continental slope while entraining overlying north atlantic central waters nacw the result is the formation of the mediterranean water that finally spreads into the interior of the na forming the most prominent basin scale thermohaline anomaly at mid depths the mediterranean salt tongue fig 1 in this work we will focus primarily in the goc therefore we will use the acronym mow independently of the degree of transformation of the pure outflow water the fate of mow involves a wide range of spatial and temporal scales this is most evident at the sog and in the goc where the mow core has a width of just a few tens of km changes in the characteristics of atlantic and or mediterranean water masses could affect the exchange flows through the sog and also the fluxes of salt heat and other properties these changes may be induced by atmospheric disturbances e g garrett et al 1989 candela et al 1989 seasonal cycles bormans et al 1986 and interannual decadal or longer climate variability brandt et al 2004 superimposed on these exchange flows a strong tidal forcing acts in the sog candela et al 1990 this substantially modifies the amount of exchanged salt and water due to the high correlation over the tidal period between the depth of the interface and the strength of the inflowing currents bryden et al 1994 this oscillatory flow in turn interacts with the main sill of the strait creating an internal bore of high amplitude which further propagates and disintegrates into a train of internal solitary waves e g brandt et al 1996 izquierdo et al 2001 sánchez garrido et al 2008 2011 vlasenko et al 2009 these internal waves provide energy for mixing in the sog and they are likely to determine to some extent the volume and characteristics of the mow in the goc the local scale processes also are supposed to play an important role for example through the effect of submarine canyons and banks over the mow undercurrent serra et al 2005 these bottom topography features also interact with the tidal flow generating internal waves and affecting tidally induced mixing and residual currents bruno et al 2006 quaresma and pichon 2013 a recent analysis of near bottom high resolution ctd and velocity data at the goc sánchez leal et al 2017 shows the impact of mean flow topography interaction on the fate of mow along the goc but to our knowledge the impact of the tide topography interaction on the mow undercurrent has been never considered based on observational evidence there is a good understanding of the behaviour of the mow in the vicinity of the goc the general picture excellently summarized by iorga and lozier 1999a is that mow moves westward as a wall bounded undercurrent by the iberian continental slope most mow passes through the gateway between s vicente spur and gorringe bank e g zenk and armi 1990 daniault et al 1994 iorga and lozier 1999a 1999b bower et al 2002 carracedo et al 2014 and then moves northward as a poleward eastern boundary undercurrent another branch of mow recirculates cyclonically in the goc daniault et al 1994 iorga and lozier 1999a b bower et al 2002 see fig 1 meddies or mediterranean eddies isolated rotating lenses of warm salty mediterranean water play also an important role for the propagation of mow properties to the ocean interior bower et al 2002 this transport is directed generally towards southwest richardson et al 1991 iorga and lozier 1999a bower et al 2002 most of the modelling work on mow has been done with limited area models in the vicinity of the sog and the goc starting from the pioneering works by jungclaus and mellor 2000 who used the pom model for a mow process study excluding any external forcing and johnson and stevens 2000 and johnson et al 2002 who used a model based on mom modular ocean model pacanowski et al 1990 specifying barotropic streamfunction and partly tracer relaxation at open boundaries however none of them included tides as a factor with possible influence in mow spreading in the goc the relevance of flow topography interaction in the goc for mow spreading has been established sánchez leal et al 2017 but the tidal contribution to topographically induced processes has been disregarded from the point of view of tidal dynamics the goc is a very interesting region as it is influenced by the different tidal regimes of the na and the sog quaresma and pichon 2013 found small scale variability of the tidal harmonic solutions over the shelf and over nearby seamounts caused by the generation of diurnal continental shelf waves and topographic modulation of the semi diurnal tidal ellipses along shelf the semi diurnal velocities show higher spatial variability than the amplitudes of sea surface elevation over the major shelf width anomalies as submarine canyons and promontories the tidal current is magnified and changes the rotation sense to anti cyclonic the same behaviour is observed around cape s vicente as well as over the nearby seamounts gorringe quaresma and pichon 2013 also reported strong internal tide activity in some located hotspots the goal of this paper is to investigate the role of tides for the spreading of the mow in the gulf of cadiz and along the southwestern iberian margin in order to do so we apply a global ocean model with a strong focus on the region of interest the paper is organized as follows the model setup is presented in section 2 the numerical experiments and results are provided in section 3 while section 4 contains the discussion of the results 2 model setup we employ a special setup of the max planck institute ocean model mpiom developed at the max planck institute for meteorology maier reimer 1997 marsland et al 2003 jungclaus et al 2013 which allows us to use a global model with a strong zoom on the sog and the goc mpiom is a free surface primitive equations ocean model which uses the boussinesq and incompressibility approximations the model is formulated on an orthogonal curvilinear arakawa c grid with vertical discretization on z levels the curvilinear grid allows for the placement of the poles over land thus removing the numerical singularity associated with convergence of meridians at the geographical poles one important advantage of the curvilinear grid is that high resolution in the region of interest can be reached by adequate positioning of the model grid poles while maintaining a global domain vertical mixing and diffusion are formulated depending on the richardson number according to pacanowski and philander 1981 a simple mixed layer scheme is included convection in case of unstable stratification is treated by enhanced vertical diffusion marsland et al 2003 a bottom boundary layer bbl slope convection scheme was included which allows for a better representation of the flow of statically unstable dense water masses over sills and off shelves marsland et al 2003 lateral diffusion of the tracer fields is done using an isopycnal scheme griffies 1998 unresolved eddy induced tracer transport has been included by the implementation of a gent and mcwilliams style parameterization gent et al 1995 advection of scalar tracers is computed with a second order total variation diminishing scheme sweby 1984 tides can be calculated by prescribing the full ephimeridic luni solar tidal potential thomas et al 2001 2 1 grid configuration as this study focuses on the mow and its spreading from the sog along the southwestern iberian margin the model grid has very high resolution along the coast of the iberian peninsula and gradually decreasing resolution elsewhere the model is global which allows us to combine the high spatial resolution required in key regions for the mediterranean overflow and subsequent spreading in the goc and the large scales required for the subsequent spreading in the na this approach avoids one of the most prominent problems of regional ocean models the specification of boundary values in the ocean interior the grid configuration used in this study span10 fig 2 places one pole in the iberian peninsula at 4 7 w and 39 25 n the other in south america 4 s 89 w allowing 4 km resolution at the sog formal mean global resolution 1 0 the span10 setup combines the explicit exchange through a realistic sog and tidal forcing as well as a realistic representation of the most relevant topographic features in the sog and the goc fig 2 essential for the spreading of the mow sánchez leal et al 2017 the model has 80 vertical levels with level thickness increasing with depth centered at 8 21 31 41 51 61 71 81 91 101 111 121 131 141 151 161 171 181 191 201 211 221 231 242 254 267 281 296 312 329 347 366 386 407 429 452 476 501 527 554 582 611 641 672 704 737 771 806 842 879 918 959 1002 1047 1094 1143 1196 1253 1316 1383 1458 1543 1638 1743 1858 1983 2118 2263 2423 2598 2783 2978 3188 3423 3683 3968 4293 4668 5093 and 5568 m depth allowing a fair vertical resolution and keeping the implicit vertical numerical diffusivity small for an accurate temporal resolution of the tidal oscillations and to guarantee numerical stability the model time step was 432 s the coefficients of horizontal friction tracer diffusion in the model are formulated spatially varying depending on local grid resolution the vertical mixing in the standard version was tuned to yield an optimal representation of the hydrography in the north atlantic therefore we have decided to keep all model parameters near the standard values without fine tuning the model as our main objective is to study the effect of tides on the spreading of mow surface forcing was similar as described in marsland et al 2003 the omip climatology röske 2001 was used for the atmospheric surface forcing this data set combines the advantages of using the same forcing for every model year while maintaining a realistic short term variability on daily time scale heat fluxes and evaporation are calculated using bulk formula with prescribed atmospheric quantities and actual model sea surface temperature sst the only direct restoring term used in this model setup is surface salinity restoring to the phc 2 1 climatology steele et al 2001 the ocean initial state was taken from the same climatology the parameter values employed in the mpiom span10 runs are listed in table 1 3 results 3 1 baseline experiments two baseline experiments have been performed with the span10 setup in experiment tide the full ephimeridic luni solar tidal potential was activated in experiment notide it was not this is the only difference between these two experiments both experiments were integrated for 13 years this turned out to be sufficient to ensure that the oceanographic fields in the eastern na reflect the model physics and not the initial conditions a list of experiments can be found in table 2 3 2 tides in the global span10 müller et al 2010 already demonstrated the ability of the global mpiom to properly simulate ocean tides the span10 configuration of mpiom also succeeds in depicting a satisfactory representation of the main tidal waves in the na for validation purposes we performed a least square harmonic analysis of sea level on a 1 year long chunk of model output from experiment tide fig 3 a presents the simulated m2 partial tide which is the dominant tidal component in the north atlantic the agreement between mpiom span10 m2 tide and that obtained from accurate tidal models is reasonable in the na for a climate model this can be observed comparing the m2 cotidal chart simulated by mpiom span10 fig 3a to that obtained from the global high resolution tidal model hamtide taguchi et al 2014 with data assimilation shown in fig 3b the m2 tide travels as a sort of kelvin wave rotating counter clockwise around the central na amphidromic point the increase in amplitude towards the northwestern european shelf and the labrador sea is properly represented the amphidromic systems are well captured especially in the central north atlantic the 3 major amphidromic systems of the north sea southern bight german bight and southwest norwegian coast the iceland faroe rise the denmark strait the baffin bay west of greenland and the gulf of st lawrence some of the amphidromic points are slightly shifted the central north atlantic is displaced to the northwest causing in some cases their degeneration baffin bay and denmark strait at the same time mpiom span10 simulates key features of the tides in the goc and the sog in a realistic manner fig 4 shows a detailed m2 cotidal chart reproducing the two main features noted by candela et al 1990 from bottom pressure observations in the sog i the m2 amplitude decreases by more than 50 from the atlantic to the mediterranean side but it is otherwise uniform across the strait and ii in contrast the lines of constant phase cotidal lines are mostly oriented east west along the channel those features were confirmed by the high resolution models of tejedor et al 1998 1999 and sannino et al 2004 they found a two fold west to east decrease in amplitudes and a southwestward propagation within the sog with a nearly 20 phase difference between gibraltar and cape espartel from ne to sw across the strait and a 10 north to south phase difference at the atlantic side therefore the mpiom span10 m2 spatial structure fig 4 is very close to that well known from tidal gauge data and tidal local models candela et al 1990 already noticed that the m2 phase propagation observed in gibraltar is in clear opposition to the north atlantic deep water tide west of the strait which propagates northward raising the question on the matching between both tidal patterns in our results the sog acts as a source point but its influence is limited to the easternmost goc an area of nearly constant phases and amplitudes characterizes the central goc to the west of the goc the m2 tide becomes more progressive diffracting around cape s vicente and retaining maximum amplitude values at the head of the goc in accordance with quaresma and pichon 2013 fig 5 displays a comparison of the simulated m2 tidal current ellipse parameters with those obtained from two vertical arrays of four current meters moored at the goc instituto español de oceanografía indamar ieo es in the framework of the european project canigo two mooring arrays were located to the south of cape s vicente at 36 29 n 8 51 w and 36 22 n 8 49 w with a water depth of 2030 and 2880 m respectively see fig 6 the full time series covers a period from 14 06 1997 to 21 08 1998 with hourly resolution sufficient to perform a harmonic analysis for the characterization of the main tidal components mpiom span10 reasonably well simulates the observed vertical structure of the m2 tidal currents it slightly underestimates their small amplitude but it properly reproduces the eccentricity of the tidal current ellipses ratio of the semi minor and semi major axes the sense of rotation given by the sign of the semi minor axis negative clockwise and their vertical structure with minimum amplitudes and an abrupt change of phases at intermediate mow depths in general the model simulation adequately represents the effect of stratification on the vertical structure of the observed m2 current velocities fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the modelled depth averaged m2 tidal current ellipses in the goc along strait large amplitude tidal currents are found in the sog in agreement with observations candela et al 1990 and local tidal models e g tejedor et al 1998 1999 sannino et al 2004 west of the sog there is an interesting transitional pattern between the na goc and the sog tidal regimes with a strong decrease in tidal current amplitude and a veering in the orientation of the tidal current ellipses in the goc the wavy pattern of the current ellipses field is easily noticeable this interesting feature has been first noticed by quaresma and pichon 2013 using a regional 32 0 to 46 0 n and from 16 0 to 1 0 w barotropic version of hycom bleck 2002 they interpret these wave like structures as a consequence of along shelf tidal wave modulation by evenly spaced bathymetry features the interaction of the barotropic tide with these bottom topography features leads to the generation of internal tides müller et al 2012 demonstrated using a 0 1 resolution mpiom configuration stormtide that with the inclusion of tidal forcing in a global ogcm the model was capable of simulating mode 1 internal tides in the world ocean li et al 2015 showed that this holds also for mode 2 internal tides with a shorter wave length of 45 80 km camarinal sill the main sill of the sog represents one of the most extreme examples of internal tide generation e g morozov et al 2002 these oscillations are more evident at the transition layer between the atlantic and mediterranean waters which is often identified with an isohaline between 37 0 and 37 5 psu bray et al 1990 1995 bryden et al 1994 a hovmøller diagram of model salinity fig 7 at camarinal sill shows that the model places the mean interface contoured lines show 37 0 white and 37 5 black isohalines around 120 m depth e g bray et al 1990 1995 sannino et al 2002 and reproduces the spring neap cycle and diurnal inequality of the large tidal vertical oscillations of the atlantic mediterranean interface the modelled mean depths and standard deviations of the 37 0 and 37 5 isohalines at camarinal sill are 106 27 m and 130 30 m respectively these results are in good agreement with those obtained from previous modelling studies e g wang 1993 izquierdo et al 2001 sannino et al 2004 vlasenko et al 2009 sánchez garrido et al 2011 and observational campaigns for comparison bray et al 1990 identified the atlantic mediterranean interface with the 37 5 psu isohaline on the basis of observational data from the gibraltar experiment 1985 1986 kinder and bryden 1987 at camarinal sill they reported a mean interface depth of around 120 m with m2 oscillation amplitudes ranging from 30 to 50 m increasing from north to south using the same data set bryden et al 1994 chose the 37 0 psu isohaline as the interface at camarinal sill and found that it oscillated vertically with a standard deviation value of 47 m bray et al 1995 placed the mean interface depth at camarinal sill between 100 and 125 m corresponding to the 37 2 psu isohaline using five cross strait hydrographic sections repeated several times and also belonging to the gibraltar experiment 1985 1986 this comparison shows that the model simulates properly the internal tide in the sog however the horizontal resolution is too poor to generate the existing short period large amplitude internal waves mpiom span10 also reproduces the existence of internal tides in the goc generated mostly at gorringe bank and s vicente spur fig 8 in full agreement with the location of hotspots for the generation of the m2 internal tide reported by quaresma and pichon 2013 3 3 effect of tides on the ocean climate in the goc fig 9 shows five salinity sections from east to west across the sog and goc as indicated in fig 2 displayed is the annual mean salinity of the last year of experiment tide at the eastern side of the sog fig 9a the atlantic mediterranean interface is placed at the correct depth shallower at the north due to coriolis acceleration in agreement with observations e g bryden et al 1994 bray et al 1995 to the west the mediterranean outflow becomes less salty due to mixing and entrainment with ambient waters and sinks gradually to an equilibrium depth of 1100 m at c santa maria first as a bottom current and finally as a slope bounded undercurrent the mediterranean undercurrent which turns north after passing the cape of s vicente the results from experiment tide on both mow location and properties in the sog and the goc are in good agreement with the climatological data from the world ocean data base supp mat fig s1a and with previously published salinity sections in the eastern goc ochoa and bray 1991 baringer and price 1997 in contrast results from experiment notide show clear differences to climatological data already in the eastern goc section c in supp mat fig s1b the differences increase substantially towards the west a similar behaviour is observed for temperatures fig s2 direct comparison of the results from experiments tide and notide reveals the effect of tides figs 10 a and b show the salinity field at approximately the mow depth 1143 m for both experiments in year 13 starting from the same initial conditions both experiments reproduce the mow salinity anomaly in the eastern na both experiments show a finer structure than the lower resolution 0 25 climatology fig 10c and somewhat higher salinities in the western periphery off the iberian peninsula however while the fields from experiment tide better resemble the climatological salinity distribution experiment notide shows a too salty tongue from the goc to the southwest fig 10b which is at odds with the pathways of mow spreading derived from observations or climatological data analysis e g zenk and armi 1990 daniault et al 1994 iorga lozier 1999a bower et al 2002 carracedo et al 2014 see also our scheme in fig 1 baringer and price 1997 and iorga and lozier 1999 used the 36 25 psu isohaline as the minimum limit for defining the mow outflow in the goc and estimated the maximum width of the mow plume as 65 and 50 km respectively in very good agreement with experiment tide result fig 10 black isohaline the origin of this excessive southward salt flux in experiment notide is related to a gradual increase in the salinity of the goc at mow depths during the course of the simulation the goc becomes saltier and the salinity surplus propagates southwestward as a mid depth salinity front a meridional cross section through the goc at 8 w fig 11 further illustrates the differences between the tide fig 11a and notide fig 11b experiments in this area in both runs the mow core depth of 1100 m is slightly too shallow compared to observations fig 11c and the double salinity core is not reproduced these are caveats common to other mow simulations e g treguier et al 2003 jia et al 2007 and in our case they are likely related to an excessive entrainment favoured by the staircase topography treguier et al 2003 papadakis et al 2003 demonstrated that a shallower mediterranean undercurrent produces higher meddy activity and artale et al 2003 concluded that the vertical position of mw could have an impact on the structure of amoc however ivanovic et al 2013 showed that for a proper amoc simulation it is necessary to attain a mow plume centered at 1000 m as long as the mow depth is similar in both experiments and around 1100 m this misrepresentation will have no impact on our evaluation of the role of tides in mow spreading remarkably in experiment notide the mow plume is not a wall bounded gravity current spreading along the iberian continental slope but rather a mid depth salinity anomaly extending to the south of the goc fig 11b this striking difference between the experiments in the pattern of mow spreading into the na is fully attributable to the inclusion of the tidal potential in the tide control experiment temperature sections fig s3 reproduce the same patterns as salinity there are two potential non exclusive causes for this effect of tides on the ocean climate in the goc the first and well known cause is that tides have a strong effect both on the properties and on the amount of mow exiting the sog due to the intense tidal mixing and the correlation between horizontal tidal currents and interface vertical excursions see fig 7 apparently the effect of tidally induced mixing in the sog on mow properties was first proposed by seidler 1968 and has been studied in several papers and shown to be of considerable importance bryden et al 1994 report an important contribution of tidal fluctuations at the sog to the mean exchange flows which has an estimated mean value in the range from 0 67 to 1 78 sv bryden et al 1994 in our experiments the inclusion of tides produces an increase in the mean water exchange at camarinal sill section sog from 0 9 sv notide to 1 5 sv tide and a decrease of the salt transport to the goc from 1 21 psu sv notide to 1 10 psu sv tide table 3 this result agrees with the modelling study of sannino et al 2004 who found that the effect of the semidiurnal tide is to increment the mean transport by about 30 the second potential cause for the differences between the two experiments is the effect of tides on the spreading of the mow within the goc indeed there are clear differences in the time mean velocity fields at 1143 m depth between the tide and notide experiments fig 12 that are consistent with the respective salinity distribution shown in fig 10 experiment tide fig 12a presents an open cyclonic circulation with westward currents at the iberian slope and increasing velocities between cape s vicente and gorringe bank guaranteeing an efficient export of mow to the tagus abyssal plain mostly through the gap between s vicente spur and gorringe bank bower et al 2002 estimated mean velocities between 0 1 0 2 m s 1 in this area on the basis of rafos floats similar values have been reported by barbosa et al 2015 from adcp measurements taken during semane2000 campaing section 04 at 8 44 w further the mow core meanders west and northwest propagating the themohaline anomaly at intermediate depths along the african slope the flow is mostly poleward supplying fresher antarctic intermediate water aaiw barton 1989 machín and pelegrí 2009 this circulation pattern is close to the classical view e g zenk and armi 1990 daniault et al 1994 iorga and lozier 1999b that has been confirmed by more recent studies e g carracedo et al 2014 the notide fig 12b experiment depicts a very different velocity field with much less small scale structure and a dominant southwestward flow which is in disagreement with all observational and climatological evidence there is a clear correspondence between the velocity and the salinity fields in both experiments and it is evident that the tide solution is much better than the notide one however it is not obvious what ruins the notide solution does the difference in water and salt exchanges through the sog drive the circulation changes in the goc or do tidally induced differences in the goc circulation generate a different mow spreading pattern in the remainder of this paper we will address this question by performing a set of additional experiments where we exclude the effect of changes in amount and properties of mow transport through the sog 3 4 closed strait fixed water source experiments the difference between experiments tide and notide shows the effect of tides both in the sog as well as in the goc to be able to isolate the effect of tides in the goc a new set of experiments was carried out with a closed sog and a fixed water source fws a continuous water source 0 8 sv 38 5 psu 13 c was placed at the bottom of the first cell 354 m depth in the atlantic side of the sog in order to easier trace the spreading of the fws water a passive tracer was included in these simulations marking the prescribed mow source water this setup guarantees that we have identical salt water and tracer flow into the goc for the fws tide and fws notide experiments and that the only differences between these two experiments are due to tidally induced effects outside the sog especially in the goc the bathymetry file was modified to artificially close the sog as spin up the closed strait model configuration was run for 1 year without prescribed source of mow starting from year 13 of experiment tide this procedure removed the mow from the goc starting from this second spin up state two experiments were integrated for 8 years with prescribed fws with fws tide and without tidal forcing fws notide following we present results averaged over the last year of the fws experiments the fws experiments show the same mow spreading pattern as those with an open sog baseline while the source water tracer field in the fws tide experiment fig 13 a reproduces the accepted mow spreading pathways fig 1 the results from experiment fws notide fig 13b indicate a clearly unrealistic southward salt flux the goc gets gradually saltier at mid depths and the salinity excess propagates to the southwest the correspondence between the fws tracer fields and the baseline salinity fields fig 10 is more than evident the results from the two fws experiments clearly indicate that the modification of the mean water exchange flows by intense tidal mixing and tidal rectification in the sog is not decisive for the changes in the mow spreading pattern between the tide and notide experiments moreover differences in tracer fields from fws tide and fws notide fig 13 are closely related to changes in the circulation pattern within the goc fig 14 the velocity fields in experiments fws tide and fws notide to a large extent mimic those of the tide and notide baseline experiments resulting in the tidal cases in a further westward transport of mow along the iberian slope this demonstrates that tidally induced processes within the goc are causing the differences in the spreading of mow in the goc between experiments tide and notide additionally the time evolution of the source water plume in fws tide and fws notide see animation 1 in supp mat is closely linked to the velocity fields and shows differences already at initial stages when it is too early for changes in density field to cause a substantial impact on the dynamics notide experiments with increased values of vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity show an impact on mow vertical structure but do not change the preference for a southwestward spreading this points toward tidally induced circulation changes as cause of the difference in advective tracer transport the prime suspect is tidally induced residual current in the following section we will investigate this mechanism 3 5 tidally induced residual currents in the goc the advective transport mechanism in order to test the hypothesis that the changes in the spreading of mow due to inclusion of tides are dominated by advection through the tidally induced residual currents we determined the residual currents from two short additional sensitivity experiments we run the closed sog span10 configuration without any water source no water source experiments nws with and without tidal forcing experiments were started from the same spin up as fws experiments and then the model was run for 13 months with and without tidal forcing without any water source nws tide and nws notide from the last 12 months of these experiments we calculated the tidal residual velocity and sea surface height ssh fields fig 15 shows the depth integrated tidal residual velocity between the sea surface and 1858 m depth and tidal residual ssh in the goc the modelled tidal residual velocity field is closely related to the contours of tidal residual ssh which in turn are linked to bottom topography see fig 16 a the tidal residual ssh field is characterized by two depressions right south of cape s vicente and east of gorringe bank see d1 and d2 in fig 16a each associated with a corresponding depth integrated cyclonic residual circulation in the upper 1858 m fig 15 the largest tidal residual currents at 1143 m depth up to 3 cm s 1 are located at the slopes of gorringe bank gb and around s vicente spur svs west of portimao valley see fig 2 or fig 16a for locations thus these tidally induced residual currents might be responsible for the differences in mow spreading in the tide and notide control experiments they provide a more efficient advective export of mow to the na from the goc in the tide experiment conversely the lack of this tidal residual transport causes an accumulation of mow in the goc which results in gradually increasing salinity at mid depths ultimately this salinity anomaly will propagate as a salinity front to the southwest following the north african slope to check the validity of the proposed mechanism as initial trigger we used the high frequency 3456 s output of the first 2 years of fws tide and fws notide the fixed water source as 0 8 sv 38 5 psu 13 c tracer 1 0 to calculate offline the advective tracer transport fti across northwestern and southwestern boundaries enclosing the goc fig 16a 1 f t i 0 l h ζ v i t r i d z d s i t f w s t i d e i n t f w s n o t i d e where v i and tri are velocity and tracer concentration l is the length of the boundary and h and ζ are the local depth and free surface elevation respectively the zonal across the solid line i e between gorringe bank gb and s vicente spur svs and meridional dotted line tracer transports fig 16a show clear differences between the fws tide black line and fws notide red line runs with the fws tide tracer exiting the goc mainly through the gb svs section positive values indicate fluxes out from the goc as reported from observations bower et al 2002 report that most of the amuse floats 60 exited the goc through the gb svs section over the two years presented the evolution of the advective tracer transports shows a clear seasonality indicative of the importance of the atmospheric forcing in the goc circulation at depth carracedo et al 2014 tracer export from the goc is more efficient in the fws tide case being always larger across the northwestern boundary than across the southwestern conversely fws notide tracer transport is larger across the southwestern boundary and very small across the western boundary indicative of artificial southwestward spreading of mow in the goc eventually fws notide simulates negative tracer transport across the gb svs section pointing to a recirculation of mow exiting through the southwestern boundary the radical difference in mow spreading pathways from the goc is readily seen in fig 17 showing the fws tide fws notide difference in tracer concentration averaged over year 2 along de goc box boundaries we have also recalculated the fws notide tracer transport adding the constant 3d tidal residual velocity field obtained from the nws experiments vres to the time varying fws notide velocity vnt fig 13b c grey lines and using the fws notide tracer fields tr nt according to eq 2 2 f t r 0 l h ζ v res v nt t r n t d z d s the result approaches the transport calculated from fws tide with a preferred pathway between gb and svs this convergence is more evident after the first year when the tracer concentration along the boundaries is larger this confirms that advection with the tidal residual currents is the main contributor to the observed differences in mow spreading in the goc between our tidal and no tidal experiments the fws experiments were repeated for different source water properties denser and lighter source waters different water source production rates from 0 5 sv to 1 2 sv and with varying viscosity diffusion and bottom friction coefficients in all tested cases the results remain at large unchanged when tidal forcing is not present the goc gets extremely saltier at mid depths and mow flows in excess to the southwest along the north african shelf slope this unrealistic behaviour is corrected when tidal forcing is included this set of additional experiments not shown confirmed our hypothesis that the difference in the spreading of mow in the goc in experiments tide and notide is essentially determined by tidally induced processes in the goc 4 discussion the strong effect of tides on the exchange through the sog by enhanced mixing and tidal rectification has been widely recognized recently sannino et al 2015 investigated the role of tides in the mediterranean thermohaline circulation by means of a pair tide no tide of numerical experiments with an eddy resolving mitgcm configuration the results suggest that the inclusion of explicit tidal forcing in an eddy resolving mediterranean model has non negligible effects on the simulated circulation besides the intensification of local mixing processes however the influence of tides on the spreading of mow in the goc has been much disregarded despite the fact that mow flows as a narrow slope undercurrent in the mesotidal goc where the continental shelf and slope change abruptly direction and present marked bathymetric irregularities which can trigger strong nonlinear interactions on the other hand the importance of topography interaction and mixing on the mow plume adjustment in the goc e g price and baringer 1994 peliz et al 2007 sánchez el al 2017 is well established the inclusion of tides obviously improves the simulated spreading of mow in the goc and the na advection by the residual currents contributes to this improvement as our fws sensitivity experiments clearly demonstrate tidal impact on mean circulation has been observed at a basin scale in other mpiom configurations sein et al 2015 weber and thomas 2017 using a pure barotropic model quaresma and pichon 2013 also identified gorringe bank and s vicente spur as the locations with larger m2 tidal residual currents in the goc their residual currents are smaller than those we present here however it is known that in case of stratification tidal rectification and tidal mixing intensify the residual currents maas and zimmerman 1989 chen et al 1995 indeed recent studies report the existence of tidal residual currents of significant magnitude kurapov et al 2010 in a process study with the regional ocean modelling system roms demonstrated that moderate internal tides horizontal velocities o 10 1 ms 1 can induce differences in the subinertial velocity field of the same order of magnitude through the changes in the bottom boundary layer variability resulting in a larger bottom stress and divergence in the reynolds stresses associated with the baroclinic tidal flow more recently musgrave et al 2017 reported the generation of time mean flows by tides of up to 0 15 ms 1 in some regions of the mendocino ridge with complex topography and even hypothesized that such tidally induced circulations may play a role in the lateral spreading of water masses from the ridge crest into the ocean s interior the unrealistic southwestward spreading of mow in the goc and in the na found in the notide experiments is a problem found in several global or basin scale models without tides jia et al 2007 investigated an explicit mediterranean atlantic exchange through a wide open sog in the global occam model they focused on the behaviour of mow in the na and remarkably their bias pattern of the salinity field at mow depths closely resembles that of our notide experiment with salinities as high as 36 5 g kg at 30 n off the north african coast their fig 10a gary et al 2011 also observed a similar anomalous presence of mediterranean waters between 25 n and 40 n in the eastern atlantic in the 1 12 flame output according to our results it starts with a less efficient evacuation of mow through the western boundary of the goc this produces a mow accumulation with a subsequent southwestward spreading along the north african coast which finally triggers the collapse of a poleward fresher flow along the african coast barton 1989 and blocks the northward penetration of aaiw whose core is slightly shallower the importance of an adequate supply of fresher aaiw for a proper mediterranean water formation at the goc is supported by the analysis of hydrographic data provided by iorga and lozier 1999a b by the cluster analysis data presented by machín and pelegrí 2009 and by the climatologically based study of carracedo et al 2014 cutting the freshwater supply that would entrain underlying salty mow at the goc iorga and lozier 1999a b leads to an additional gradual salinification in the goc and a disruption of the water mass structure and circulation in the eastern boundary na however limited area models have been able to properly simulate the spreading of mow along the sw iberian margin while simulating a realistic water exchange through the sog without accounting for tides e g papadakis et al 2003 drillet et al 2005 serra et al 2005 2010 peliz et al 2007 2013 xu et al 2007 bozec et al 2011 barbosa et al 2015 this apparent contradiction seems to indicate that an appropriate choice of open boundaries conditions close to the gulf of cádiz and or the use of variable horizontal mixing bottom friction relaxation or restoring can play a role similar to that of the explicit inclusion of tidal forcing in our experiments this is compatible with the causal chain that according to our results leads to the degeneracy of the solution in the notide experiment 1 less efficient mow export through the western boundary of the goc 2 gradual increase of salinity in the goc 3 southwestward propagation of the salinity anomaly 4 suppression of the poleward flow supplying fresher water to the goc 5 further salinity increase in the goc limited area models offer a number of options to avoid any of the first three steps of this causal chain among them prescribing parameterizing the outflow through the sog reducing the mow inflow into the goc or enhancing the westward export of mow via varying bottom friction or horizontal diffusivity restoring salinity to climatology or by the open boundary conditions sponge zones in the limited area models therefore limited area models can be successful without explicitly including tides our results demonstrate that in our model setup the inclusion of explicit tidal forcing alone is able to correct the excessive southwestward spreading of mow reducing the biases in the northeast atlantic using a global ocean model we ensure that the model results in the goc are not affected by information provided through the open boundary conditions tides may affect mow spreading and properties through enhanced mixing or tidally induced residual currents indeed mixing between the mediterranean outflow and the atlantic ambient waters takes place over a small distance a few tens of km and depends strongly on bottom topography price and baringer 1994 jungclaus and mellor 2000 however according to quaresma and pichon 2013 and to our modelling results topography does not only have an influence on mixing but also on the spatial structure of the tidal wave and the residual currents which in turn might be originated by tidal mixing e g chen et al 1995 this is evident in fig 6 where a pivotal point in the field of m2 tidal current ellipse parameters is located in the portimao valley this divergence in the orientation of the semimajor axes fig 6 is also observed in tidal modelling results of quaresma and pichon 2013 where it is accompanied by a nearly 180 phase difference in maximum m2 tidal velocities from west to east of the portimao valley this is exactly the area with the largest values of the tidally induced residual current velocities which closely follow the sea surface height residual field fig 15 the tracer transport calculations fig 16 point out that the tidal residual currents play a lead role 5 summary and conclusions mow spreads as a basin scale salinity anomaly at about 1000 1200 m depth through the na forming the mediterranean salinity tongue after exiting from the sog it transits as a narrow slope bounded gravity plume the complex topography of the goc therefore small scale processes and local scale nonlinear interaction with tides and topography may have an impact on the mow properties and its further spreading pattern in the na to investigate the impact of tides on the mow spreading it is necessary to take into account a wide range of spatial and temporal scales which we have done by simultaneously resolving the local scale processes at the sog and the goc and the larger scale processes which may influence the na climate by means of using a highly zoomed setup of the global mpiom with explicit simulation of tides the mpiom simulation of the mow is successful in the sense that the depth and properties of the mow core are properly reproduced after the 13 year long baseline experiments while the experiment including tides resemble better the climatology and the established mow spreading pathways the experiment without tidal forcing simulates an excess of salinity at mow depths in the goc which triggers a non realistic southward salt flux this spreading of mow along the african slope suppresses the supply of fresher aaiw by the poleward undercurrent on the eastern boundary this feedback further enhances the salinity increase and the southwestward spreading of mow the resulting salinity bias pattern is common to some other global or basin scale models that do not include tides a series of process study targeted numerical experiments was designed in order to reveal the mechanisms responsible for such differences in the mow simulations with and without tides from a detailed analysis of the experiments high frequency output we were able to conclude that the tidal residual currents likely generated by the interaction of tides with local scale topography play a major role in the spreading of mow in the goc according to our results tidal residual currents contribute to the advection of mow west from the goc allowing them to pass the gap between s vicente spur and gorringe bank the zenk and armi 1990 mediterranean gateway as supported by observations this is not happening in the runs without tidal forcing instead the reduced efficiency in the evacuation of mow from the goc results in a gradual salinity increase at mow depths which sets up the already mentioned southwestward salt flux additional support to our conclusions is given by the model skills to properly reproduce different aspects of the tidal dynamics in the goc the surface tide tidal currents and internal wave generation and propagation have been satisfactorily compared to observations therefore to properly understand the impact that local processes acting on mow in the goc and the sog have on the larger scale it is necessary to study the mediterranean sea and the north atlantic ocean as a unique system accounting for relevant local and small scale processes and also for the atmospheric feedbacks which is considered as a milestone challenge artale et al 2006 legg et al 2009 in all our experiments the tidal runs show a more northward

24063,ocean surface winds determine energy material and momentum fluxes through the air sea interface accounting for wind variability in time and space is thus essential to reliably analyze and simulate ocean circulation and the dynamics of marine ecosystems here we present an assessment of surface winds from three widely used atmospheric reanalysis products ncep ncar era interim and jra 55

surface wind stress its curl and estimates of induced vertical upwelling velocity across global and regional scales with added emphasis on the main eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems ebues all

ekman pumping fidelity with respect to a reference reanalysis based on blended satellite and buoy observations ccmp v2 0 improved in more recent higher resolution products like jra 55 and era interim adjustments applied when deriving ocean forcing data sets from atmospheric reanalysis robustly improved wind speed and wind stress vectors but degraded wind stress curl and implied ekman upwelling in two of the three ocean forcing products considered dfs v5 2 and core v2 1 at regional scales we found significant inconsistencies in equatorial and polar regions as well as in coastal areas in ebues

seasonal cycles and contrasting patterns of low frequency variability within each ebue including the presence of sudden changes in mean upwelling only for some products taken together our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainties in wind forcing into ocean simulation experiments and retrospective analysis and of correcting reanalysis products for ocean forcing data sets

introduction ocean surface winds determine air sea heat and gas exchanges as well as the transfer of momentum between the lower atmosphere and the surface ocean e g large and yeager 2009 accurate wind vector fields are thus necessary to analyze and to simulate ocean circulation and the dynamics of marine ecosystems bourassa et al 2010 however current limitations in available observational and reanalysis wind products result in a disparate range of estimates that fail to meet the quality levels required to quantify air sea fluxes bradley and fairall 2006 smith et al 2011 kent et al 2013 the

the context of ocean model experiments these biases generate spurious perturbations of ocean dynamics that limit the ability to identify actual ocean model deficiencies griffies et al 2009 2016 wind biases are particularly acute at land ocean boundaries where both land contamination of ocean winds and the coarse resolution of atmospheric models result in weak winds and altered wind stress curl

from three widely used atmospheric reanalysis products ncep ncar era interim and jra 55 and their corresponding ocean forcing data sets core v2 1 dfs v5 2 and jra55 do which include corrections for use in ocean simulations table 1 after the validation of reference satellite wind products using in situ buoy observations we conducted a detailed analysis featuring deviations among atmospheric

oceanic regions finally we examined in more detail the four largest ebues humboldt benguela canary and california focusing on the presence and consistency of low frequency variation reflected in temporal trends and shifts in coastal upwelling taken together the analysis aims to inform ocean modelers about the potential biases and long term changes that can be expected while using alternative atmospheric forcing products in ocean modelling experiments emphasizing coastal areas and upwelling ecosystems of high interest for the management of living marine resources 2 materials and methods the assessment compared four different types of wind data sets table 1 i reference wind estimates based mainly on satellite data provided an approximate baseline to assess the quality of reanalysis products ii atmospheric reanalysis products derived from data assimilation experiments which are widely used by the oceanographic and climatic communities and iii ocean forcing data sets constructed by applying corrections to atmospheric reanalysis data sets which are used mainly by the ocean model community finally we also used iv direct observations recorded by buoys and coastal stations to assess reference data sets and the overall approach hereafter we will also refer to data sets ii and iii above just as standard and adjusted reanalysis respectively 2 1 satellite wind data we used two complementary satellite based reference data sets to assess the quality of and differences between surface winds in atmospheric reanalysis and ocean forcing data sets see table 1 we retrieved the third version of quikscat seawinds scatterometer data set oct 1999 oct 2009 liu et al 2010 available at the jet propulsion laboratory jpl l2b v3 12 5 km http podaac jpl nasa gov quikscat fore et al 2014 this data set provides surface relative equivalent neutral winds at a standard height of 10 m inverted from quikscat backscatter measurements using ricciardulli and wentz s 2011 geophysical model function ku 2011 in scatterometry the equivalent neutral wind is defined as the wind speed expected under neutrally stable atmospheric conditions of temperature and humidity liu and tang 1996 robinson and fangohr 2010 even when its calculation is based on the stress and roughness length consistent with observed atmospheric stratification see kara et al 2008b for definitions used in other contexts the ku 2011 model was calibrated to match windsat all weather retrievals meissner and wentz 2009 and it provides improved wind estimates at high speeds relative to previous reprocessings the jpl product includes further improvements that allowed use of wind retrievals as close as 10 km from the coast and reduced directional noise fore et al 2014 we considered quikscat as a reference to assess regional and local wind patterns and especially coastal winds preparation of quikscat data started with the retrieval of individual swaths containing already geolocated and rain corrected wind vectors at the finest spatial resolution available for the quikscat jpl v3 product at the global scale l2b 12 5 km fore et al 2014 we excluded rain contaminated measurements and applied a vectorial 3 x 3 median filter to reduce noise as recommended by fore et al 2014 before binning the 12 5 km observations into a regular 0 25 grid using vector averages we grouped observations in ascending and descending passes before estimating all derived wind quantities from 0 25 data the quikscat orbit ensures a daily coverage of 93 of the ocean surface chelton and freilich 2005 hoffman and leidner 2005 although accuracy decays especially under rain conditions or in the presence of sea ice milliff et al 2004 chelton and freilich 2005 masking rain flagged observations results in an uneven coverage of the surface ocean introducing biases in regions with high precipitation rates or with a seasonal ice cover we complemented the high resolution quikscat satellite data with version 2 0 of the cross calibrated multi platform reanalysis ccmp v2 0 wentz et al 2015 produced and maintained by remote sensing systems rss http www remss com measurements ccmp ccmp v2 0 is a reanalysis product that combines passive microwave radiometer and active scatterometer satellite data with conventional wind measurements from moored buoys using two dimensional variational analysis hoffman et al 2003 atlas et al 2011 the variational scheme combines all available observations with background winds from era interim reanalysis see table 1 which provide an initial guess for the estimation of the underlying wind field the resulting estimates combine the strengths of different satellite sensors radiometers and scatterometers sampling from different orbits with those of the other data sources to fill spatial and temporal gaps and to decrease the overall error with respect to satellite and reanalysis inputs hoffman et al 2013 the main caveat of ccmp v2 0 is that by seeking a compromise between different data sources the variational method tends to smooth out high frequency wind variability in space and time captured by scatterometers and buoys respectively atlas et al 2011 wentz et al 2015 in addition there is also an unavoidable bias towards the initial guess when no observations are available and to a lesser extent when there is a large deviation among wind observations and the initial guess both aspects become more important in coastal regions where both satellite wind measurements and the background initial guess are less reliable as a consequence ccmp v2 0 tends to smooth out wind variability close to coast and to underestimate very high wind speeds not present in the background winds i e greater than 25 m s 1 we note also that calibration removes the strict independence of this data set from era interim and its derived ocean forcing data set dfs v5 2 as quikscat ccmp v2 0 provides equivalent neutral winds at standard height of 10 m and relative to the moving surface of the ocean we considered ccmp v2 0 as a reference data set suitable for the assessment of both basin and regional patterns of wind variability 2 2 reanalysis data sets we analyzed surface wind vectors from three widely used atmospheric reanalysis products ncep ncar era interim and jra 55 and their corresponding ocean forcing data sets prepared for ocean modeling experiments core v2 1 dfs v5 2 and jra55 do see table 1 all these products rely on well established data assimilation systems they differ however in their spatial and temporal resolution the weight given to different data sources and the corrections applied to the original data sets all 3 atmospheric reanalysis products were tuned to match wind climatologies using versions of quikscat data that except for jra55 do rely on geophysical model functions now considered obsolete see above and table 1 actual earth relative meteorological winds assimilated by atmospheric reanalysis products were adjusted to equivalent neutral winds at a standard height of 10 m using the bulk formulae in large and yeager 2004 2009 the adjustment to equivalent neutral winds ensured a fair comparison with reference satellite data sets kara et al 2008b kent et al 2013 and the consistent derivation of wind stress vectors and upwelling indices these calculations are very sensitive to assumptions about turbulent fluxes at the air sea interface edson et al 2013 vickers et al 2013 which is one of the reasons behind the adjustment of absolute winds instead of wind stress vectors in ocean forcing data sets here the use of a single atmospheric flux model prevented unnecessary noise yet allowed the direct comparisons of alternative data sets ancillary data required for the atmospheric stability adjustment i e sea level pressure humidity and atmospheric and water temperatures close to the air sea interface were readily available from the output of each reanalysis except in the case of sea surface temperature sst the era interim product includes the prescribed daily averaged sst data used during assimilation but this was not the case for ncep core v2 1 and the jra55 products so we linearly interpolated a subset of the noaa daily optimum interpolation 0 25 sst analysis version 2 see reynolds et al 2007 and www ncdc noaa gov oisst to ensure temporal homogeneity reynolds and chelton 2010 we used the avhrr only product based on advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr data from the pathfinder version 5 dataset casey et al 2010 as illustrated by kara et al 2008b and kent et al 2013 atmospheric stability accounts to a large extent for the low wind bias of reanalysis winds with respect to equivalent neutral satellite winds over warm waters in tropical regions where the impact of stability adjustments is more important liu et al 1979 fairall et al 2003 it is also important to note that under calm weak wind conditions diurnal variation in ocean surface temperature can further enhance atmospheric instability kawai and wada 2007 although available data prevented the inclusion of diurnal variation in sst into our analyses a comparison of neutral winds from buoy data see below based on hourly versus daily averaged sst suggested a limited impact on the monthly and longer term averages examined here the atmospheric stability adjustment was performed on model forecasts at the highest spatial and temporal grid spacing and time step available for each reanalysis data set then we homogenized the resulting equivalent neutral wind fields to a 0 25 regular grid matching the ccmp v2 0 product to do that we used optimal interpolation assuming a constant anisotropic squared exponential covariance function kako et al 2011 1 c d x d y exp ϕ x 2 d x 2 ϕ y 2 d y 2 where the subscripts x and y indicate zonal and meridional directions d is geodetic distance taking wgs84 as the reference ellipsoid and ϕ is a decay parameter we set the value of ϕ equal to the inverse of the distance between adjacent grid cells for different reanalysis products table 1 accounting for changes in ϕx with latitude we only included in the interpolation up to 100 nearest neighbors around each pixel location wind speed components were interpolated independently these choices assure low computational cost smoothness of the interpolated fields and preserve the fine detail features in the original data the interpolation step was included to compare different products on a common grid and to resemble calculations performed by an atmosphere ocean model coupler during ocean model simulations the choice of a 0 25 grid spacing is also consistent with the refined grid spacing of climate scale simulations that have become more common e g delworth et al 2012 the interpolation considered only pixels located in the ocean i e land pixels were excluded resembling kara et al s 2008a creeping sea fill methodology which uses a weighted mean of the immediate oceanic nearest neighbor locations to avoid land contamination of coastal winds 2 3 in situ buoy and station data sets we further assessed the analysis of gridded wind field data sets using in situ direct measurements recorded by autonomous meteorological buoys and coastal stations maintained by noaa s national buoy data center nbdc http www ndbc noaa gov and by the pacific marine environmental laboratory pmel http www pmel noaa gov meteorological buoys and ground stations maintained by nbdc focus on the monitoring of coastal and offshore weather the global tropical moored buoy array gtmba project office at pmel coordinates meteorological buoys around the three tropical oceans located far offshore i e pirata bourles et al 2008 tao triton mcphaden et al 1988 and rama mcphaden et al 2009 we retrieved daily averaged wind vectors and synchronous measurements of air and sea surface temperature humidity and sea level pressure slp since most gtmba buoys were not equipped with a barometer we imputed the missing slp observations with linearly interpolated estimates from the analysis step of nasa merra2 reanalysis gelaro et al 2017 the remarkable ability of merra2 to assimilate slp observations recorded by buoys r 0 98 and a slight positive bias of 23 2 pa lends support to the interpolation to locations with no slp data the ancillary meteorological data were used to adjust meteorological winds recorded by the buoys to equivalent neutral stability winds at the standard height of 10 m using the bulk formulae in large and yeager 2004 2009 although a few buoys were equipped with acoustic sensors to retrieve surface currents we made no attempt to correct the observed earth relative winds lastly we retained only observations with the highest quality flags which resulted in 88 ndbc and 98 gtmba locations with data available to parallel the processing of the other data sources daily equivalent neutral winds at 10 m wind stress and derived metrics were averaged at the monthly scale months with less than 15 days of full observations were excluded before taking monthly averages of winds and derived indices see below a data base of matchups with each gridded data set was built using linear interpolation although we required an overlap of at least 36 months to compare data from a buoy with a reanalysis or satellite data sets the resulting monthly time series had an average length of 110 months range 36 to 243 although we note that the length of matchups was much shorter for quikscat i e mean 74 months maximum 122 months 2 4 data processing and derived quantities we followed the same procedure to analyze both satellite and reanalysis data after gridding or interpolating equivalent neutral wind data to a 0 25 grid with the objective of constructing monthly and annual climatologies of i wind stress ii wind stress curl and iii its divergence iv ekman pumping and v a wind based index of coastal upwelling we calculated wind stress at the highest temporal resolution available for each product to prevent the underestimation of monthly averages which were reserved for further analysis first we derived wind stress τ n m 2 from equivalent neutral wind vectors u n m s 1 using the bulk formula τ ρ a i r c d u n u n where ρair is air density fixed to 1 223 k g m 3 assuming a mean atmospheric temperature of 15 4 c and cd is the drag coefficient that was estimated as a function of u n based on large et al 1994 i e 10 3 c d 2 70 u n 1 0 142 0 0764 u n wind stress curl τ and wind stress divergence τ were estimated using centered derivatives spanning two 0 25 cells pickett and paduan 2003 spatial gradients in wind stress might cause surface divergence or convergence that results in open ocean upwelling or downwelling e g stewart 2008 we estimated ekman pumping as the vertical velocity wcurl m s 1 at the base of the ekman layer following risien and chelton 2008 2 w c u r l 1 ρ s w τ f 1 ρ s w f τ β f τ x where ρsw is seawater density 1025 k g m 3 f is the coriolis parameter β is the latitudinal gradient in f s m 1 and τx is the zonal component of wind stress positive eastwards only locations poleward from 5 of latitude were considered finally we calculated a rough estimate of alongshore coastal upwelling qupw m 3 s 1 based on seaward ekman transport t m2s 1 integrated along a segment of coast of a given length l 1 m using bakun s1973 upwelling index 3 q u p w t l τ a l ρ s w f where τa is the alongshore component of wind stress acting along the segment of coastline l to derive τa the mean coastal orientation within each 0 25 pixel location was estimated from a finer resolution regularized coastline derived from a landmask based on etopo1 one minute cell side amante and eakins 2009 mean vertical upwelling velocity wcoast m s 1 at the base of the ekman layer can then be derived directly as the ratio of transport and the rossby radius of deformation w c o a s t t r d pickett and paduan 2003 rd was interpolated from chelton et al 1998 data available online 1 1 global atlas of the first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation and gravity wave phase speed http www po coas oregonstate edu research po research rossby radius it is important to note that in all the quantities described above nonlinearities and correlations among pairwise differences in wind speed components lead to the magnification of small discrepancies among reanalysis wind products when comparing derived quantities 2 5 analysis of wind reanalysis products we structured the assessment in two steps focusing first on the fidelity of global scale spatial patterns in open ocean waters before zooming in on coastal shelf regions where we further examined long term variability in eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems ebues as detailed above we regarded ccmp v2 0 and quikscat satellite winds as references to assess and contrast the performance of different wind reanalysis products in open and coastal waters respectively in both cases we homogenized the time resolution of different wind products by averaging high frequency daily or subdaily wind data to the monthly scale the use of monthly wind estimates is consistent with our interest in analyzing mean and seasonal patterns and low frequency trends however the approach admittedly excluded from our analysis diurnal cycles which can be important for coastal upwelling and smoothed the impact of extreme winds associated with storms and mesoscale systems before conducting any comparison among the gridded data sets we compared the different products against monthly time series of equivalent neutral wind speed and wind stress at 10 m calculated from buoy observations these time series are not strictly independent satellites are calibrated against buoy winds and all the reanalysis products analyzed here assimilate buoy observations although we used short term winds forecasts table 1 however the comparison provides an assessment of the fidelity of each data set to real world observations 2 5 1 basin scale patterns we used simple summary statistics bias mean absolute and relative deviations and pearson product moment correlations to characterize potential differences and the degree of temporal and spatial coherence among reanalysis and reference wind products at the global scale we considered two alternative periods to estimate climatologies of wind variables and to calculate summary statistics depending on the longest shared time span among the data sets used as a reference table 1 i e oct 1999 oct 2009 or aug 1987 dec 2015 for quikscat and ccmp v2 0 n 122 and 341 months respectively we also analyzed regional summaries to highlight potential inconsistencies affecting large areas using spalding et al s 2012 biogeographical classification of marine pelagic provinces fig b 1 the nature conservancy 2012 this set of analysis allowed us to assess i the overall performance of different reanalysis data sets and ii the efficiency of bias correction adjustments used to prepare data sets for ocean modeling experiments 2 5 2 coastal shelf ecosystems we conducted a more detailed assessment of different wind reanalysis products in coastal regions where we can expect a larger impact of atmospheric resolution and adjustment procedures on product performance we relied in this case on spalding et al s 2012 coastal provinces to prepare regional summaries of differences among wind products fig b 2 then we extended the analysis above to consider how different wind products resolve long term patterns of variability in the four major ebues humboldt benguela canary and california e g barber and smith 1981 specifically we analyzed monthly time series of upwelling indices averaged over the main upwelling cells within the four ebues which match the following ecoregions defined by spalding et al s 2007 central peru namib saharan upwelling and northern california see detail plots in fig b 2 we followed a bayesian approach to analyze the resulting time series using a dynamic linear model dlm west and harrison 1997 to account for the expected superposition of slow moving trends stochastic climatic oscillations and contamination by measurement noise see section appendix a for further details the dlm model included a slow varying component to account for changes in the mean level of each series and an autoregressive component capturing cyclical variability associated with the seasonal cycle and with lower frequency recurrent interannual patterns posterior model based simulations of assimilated states and model parameters were used to derive estimates of i overall mean upwelling intensity and ii its variability iii the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and iv the average rate of change based on the theil sen slope of the estimated trend component e g wilcox 2010 in the four major ebues wind time series reflect both long term climate trends in wind intensity and stratification associated to changes in atmospheric pressure systems and in ocean heat content bakun 1990 lluch cota et al 2014 and external noise associated with large scale recurrent patterns of climate variability like el niño e g smith et al 2001 both sources of variability remain largely uncertain and a matter of concern in upwelling regions in part due to the limitations inherent to the measurement and modeling of wind fields lluch cota et al 2014 garcía reyes et al 2015 in this sense our analysis can assess the consistency of local trends among different products that ultimately determine inferred conclusions about climate change effects and regime shift behavior e g rocha et al 2014 3 results 3 1 comparison with in situ data the assessment of the gridded data sets with respect to direct observations recorded by automated meteorological buoys and coastal stations from nbdc and gtmba highlighted the high quality of all the products assessed fig 1 the average of mean absolute deviations across locations was below 1 m s 1 and 0 02 n m 2 for monthly equivalent neutral wind speed and wind stress respectively all products showed a relatively good agreement with in situ data in offshore locations especially around the tropical oceans performance degraded close to the shore although both the shorter duration of coastal records median length of 79 months for nbdc vs 144 for gtmba and the potential confounding due to local conditions demand a cautious interpretation the analysis of in situ data confirmed ccmp v2 0 as a robust reference product in the open ocean it presented generally small deviations that were almost homogenously distributed in space fig 1 a and i the other reanalysis and ocean forcing products were inferior in coastal areas around north america and showed a slight degradation in tropical areas which was more apparent in ncep and core e g panels c d k and l in fig 1 beyond these differences the performance of the modern products based on era interim and jra 55 was comparable to ccmp v2 0 although it is important to note that all of them assimilate buoy observations table 1 finally the analysis revealed quikscat biases in tropical areas affected by high precipitation rates i e the larger deviations observed in the tropical pacific around 10 n in fig 1 b and j a pattern that seem to emerge also in adjusted ocean forcing data sets right column in fig 1 3 2 open ocean winds all products captured variation in surface equivalent neutral winds across major oceanographic features e g r 0 90 for any combination of climatological means in fig 2 and fig 3 difference maps averaging deviations in monthly means across time however revealed both large and small scale discrepancies with respect to ccmp v2 0 the reference wind product for open ocean waters fig 4 see also fig b 3 to fig b 5 in section appendix b for correlation and difference maps among ocean forcing data sets for the standard reanalysis products the comparison highlighted a consistent underestimation of equivalent neutral wind speed and wind stress magnitude in ncep and in era interim but not in jra 55 i e negative entries in table 2 deviations were particularly strong in the eastern tropical pacific and in the equatorial atlantic and in the polar seas including deep convection areas in the labrador and around greenland as well as south of the polar front in the southern ocean left column panels in fig 4 all products showed larger relative deviations for meridional components of equivalent neutral wind speed and wind stress than for the corresponding zonal vector table 2 there was also a tendency to overestimate wind forcing along many coastal areas especially in regions featuring strong circulation e g boundary currents in fig 4 adjustments applied during the preparation of ocean model forcing products to account for biases in standard reanalyses resulted in an improved fit halving relative deviations in almost all cases table 2 curiously some adjustments had a non linear impact on wind biases such that some regions with overly weak wind biases in the original reanalysis developed overly strong wind biases after the adjustments this effect was more acute in the tropics where it resulted in the overestimation of neutral wind speed over much of the north pacific subtropical gyre panels b d and f in fig 4 the comparison of quikscat winds with ccmp v2 0 which is more reliable under rain conditions subsection 2 1 resulted in a similar pattern of stronger winds north of the equator and suggested that quikscat biases might have propagated during the adjustment from standard reanalyses to adjusted ocean forcing products fig b 3 the shift in the intensity of trade winds was also apparent in time series of average wind stress around the equator in the tropical pacific fig 5 a pattern that has a strong impact on global heat uptake balmaseda et al 2013 england et al 2014 all products featured a consistent negative trend in the intensity of the trade winds between 0 004 and 0 007 n m 2 decade 1 r 0 95 between products see also fig b 4 the degree of the fidelity among different wind products and satellite data sets paralleled increases in reanalysis resolution table 2 there was a clear improvement in quality from the relatively old coarse scale ncep ncar winds to the recently released high resolution jra55 products regional summaries confirmed this pattern while also highlighting the high consistency of climatological equivalent neutral wind speed patterns across products fig 6 average relative deviations were below 10 over most of the ocean for all reanalyses and they were even lower for adjusted ocean forcing data sets however nonlinear propagation of deviations in equivalent neutral wind vectors magnified differences for wind stress and derived upwelling indices with larger deviations affecting extensive areas such as the southern ocean and along the equator fig 7 there was also a curious interaction among model resolution and the application of the adjustments used to prepare ocean forcing data sets that affected major ocean gyres and transitional regions wind stress curl its divergence and ekman pumping presented larger deviations over these areas for estimates based on ocean forcing data sets than for the original atmospheric reanalysis products fig 7 and table 2 this interaction is in part a consequence of latitudinal gradients in the factors applied to correct wind vectors these deviations were further magnified by the overestimation of the strength of zonal wind stress especially in subtropical gyres fig b 4 see also above the effect is more severe in core v2 1 and dfs v5 2 than in adjusted jra 55 fields which employed a more elaborate adjustment procedure and presented an overall better quality table 2 model resolution and adjustments made for ocean forcing data sets also contributed to improve the ability of different products to capture persistent small scale features in ocean winds fig 8 and fig b 6 these features can be better appreciated in high resolution surface relative quikscat winds since they are associated with permanent fronts and mesoscale features with islands and coastal mountain ranges and with strong surface currents chelton et al 2004 for instance fig 8 e depicts changes in the wind field associated with the great barrier reef numerous island wakes in melanesia and intricate patterns associated with the antarctic circumpolar current including a permanent eddy south of new zeland examining the resemblance of persistent small scale features between quikscat and the other products reveals that jra55 do represented these features with a fidelity similar to ccmp e g compare detail patterns in fig 8 a and fig b 6 a where the correlation with quikscat fields panel b is r 0 48 both for jra55 do h and ccmp v2 0 correlation drops to the range 0 18 0 39 for the other products despite exceptions commented above increased model resolution and secondarily adjustments contributed in general to reduce wind biases however some important deviations remained in all products examined especially in boundary systems and marginal seas under the influence of coastal processes 3 3 coastal ocean winds in contrast to open ocean areas the fidelity of wind reanalysis products with respect to the reference satellite data sets varied extensively along the coastal ocean i e relative errors often above 10 in fig b 7 and fig b 8 adjustments in ocean forcing data sets improved the match with satellite wind fields in coastal areas especially for core v2 1 an average 62 decrease in bias compared to ncep vs 40 for dfs v5 2 and jra55 do however both higher resolution jra55 products performed better than the other reanalysis data sets even before the adjustment the large scale biases detected in oceanic regions were also apparent close to the coast particularly across the labyrinthine indo pacific connection fidelity to satellite based spatial wind gradients was also negatively impacted by the adjustments resulting in a weakened wind stress curl and upwelling with respect to original atmospheric reanalysis products 3 3 1 coastal ocean winds and upwelling in ebues coastal winds and upwelling patterns varied greatly among reanalysis and ocean model forcing winds in the four largest ebues table 3 and fig 9 estimates of potential upwelling velocities derived from wind stress and coastal topography varied up to one order of magnitude with weaker upwelling velocities inferred from reanalysis products than from satellite data median relative deviation δ 0 34 and 0 18 w r t quikscat for ekman pumping and coastal upwelling respectively however satellite based estimates also varied considerably ekman pumping was stronger in ccmp v2 0 than in quikscat δ 0 60 but coastal upwelling was weaker δ 0 18 consistent with the expected coastal drop off in reanalysis winds although the match between quikscat and ccmp v2 0 was far from perfect their overall coherence provides confidence on patterns found for ccmp v2 0 which will be considered the default reference data set unless otherwise stated the adjustments applied to standard reanalysis products improved the agreement of ocean forcing data sets with satellite data for coastal upwelling decreases in the absolute value of δ from 0 32 to 0 05 w r t quikscat but reduced agreement for ekman pumping δ tripled from 0 17 to 0 53 this latter result is consistent with the degradation of wind stress curl estimates noted above the adjustment was particularly problematic for era interim and dfs v5 2 increasing discrepancies with both satellite references and other reanalyses no single product outperformed the others on all ebues in humboldt and benguela all products had significant biases in seasonal and long term variation patterns table 3 at california and canary jra55 do products provided realistic upwelling indices that resembled satellite observations δ 0 25 in general the analysis of trends in the time series of upwelling indices confirmed regional differences among products and revealed large contrasts among temporal patterns of long term variability table 3 fig 10 and fig 11 according to ccmp v2 0 the average intensity of ekman pumping and alongshore coastal upwelling increased in all ebues with an average increase clearly above zero in all cases except for ekman pumping in humboldt ecosystem at canary and california credible intervals for coastal upwelling trends covered negative values only marginally for upwelling table 3 trends in the intensity of coastal upwelling were in general of similar magnitude that changes in ekman pumping mean change per decade in table 3 corresponding to 10 of the mean for trends different from zero however the direction and magnitude of trends varied across standard and adjusted reanalyses with no region having consistent positive or negative trends table 3 low frequency trends in upwelling indices were more coherent in california and in canary than in benguela and humboldt where many products were anticorrelated fig 10 and fig 11 even where the trends were coherent the expected amount of change in upwelling differed among data sets e g the relative increase in alongshore upwelling in california was much lower in reanalysis winds than in satellite products table 3 in general adjustments did not provide a better match to the reference data set than the original atmospheric reanalysis in some cases adjustments lead to opposite trends e g contrasting trends for jra55 products in benguela or to the disappearance of some features e g the change of level in the mean of jra 55 in humboldt and benguela around 1998 99 the time series decomposition was unable to capture stochastic oscillations beyond the seasonal scale with an evident effect of enso on inferred trends at humboldt and california the theil sen procedure reduced to a large extent the impact of subdecadal oscillations like enso on the overall trend estimate at each ebue unfortunately we were unable to discern the impact of long term climate modes like the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 or the pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua et al 1997 4 discussion the characterization of ocean winds remains an open challenge that limits our ability to analyze and simulate ocean circulation and marine ecosystems bourassa et al 2010 encouragingly our assessment of oceanic winds produced by widely used atmospheric reanalysis products tracks a clear progression in the quality of assimilated winds that reflects a continued improvement in observation and data assimilation systems and in climate modeling kalnay et al 1996 griffies et al 2009 brodeau et al 2010 liu et al 2010 dee et al 2011 fore et al 2014 kobayashi et al 2015 wentz et al 2015 there was a clear ranking of the performance of different reanalysis products with the most recent high resolution products derived using 4d assimilation schemes like jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 and era interim dee et al 2011 outperforming the seminal coarse scale ncep ncar products kalnay et al 1996 our analyses highlighted also some weaknesses common to all products like the lack of agreement with reference estimates in coastal areas and the sometimes deleterious impact of simple adjustment strategies that do not take into account spatial variability in the following we discuss these issues and extract some recommendations to account for the uncertainty surrounding the characterization of ocean winds before this however we comment on the major limitations of our assessment and how these affect the robustness of the results presented 4 1 limitations of our assessment a major limitation of the assessment presented here was the assumption that the two satellite wind products provide a valid reference to assess the reliability of atmospheric wind reanalysis products the approach adopted here was indeed more pragmatic than orthodox since satellite winds serve as an input of data assimilation systems and in the case of ccmp v2 0 analyzed winds provide a first guess to interpolate satellite data atlas et al 2011 wentz et al 2015 the last aspect seems relatively unimportant although there was in general a good agreement between ccmp v2 0 and era interim the two products demonstrate levels of independence similar to the other products beyond the problems highlighted above the reference data sets provide a useful although not perfect baseline to assess similarities and differences among atmospheric wind reanalysis products the assessment of the different products with data recorded by autonomous meteorological buoys and coastal stations added further support to the choice of ccmp v2 0 as a reference data set and confirmed to some extent the lack of agreement found in tropical regions however there are indications suggesting that some of the differences among reanalysis products arise from biases in the reference products for instance the large positive deviations relative to ccmp v2 0 prevailing for all reanalysis products in tropical and subtropical coastal regions might be partially explained by biases in ccmp v2 0 due to the suboptimal performance of passive microwave radiometer sensors in these areas i e problems with the atmospheric correction of ssm i suggested by atlas et al 2011 while rain contamination and irregular sampling coverage complicate the interpretation of quikscat data in tropical and subtropical coastal regions chelton and freilich 2005 the better agreement among reanalysis products and quikscat suggest that the fidelity of renanlyses with actual winds may be better than the ccmp v2 0 comparison indicates the definition of winds with respect to a fixed or a moving surface can also explain some of the differences observed among reanalysis and satellite wind products large deviations in western boundary systems and in other areas with intense currents can be explained in part by the assumption of a nonmoving ocean in earth relative meteorological winds kelly et al 2001 chelton et al 2004 here we assumed a perfect match with surface relative satellite winds as an advantage since it simplifies the retrieval of wind stress from wind speed kara et al 2007 thus this issue is mainly important for the assessment of standard atmospheric reanalysis products since we expect adjustments to account for differences due to surface currents and waves concomitant to satellite measurements the last major limitation was the choice of a monthly scale to compare winds among different products the choice of a monthly scale preserves large scale patterns including seasonal variability and long term trends targeted in our analyses nonetheless this excluded from our analysis diurnal cycles and smoothed to a large extent the impact of extreme winds associated with storms and mesoscale systems 4 2 assessment of available ocean forcing wind products the assessment produced several particularly robust results despite the limitations discussed in the previous section the most recent high resolution products derived using 4d assimilation schemes like jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 and era interim dee et al 2011 generally performed better than the seminal coarse scale ncep ncar products kalnay et al 1996 importantly ncep ncar products only assimilate sparse wind observations from buoys and voluntary ships whereas the incorporation of synoptic spatial wind fields based on satellite data and the growing network of in situ ground observations has contributed to improve wind quality in more recent reanalysis bourassa et al 2010 trenberth et al 2010 on the other hand known problems in the calibration of quikscat e g ricciardulli and wentz 2011 fore et al 2014 also generated differences among products in tropical areas experiencing high precipitation rates biases were particularly enhanced during the adjustments employed to generate core v2 1 and dfs v5 2 see e g milliff et al 2004 the more complicated adjustment employed to produce jra55 do tsujino et al 2018 based on a careful match of satellite and model observations and on the use of state of the art quikscat winds ricciardulli and wentz 2011 worked particularly well and resulted in a lower bias product with realistic spatial wind patterns considering the overall performance of ccmp v2 0 and its ability to preserve high resolution spatial patterns present in quikscat fields future adjustments might consider as well the incorporation of ccmp v2 0 wentz et al 2015 4 3 open ocean winds an important aspect of our analysis was the focus on differences in wind patterns relevant to ocean circulation and ecosystem functioning this focus allowed us to highlight how the nonlinear magnification of relatively small deviations in wind speed results in important differences in surface wind stress its curl and inferred vertical upwelling velocity risien and chelton 2008 kent et al 2013 larger deviations in meridional winds relative to those estimated for zonal components e g smith et al 2011 contribute to the magnification of differences in wind stress and derived metrics there were also striking changes associated with the adjustments made for ocean forcing data sets like the switch from a strong to weaker wind stress curl patterns following the adjustment of reanalysis winds although these biases were less important in jra55 do the magnitude of the deviations found suggest the need to improve current adjustment schemes setting wind stress vectors as the target instead of wind speed and approaches matching spatial gradients and patterns of temporal variability may address issues raised in our analysis the lack of agreement among reanalyses and observations was particularly important in tropical regions suggesting that the choice among alternative wind products might lead to contrasting inferences about trends in surface warming and in ocean heat uptake associated to the strengthening of trade winds balmaseda et al 2013 england et al 2014 richter 2015 or long term changes in enso dynamics wittenberg 2004 realistic wind stress curl gradients are also important to simulate circulation and transport patterns in the equatorial region e g richter et al 2012 tseng et al 2016 similarly we can expect altered nutrient fluxes in the tropics that might have an important impact on the characterization of ocean biogeochemical processes anav et al 2013 differences in wind strength among ocean forcing products were also important in polar and subpolar latitudes there were important differences in estimated winds both in deep convection areas in labrador sea and around greenland in the north atlantic as well as along the path of the antarctic circumpolar current these changes have the potential to impact both the rate of formation of deep waters as well as upwelling in the southern ocean compromising analysis and simulations of the global overturning toggweiler and russell 2008 wang et al 2014 the low reliability of southern ocean winds has been highlighted before in analysis featuring other reanalysis products e g smith et al 2011 suggesting a prevailing limitation in the assimilation of wind observations although evaluating the impact of observed differences in wind forcing is beyond the scope of this contribution ongoing efforts in the context of cmip6 omip will include a set of experiments featuring the comparison of corev2 1 and jra55 do forced runs griffies et al 2016 4 4 coastal ocean winds in coastal regions assimilated winds give lower estimates of upwelling than those based on satellite products in most locations even after the adjustment of wind speed we suspect this decrease is due to the contamination of wind measurements by weaker winds over land as well as a consequence of the coarse representation of the ocean land transition and of coastal topography in atmospheric models capet et al 2004 reanalysis products were in general unable to capture wind stress curl patterns something that degrades the ability to reproduce realistic upwelling patterns in coastal areas small et al 2015 and subsequent ecological impacts chelton 1982 rykaczewski and checkley 2008 indeed the larger deviations found in humboldt and benguela ebues might partially explain why these ecosystems remain a challenge both for ocean and coupled climate modeling zuidema et al 2016 another interesting result was the contrasting patterns of long term variability in the main ebues of the world ocean analyses of satellite data were in general coherent with the expected increase in upwelling favorable winds under increased atmospheric pressure gradients as climate warms bakun 1990 sydeman et al 2014 wang et al 2015 garcía reyes et al 2015 the analyses highlighted even a marginal increase in intensity for the canary upwelling that remains highly disputed barton et al 2013 sydeman et al 2014 see also cropper et al 2014 and sousa et al 2017 however reanalysis products showed contrasting trends again especially in humboldt and benguela although the foundational hypothesis by bakun 1990 postulated that land sea differences in the pace of atmospheric warming would enhance air pressure gradients and thus promote an increase in the intensity of alongshore winds and coastal upwelling this idea has been progressively refined to reveal a more complex picture where the poleward migration of high pressure atmospheric systems plays a prominent role in recent changes in upwelling patterns belmadani et al 2014 rykaczewski et al 2015 the interaction of large scale changes in atmospheric circulation with coastal orientation cropper et al 2014 ocean circulation and turbulent mixing blanke et al 2005 gruber et al 2011 oerder et al 2015 contribute to observed spatial heterogeneity and in some areas even to a reversal of expected upwelling trends or to counterintuitive biogeochemical responses as upwelling intensity increases renault et al 2016 ebues are prone to regime shifts involving the collapse of fisheries and transitions in kelp ecosystems hare and mantua 2000 verheye 2000 alheit and niquen 2004 and changes in upwelling intensity interact with other major concerns like coastal hypoxia and acidification grantham et al 2004 feely et al 2008 reanalysis products capturing trends in upwelling are necessary to accurately explore these challenges and to develop a mechanistic understand that allow us to identify optimal management practices and to anticipate future impacts stock et al 2011 hoegh guldberg et al 2014 lluch cota et al 2014 regrettably none of the adjustments universally addressed limitations inherent to coastal environments in this way the best practice to navigate across different reanalysis and satellite products for coastal applications should probably include an assessment based on local observations and downscaling approaches e g kanamitsu and kanamaru 2007 4 5 summary overall our results revealed the ability of state of the art wind reanalysis to produce high quality wind patterns at different spatial and temporal scales this assessment encourages continued use of these products both in retrospective analysis and in ocean simulation experiments nevertheless differences among products recommend careful consideration of large uncertainties in wind forcing particularly in coastal regions and to test the sensitivity of derived results to the choice of wind product in particular our results favor the use of reanalysis products already adjusted for large scale biases which are currently preferentially used only by ocean modelers while noting that there is ample room to improve correction strategies across ocean relevant wind properties despite the continued improvement in the quality of wind data sets

harrison gfdl provided valuable comments and discussion on earlier versions of the manuscript we also acknowledge constructive and detailed reviews by three anonymous reviewers appendix a details on the analysis of coastal time series of upwelling indices we analyzed time series of upwelling indices to characterize and compare long term variation among different wind products the superposition of slow moving trends stochastic climatic oscillations and contamination by measurement noise suggested the use of a dynamic linear model dlm approach west and harrison 1997 petris et al 2009 we fitted a dlm to noisy wind time series zt that included i a local first order polynomial component xt to account for potential trends ii an autoregressive ar component ht which captures remaining autocorrelation and quasicyclical oscillations accounting for the seasonal cycle and recurrent patterns of interannual variability and iii a noise component ζ that accounts for measurement error and model inadequacy z t x t h t ζ t ζ t n 0 σ ζ 2 x t x t 1 ν t ν t n 0 σ ν 2 h t k 1 p a k h t k η t η t n 0 σ η 2 where the error term ζ follows a mean zero gaussian distribution with variance σ ζ 2 that determines the likelihood of a given parameterization of the model the local first order polynomial trend is equivalent to a random walk or locally constant mean process with variance σ ν 2 which captures slow moving trends in the data as an accumulation of small short term shocks to the mean level the ar component is also defined by the variance of stochastic innovations σ η 2 and by the vector of autoregressive coefficients ak whose dimension p was regarded also as a random parameter the model was fitted under a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo simulation methods mcmc robert and casella 2004 gelman et al 2014 the procedure involved two sequential updating steps by conditioning alternately on estimates of model parameters and on estimates of the state process west and harrison 1997 these steps were repeated 40 000 times dismissing the first 30 000 warmup updates to ensure convergence and thinning the remainder 10 000 iterations to retrieve 1000 posterior samples of the posterior distribution of model parameters and states the posterior distribution of states xt and ht was updated based on filtered and smoothed estimates using petris et al s 2009 r library dlm which implements the robust svd kalman filter proposed by zhang and li 1996 remainder model parameters were estimated using metropolis within gibbs steps with weakly informative priors gelman et al 2014 measurement and process noise variances for the trend were updated using conjugate steps by assuming half cauchy priors with a large scale parameter τ 0 25 gelman 2006 the parameters of the ar component were estimated following the reversible jump mcmc approach of vermaak et al 2004 this approach allowed us to determine model order p interactively usual steps with no change in p were complemented with updates assessing proposals with either a one unit increase or decrease in p we assumed a truncated poisson prior distribution to include the constrain p 1 30 the parameter of this prior was adjusted dynamically by an uninformative gamma hyperprior using the same mixture as in vermaak et al 2004 reflection coefficients ak and the ar innovation variance σ η 2 were updated using standard conjugate normal gamma steps reinforcing stationarity using simple rejection sampling parameter estimates were summarized using posterior 95 central intervals based on sample quantiles trends were further summarized by retrieving theil sen slope estimates based on assimilated states for the linear growth component estimated trends were also compared and grouped across datasets using cluster analysis finally we used west s 1997 constructive decomposition method to examine the potential existence of other underlying trends and cyclical components in the ar component this method relies on a reparameterization of dlms to a canonical form based on the eigenvalues of the model evolution matrix g west and harrison 1997 prado and west 2010 in the case of ar models the method results in an additive superposition of first order short memory ar 1 components corresponding to each of the real eigenvalues of g and to autoregressive moving average arma 2 1 components corresponding to conjugate imaginary eigenvalue pairs λe iω the arma 2 1 component represent quasi cyclical oscillations with period 2π ω and time varying amplitude and phase west and harrison 1997 prado and west 2010 this component targets the characterization of a varying seasonal cycle and of recurrent patterns of interannual variability like climate modes and teleconnection patterns on the other hand the slow moving trend targets directed changes in the mean level of each wind time series that show no apparent periodicity we expect those trends to reflect long term changes associated to warming trends although given the short length of the time series analyzed we cannot ensure that trends are not confounded by long term climate modes like the pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua et al 1997 or the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 the combination of inference on slow trends and on quasi cyclical components allowed us to characterize long term variations in the mean level and seasonality of different wind indices statistical model fitting was implemented in r r core team 2017 making extensive use of libraries mvtnorm genz and bretz 2009

24063,ocean surface winds determine energy material and momentum fluxes through the air sea interface accounting for wind variability in time and space is thus essential to reliably analyze and simulate ocean circulation and the dynamics of marine ecosystems here we present an assessment of surface winds from three widely used atmospheric reanalysis products ncep ncar era interim and jra 55 and their corresponding ocean forcing data sets core v2 1 dfs v5 2 and jra55 do which include corrections for use in ocean simulations we compared wind patterns most relevant to ocean circulation surface wind stress its curl and estimates of induced vertical upwelling velocity across global and regional scales with added emphasis on the main eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems ebues all products provided consistent large scale patterns in surface winds and wind stress although agreement was reduced for indices involving the calculation of spatial derivatives like wind stress curl and ekman pumping fidelity with respect to a reference reanalysis based on blended satellite and buoy observations ccmp v2 0 improved in more recent higher resolution products like jra 55 and era interim adjustments applied when deriving ocean forcing data sets from atmospheric reanalysis robustly improved wind speed and wind stress vectors but degraded wind stress curl and implied ekman upwelling in two of the three ocean forcing products considered dfs v5 2 and core v2 1 at regional scales we found significant inconsistencies in equatorial and polar regions as well as in coastal areas in ebues upwelling favorable winds were weaker in atmospheric reanalysis products and ocean forcing data sets than estimates based on ccmp v2 0 and quikscat all reanalysis products featured lower amplitude seasonal cycles and contrasting patterns of low frequency variability within each ebue including the presence of sudden changes in mean upwelling only for some products taken together our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainties in wind forcing into ocean simulation experiments and retrospective analysis and of correcting reanalysis products for ocean forcing data sets despite the continued improvement in the quality of wind data sets prevailing limitations in reanalysis models demonstrate the need to confirm global products against regional measurements whenever possible and improve correction strategies across multiple ocean relevant wind properties keywords atmospheric reanalysis coastal upwelling ekman pumping ocean forcing datasets remote sensing winds 1 introduction ocean surface winds determine air sea heat and gas exchanges as well as the transfer of momentum between the lower atmosphere and the surface ocean e g large and yeager 2009 accurate wind vector fields are thus necessary to analyze and to simulate ocean circulation and the dynamics of marine ecosystems bourassa et al 2010 however current limitations in available observational and reanalysis wind products result in a disparate range of estimates that fail to meet the quality levels required to quantify air sea fluxes bradley and fairall 2006 smith et al 2011 kent et al 2013 the presence of biases in wind fields confounds retrospective analysis and limits the ability to characterize the impact of environmental changes within ocean ecosystems e g hoegh guldberg et al 2014 in the context of ocean model experiments these biases generate spurious perturbations of ocean dynamics that limit the ability to identify actual ocean model deficiencies griffies et al 2009 2016 wind biases are particularly acute at land ocean boundaries where both land contamination of ocean winds and the coarse resolution of atmospheric models result in weak winds and altered wind stress curl fields relative to observations capet et al 2004 kara et al 2008a small et al 2015 subsequent decreased coastal upwelling contributes to the warm sea surface temperature biases of climate models in eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems ebue large and danabasoglu 2006 richter 2015 weak coastal winds also impact key biogeochemical processes by decreasing nutrient fluxes and biological production in coastal shelf ecosystems around the world e g anav et al 2013 despite their reduced extent coastal areas support 90 of global fish catches and play an important role in the biological pump simpson and sharples 2012 improving the representation of coastal processes in ocean models has been identified as a major priority for an improved assessment of climate change impacts on living marine resources stock et al 2011 hoegh guldberg et al 2014 changes in production and transport associated with fluctuations in upwelling have been identified as one of the key drivers behind marine regime shifts including fisheries collapse the spread of hypoxic conditions enhanced ocean acidification and food web transitions rocha et al 2014 bakun et al 2015 past studies have revealed an increase in upwelling intensity in three of the four largest ebues humboldt benguela and california but not in canary sydeman et al 2014 however these trends mask considerable spatial heterogeneity cropper et al 2014 belmadani et al 2014 rykaczewski et al 2015 and pose considerable uncertainty on the mechanisms behind observed changes in upwelling and its evolution under climate warming lluch cota et al 2014 garcía reyes et al 2015 kämpf and chapman 2016 accounting for uncertainties in wind forcing is necessary to decipher how the interaction between increased stratification ocean circulation and turbulent mixing associated with mesoscale eddies will balance in future oceans blanke et al 2005 gruber et al 2011 oerder et al 2015 small et al 2015 here we present an assessment of surface winds from three widely used atmospheric reanalysis products ncep ncar era interim and jra 55 and their corresponding ocean forcing data sets core v2 1 dfs v5 2 and jra55 do which include corrections for use in ocean simulations table 1 after the validation of reference satellite wind products using in situ buoy observations we conducted a detailed analysis featuring deviations among atmospheric reanalysis and ocean forcing wind products from global to regional extents we focused on quantities of interest for ocean modeling and climate impact assessment addressing biases in open and coastal oceanic regions finally we examined in more detail the four largest ebues humboldt benguela canary and california focusing on the presence and consistency of low frequency variation reflected in temporal trends and shifts in coastal upwelling taken together the analysis aims to inform ocean modelers about the potential biases and long term changes that can be expected while using alternative atmospheric forcing products in ocean modelling experiments emphasizing coastal areas and upwelling ecosystems of high interest for the management of living marine resources 2 materials and methods the assessment compared four different types of wind data sets table 1 i reference wind estimates based mainly on satellite data provided an approximate baseline to assess the quality of reanalysis products ii atmospheric reanalysis products derived from data assimilation experiments which are widely used by the oceanographic and climatic communities and iii ocean forcing data sets constructed by applying corrections to atmospheric reanalysis data sets which are used mainly by the ocean model community finally we also used iv direct observations recorded by buoys and coastal stations to assess reference data sets and the overall approach hereafter we will also refer to data sets ii and iii above just as standard and adjusted reanalysis respectively 2 1 satellite wind data we used two complementary satellite based reference data sets to assess the quality of and differences between surface winds in atmospheric reanalysis and ocean forcing data sets see table 1 we retrieved the third version of quikscat seawinds scatterometer data set oct 1999 oct 2009 liu et al 2010 available at the jet propulsion laboratory jpl l2b v3 12 5 km http podaac jpl nasa gov quikscat fore et al 2014 this data set provides surface relative equivalent neutral winds at a standard height of 10 m inverted from quikscat backscatter measurements using ricciardulli and wentz s 2011 geophysical model function ku 2011 in scatterometry the equivalent neutral wind is defined as the wind speed expected under neutrally stable atmospheric conditions of temperature and humidity liu and tang 1996 robinson and fangohr 2010 even when its calculation is based on the stress and roughness length consistent with observed atmospheric stratification see kara et al 2008b for definitions used in other contexts the ku 2011 model was calibrated to match windsat all weather retrievals meissner and wentz 2009 and it provides improved wind estimates at high speeds relative to previous reprocessings the jpl product includes further improvements that allowed use of wind retrievals as close as 10 km from the coast and reduced directional noise fore et al 2014 we considered quikscat as a reference to assess regional and local wind patterns and especially coastal winds preparation of quikscat data started with the retrieval of individual swaths containing already geolocated and rain corrected wind vectors at the finest spatial resolution available for the quikscat jpl v3 product at the global scale l2b 12 5 km fore et al 2014 we excluded rain contaminated measurements and applied a vectorial 3 x 3 median filter to reduce noise as recommended by fore et al 2014 before binning the 12 5 km observations into a regular 0 25 grid using vector averages we grouped observations in ascending and descending passes before estimating all derived wind quantities from 0 25 data the quikscat orbit ensures a daily coverage of 93 of the ocean surface chelton and freilich 2005 hoffman and leidner 2005 although accuracy decays especially under rain conditions or in the presence of sea ice milliff et al 2004 chelton and freilich 2005 masking rain flagged observations results in an uneven coverage of the surface ocean introducing biases in regions with high precipitation rates or with a seasonal ice cover we complemented the high resolution quikscat satellite data with version 2 0 of the cross calibrated multi platform reanalysis ccmp v2 0 wentz et al 2015 produced and maintained by remote sensing systems rss http www remss com measurements ccmp ccmp v2 0 is a reanalysis product that combines passive microwave radiometer and active scatterometer satellite data with conventional wind measurements from moored buoys using two dimensional variational analysis hoffman et al 2003 atlas et al 2011 the variational scheme combines all available observations with background winds from era interim reanalysis see table 1 which provide an initial guess for the estimation of the underlying wind field the resulting estimates combine the strengths of different satellite sensors radiometers and scatterometers sampling from different orbits with those of the other data sources to fill spatial and temporal gaps and to decrease the overall error with respect to satellite and reanalysis inputs hoffman et al 2013 the main caveat of ccmp v2 0 is that by seeking a compromise between different data sources the variational method tends to smooth out high frequency wind variability in space and time captured by scatterometers and buoys respectively atlas et al 2011 wentz et al 2015 in addition there is also an unavoidable bias towards the initial guess when no observations are available and to a lesser extent when there is a large deviation among wind observations and the initial guess both aspects become more important in coastal regions where both satellite wind measurements and the background initial guess are less reliable as a consequence ccmp v2 0 tends to smooth out wind variability close to coast and to underestimate very high wind speeds not present in the background winds i e greater than 25 m s 1 we note also that calibration removes the strict independence of this data set from era interim and its derived ocean forcing data set dfs v5 2 as quikscat ccmp v2 0 provides equivalent neutral winds at standard height of 10 m and relative to the moving surface of the ocean we considered ccmp v2 0 as a reference data set suitable for the assessment of both basin and regional patterns of wind variability 2 2 reanalysis data sets we analyzed surface wind vectors from three widely used atmospheric reanalysis products ncep ncar era interim and jra 55 and their corresponding ocean forcing data sets prepared for ocean modeling experiments core v2 1 dfs v5 2 and jra55 do see table 1 all these products rely on well established data assimilation systems they differ however in their spatial and temporal resolution the weight given to different data sources and the corrections applied to the original data sets all 3 atmospheric reanalysis products were tuned to match wind climatologies using versions of quikscat data that except for jra55 do rely on geophysical model functions now considered obsolete see above and table 1 actual earth relative meteorological winds assimilated by atmospheric reanalysis products were adjusted to equivalent neutral winds at a standard height of 10 m using the bulk formulae in large and yeager 2004 2009 the adjustment to equivalent neutral winds ensured a fair comparison with reference satellite data sets kara et al 2008b kent et al 2013 and the consistent derivation of wind stress vectors and upwelling indices these calculations are very sensitive to assumptions about turbulent fluxes at the air sea interface edson et al 2013 vickers et al 2013 which is one of the reasons behind the adjustment of absolute winds instead of wind stress vectors in ocean forcing data sets here the use of a single atmospheric flux model prevented unnecessary noise yet allowed the direct comparisons of alternative data sets ancillary data required for the atmospheric stability adjustment i e sea level pressure humidity and atmospheric and water temperatures close to the air sea interface were readily available from the output of each reanalysis except in the case of sea surface temperature sst the era interim product includes the prescribed daily averaged sst data used during assimilation but this was not the case for ncep core v2 1 and the jra55 products so we linearly interpolated a subset of the noaa daily optimum interpolation 0 25 sst analysis version 2 see reynolds et al 2007 and www ncdc noaa gov oisst to ensure temporal homogeneity reynolds and chelton 2010 we used the avhrr only product based on advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr data from the pathfinder version 5 dataset casey et al 2010 as illustrated by kara et al 2008b and kent et al 2013 atmospheric stability accounts to a large extent for the low wind bias of reanalysis winds with respect to equivalent neutral satellite winds over warm waters in tropical regions where the impact of stability adjustments is more important liu et al 1979 fairall et al 2003 it is also important to note that under calm weak wind conditions diurnal variation in ocean surface temperature can further enhance atmospheric instability kawai and wada 2007 although available data prevented the inclusion of diurnal variation in sst into our analyses a comparison of neutral winds from buoy data see below based on hourly versus daily averaged sst suggested a limited impact on the monthly and longer term averages examined here the atmospheric stability adjustment was performed on model forecasts at the highest spatial and temporal grid spacing and time step available for each reanalysis data set then we homogenized the resulting equivalent neutral wind fields to a 0 25 regular grid matching the ccmp v2 0 product to do that we used optimal interpolation assuming a constant anisotropic squared exponential covariance function kako et al 2011 1 c d x d y exp ϕ x 2 d x 2 ϕ y 2 d y 2 where the subscripts x and y indicate zonal and meridional directions d is geodetic distance taking wgs84 as the reference ellipsoid and ϕ is a decay parameter we set the value of ϕ equal to the inverse of the distance between adjacent grid cells for different reanalysis products table 1 accounting for changes in ϕx with latitude we only included in the interpolation up to 100 nearest neighbors around each pixel location wind speed components were interpolated independently these choices assure low computational cost smoothness of the interpolated fields and preserve the fine detail features in the original data the interpolation step was included to compare different products on a common grid and to resemble calculations performed by an atmosphere ocean model coupler during ocean model simulations the choice of a 0 25 grid spacing is also consistent with the refined grid spacing of climate scale simulations that have become more common e g delworth et al 2012 the interpolation considered only pixels located in the ocean i e land pixels were excluded resembling kara et al s 2008a creeping sea fill methodology which uses a weighted mean of the immediate oceanic nearest neighbor locations to avoid land contamination of coastal winds 2 3 in situ buoy and station data sets we further assessed the analysis of gridded wind field data sets using in situ direct measurements recorded by autonomous meteorological buoys and coastal stations maintained by noaa s national buoy data center nbdc http www ndbc noaa gov and by the pacific marine environmental laboratory pmel http www pmel noaa gov meteorological buoys and ground stations maintained by nbdc focus on the monitoring of coastal and offshore weather the global tropical moored buoy array gtmba project office at pmel coordinates meteorological buoys around the three tropical oceans located far offshore i e pirata bourles et al 2008 tao triton mcphaden et al 1988 and rama mcphaden et al 2009 we retrieved daily averaged wind vectors and synchronous measurements of air and sea surface temperature humidity and sea level pressure slp since most gtmba buoys were not equipped with a barometer we imputed the missing slp observations with linearly interpolated estimates from the analysis step of nasa merra2 reanalysis gelaro et al 2017 the remarkable ability of merra2 to assimilate slp observations recorded by buoys r 0 98 and a slight positive bias of 23 2 pa lends support to the interpolation to locations with no slp data the ancillary meteorological data were used to adjust meteorological winds recorded by the buoys to equivalent neutral stability winds at the standard height of 10 m using the bulk formulae in large and yeager 2004 2009 although a few buoys were equipped with acoustic sensors to retrieve surface currents we made no attempt to correct the observed earth relative winds lastly we retained only observations with the highest quality flags which resulted in 88 ndbc and 98 gtmba locations with data available to parallel the processing of the other data sources daily equivalent neutral winds at 10 m wind stress and derived metrics were averaged at the monthly scale months with less than 15 days of full observations were excluded before taking monthly averages of winds and derived indices see below a data base of matchups with each gridded data set was built using linear interpolation although we required an overlap of at least 36 months to compare data from a buoy with a reanalysis or satellite data sets the resulting monthly time series had an average length of 110 months range 36 to 243 although we note that the length of matchups was much shorter for quikscat i e mean 74 months maximum 122 months 2 4 data processing and derived quantities we followed the same procedure to analyze both satellite and reanalysis data after gridding or interpolating equivalent neutral wind data to a 0 25 grid with the objective of constructing monthly and annual climatologies of i wind stress ii wind stress curl and iii its divergence iv ekman pumping and v a wind based index of coastal upwelling we calculated wind stress at the highest temporal resolution available for each product to prevent the underestimation of monthly averages which were reserved for further analysis first we derived wind stress τ n m 2 from equivalent neutral wind vectors u n m s 1 using the bulk formula τ ρ a i r c d u n u n where ρair is air density fixed to 1 223 k g m 3 assuming a mean atmospheric temperature of 15 4 c and cd is the drag coefficient that was estimated as a function of u n based on large et al 1994 i e 10 3 c d 2 70 u n 1 0 142 0 0764 u n wind stress curl τ and wind stress divergence τ were estimated using centered derivatives spanning two 0 25 cells pickett and paduan 2003 spatial gradients in wind stress might cause surface divergence or convergence that results in open ocean upwelling or downwelling e g stewart 2008 we estimated ekman pumping as the vertical velocity wcurl m s 1 at the base of the ekman layer following risien and chelton 2008 2 w c u r l 1 ρ s w τ f 1 ρ s w f τ β f τ x where ρsw is seawater density 1025 k g m 3 f is the coriolis parameter β is the latitudinal gradient in f s m 1 and τx is the zonal component of wind stress positive eastwards only locations poleward from 5 of latitude were considered finally we calculated a rough estimate of alongshore coastal upwelling qupw m 3 s 1 based on seaward ekman transport t m2s 1 integrated along a segment of coast of a given length l 1 m using bakun s1973 upwelling index 3 q u p w t l τ a l ρ s w f where τa is the alongshore component of wind stress acting along the segment of coastline l to derive τa the mean coastal orientation within each 0 25 pixel location was estimated from a finer resolution regularized coastline derived from a landmask based on etopo1 one minute cell side amante and eakins 2009 mean vertical upwelling velocity wcoast m s 1 at the base of the ekman layer can then be derived directly as the ratio of transport and the rossby radius of deformation w c o a s t t r d pickett and paduan 2003 rd was interpolated from chelton et al 1998 data available online 1 1 global atlas of the first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation and gravity wave phase speed http www po coas oregonstate edu research po research rossby radius it is important to note that in all the quantities described above nonlinearities and correlations among pairwise differences in wind speed components lead to the magnification of small discrepancies among reanalysis wind products when comparing derived quantities 2 5 analysis of wind reanalysis products we structured the assessment in two steps focusing first on the fidelity of global scale spatial patterns in open ocean waters before zooming in on coastal shelf regions where we further examined long term variability in eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems ebues as detailed above we regarded ccmp v2 0 and quikscat satellite winds as references to assess and contrast the performance of different wind reanalysis products in open and coastal waters respectively in both cases we homogenized the time resolution of different wind products by averaging high frequency daily or subdaily wind data to the monthly scale the use of monthly wind estimates is consistent with our interest in analyzing mean and seasonal patterns and low frequency trends however the approach admittedly excluded from our analysis diurnal cycles which can be important for coastal upwelling and smoothed the impact of extreme winds associated with storms and mesoscale systems before conducting any comparison among the gridded data sets we compared the different products against monthly time series of equivalent neutral wind speed and wind stress at 10 m calculated from buoy observations these time series are not strictly independent satellites are calibrated against buoy winds and all the reanalysis products analyzed here assimilate buoy observations although we used short term winds forecasts table 1 however the comparison provides an assessment of the fidelity of each data set to real world observations 2 5 1 basin scale patterns we used simple summary statistics bias mean absolute and relative deviations and pearson product moment correlations to characterize potential differences and the degree of temporal and spatial coherence among reanalysis and reference wind products at the global scale we considered two alternative periods to estimate climatologies of wind variables and to calculate summary statistics depending on the longest shared time span among the data sets used as a reference table 1 i e oct 1999 oct 2009 or aug 1987 dec 2015 for quikscat and ccmp v2 0 n 122 and 341 months respectively we also analyzed regional summaries to highlight potential inconsistencies affecting large areas using spalding et al s 2012 biogeographical classification of marine pelagic provinces fig b 1 the nature conservancy 2012 this set of analysis allowed us to assess i the overall performance of different reanalysis data sets and ii the efficiency of bias correction adjustments used to prepare data sets for ocean modeling experiments 2 5 2 coastal shelf ecosystems we conducted a more detailed assessment of different wind reanalysis products in coastal regions where we can expect a larger impact of atmospheric resolution and adjustment procedures on product performance we relied in this case on spalding et al s 2012 coastal provinces to prepare regional summaries of differences among wind products fig b 2 then we extended the analysis above to consider how different wind products resolve long term patterns of variability in the four major ebues humboldt benguela canary and california e g barber and smith 1981 specifically we analyzed monthly time series of upwelling indices averaged over the main upwelling cells within the four ebues which match the following ecoregions defined by spalding et al s 2007 central peru namib saharan upwelling and northern california see detail plots in fig b 2 we followed a bayesian approach to analyze the resulting time series using a dynamic linear model dlm west and harrison 1997 to account for the expected superposition of slow moving trends stochastic climatic oscillations and contamination by measurement noise see section appendix a for further details the dlm model included a slow varying component to account for changes in the mean level of each series and an autoregressive component capturing cyclical variability associated with the seasonal cycle and with lower frequency recurrent interannual patterns posterior model based simulations of assimilated states and model parameters were used to derive estimates of i overall mean upwelling intensity and ii its variability iii the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and iv the average rate of change based on the theil sen slope of the estimated trend component e g wilcox 2010 in the four major ebues wind time series reflect both long term climate trends in wind intensity and stratification associated to changes in atmospheric pressure systems and in ocean heat content bakun 1990 lluch cota et al 2014 and external noise associated with large scale recurrent patterns of climate variability like el niño e g smith et al 2001 both sources of variability remain largely uncertain and a matter of concern in upwelling regions in part due to the limitations inherent to the measurement and modeling of wind fields lluch cota et al 2014 garcía reyes et al 2015 in this sense our analysis can assess the consistency of local trends among different products that ultimately determine inferred conclusions about climate change effects and regime shift behavior e g rocha et al 2014 3 results 3 1 comparison with in situ data the assessment of the gridded data sets with respect to direct observations recorded by automated meteorological buoys and coastal stations from nbdc and gtmba highlighted the high quality of all the products assessed fig 1 the average of mean absolute deviations across locations was below 1 m s 1 and 0 02 n m 2 for monthly equivalent neutral wind speed and wind stress respectively all products showed a relatively good agreement with in situ data in offshore locations especially around the tropical oceans performance degraded close to the shore although both the shorter duration of coastal records median length of 79 months for nbdc vs 144 for gtmba and the potential confounding due to local conditions demand a cautious interpretation the analysis of in situ data confirmed ccmp v2 0 as a robust reference product in the open ocean it presented generally small deviations that were almost homogenously distributed in space fig 1 a and i the other reanalysis and ocean forcing products were inferior in coastal areas around north america and showed a slight degradation in tropical areas which was more apparent in ncep and core e g panels c d k and l in fig 1 beyond these differences the performance of the modern products based on era interim and jra 55 was comparable to ccmp v2 0 although it is important to note that all of them assimilate buoy observations table 1 finally the analysis revealed quikscat biases in tropical areas affected by high precipitation rates i e the larger deviations observed in the tropical pacific around 10 n in fig 1 b and j a pattern that seem to emerge also in adjusted ocean forcing data sets right column in fig 1 3 2 open ocean winds all products captured variation in surface equivalent neutral winds across major oceanographic features e g r 0 90 for any combination of climatological means in fig 2 and fig 3 difference maps averaging deviations in monthly means across time however revealed both large and small scale discrepancies with respect to ccmp v2 0 the reference wind product for open ocean waters fig 4 see also fig b 3 to fig b 5 in section appendix b for correlation and difference maps among ocean forcing data sets for the standard reanalysis products the comparison highlighted a consistent underestimation of equivalent neutral wind speed and wind stress magnitude in ncep and in era interim but not in jra 55 i e negative entries in table 2 deviations were particularly strong in the eastern tropical pacific and in the equatorial atlantic and in the polar seas including deep convection areas in the labrador and around greenland as well as south of the polar front in the southern ocean left column panels in fig 4 all products showed larger relative deviations for meridional components of equivalent neutral wind speed and wind stress than for the corresponding zonal vector table 2 there was also a tendency to overestimate wind forcing along many coastal areas especially in regions featuring strong circulation e g boundary currents in fig 4 adjustments applied during the preparation of ocean model forcing products to account for biases in standard reanalyses resulted in an improved fit halving relative deviations in almost all cases table 2 curiously some adjustments had a non linear impact on wind biases such that some regions with overly weak wind biases in the original reanalysis developed overly strong wind biases after the adjustments this effect was more acute in the tropics where it resulted in the overestimation of neutral wind speed over much of the north pacific subtropical gyre panels b d and f in fig 4 the comparison of quikscat winds with ccmp v2 0 which is more reliable under rain conditions subsection 2 1 resulted in a similar pattern of stronger winds north of the equator and suggested that quikscat biases might have propagated during the adjustment from standard reanalyses to adjusted ocean forcing products fig b 3 the shift in the intensity of trade winds was also apparent in time series of average wind stress around the equator in the tropical pacific fig 5 a pattern that has a strong impact on global heat uptake balmaseda et al 2013 england et al 2014 all products featured a consistent negative trend in the intensity of the trade winds between 0 004 and 0 007 n m 2 decade 1 r 0 95 between products see also fig b 4 the degree of the fidelity among different wind products and satellite data sets paralleled increases in reanalysis resolution table 2 there was a clear improvement in quality from the relatively old coarse scale ncep ncar winds to the recently released high resolution jra55 products regional summaries confirmed this pattern while also highlighting the high consistency of climatological equivalent neutral wind speed patterns across products fig 6 average relative deviations were below 10 over most of the ocean for all reanalyses and they were even lower for adjusted ocean forcing data sets however nonlinear propagation of deviations in equivalent neutral wind vectors magnified differences for wind stress and derived upwelling indices with larger deviations affecting extensive areas such as the southern ocean and along the equator fig 7 there was also a curious interaction among model resolution and the application of the adjustments used to prepare ocean forcing data sets that affected major ocean gyres and transitional regions wind stress curl its divergence and ekman pumping presented larger deviations over these areas for estimates based on ocean forcing data sets than for the original atmospheric reanalysis products fig 7 and table 2 this interaction is in part a consequence of latitudinal gradients in the factors applied to correct wind vectors these deviations were further magnified by the overestimation of the strength of zonal wind stress especially in subtropical gyres fig b 4 see also above the effect is more severe in core v2 1 and dfs v5 2 than in adjusted jra 55 fields which employed a more elaborate adjustment procedure and presented an overall better quality table 2 model resolution and adjustments made for ocean forcing data sets also contributed to improve the ability of different products to capture persistent small scale features in ocean winds fig 8 and fig b 6 these features can be better appreciated in high resolution surface relative quikscat winds since they are associated with permanent fronts and mesoscale features with islands and coastal mountain ranges and with strong surface currents chelton et al 2004 for instance fig 8 e depicts changes in the wind field associated with the great barrier reef numerous island wakes in melanesia and intricate patterns associated with the antarctic circumpolar current including a permanent eddy south of new zeland examining the resemblance of persistent small scale features between quikscat and the other products reveals that jra55 do represented these features with a fidelity similar to ccmp e g compare detail patterns in fig 8 a and fig b 6 a where the correlation with quikscat fields panel b is r 0 48 both for jra55 do h and ccmp v2 0 correlation drops to the range 0 18 0 39 for the other products despite exceptions commented above increased model resolution and secondarily adjustments contributed in general to reduce wind biases however some important deviations remained in all products examined especially in boundary systems and marginal seas under the influence of coastal processes 3 3 coastal ocean winds in contrast to open ocean areas the fidelity of wind reanalysis products with respect to the reference satellite data sets varied extensively along the coastal ocean i e relative errors often above 10 in fig b 7 and fig b 8 adjustments in ocean forcing data sets improved the match with satellite wind fields in coastal areas especially for core v2 1 an average 62 decrease in bias compared to ncep vs 40 for dfs v5 2 and jra55 do however both higher resolution jra55 products performed better than the other reanalysis data sets even before the adjustment the large scale biases detected in oceanic regions were also apparent close to the coast particularly across the labyrinthine indo pacific connection fidelity to satellite based spatial wind gradients was also negatively impacted by the adjustments resulting in a weakened wind stress curl and upwelling with respect to original atmospheric reanalysis products 3 3 1 coastal ocean winds and upwelling in ebues coastal winds and upwelling patterns varied greatly among reanalysis and ocean model forcing winds in the four largest ebues table 3 and fig 9 estimates of potential upwelling velocities derived from wind stress and coastal topography varied up to one order of magnitude with weaker upwelling velocities inferred from reanalysis products than from satellite data median relative deviation δ 0 34 and 0 18 w r t quikscat for ekman pumping and coastal upwelling respectively however satellite based estimates also varied considerably ekman pumping was stronger in ccmp v2 0 than in quikscat δ 0 60 but coastal upwelling was weaker δ 0 18 consistent with the expected coastal drop off in reanalysis winds although the match between quikscat and ccmp v2 0 was far from perfect their overall coherence provides confidence on patterns found for ccmp v2 0 which will be considered the default reference data set unless otherwise stated the adjustments applied to standard reanalysis products improved the agreement of ocean forcing data sets with satellite data for coastal upwelling decreases in the absolute value of δ from 0 32 to 0 05 w r t quikscat but reduced agreement for ekman pumping δ tripled from 0 17 to 0 53 this latter result is consistent with the degradation of wind stress curl estimates noted above the adjustment was particularly problematic for era interim and dfs v5 2 increasing discrepancies with both satellite references and other reanalyses no single product outperformed the others on all ebues in humboldt and benguela all products had significant biases in seasonal and long term variation patterns table 3 at california and canary jra55 do products provided realistic upwelling indices that resembled satellite observations δ 0 25 in general the analysis of trends in the time series of upwelling indices confirmed regional differences among products and revealed large contrasts among temporal patterns of long term variability table 3 fig 10 and fig 11 according to ccmp v2 0 the average intensity of ekman pumping and alongshore coastal upwelling increased in all ebues with an average increase clearly above zero in all cases except for ekman pumping in humboldt ecosystem at canary and california credible intervals for coastal upwelling trends covered negative values only marginally for upwelling table 3 trends in the intensity of coastal upwelling were in general of similar magnitude that changes in ekman pumping mean change per decade in table 3 corresponding to 10 of the mean for trends different from zero however the direction and magnitude of trends varied across standard and adjusted reanalyses with no region having consistent positive or negative trends table 3 low frequency trends in upwelling indices were more coherent in california and in canary than in benguela and humboldt where many products were anticorrelated fig 10 and fig 11 even where the trends were coherent the expected amount of change in upwelling differed among data sets e g the relative increase in alongshore upwelling in california was much lower in reanalysis winds than in satellite products table 3 in general adjustments did not provide a better match to the reference data set than the original atmospheric reanalysis in some cases adjustments lead to opposite trends e g contrasting trends for jra55 products in benguela or to the disappearance of some features e g the change of level in the mean of jra 55 in humboldt and benguela around 1998 99 the time series decomposition was unable to capture stochastic oscillations beyond the seasonal scale with an evident effect of enso on inferred trends at humboldt and california the theil sen procedure reduced to a large extent the impact of subdecadal oscillations like enso on the overall trend estimate at each ebue unfortunately we were unable to discern the impact of long term climate modes like the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 or the pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua et al 1997 4 discussion the characterization of ocean winds remains an open challenge that limits our ability to analyze and simulate ocean circulation and marine ecosystems bourassa et al 2010 encouragingly our assessment of oceanic winds produced by widely used atmospheric reanalysis products tracks a clear progression in the quality of assimilated winds that reflects a continued improvement in observation and data assimilation systems and in climate modeling kalnay et al 1996 griffies et al 2009 brodeau et al 2010 liu et al 2010 dee et al 2011 fore et al 2014 kobayashi et al 2015 wentz et al 2015 there was a clear ranking of the performance of different reanalysis products with the most recent high resolution products derived using 4d assimilation schemes like jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 and era interim dee et al 2011 outperforming the seminal coarse scale ncep ncar products kalnay et al 1996 our analyses highlighted also some weaknesses common to all products like the lack of agreement with reference estimates in coastal areas and the sometimes deleterious impact of simple adjustment strategies that do not take into account spatial variability in the following we discuss these issues and extract some recommendations to account for the uncertainty surrounding the characterization of ocean winds before this however we comment on the major limitations of our assessment and how these affect the robustness of the results presented 4 1 limitations of our assessment a major limitation of the assessment presented here was the assumption that the two satellite wind products provide a valid reference to assess the reliability of atmospheric wind reanalysis products the approach adopted here was indeed more pragmatic than orthodox since satellite winds serve as an input of data assimilation systems and in the case of ccmp v2 0 analyzed winds provide a first guess to interpolate satellite data atlas et al 2011 wentz et al 2015 the last aspect seems relatively unimportant although there was in general a good agreement between ccmp v2 0 and era interim the two products demonstrate levels of independence similar to the other products beyond the problems highlighted above the reference data sets provide a useful although not perfect baseline to assess similarities and differences among atmospheric wind reanalysis products the assessment of the different products with data recorded by autonomous meteorological buoys and coastal stations added further support to the choice of ccmp v2 0 as a reference data set and confirmed to some extent the lack of agreement found in tropical regions however there are indications suggesting that some of the differences among reanalysis products arise from biases in the reference products for instance the large positive deviations relative to ccmp v2 0 prevailing for all reanalysis products in tropical and subtropical coastal regions might be partially explained by biases in ccmp v2 0 due to the suboptimal performance of passive microwave radiometer sensors in these areas i e problems with the atmospheric correction of ssm i suggested by atlas et al 2011 while rain contamination and irregular sampling coverage complicate the interpretation of quikscat data in tropical and subtropical coastal regions chelton and freilich 2005 the better agreement among reanalysis products and quikscat suggest that the fidelity of renanlyses with actual winds may be better than the ccmp v2 0 comparison indicates the definition of winds with respect to a fixed or a moving surface can also explain some of the differences observed among reanalysis and satellite wind products large deviations in western boundary systems and in other areas with intense currents can be explained in part by the assumption of a nonmoving ocean in earth relative meteorological winds kelly et al 2001 chelton et al 2004 here we assumed a perfect match with surface relative satellite winds as an advantage since it simplifies the retrieval of wind stress from wind speed kara et al 2007 thus this issue is mainly important for the assessment of standard atmospheric reanalysis products since we expect adjustments to account for differences due to surface currents and waves concomitant to satellite measurements the last major limitation was the choice of a monthly scale to compare winds among different products the choice of a monthly scale preserves large scale patterns including seasonal variability and long term trends targeted in our analyses nonetheless this excluded from our analysis diurnal cycles and smoothed to a large extent the impact of extreme winds associated with storms and mesoscale systems 4 2 assessment of available ocean forcing wind products the assessment produced several particularly robust results despite the limitations discussed in the previous section the most recent high resolution products derived using 4d assimilation schemes like jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 and era interim dee et al 2011 generally performed better than the seminal coarse scale ncep ncar products kalnay et al 1996 importantly ncep ncar products only assimilate sparse wind observations from buoys and voluntary ships whereas the incorporation of synoptic spatial wind fields based on satellite data and the growing network of in situ ground observations has contributed to improve wind quality in more recent reanalysis bourassa et al 2010 trenberth et al 2010 on the other hand known problems in the calibration of quikscat e g ricciardulli and wentz 2011 fore et al 2014 also generated differences among products in tropical areas experiencing high precipitation rates biases were particularly enhanced during the adjustments employed to generate core v2 1 and dfs v5 2 see e g milliff et al 2004 the more complicated adjustment employed to produce jra55 do tsujino et al 2018 based on a careful match of satellite and model observations and on the use of state of the art quikscat winds ricciardulli and wentz 2011 worked particularly well and resulted in a lower bias product with realistic spatial wind patterns considering the overall performance of ccmp v2 0 and its ability to preserve high resolution spatial patterns present in quikscat fields future adjustments might consider as well the incorporation of ccmp v2 0 wentz et al 2015 4 3 open ocean winds an important aspect of our analysis was the focus on differences in wind patterns relevant to ocean circulation and ecosystem functioning this focus allowed us to highlight how the nonlinear magnification of relatively small deviations in wind speed results in important differences in surface wind stress its curl and inferred vertical upwelling velocity risien and chelton 2008 kent et al 2013 larger deviations in meridional winds relative to those estimated for zonal components e g smith et al 2011 contribute to the magnification of differences in wind stress and derived metrics there were also striking changes associated with the adjustments made for ocean forcing data sets like the switch from a strong to weaker wind stress curl patterns following the adjustment of reanalysis winds although these biases were less important in jra55 do the magnitude of the deviations found suggest the need to improve current adjustment schemes setting wind stress vectors as the target instead of wind speed and approaches matching spatial gradients and patterns of temporal variability may address issues raised in our analysis the lack of agreement among reanalyses and observations was particularly important in tropical regions suggesting that the choice among alternative wind products might lead to contrasting inferences about trends in surface warming and in ocean heat uptake associated to the strengthening of trade winds balmaseda et al 2013 england et al 2014 richter 2015 or long term changes in enso dynamics wittenberg 2004 realistic wind stress curl gradients are also important to simulate circulation and transport patterns in the equatorial region e g richter et al 2012 tseng et al 2016 similarly we can expect altered nutrient fluxes in the tropics that might have an important impact on the characterization of ocean biogeochemical processes anav et al 2013 differences in wind strength among ocean forcing products were also important in polar and subpolar latitudes there were important differences in estimated winds both in deep convection areas in labrador sea and around greenland in the north atlantic as well as along the path of the antarctic circumpolar current these changes have the potential to impact both the rate of formation of deep waters as well as upwelling in the southern ocean compromising analysis and simulations of the global overturning toggweiler and russell 2008 wang et al 2014 the low reliability of southern ocean winds has been highlighted before in analysis featuring other reanalysis products e g smith et al 2011 suggesting a prevailing limitation in the assimilation of wind observations although evaluating the impact of observed differences in wind forcing is beyond the scope of this contribution ongoing efforts in the context of cmip6 omip will include a set of experiments featuring the comparison of corev2 1 and jra55 do forced runs griffies et al 2016 4 4 coastal ocean winds in coastal regions assimilated winds give lower estimates of upwelling than those based on satellite products in most locations even after the adjustment of wind speed we suspect this decrease is due to the contamination of wind measurements by weaker winds over land as well as a consequence of the coarse representation of the ocean land transition and of coastal topography in atmospheric models capet et al 2004 reanalysis products were in general unable to capture wind stress curl patterns something that degrades the ability to reproduce realistic upwelling patterns in coastal areas small et al 2015 and subsequent ecological impacts chelton 1982 rykaczewski and checkley 2008 indeed the larger deviations found in humboldt and benguela ebues might partially explain why these ecosystems remain a challenge both for ocean and coupled climate modeling zuidema et al 2016 another interesting result was the contrasting patterns of long term variability in the main ebues of the world ocean analyses of satellite data were in general coherent with the expected increase in upwelling favorable winds under increased atmospheric pressure gradients as climate warms bakun 1990 sydeman et al 2014 wang et al 2015 garcía reyes et al 2015 the analyses highlighted even a marginal increase in intensity for the canary upwelling that remains highly disputed barton et al 2013 sydeman et al 2014 see also cropper et al 2014 and sousa et al 2017 however reanalysis products showed contrasting trends again especially in humboldt and benguela although the foundational hypothesis by bakun 1990 postulated that land sea differences in the pace of atmospheric warming would enhance air pressure gradients and thus promote an increase in the intensity of alongshore winds and coastal upwelling this idea has been progressively refined to reveal a more complex picture where the poleward migration of high pressure atmospheric systems plays a prominent role in recent changes in upwelling patterns belmadani et al 2014 rykaczewski et al 2015 the interaction of large scale changes in atmospheric circulation with coastal orientation cropper et al 2014 ocean circulation and turbulent mixing blanke et al 2005 gruber et al 2011 oerder et al 2015 contribute to observed spatial heterogeneity and in some areas even to a reversal of expected upwelling trends or to counterintuitive biogeochemical responses as upwelling intensity increases renault et al 2016 ebues are prone to regime shifts involving the collapse of fisheries and transitions in kelp ecosystems hare and mantua 2000 verheye 2000 alheit and niquen 2004 and changes in upwelling intensity interact with other major concerns like coastal hypoxia and acidification grantham et al 2004 feely et al 2008 reanalysis products capturing trends in upwelling are necessary to accurately explore these challenges and to develop a mechanistic understand that allow us to identify optimal management practices and to anticipate future impacts stock et al 2011 hoegh guldberg et al 2014 lluch cota et al 2014 regrettably none of the adjustments universally addressed limitations inherent to coastal environments in this way the best practice to navigate across different reanalysis and satellite products for coastal applications should probably include an assessment based on local observations and downscaling approaches e g kanamitsu and kanamaru 2007 4 5 summary overall our results revealed the ability of state of the art wind reanalysis to produce high quality wind patterns at different spatial and temporal scales this assessment encourages continued use of these products both in retrospective analysis and in ocean simulation experiments nevertheless differences among products recommend careful consideration of large uncertainties in wind forcing particularly in coastal regions and to test the sensitivity of derived results to the choice of wind product in particular our results favor the use of reanalysis products already adjusted for large scale biases which are currently preferentially used only by ocean modelers while noting that there is ample room to improve correction strategies across ocean relevant wind properties despite the continued improvement in the quality of wind data sets

harrison gfdl provided valuable comments and discussion on earlier versions of the manuscript we also acknowledge constructive and detailed reviews by three anonymous reviewers appendix a details on the analysis of coastal time series of upwelling indices we analyzed time series of upwelling indices to characterize and compare long term variation among different wind products the superposition of slow moving trends stochastic climatic oscillations and contamination by measurement noise suggested the use of a dynamic linear model dlm approach west and harrison 1997 petris et al 2009 we fitted a dlm to noisy wind time series zt that included i a local first order polynomial component xt to account for potential trends ii an autoregressive ar component ht which captures remaining autocorrelation and quasicyclical oscillations accounting for the seasonal cycle and recurrent patterns of interannual variability and iii a noise component ζ that accounts for measurement error and model inadequacy z t x t h t ζ t ζ t n 0 σ ζ 2 x t x t 1 ν t ν t n 0 σ ν 2 h t k 1 p a k h t k η t η t n 0 σ η 2 where the error term ζ follows a mean zero gaussian distribution with variance σ ζ 2 that determines the likelihood of a given parameterization of the model the local first order polynomial trend is equivalent to a random walk or locally constant mean process with variance σ ν 2 which captures slow moving trends in the data as an accumulation of small short term shocks to the mean level the ar component is also defined by the variance of stochastic innovations σ η 2 and by the vector of autoregressive coefficients ak whose dimension p was regarded also as a random parameter the model was fitted under a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo simulation methods mcmc robert and casella 2004 gelman et al 2014 the procedure involved two sequential updating steps by conditioning alternately on estimates of model parameters and on estimates of the state process west and harrison 1997 these steps were repeated 40 000 times dismissing the first 30 000 warmup updates to ensure convergence and thinning the remainder 10 000 iterations to retrieve 1000 posterior samples of the posterior distribution of model parameters and states the posterior distribution of states xt and ht was updated based on filtered and smoothed estimates using petris et al s 2009 r library dlm which implements the robust svd kalman filter proposed by zhang and li 1996 remainder model parameters were estimated using metropolis within gibbs steps with weakly informative priors gelman et al 2014 measurement and process noise variances for the trend were updated using conjugate steps by assuming half cauchy priors with a large scale parameter τ 0 25 gelman 2006 the parameters of the ar component were estimated following the reversible jump mcmc approach of vermaak et al 2004 this approach allowed us to determine model order p interactively usual steps with no change in p were complemented with updates assessing proposals with either a one unit increase or decrease in p we assumed a truncated poisson prior distribution to include the constrain p 1 30 the parameter of this prior was adjusted dynamically by an uninformative gamma hyperprior using the same mixture as in vermaak et al 2004 reflection coefficients ak and the ar innovation variance σ η 2 were updated using standard conjugate normal gamma steps reinforcing stationarity using simple rejection sampling parameter estimates were summarized using posterior 95 central intervals based on sample quantiles trends were further summarized by retrieving theil sen slope estimates based on assimilated states for the linear growth component estimated trends were also compared and grouped across datasets using cluster analysis finally we used west s 1997 constructive decomposition method to examine the potential existence of other underlying trends and cyclical components in the ar component this method relies on a reparameterization of dlms to a canonical form based on the eigenvalues of the model evolution matrix g west and harrison 1997 prado and west 2010 in the case of ar models the method results in an additive superposition of first order short memory ar 1 components corresponding to each of the real eigenvalues of g and to autoregressive moving average arma 2 1 components corresponding to conjugate imaginary eigenvalue pairs λe iω the arma 2 1 component represent quasi cyclical oscillations with period 2π ω and time varying amplitude and phase west and harrison 1997 prado and west 2010 this component targets the characterization of a varying seasonal cycle and of recurrent patterns of interannual variability like climate modes and teleconnection patterns on the other hand the slow moving trend targets directed changes in the mean level of each wind time series that show no apparent periodicity we expect those trends to reflect long term changes associated to warming trends although given the short length of the time series analyzed we cannot ensure that trends are not confounded by long term climate modes like the pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua et al 1997 or the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 the combination of inference on slow trends and on quasi cyclical components allowed us to characterize long term variations in the mean level and seasonality of different wind indices statistical model fitting was implemented in r r core team 2017 making extensive use of libraries mvtnorm genz and bretz 2009

24064,the emerging availability of biogeochemical argo bgc argo float data creates new opportunities to combine models and observations in investigations of the interior structures and dynamics of marine ecosystems an existing variational data assimilation scheme 3dvarbio has been upgraded and coupled with the copernicus marine environment monitoring service biogeochemical model of the mediterranean sea to assimilate bgc argo chlorophyll profile observations our results show that the assimilation of bgc argo float data is feasible moreover the proposed data assimilation framework provides significant corrections to the chlorophyll concentrations and is able to consistently re adjust the shapes of chlorophyll profiles during surface blooms occurring in winter vertically mixed conditions and in the case of the summer deep chlorophyll maxima sensitivity analysis and diagnostic metrics have been applied to evaluate the impact of assimilation and the relevance of different factors of the 3dvarbio method a key factor is the observation error that has been tuned on a monthly basis to incorporate the representation error different frequencies of the assimilation cycle have been tested daily or 3 day assimilation fosters the highest skill performances despite the reduced impacts and the increase of computational burden considering the present size of the bgc argo mediterranean network about 15 floats and the estimated non homogeneous correlation radius length scale 15 2 km on average the chlorophyll assimilation can constrain the phytoplankton dynamics along the whole water column over an area up to 10 of the mediterranean sea keywords data assimilation biogeochemical argo float biogeochemical model chlorophyll mediterranean sea 1 introduction operational ocean forecasting systems coordinate observations and modeling systems and have been widely recognized as important assets in monitoring the state of the ocean thus addressing current challenges in increasing our understanding of the ocean and its role in society le traon et al 2017 she et al 2016 integration of data assimilation and models represents a key element in providing accurate assessments of ocean conditions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales data assimilation is a well developed practice in atmospheric science and in physical oceanography whereas it remains a challenge in biogeochemical ocean modeling brasseur et al 2009 dowd et al 2014 there exist several assimilation methods applied to biogeochemical models edwards et al 2015 a not exhaustive list includes popular implementations of kalman filter methods such as the singular evolutive extended kalman brasseur and verron 2006 fontana et al 2013 and the singular evolutive interpolated kalman triantafyllou et al 2013 nerger and gregg 2007 tsiaras et al 2017 and the ensemble kalman filters ciavatta et al 2011 2014 cossarini et al 2009 hu et al 2012 particle filter assimilation is a class of ensemble methods that are applicable to non linear systems ristic et al 2004 van leeuwen 2009 mattern et al 2013 variational approaches that minimize a least squares based cost function include 3dvar teruzzi et al 2014 and 4dvar song et al 2016 verdy and mazloff 2017 methods however a few of the assimilation methods mentioned above are used in the context of operational biogeochemical model systems specifically 3dvar variational scheme teruzzi et al 2016 hybrid ensemble oi kalman filter tsiaras et al 2017 and optimal interpolation with a multivariate balancing scheme ford et al 2012 in these particular applications the computational efficiency of the assimilation scheme teruzzi et al 2018b and the availability of near real time data le traon et al 2009 are also important aspects the most commonly assimilated variable in biogeochemical model applications is remote sensing derived chlorophyll ford et al 2012 fontana et al 2013 teruzzi et al 2014 2018a tsiaras et al 2017 because of the spatial and temporal coverage of these measurements and their availability through operational services such as the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems volpe et al 2012 le traon et al 2017 very few examples of the assimilation of in situ observations exist and the variables that have been incorporated into these studies include nutrients and oxygen from monitoring systems cossarini et al 2009 liu et al 2017 and pco2 and oxygen from multi platform instruments verdy and mazloff 2017 the sparseness and lack of availability of in situ biogeochemical measurements have limited their use in assimilation studies to date and represent a severe issue in operational biogeochemical modeling autonomous in situ platforms have already made critical contributions to improving physical assimilation systems the argo network is undoubtedly the most important in terms of the number of observations and its integration with assimilation systems the deployment of the argo network marked a transition in physical operational oceanography as it has provided publicly available observations of the interior of the global ocean in near real time le traon 2013 recently a biogeochemical equivalent of argo the bgc argo programme has been established johnson and claustre 2016 the bgc argo network is rapidly growing although the density of operational floats is still scarce compared to argo however at regional scale specific activities might provide a sufficient number of floats to both contribute to the improvement of ocean biogeochemical models brasseur et al 2009 and to be used in operational modeling frameworks le traon et al 2017 the mediterranean sea has one of the first bgc argo networks with a sufficient density of floats deployed in framework of the naos french initiative and of the argo italy bgc argo programme to test and validate assimilation systems thirty nine bgc argo floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors were deployed from 2012 to 2017 thus making the mediterranean bgc argo network one of the densest in terms of the number of profiles per unit surface area of the global ocean the mediterranean bgc argo float data also contributed to develop the quality control methods for the bgc argo chlorophyll observations that are presently endorsed at the international level schmechtig et al 2016 moreover specific methods for nitrate sensor calibration have been derived for the mediterranean pasqueron de fommervault et al 2015 d ortenzio et al 2014 to account for the biogeochemical characteristics of the basin in this work an innovative bgc argo data assimilation framework is discussed and its feasibility within a realistic model is demonstrated the framework is intended to be integrated into the operational mediterranean biogeochemistry model medbfm of the cmems system bolzon et al 2017 the medbfm model features the off line coupling of nemo3 6 clementi et al 2017 and ogstm bfm lazzari et al 2012 2016 cossarini et al 2015 and includes separate physical dobricic and pinardi 2008 farina et al 2015 storto et al 2014 and biogeochemical teruzzi et al 2014 variational data assimilation schemes the 3dvarbio variational assimilation scheme has already been shown to be suited for biogeochemical data assimilation due to its modularity teruzzi et al 2014 2018a a new upgrade of the 3dvarbio has been developed to assimilate the vertical chlorophyll profiles and update the phytoplankton state variables of ogstm bfm model the mediterranean sea is characterized by peculiar vertical phytoplankton characteristics it displays a marked seasonal cycle of surface and deep chlorophyll maxima lavigne et al 2015 mignot et al 2014 and a noticeable west east deepening of the deep chlorophyll maximum and trophic gradient lavigne et al 2015 thus the bgc argo float assimilation is discussed with the aim of showing its capability to correct the vertical structure of modelled chlorophyll furthermore we propose a tuning procedure based on the analysis of the a posteriori observation and background errors desroziers et al 2005 to define the observation error then key elements of the 3dvarbio scheme namely the components of the background error covariances and the frequency of assimilation are tested to investigate their impacts on the chlorophyll assimilation and simulated chlorophyll vertical dynamics their sensitivity is analysed through diagnostic statistics as defined in mattern et al 2018 and novel statistical indexes the paper is organized as follows after a brief presentation of the cmems biogeochemical modeling system for the mediterranean and the bgc argo data section 2 we focus on the novel elements of the variational data assimilation in the following section section 3 we describe the results of the new data assimilation method and a sensitivity analysis of several key elements a discussion of some key issues involved in the assimilation of bgc argo data is provided in section 4 then the paper closes with some final remarks and future prospects for the assimilation of biogeochemical data from multiple sources section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 mediterranean sea model the mediterranean sea hydrodynamic biogeochemical model is the off line coupled mfs medbfm with a 1 16 horizontal resolution and 72 unevenly spaced z levels in the vertical direction the first layer is approximately 1 5 m thick and the spacing increases to approximately 8 m at a depth of 100 m the medbfm biogeochemical model incorporates the ogstm transport model which is based on the opa system lazzari et al 2010 and the biogeochemical flux model bfm vichi et al 2015 lazzari et al 2012 2016 cossarini et al 2015 2017 and references therein bfm includes nine plankton functional types pfts diatoms flagellates picophytoplankton and dinoflagellates are the phytoplankton groups whereas carnivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton bacteria heterotrophic nanoflagellates and microzooplankton are the heterotrophic groups the bfm model describes the biogeochemical cycles of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silicon through the dissolved inorganic living organic and non living organic compartments dissolved oxygen alkalinity and carbonate system dynamics are also represented by the bfm cossarini et al 2015 melaku canu et al 2015 the non living compartments consist of 3 groups specifically labile semi labile and refractory organic matter the ogstm bfm is also integrated with a variational 3dvarbio scheme that has been used to assimilate remotely sensed surface chlorophyll teruzzi et al 2014 2018a the daily fields of the physical quantities i e the horizontal and vertical current velocities vertical eddy diffusivity potential temperature salinity sea surface height surface wind stress and surface solar shortwave irradiance that drive the transport of biogeochemical tracers and their dynamics are pre computed by the mediterranean forecast system mfs pinardi et al 2003 tonani et al 2014 oddo et al 2014 mfs features the nemo ocean general circulation model and the oceanvar variational scheme that assimilates satellite observed sea level anomalies and in situ vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from xbts argo floats and gliders dobricic and pinardi 2008 storto et al 2014 the coupled model and the physical and biogeochemical assimilation schemes represent the core of the physical and biogeochemical components of the mediterranean monitoring and forecasting med mfc system of the cmems http marine copernicus eu which releases daily and weekly 3d gridded forecasts clementi et al 2017 bolzon et al 2017 and multi decadal reanalyses simoncelli et al 2014 teruzzi et al 2016 of the state of the mediterranean sea 2 2 data collected by bgc argo floats the bgc argo floats network is one of the first real time biogeochemical in situ ocean observing system johnson and claustre 2016 bgc argo floats are equipped with sensors that measure biogeochemical parameters e g chlorophyll nitrate ph oxygen suspended particles and downwelling irradiance and collect and transmit data in near real time as the argo floats roemmich et al 2009 the first bgc argo float was deployed in the mediterranean in 2009 at present august 2018 39 floats have been deployed and about 15 are still operational in our model experiments that cover the year 2015 25 floats with chlorophyll data are available and located mainly in the western mediterranean the northern ionian sea and the central part of the levantine basin fig 1 the measured chlorophyll profiles are processed with specific quality control qc methods and become available 24 h after the data are collected delayed mode qc for chlorophyll is based on specific quality control algorithms schmechtig et al 2015 and an additional correction factor of 0 5 on the amplitude of wetlabs fluorescence signal to get a proxy of total chlorophyll concentration is applied roesler et al 2017 moreover the pre operational quality protocol applied before performing assimilation includes the detection of anomalous chlorophyll data e g negative values spikes exceeding 10 mg m3 and the application of a 5 point moving gaussian smoothing providing a 2 m resolution vertical profiles further nitrate concentrations from 8 bgc argo floats blue labels in fig 1 after qc pasqueron de fommervault et al 2015 are used to assess the impact the 3dvarbio on a non assimilated model variable 2 3 3dvarbio assimilation scheme in the 3dvarbio assimilation scheme the analysis step involves the minimization of the cost function 1 j x a 1 2 x a x b t b 1 x a x b 1 2 y h x b t r 1 y h x b where x b is the background model state before the assimilation x a is the analysis y represents the available observations and y h x b is the innovation b and r are the background and observation error covariance matrices the term h is the observational operator according to weaver et al 2003 and dobricic and pinardi 2008 the solution of the cost function namely the increment x a x b is computed by means of a new control variable v such that x a x b vv where b is rewritten as b vv t and the transformation matrix v can be decomposed into a sequence of operators that characterize different aspects of the error covariances and transform increments from the control space to the model space the 3dvarbio is based on the oceanvar physical assimilation scheme dobricic and pinardi 2008 and has been modified for biogeochemical assimilation teruzzi et al 2014 2018a by upgrading the decomposition of v v b v h v v to integrate remotely sensed chlorophyll data teruzzi et al 2014 2018a the three operators are the vertical error covariance v v the horizontal error covariance v h and the biogeochemical state variable error covariance v b in the present study the 3dvarbio scheme is redesigned to permit the assimilation of chlorophyll observation vertical profiles by upgrading r and h and the two linear operators v v and v h the biological operator v b which is built on covariances between chlorophyll and other phytoplankton state variables i e carbon nitrate and phosphorus contents in the four phytoplankton group is kept as in teruzzi et al 2014 the upgraded observation operator h is a linear interpolator from the model grid to the observation space i e to the position and vertical depths of the float profiles and computes the sum of the chlorophyll content of the 4 phytoplankton functional types the observation error r is implemented as a diagonal matrix whose values are estimated through a tuning analysis presented in section 3 1 the minimization of the cost function is computed without log transforming chlorophyll innovation vectors teruzzi et al 2014 2018a which have indeed symmetric and mostly gaussian distributions not shown possible negative increment values are corrected diagnostically at the end of the assimilation cycle with a very small positive value 10 4 mg m3 and with changes to nitrogen phosphorus and carbon components of each pft based on the vb operator teruzzi et al 2018a the effect of this correction is negligible it occurs in less of the 4 of the cases and mostly in the deepest part of the vertical chlorophyll profiles 2 3 1 vertical covariance operator the vertical covariance operator v v consists of a set of profiles obtained by empirical orthogonal function eof decomposition as described in teruzzi et al 2014 of a multiannual simulation bolzon et al 2017 sets of eofs are computed for the sub regions of fig 1 and for the 12 months in order to account for the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the vertical dynamics of the background errors examples of eofs modes for two selected sub basins and months fig 2 show that nearly all of the covariance is described by the first three eofs the first eof mode reflects a uniform vertical covariance of the error in january while significant eofs obtained for august are characterized by low values in the 0 30 m layer and the presence of two or more peaks with opposite signs in the deeper layers these peaks account for the variability around the deep chlorophyll maximum dcm which is deeper in the eastern with respect to the western mediterranean sea lavigne et al 2015 moreover in summer the variance of higher order eofs grey lines in fig 2 is larger than that in winter i e the first three eofs account for nearly 85 and 70 of the error covariance in january and august western sub basins e g nwm in fig 2 have eof explained variances higher than the eastern ones e g lev2 in fig 2 reflecting a larger background variability in the western sub basin teruzzi et al 2014 2 3 2 horizontal covariance operator the horizontal covariance operator v h consists of a gaussian recursive filter dobricic and pinardi 2008 whose correlation radius length scale modulates the smoothing intensity and the areas influenced by the operator the filter has been redesigned to work with non uniform correlation radius length scales lr because local effects may be important in regions with high spatial variability storto et al 2014 at each model grid point and vertical level lr is set equal to the standard deviation of a gaussian theoretical distribution estimated using a non linear least squares fitting algorithm i e levenberg marquardt algorithm implemented in the scipy python package on the distribution of the temporal correlation between a given point and all of the nearby points within a radius of 100 km the temporal correlation is calculated using the daily output from a previous run bolzon et al 2017 the spatial distribution of lr at surface is shown in fig 3 the values of lr range from 12 20 km and display a basin average of 15 2 km and a standard deviation of 1 6 km lower values occur along the coast whereas the areas characterized by the highest values reflect some common patterns of the mean current fields poulain et al 2012 this result emphasizes that physical transport processes may lead to elevated covariance the correlation radius length scale decreases with depth the averages at 50 m and 100 m are 14 8 and 14 3 km respectively maintaining spatial patterns similar to those at the surface 2 4 setup of assimilation simulations several assimilation simulations were carried out table 1 employing different configurations of key aspects of the 3dvarbio each simulation covers the period 1 jan 2015 31 dec 2015 and consists of sequential cycles of one assimilation step followed by a given number of forecast days a set of simulations featuring constant observation error oe010 oe025 and oe050 is used to tune the monthly values of the observation error which is then used in the core simulation oetun of the sensitivity analysis an additional simulation oetuns differs from oetun because the observation error of each float profile is set equal to the tuned monthly values used in oetun multiplied by the ratio between the chlorophyll profile standard deviation and the average of all profile standard deviations of that given month the oetun5eof simulation is intended to evaluate the effects of using a smaller number of eofs to define the vertical component of the background error covariance v v whereas two other experiments oetunlr 50 and oetunlr 100 are used to analyse the sensitivity of the assimilation to the increase 50 and 100 respectively of correlation radius length scale lr of v h the assimilation cycle of oetun is equal to 7 days which is the frequency of the assimilation cycle currently adopted in the cmems med mfc biogeochemistry operational system bolzon et al 2017 and is close to the sampling frequency of most of the bgc argo floats i e 5 days in 2015 thus all the float profiles within a time window of 3 days centred on the day of a given assimilation step are considered to be synoptic and used in the assimilation when multiple profiles are available for a given float within the given time window the different profiles are treated as independent measurements the effect of the time frequency of the assimilation steps is assessed by decreasing the assimilation cycle length from 7 days to 5 days 3 days and 1 day oetun5d oetun3d oetun1d and assuming the temporal window used in searching for available float profiles has a width of 2 days 1 day and 1 day respectively the set of simulations also includes a reference run ref in which the medbfm model is run without assimilation 2 5 diagnostic metrics following desroziers et al 2005 and mattern et al 2018 diagnostic statistics are calculated to quantify the model data difference for the posterior and prior model solutions 2 d a o y h x a 3 d b o y h x b while the following statistic 4 d b a h x a h x b quantifies the increments at the observation locations two diagnostic quantities the a posteriori observation error σ o and the a posteriori background error σ b 5 σ o d a o t d b o n 6 σ b d b a t d b o n are applied in section 3 1 to tune the observation error using the results of the constant observation error assimilation simulations oetun010 oetun015 and oetun050 the impact of the bgc argo assimilation on biogeochemical fields and the sensitivity of the model to different factors are analysed using a series of diagnostics and novel metrics designed to characterize the intensity shape and extent of the changes caused by the assimilation in particular we define the absolute integral increment int 7 int 150 z 0 d b a dz 150 as the average of the absolute increment over the 0 150 m layer for each float profile and assimilation step the average of int over floats and assimilation cycles quantifies the intensity of the change on the updated chlorophyll fields following mattern et al 2018 the root mean square rms of the differences between observation and prior model solution 8 e b 1 n d b o 2 provides a measurement of da performance it can be intended as a short term forecast skill metric since it is based on observations that are going to be assimilated in the following cycles high values of int without a significant reduction of eb might indicate overfitting mattern et al 2018 thus we define the overfitting metric 9 io n t d b o t 1 2 d a o t 2 that accounts for the reduction of the prior model solution and observation difference at the t 1th assimilation cycle given the previous i e tth cycle posterior model solution and observation difference the metric is computed at time t 1 using the same number of floats at time t an assimilation system achieving a lower value of io indicates that a given increment promotes a better innovation of the model solution at the following assimilation cycle the shape of the innovation profile index isp provides a unique number to describe the shapes of the increment profiles for each assimilated float 10 isp n 0 4 0 if z n d b a 0 2 n if z n d b a 0 where z n are defined as the five 30 m layers i e 0 30 m 30 60 m 60 90 m 90 120 m and 120 150 into which the increment profile is partitioned the value of zero is given to negative increment layers whereas a value of 2 to the power of the layer number minus one i e 2 21 22 23 24 for the five layers is assigned to positive increment layer the sum of the five values then gives the isp which ranges from 0 for entirely negative increment profiles to 31 for entirely positive increment profiles and covers all the possible intermediate shapes of alternating positive and negative layers see upper panel of fig 9 intermediate values and high variability of isp indicate that the assimilation provides not only corrections of the uniform bias along the vertical profile but also adjustments to the shape of the modelled chlorophyll profiles given the sparseness of bgc argo floats distribution the index of spatial increment isi is calculated to measure the impact of the assimilation in the horizontal dimension 11 i s i x y s u r f a c e x y s u c h t h a t x a x b 0 150 m t i s i d x d y where tisi is a threshold equal to 0 001 mg m3 and x a x b 0 150m is the absolute increment averaged over 0 150 m in the model space isi provides the horizontal coverage of the impact of the bgc argo float network in the mediterranean sea in our case finally the time persistency index itp reflects how long the correction of the assimilation persists over time in the vicinity of the position of a float 12 itp time such that 150 z 0 neig hbour x y x t assim x t ref x 0 assim x 0 ref 0 5 where xassim and xref are the model solutions of the assimilation and reference runs averaged in a neighbour i e an area of 30 km of radius of the float trajectory their difference is computed on the assimilation day time t 0 and for the following days t then the time series of the ratios between the differences at time t and t 0 are used to evaluate the time after which the ratio is halved 3 results 3 1 tuning of the observation error the observation error is a critical element of biogeochemical data assimilation teruzzi et al 2014 because quantities are usually measured indirectly e g optical measurements are converted into biogeochemical quantities using theoretical and empirical models leading to additional uncertainty dowd et al 2014 thus the statistical properties of the observation errors are not perfectly known and their determination is not straightforward desroziers et al 2005 in practice several approaches can be used to define the observation error including the precision of the measurement methods the accuracy computed using independent datasets and the representativeness and variability of spatial temporal sampling e g liu et al 2017 verdy and mazloff 2017 gharamti et al 2017a and 2017b further the observation error provides indications about the relative quality of the assimilated observations losa et al 2012 losa et al 2014 thus it depends also on the temporal and spatial scales resolved by the model therefore in order to account for the representation error our approach involves a tuning on a monthly basis of the observation error with respect to the consistency i e equality between the two a posteriori observation σ o and background σ b errors as defined in desroziers et al 2005 the calibration procedure uses the results of the assimilation simulations with constant observation error values equal to 0 01 oe010 0 025 oe025 and 0 05 oe050 mg m3 table 1 and is performed separately for each month the linear regressions of a posteriori errors are shown for two selected months fig 4 and their consistency is achieved at the intersection where the observation error is equal to 0 0149 and 0 0690 mg m3 respectively in august green and january blue results of the calibration procedure for all months indicate a seasonal pattern with higher observation errors in winter and spring months corresponding to periods with higher variability and consistently with the hypothesis that representation errors correlate with high variabilities janjic et al 2017 to quantitatively analyse the effect of the observation error the values of the diagnostic statistics are shown in fig 5 for the constant and tuned observation errors the averages of the absolute increment metric int indicate that the lower the observation errors the higher the values of the int indexes fig 5a in fact the assimilation that features a lower observation error minimizes the cost function and produces profiles that lie closer to the observed ones the oetun run has an average value of int close to oe050 and is characterized by a lower range of the monthly values due to the effect of the time varying observation error to verify whether the monthly tuned observation error represents an optimal solution we computed the rms of the differences between observations and prior model solution eb and the index of the overfitting io fig 5b despite the low variability of eb among the simulations with the mean eb almost equal among the experiments oetun has the lowest value of the prior model error i e 0 0885 and 0 0892 mg m3 for oetun and oe010 respectively and presents reduced evidence of overfitting higher observation errors during winter months of oetun reduce the increments dots on the right part of fig 5a during period of high dynamics limiting the overfitting dots on the right part of fig 5b on the other hand during summer when variability is lower the oetun is characterized by lower observation error which constrains better the model solution thus the time varying observation error consistently with the evolution of model error and its variability represents a superior solution with respect to each one of the fixed observation error experiments the spatio temporal variability of the metrics is pretty high monthly averages are shown in fig 5 highlighting a possible limit of the analysis that uses a small number of sparse observations to constrain such a time varying and heterogeneous marine ecosystem as the mediterranean sea consistently with the hypothesis that the observation error can be set proportional to the data dispersion or variability oke and sakov 2008 the oetuns experiment features an observation error that varies both in time i e monthly tuned values of oetun and in space according to the ratio between the standard deviation of each float profile and the monthly average of the standard deviation of all the floats the average diagnostics statistics yielded by the oetuns simulation are largely consistent with those of oetun fig 5b however the variability of statistics decreases in the case of oetuns because the use of normalized but spatially varying observation error reduces the impact of some floats that have high innovation associated with high standard deviations i e abrupt profiles with very high peaks that occur for less than 10 of cases and mainly in winter the observation error of these profiles is set higher than the monthly tuned values and it causes lower increments not shown filtering the effect of possible anomalous data as an overall effect fig 5 shows that the same average of int is produced despite the slightly lower average of the observation error of oetuns w r t oetun 3 2 assimilation impact on the chlorophyll and nitrate profiles to analyse in details the effects of the bgc argo floats assimilation on vertical patterns the hovmoller diagrams of fig 6 report the temporal evolution of chlorophyll profiles for four selected bgc argo floats in the western 6901491 and 6901600 and eastern 6901528 and 6901773 mediterranean sea chlorophyll profiles of assimilation upper panels and reference run without assimilation ref middle panel are averaged over an area of 30 km of radius surrounding each selected float trajectory the oetun ref differences lower panels in fig 6 show the impact of assimilation on the chlorophyll dynamics the upper middle plots exemplify the behavior of phytoplankton dynamics simulated by the bfm model which are consistent with what described in lavigne et al 2015 they show the increase in chlorophyll at the surface layer bloom during the winter and autumn when vertically mixed conditions occur the presence of a deep chlorophyll maximum dcm during summer stratified conditions and the decreasing trophic gradient from the western e g 6901491 and 6901600 floats to the eastern e g 6901528 and 6901773 floats mediterranean sea fig 7 completes the qualitative analysis by reporting the profiles of prior and posterior model simulation and observation together with the innovation and increment profiles for some selected assimilation cycle of the floats of fig 6 the major changes introduced by the assimilation during winter and early spring months lower panel of fig 6a and b affect the intensity and timing of the chlorophyll surface bloom and to a lesser degree the depth of the vertically mixed bloom in the case of the float 6901491 the assimilation results in higher values of the surface bloom with respect to the reference run during almost all of the assimilation steps except in two weeks during february fig 6a increments are generally homogeneous over the bloom layers till the onset of the dcm in april as shown by the profiles of fig 7a the assimilation forces a change in the depth of the bloom layer which is approximately 15 20 m deeper than the prior state the intensity of correction for float 6901528 fig 6b is pretty low since the model already performs quite well indeed a very low increment is prescribed by the assimilation for float 6901528 at the selected date fig 7b fig 6b shows also that in april and may the assimilation corrects the rate of deepening of the onset of the dcm which starts shallower in april and ends deeper in may in the assimilation simulation with respect to the reference considering all the assimilation cycles during winter and autumn the depth of the layer characterized by the surface bloom i e depth at which the chlorophyll concentration is 10 of the surface value is changed on the 56 of the cases during the summer period the impact of the assimilation occurs mainly in the intermediate layers between 50 and 150 m which correspond to the dcm layer in this case the assimilation changes both the intensity of the dcm and the shapes of the chlorophyll profiles fig 6c and d in the case of float 6901600 fig 6c the comparison between oetun and ref runs highlights a general good performance of the model in reproducing the processes driving the dcm formation in the area of the western mediterranean sub basin visited by the float the sequence of positive and negative corrections around the depth of the dcm displays however the presence of small scale dynamics not properly simulated by the model conversely the assimilation along the trajectory of float 6901773 has a constant impact that deepens the dcm fig 6d highlighting the presence of a possible bias of the model in reproducing the processes sustaining the dcm in this part of the eastern mediterranean basin during summer the innovation and increment profiles assume a characteristic reversed s as in fig 7c and s shapes as in fig 7d highlighting the ability of the assimilation to substantially change the location and width of the layer around the dcm i e the layer where organic matter is produced during the summer season as a result the dcm of the analysis of float 6901600 is 10 m shallower than that of forecast fig 7c while dcm of analysis of 6901773 has a more noticeable peak at 110 m depth w r t forecast fig 7d the comparison of the analysis and forecast profiles of all assimilation cycles reveals that the 52 of the dcm depths are changed during april to august the chlorophyll assimilation updates directly the phytoplankton variables 17 state variables of the bfm model through the v b operator and has an indirect impact on all the model variables as an example the impact of oetun assimilation on nitrate is shown in fig 8 w r t ref simulation in floats 6901773 the assimilation forces a deeper dcm fig 6d which produces an extra consumption of nitrate at the layer of dcm 8b the correction of the timing of the surface bloom for float 6901600 during winter and spring fig 6c triggers extra negative anomalies and lower positive anomalies amounts of nitrate uptake by phytoplankton fig 8a during summer the nitrate differences between oetun and ref are negative with the highest values corresponding to the moments of the highest positive corrections in chlorophyll dynamics at the dcm depths see fig 6c on the other hand the negative chlorophyll corrections have a minor impact in nitrate being phytoplankton in a condition of luxury uptake for nitrate lazzari et al 2016 the nitrate uptake is at the minimum during summer showing negligible sensitivity to the decrease of phytoplankton biomass using the nitrate concentrations from bgc argo floats blue labels in fig 1 the skill performance assessment on the non assimilated variable is reported table 2 in terms of rms of the differences between model and observations along 5 layers and of the rms of the difference of the depth of the nitracline i e the depth at which the nitrate concentration is 2 mmol m3 statistics are given for the ref simulation and in terms of relative variation for the oetun simulation even if our results must be cautiously considered due to the low number of available profiles the chlorophyll assimilation has an overall positive impact quantified as the decrease of the rms in all sub basins and almost all levels beside that the nwm sub basin shows also an improvement of the estimate of the displacement of the depth of the nitracline 3 3 sensitivity to the definition of vv operator to provide a statistical measure of the effectiveness of the data assimilation in changing the profile shapes the isp defined in section 2 5 assigns a unique value to any given alternation of positive and negative layers in the increment profiles eq 10 and the upper panel of fig 9 as an example the isp values of the four increment profiles of fig 7 are 31 0 23 and 24 the frequency of the isp values of oetun lower panels of fig 9 shows that during winter and autumn the increment profiles belong mainly to two categories 0 and 31 i e entirely negative and positive increments respectively this basically underlines a correction of some bias along the water column only isp values of 7 and 15 in winter and 7 24 28 and 30 in autumn are the other more frequent cases of increment profiles frequency higher than 4 that modify the thickness and depth of the layer containing the winter and autumn surface bloom in spring and summer the isp frequency distribution is broader with frequency higher than 4 for isp equal to 0 3 7 16 24 28 30 and 31 spring and 0 7 15 16 24 28 30 and 31 summer a larger range of isp values reflect the capability of the float assimilation to compute complex increment profiles allowing for changes in the position and shape of the dcm as in fig 7c and d to emphasize the higher diversity of possible behaviors of the assimilation in the different seasons the shannon index of diversity is calculated as 13 h i 0 31 p i ln p i using the frequencies of the isp values pi as expected the h value for spring and summer fig 9 is 50 70 higher than that for winter and autumn the sensitivity of the vertical behavior of the assimilation is tested against a reduced number of eof modes of vv oetun5eof and a lower observation error oe010 a data assimilation system able to produce higher number of different types of vertical increments higher h would be preferable since it reflects a superior use of the information from the vertical chlorophyll profile of bgc argo floats oetun5eof results second lower panel in fig 9 indicate that the addition of lower variance eof modes has a very small effect on the isp frequency distribution i e the shannon index does not change substantially highlighting that the first eofs are sufficient to integrate in the vertical direction the chlorophyll profiles in all the seasons on the other hand the use of a low value of the observation error oe010 bottom panel in fig 9 gives the highest values of the shannon index with the exception of autumn the increase is significant in winter but modest in spring and summer the oe010 simulation forces more complex increment profiles and the chlorophyll analysis profiles to be much closer to the bgc argo float profiles than the other two experiments when the model observation difference is the highest i e winter months the low sensitivity during summer results primarily from the vertical resolution of the model in the zone of the dcm which is between 8 and 14 m the coarseness of the vertical model resolution limits the effectiveness of the data assimilation to examine how the range of the vertical subdivision affects this result the isp is recomputed for 8 layers 20 m thick resulting in 256 possible increment profile shapes not shown the new values of h and the isp variability are generally 15 25 higher than in the case of the 5 layer isp but the differences among the simulations remain unchanged 3 4 sensitivity to the definition of vh operator the spatial extent over which the information from the bgc argo profiles propagates through the assimilation is mostly controlled by the vh operator and the correlation radius length scale daily 0 150 m averaged maps of chlorophyll are shown in fig 10 left panels for two assimilation dates along with the increment maps of oetun simulation fig 10 right panels the increment maps are obtained by separately averaging the positive shading and negative contour lines increments over the 0 150 m depths fig 10 shows that the increment patterns are generally rounded patches not overlapping since the distance between floats remains large further increment dimensions are comparable to the pattern of chlorophyll spatial features some of the floats or profiles of the same float e g floats in swm2 nwm and tyr2 fig 10 right panel are sufficiently close one to another that their increment areas overlap showing more complex horizontal patterns increment profiles characterized by isp equal to 0 and 31 promote uniform negative and positive vertical homogeneous patches as in most of the cases of the upper panel of fig 10 during summer increments are composed by vertically overlapping patches of negative and positive values since isp differs from 0 and 31 as in all cases of fig 10 lower panel given the chosen threshold tisi and the number of available floats large areas of the mediterranean sea remain unaffected by the assimilation computing the area with absolute increment values that exceed the threshold during each assimilation steps provides a measure of the spatial impact of assimilation the mean area impacted by oetun is 194 103 km2 table 3 the area impacted by the assimilation depends greatly on the number of available float profiles between 14 and 22 and on the intensity of innovation when isi is normalized by the number of float profiles the average area with increment values above the threshold is approximately 0 4 of the total surface area of the mediterranean sea the normalized isi is 30 higher in winter and autumn w r t spring and summer because of higher absolute innovation and of the uniformity of the increments along the water column isp equal to 0 and 31 on the contrary during summer a lower mean of the extent of the spatial impacted area arises from the vertical integration of the increment profiles with isp shape different from 0 to 31 i e increment profiles have very low values in some layers the correlation radius length scale lr of oetun which is estimated using pre existing modelled chlorophyll fields has been tested against variation of 50 and 100 oetunlr 50 and oetunlr 100 table 1 the results of the sensitivity tests table 3 show that the isi changes more than linearly 90 and 190 in the two tests respectively the increase of lr shows also a slight improvement of the forecast skill performance with respect to the oetun since assimilation with a larger impacted area triggers a better evolution in the next point of emersion of the same float which is usually 40 60 km far from the previous assimilated one however larger horizontal uniform increment patterns might be not always optimal unless for large spatial bias this can be intuitively deduced by the visual comparison of the dimension of horizontal patterns of the chlorophyll maps and the typical roughly round shaped increment patterns fig 10 to investigate that we computed the correlation between esa cci daily satellite maps from cmems colella et al 2016 and model surface chlorophyll for every sub basins and assimilation cycles for the reference ref and assimilation simulations in almost 60 of the cases the correlation between satellite and surface model chlorophyll of the assimilation simulations does not change significantly w r t the one of ref i e correlation variation lower than 0 01 indeed the float assimilation does not substantially change the spatial pattern of the surface chlorophyll during summer however we observe a worsening of the correlation of oetun w r t ref in 30 of the cases mostly in winter with a mean negative variation of the correlation of 0 04 with larger lr the worsening increases table 3 highlighting the possible onset of not consistent spatial patterns and spurious correlation 3 5 sensitivity to the frequency of the assimilation cycle another critical element that determines the effectiveness of the assimilation is the frequency of the assimilation cycle high frequency assimilation cycles may promote the model simulation to more closely approach the evolution of the sequence of observations however insufficient in situ observation spatial coverage may result in unrealistic patchy and scattered analysis and in overfitting when the distance between profiles is large compared to the scale of horizontal decorrelation cane et al 1996 indeed fig 6 shows that corrections introduced by the assimilation can be smoothed by the model integration in the following days and the oetun and ref simulation can converge towards similar chlorophyll profiles i e anomalies oetun ref approaching zero in the lower panels of fig 6 when a local change is introduced by the assimilation the following period of model integration may smooth the new condition depending on the physical horizontal transport and diffusion into and from adjacent areas and vertical mixing and biogeochemical processes that act upon the new condition we propose to quantify the persistence of the assimilation by following the model evolution in a neighbour of the float trajectory the difference between the oetun and ref simulation is computed on the day of the assimilation step t 0 and on the following days t 1 2 6 the ratio between the differences at time t and at initial time t 0 eq 12 is reported in fig 11 for all bgc argo floats and the 365 days of simulation the ratio is equal to 1 on the day of the assimilation steps orange color in fig 11 and decreases from 1 in the following days in almost 80 of the cases shading strips toward green and blue colors in fig 11 the index of temporal persistence itp that accounts for how many days the ratio is above 0 5 after the assimilation steps averages 5 7 days table 4 the 21 of the cases have values higher than 1 grey shadings in fig 11 indicating that chlorophyll assimilation can also initialize local phytoplankton dynamics that differ from those seen in the reference run this difference is also encouraged by the assimilation of data from adjacent floats that drives a larger and self sustaining area with divergent dynamics examples can be noted by concomitant grey shading stripes in adjacent rows of fig 11 which correspond to close float trajectories e g 6901653 6901648 and 6901649 in the nwm in january 6901529 and 6901865 in ion3 in january 6901769 and 6901864 in tyr2 in june 6901771 and 6901863 at the border between ion2 and ion3 in june and 6901764 and 6901766 in lev2 in june when the frequency of the assimilation steps increases from 7 day to 5 3 and 1 day oetun5d oetun3d and oetun1d in table 1 the number of observed profiles that is available in each assimilation cycle decreases significantly table 4 the 7 day assimilation shows the highest persistence and int because the presence of close profiles in some of the assimilation steps produces impacts on larger local areas thus increasing the mean persistence on the other hand the daily assimilation oetun1d has 291 cycles over the 365 total available i e 20 of the days of the year lacks any available float with an average of 4 available float profiles per cycle of assimilation the analyses are less widespread given the decrease of spatial interactions between floats and mean absolute increment int is the lowest among the simulations however the increase of the assimilation frequency improves the skill performance statistics eb and io generally decreasing in table 4 mostly because the chlorophyll profiles are assimilated at the same time and location as the temperature and salinity profiles assimilation in the physical model thus increasing the consistency between the physical vertical properties and chlorophyll at the local scale the best performances are for the 3 days and 1 day simulations the slightly difference of persistence between them is mostly due to the fact that a float is assimilated by oetun3d every 3 and 6 days while generally every 5 days by oetun1d thus allowing a longer time of simulation between two consecutive assimilations in the latter case 4 discussion the scarce availability of in situ data has limited their use in biogeochemical data assimilation studies currently the emerging availability of bgc argo float data creates new opportunities dowd et al 2014 that allows the combination of models and observations in investigating the interior structure of marine ecosystems and for operational purposes we show that the assimilation of bgc argo float data can be carried out in a variational assimilation framework and that this practice results in significant corrections to the chlorophyll state and evolution and in positive impacts on the analysed non assimilated variable although the reference run i e without biogeochemical assimilation already provides reasonable results the assimilation of chlorophyll data from bgc argo floats provides corrections to chlorophyll concentrations and several vertical features such as the onset and dynamics of the dcm layer in spring and summer the thickness of the water column involved in the winter and autumn surface blooms and the timing of the blooms figs 6 and 7 this result is an important novel aspect of this work considering that when assimilation employs satellite chlorophyll the correction along the water column usually relies on a priori knowledge such as predefined covariances song et al 2016 or model ensemble derived covariances ciavatta et al 2014 moreover apart from a few examples teruzzi et al 2014 jones et al 2016 vertical corrections and assessments of the vertical phytoplankton state and dynamics are seldom shown the density of observations in the vertical direction is a key novel factor because bgc argo floats efficiently resolve vertical profiles of chlorophyll concentrations in the mediterranean sea d ortenzio et al 2014 mignot et al 2014 and allow to correct simulated vertical phytoplankton dynamics figs 6 and 7 given the relevance of analysing vertical profiles as a whole as proposed in lavigne et al 2015 the index of shape profile isp which characterizes the increment profiles showed that the first most relevant eofs of the v v operator of 3dvarbio are sufficient to integrate on the vertical direction the chlorophyll profiles in all the seasons low sensitivity of isp in summer and spring is because the highest values of increments occur in the sub surface layer where the vertical resolution of the model is much coarser e g layer thicknesses of 8 15 m at the depths of 100 150 m than that of the observations indeed this result indicates that the specific biogeochemical processes taking place at depth in spring and summer i e the formation of a deep chlorophyll maximum that is closely associated with the presence of a nutricline at the bottom of the photic layer might require a finer vertical model resolution to depths of at least 150 m in the mediterranean sea to fully resolve the vertical plankton structure observed by the bgc argo floats a proper estimate of the observation error of the bgc argo floats data is a crucial aspect in effective assimilation the sources of uncertainty in observations are many first the bgc argo biogeochemical variables are often derived from measurements of optical quantities through complex calibration processes but little reference to the errors is provided dowd et al 2014 the uncertainty of observations can be estimated considering independent datasets when they are available for example mignot et al 2018 employ a triple collocation analysis stoffelen 1998 gruber et al 2016 to estimate the random error standard deviation in chlorophyll a concentrations collected by 21 bgc argo floats in the mediterranean sea by combining the covariances of three independent data sets according to their analysis bgc argo float chlorophyll a concentrations have a random error standard deviation of 0 03 mg m3 in the mediterranean sea which is comparable with our tuned monthly observation errors in biogeochemical data assimilation applications the representation errors janjic et al 2017 can be relevant and difficult to estimate considering that isolated observations are compared with model grid cells that may miss the spatio temporal scales present in the observations given the coarse resolution of the model oke and sakov 2008 objective procedures for tuning the error covariance matrices represent a strategy to improve the assimilation mattern et al 2018 in our case a tuning based on the consistency between the a posteriori errors fig 4 highlighted that observation errors should vary over the course of the year with lower errors in summer when concentrations are lower and high values of chlorophyll are present only in a restricted portion of the water column and higher errors in winter and early spring when the variability is the largest when the standard deviation of the float profiles is used as a proxy of the spatial representation error to be merged into the tuned observation errors oetuns experiment the assimilation scheme can serve as a filter for anomalous data i e data whose high variability may not be fully captured by the model when prior qc rejection fails ingleby and huddleston 2007 however in our simulations the more complex description of the observation error covariance matrix has not given an overall improvement of the skill performance we tested the sensitivity of 3dvarbio to the frequency of the assimilation step fig 11 and table 4 showing that the persistence of the corrections itp index is almost invariant at an average time of half decay of about 4 5 days which being roughly equal to the bgc argo operational frequency confirms that bgc argo observing system provides consistent information to constrain biogeochemical models at least along the float trajectories low persistence of assimilated information might depend also on the biological processes simulated internally by bfm i e adjustments of biological interactions to the new conditions and by possible mismatches between physical and biological processes i e vertical mixing and nutrient availability and mesoscale horizontal dynamics indeed when the frequency is increased despite the decrease of intensity of the increments and the increase of computation burden the diagnostic statistics improved because the bgc argo float observations are assimilated at the same sampling day corresponding to the assimilation of the argo temperature and salinity profiles in the nemooceanvar model clementi et al 2017 thus increasing the local consistency between the physical and phytoplankton 3d fields low persistency has been already observed when satellite chlorophyll is assimilated fontana et al 2013 simon et al 2015 a direct update of the nutrient fields by the chlorophyll assimilation would provide longer impacts on the biogeochemical model dynamics it can be achieved by redesigning the v b operator with a multivariate covariance ciavatta et al 2016 or a balancing scheme hemmings et al 2008 on the other hand the integration of vertical profiles of biogeochemical observations enables the investigation of the roles of physical processes on biogeochemical forecasts dowd et al 2014 and the development of coupled physical biogeochemical data assimilation gehlen et al 2015 given the modularity of the 3dvarbio scheme the representation of missing processes can be improved by introducing an additional component to the v b v h v v operators decomposition to enable the correction of the physical forcing such as vertical mixing diffusivities the 3dvarbio scheme propagates the information of bgc argo float data in the surroundings of the sampling points through the horizontal component v h of the background error covariance decomposition the key factor that controls the extent of the spatial impact is the correlation radius length scale lr which has been set non uniform given the importance in properly reproducing the spatial scales of mesoscale features storto et al 2014 estimated lr has a spatial average of 15 2 km fig 2 which is similar to the value used for the assimilation of the t and s profiles in oceanvar dobricic and pinardi 2008 and to the rossby radius evaluated for the mediterranean sea robinson et al 2001 higher lr values indicate that larger areas are updated by the assimilation with skill performances increased as well table 3 however we verified by comparing with satellite surface chlorophyll that higher lr might generate spurious spatial correlations other data assimilation applications similarly implement limitation of the horizontal correlation length or the decorrelation radius to avoid occurrence of spurious correlations hu et al 2012 liu et al 2017 song et al 2016 tsiaras et al 2017 whatever are the lr estimates the effectiveness of the bgc argo data largely depends on the number of available profiles which in the case of the mediterranean sea is less than one third of those of physical assimilation increasing the number of bgc argo floats would be the ideal approach to enhancing the performance of the floats network in the context of operational data assimilation however given the high cost for a bgc argo float equipment their number might have already reached a sustainable threshold there might be other improvements to be performed on the biogeochemical data pre processing in order to extrapolate bgc argo profiles onto argo profiles for example when two floats one bgc argo and one ts argo are in the same sub basin or an area with same physical biogeochemical characteristics the assimilation of the bgc argo profile can be replicated in the location of ts argo profiles the developed isp metric which underlies a probabilistic approach for which each float profile is considered as a whole lavigne et al 2015 represents a potential tool for this extrapolation alternatively a data pre processing that combines bgc argo and satellite estimated ocean color fields might be used to extend the biogeochemical vertical profiles within spatially homogeneous surface chlorophyll areas as proposed in optimal interpolation of in situ sea surface salinity with thermal decorrelation scale based on satellite sea surface temperature buongiorno nardelli 2012 finally our results indicate that assimilation methods could be strongly informative in the objective design of an optimal strategy for the number and deployment of bgc argo floats the number and deployment locations could be analysed through specific observing system simulation experiments ose osse like those that are routinely performed for the t and s variables of the argo network raicich 2006 in the case of the mediterranean bgc argo network the sampling and deployment strategies are defined on the basis of observational objectives see d ortenzio et al 2014 the integration through assimilation of operational biogeochemical models and bgc argo floats may open interesting perspectives on an even more efficient design of the float deployment positions and sampling strategies 5 conclusions this paper demonstrates that the assimilation of observed chlorophyll vertical profiles from autonomous profiling floats such as bgc argo floats is feasible and effective in constraining a realistic ocean model simulation we have upgraded the 3dvarbio variational scheme of the operational biogeochemical mediterranean sea cmems system and showed that the assimilation of bgc argo float data improves the description of the chlorophyll vertical structure changes in concentration and shapes of profiles during the occurrence of both surface blooms in winter and deep chlorophyll maxima in summer and has a positive impact on a non assimilated variable such as nitrate we have tested different configurations of the 3dvarbio to assess the sensitivity and effectiveness of several key elements of the assimilation i e the observational error the components of the background error covariance matrix and the assimilation frequency by using diagnostic statistics and novel metrics the observation error has been tuned on a monthly basis to incorporate the representation error providing better results than any of the fixed error experiments the estimated non uniform correlation radius length scale average of about 15 km which is of the same order as the mesoscale dynamics and the size of the bgc argo float network i e around 15 floats permits to significantly constrain up to almost 10 of the mediterranean sea surface higher radius values promote more widespread impact of the floats assimilation and better forecast skill performances but cause the onset of spurious spatial patterns and correlation daily or 3 days frequency assimilation cycles have been shown to provide enough time persistence of the increments and the best assimilation performances despite the decrease of the specific impact per assimilation cycle and the increase of computational burden finally this paper represents the first step towards a multi platform biogeochemical data assimilation method in which both remotely sensed surface chlorophyll and chlorophyll profiles are assimilated such an assimilation will point out even more challenging issues related to the hierarchy and consistency of the data used in multi platform data assimilation

24064,the emerging availability of biogeochemical argo bgc argo float data creates new opportunities to combine models and observations in investigations of the interior structures and dynamics of marine ecosystems an existing variational data assimilation scheme 3dvarbio has been upgraded and coupled with the copernicus marine environment monitoring service biogeochemical model of the mediterranean sea to assimilate bgc argo chlorophyll profile observations our results show that the assimilation of bgc argo float data is feasible moreover the proposed data assimilation framework provides significant corrections to the chlorophyll concentrations and is able to consistently re adjust the shapes of chlorophyll profiles during surface blooms occurring in winter vertically mixed conditions and in the case of the summer deep chlorophyll maxima sensitivity analysis and diagnostic metrics have been applied to evaluate the impact of assimilation and the relevance of different factors of the 3dvarbio method a key factor is the observation error that has been tuned on a monthly basis to incorporate the representation error different frequencies of the assimilation cycle have been tested daily or 3 day assimilation fosters the highest skill performances despite the reduced impacts and the increase of computational burden considering the present size of the bgc argo mediterranean network about 15 floats and the estimated non homogeneous correlation radius length scale 15 2 km on average the chlorophyll assimilation can constrain the phytoplankton dynamics along the whole water column over an area up to 10 of the mediterranean sea keywords data assimilation biogeochemical argo float biogeochemical model chlorophyll mediterranean sea 1 introduction operational ocean forecasting systems coordinate observations and modeling systems and have been widely recognized as important assets in monitoring the state of the ocean thus addressing current challenges in increasing our understanding of the ocean and its role in society le traon et al 2017 she et al 2016 integration of data assimilation and models represents a key element in providing accurate assessments of ocean conditions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales data assimilation is a well developed practice in atmospheric science and in physical oceanography whereas it remains a challenge in biogeochemical ocean modeling brasseur et al 2009 dowd et al 2014 there exist several assimilation methods applied to biogeochemical models edwards et al 2015 a not exhaustive list includes popular implementations of kalman filter methods such as the singular evolutive extended kalman brasseur and verron 2006 fontana et al 2013 and the singular evolutive interpolated kalman triantafyllou et al 2013 nerger and gregg 2007 tsiaras et al 2017 and the ensemble kalman filters ciavatta et al 2011 2014 cossarini et al 2009 hu et al 2012 particle filter assimilation is a class of ensemble methods that are applicable to non linear systems ristic et al 2004 van leeuwen 2009 mattern et al 2013 variational approaches that minimize a least squares based cost function include 3dvar teruzzi et al 2014 and 4dvar song et al 2016 verdy and mazloff 2017 methods however a few of the assimilation methods mentioned above are used in the context of operational biogeochemical model systems specifically 3dvar variational scheme teruzzi et al 2016 hybrid ensemble oi kalman filter tsiaras et al 2017 and optimal interpolation with a multivariate balancing scheme ford et al 2012 in these particular applications the computational efficiency of the assimilation scheme teruzzi et al 2018b and the availability of near real time data le traon et al 2009 are also important aspects the most commonly assimilated variable in biogeochemical model applications is remote sensing derived chlorophyll ford et al 2012 fontana et al 2013 teruzzi et al 2014 2018a tsiaras et al 2017 because of the spatial and temporal coverage of these measurements and their availability through operational services such as the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems volpe et al 2012 le traon et al 2017 very few examples of the assimilation of in situ observations exist and the variables that have been incorporated into these studies include nutrients and oxygen from monitoring systems cossarini et al 2009 liu et al 2017 and pco2 and oxygen from multi platform instruments verdy and mazloff 2017 the sparseness and lack of availability of in situ biogeochemical measurements have limited their use in assimilation studies to date and represent a severe issue in operational biogeochemical modeling autonomous in situ platforms have already made critical contributions to improving physical assimilation systems the argo network is undoubtedly the most important in terms of the number of observations and its integration with assimilation systems the deployment of the argo network marked a transition in physical operational oceanography as it has provided publicly available observations of the interior of the global ocean in near real time le traon 2013 recently a biogeochemical equivalent of argo the bgc argo programme has been established johnson and claustre 2016 the bgc argo network is rapidly growing although the density of operational floats is still scarce compared to argo however at regional scale specific activities might provide a sufficient number of floats to both contribute to the improvement of ocean biogeochemical models brasseur et al 2009 and to be used in operational modeling frameworks le traon et al 2017 the mediterranean sea has one of the first bgc argo networks with a sufficient density of floats deployed in framework of the naos french initiative and of the argo italy bgc argo programme to test and validate assimilation systems thirty nine bgc argo floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors were deployed from 2012 to 2017 thus making the mediterranean bgc argo network one of the densest in terms of the number of profiles per unit surface area of the global ocean the mediterranean bgc argo float data also contributed to develop the quality control methods for the bgc argo chlorophyll observations that are presently endorsed at the international level schmechtig et al 2016 moreover specific methods for nitrate sensor calibration have been derived for the mediterranean pasqueron de fommervault et al 2015 d ortenzio et al 2014 to account for the biogeochemical characteristics of the basin in this work an innovative bgc argo data assimilation framework is discussed and its feasibility within a realistic model is demonstrated the framework is intended to be integrated into the operational mediterranean biogeochemistry model medbfm of the cmems system bolzon et al 2017 the medbfm model features the off line coupling of nemo3 6 clementi et al 2017 and ogstm bfm lazzari et al 2012 2016 cossarini et al 2015 and includes separate physical dobricic and pinardi 2008 farina et al 2015 storto et al 2014 and biogeochemical teruzzi et al 2014 variational data assimilation schemes the 3dvarbio variational assimilation scheme has already been shown to be suited for biogeochemical data assimilation due to its modularity teruzzi et al 2014 2018a a new upgrade of the 3dvarbio has been developed to assimilate the vertical chlorophyll profiles and update the phytoplankton state variables of ogstm bfm model the mediterranean sea is characterized by peculiar vertical phytoplankton characteristics it displays a marked seasonal cycle of surface and deep chlorophyll maxima lavigne et al 2015 mignot et al 2014 and a noticeable west east deepening of the deep chlorophyll maximum and trophic gradient lavigne et al 2015 thus the bgc argo float assimilation is discussed with the aim of showing its capability to correct the vertical structure of modelled chlorophyll furthermore we propose a tuning procedure based on the analysis of the a posteriori observation and background errors desroziers et al 2005 to define the observation error then key elements of the 3dvarbio scheme namely the components of the background error covariances and the frequency of assimilation are tested to investigate their impacts on the chlorophyll assimilation and simulated chlorophyll vertical dynamics their sensitivity is analysed through diagnostic statistics as defined in mattern et al 2018 and novel statistical indexes the paper is organized as follows after a brief presentation of the cmems biogeochemical modeling system for the mediterranean and the bgc argo data section 2 we focus on the novel elements of the variational data assimilation in the following section section 3 we describe the results of the new data assimilation method and a sensitivity analysis of several key elements a discussion of some key issues involved in the assimilation of bgc argo data is provided in section 4 then the paper closes with some final remarks and future prospects for the assimilation of biogeochemical data from multiple sources section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 mediterranean sea model the mediterranean sea hydrodynamic biogeochemical model is the off line coupled mfs medbfm with a 1 16 horizontal resolution and 72 unevenly spaced z levels in the vertical direction the first layer is approximately 1 5 m thick and the spacing increases to approximately 8 m at a depth of 100 m the medbfm biogeochemical model incorporates the ogstm transport model which is based on the opa system lazzari et al 2010 and the biogeochemical flux model bfm vichi et al 2015 lazzari et al 2012 2016 cossarini et al 2015 2017 and references therein bfm includes nine plankton functional types pfts diatoms flagellates picophytoplankton and dinoflagellates are the phytoplankton groups whereas carnivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton bacteria heterotrophic nanoflagellates and microzooplankton are the heterotrophic groups the bfm model describes the biogeochemical cycles of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silicon through the dissolved inorganic living organic and non living organic compartments dissolved oxygen alkalinity and carbonate system dynamics are also represented by the bfm cossarini et al 2015 melaku canu et al 2015 the non living compartments consist of 3 groups specifically labile semi labile and refractory organic matter the ogstm bfm is also integrated with a variational 3dvarbio scheme that has been used to assimilate remotely sensed surface

and in situ vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from xbts argo floats and gliders dobricic and pinardi 2008 storto et al 2014 the coupled model and the physical and biogeochemical assimilation schemes represent the core of the physical and biogeochemical components of the mediterranean monitoring and forecasting med mfc system of the cmems http marine copernicus eu which releases daily and weekly 3d gridded forecasts clementi et al 2017 bolzon et al 2017 and multi decadal reanalyses simoncelli et al 2014 teruzzi et al 2016 of the state of the mediterranean sea 2 2 data collected by bgc argo floats the bgc argo floats network is one of the first real time biogeochemical in situ ocean observing system johnson and claustre 2016 bgc argo floats are equipped with sensors that measure biogeochemical parameters e g chlorophyll nitrate ph oxygen suspended particles and downwelling irradiance and collect and transmit data in near real time as the argo floats roemmich et al 2009 the first bgc argo float was deployed in the mediterranean in 2009 at present august 2018 39 floats have been deployed and about 15 are still operational in our model experiments that cover the year 2015 25 floats with chlorophyll data are available and located mainly in the western mediterranean the northern ionian sea and the central part of the levantine basin fig 1 the measured chlorophyll profiles are processed with specific quality control qc methods and become available 24 h after the data are collected delayed mode qc for chlorophyll is based on specific quality control algorithms schmechtig et al 2015 and an additional correction factor of 0 5 on the amplitude of wetlabs fluorescence signal to get a proxy of total chlorophyll concentration is applied roesler et al 2017 moreover the pre operational quality protocol applied before performing assimilation includes the detection of anomalous chlorophyll data e g negative values spikes exceeding 10 mg m3 and the application of a 5 point moving gaussian smoothing providing a 2 m resolution vertical profiles further nitrate concentrations from 8 bgc argo floats blue labels in fig 1 after qc pasqueron de fommervault et al 2015 are used to assess the impact the 3dvarbio on a non assimilated model variable 2 3 3dvarbio assimilation scheme in the 3dvarbio assimilation scheme the analysis step involves the minimization of the cost function 1 j x a 1 2 x a x b t b 1 x a x b 1 2 y h x b t r 1 y h x b where x b is the background model state before the assimilation x a is the analysis y represents the available observations and y h x b is the innovation b and r are the background and observation error covariance matrices the term h is the observational operator according to weaver et al 2003 and dobricic and pinardi 2008 the solution of the cost function namely the increment x a x b is computed by means of a new control variable v such that x a x b vv where b is rewritten as b vv t and the transformation matrix v can be decomposed into a sequence of operators that characterize different aspects of the error covariances and transform increments from the control space to the model space the 3dvarbio is based on the oceanvar physical assimilation scheme dobricic and pinardi 2008 and has been modified for biogeochemical assimilation teruzzi et al 2014 2018a by upgrading the decomposition of v v b v h v v to integrate remotely sensed chlorophyll data teruzzi et al 2014 2018a the three operators are the vertical error covariance v v the horizontal error covariance v h and the biogeochemical state variable error covariance v b in the present study the 3dvarbio scheme is redesigned to permit the assimilation of chlorophyll observation vertical profiles by upgrading r and h and the two linear operators v v and v h the biological operator v b which is built on covariances between chlorophyll and other phytoplankton state variables i e carbon nitrate and phosphorus contents in the four phytoplankton group is kept as in teruzzi et al 2014 the upgraded observation operator h is a linear interpolator from the model grid to the observation space i e to the position and vertical depths of the float profiles and computes the sum of the chlorophyll content of the 4 phytoplankton functional types the observation error r is implemented as a diagonal matrix whose values are estimated through a tuning analysis presented in section 3 1 the minimization of the cost function is computed without log transforming chlorophyll innovation vectors teruzzi et al 2014 2018a which have indeed symmetric and mostly gaussian distributions not shown possible negative increment values are corrected diagnostically at the end of the assimilation cycle with a very small positive value 10 4 mg m3 and with changes to nitrogen phosphorus and carbon components of each pft based on the vb operator teruzzi et al 2018a the effect of this correction is negligible it occurs in less of the 4 of the cases and mostly in the deepest part of the vertical chlorophyll profiles 2 3 1 vertical covariance operator the vertical covariance operator v v consists of a set of profiles obtained by empirical orthogonal function eof decomposition as described in teruzzi et al 2014 of a multiannual simulation bolzon et al 2017 sets of eofs are computed for the sub regions of fig 1 and for the 12 months in order to account for the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the vertical dynamics of the background errors examples of eofs modes for two selected sub basins and months fig 2 show that nearly all of the covariance is described by the first three eofs the first eof mode reflects a uniform vertical covariance of the error in january while significant eofs obtained for august are characterized by low values in the 0 30 m layer and the presence of two or more peaks with opposite signs in the deeper layers these peaks account for the variability around the deep chlorophyll maximum dcm which is deeper in the eastern with respect to the western mediterranean sea lavigne et al 2015 moreover in summer the variance of higher order eofs grey lines in fig 2 is larger than that in winter i e the first three eofs account for nearly 85 and 70 of the error covariance in january and august western sub basins e g nwm in fig 2 have eof explained variances higher than the eastern ones e g lev2 in fig 2 reflecting a larger background variability in the western sub basin teruzzi et al 2014 2 3 2 horizontal covariance operator the horizontal covariance operator v h consists of a gaussian recursive filter dobricic and pinardi 2008 whose correlation radius length scale modulates the smoothing intensity and the areas influenced by the operator the filter has been redesigned to work with non uniform correlation radius length scales lr because local effects may be important in regions with high spatial variability storto et al 2014 at each model grid point and vertical level lr is set equal to the standard deviation of a gaussian theoretical distribution estimated using a non linear least squares fitting algorithm i e levenberg marquardt algorithm implemented in the scipy python package on the distribution of the temporal correlation between a given point and all of the nearby points within a radius of 100 km the temporal correlation is calculated using the daily output from a previous run bolzon et al 2017 the spatial distribution of lr at surface is shown in fig 3 the values of lr range from 12 20 km and display a basin average of 15 2 km and a standard deviation of 1 6 km lower values occur along the coast whereas the areas characterized by the highest values reflect some common patterns of the mean current fields poulain et al 2012 this result emphasizes that physical transport processes may lead to elevated covariance the correlation radius length scale decreases with depth the averages at 50 m and 100 m are 14 8 and 14 3 km respectively maintaining spatial patterns similar to those at the surface 2 4 setup of assimilation simulations several assimilation simulations were carried out table 1 employing different configurations of key aspects of the 3dvarbio each simulation covers the period 1 jan 2015 31 dec 2015 and consists of sequential cycles of one assimilation step followed by a given number of forecast days a set of simulations featuring constant observation error oe010 oe025 and oe050 is used to tune the monthly values of the observation error which is then used in the core simulation oetun of the sensitivity analysis an additional simulation oetuns differs from oetun because the observation error of each float profile is set equal to the tuned monthly values used in oetun multiplied by the ratio between the chlorophyll profile standard deviation and the average of all profile standard deviations of that given month the oetun5eof simulation is intended to evaluate the effects of using a smaller number of eofs to define the vertical component of the background error covariance v v whereas two other experiments oetunlr 50 and oetunlr 100 are used to analyse the sensitivity of the assimilation to the increase 50 and 100 respectively of correlation radius length scale lr of v h the assimilation cycle of oetun is equal to 7 days which is the frequency of the assimilation cycle currently adopted in the cmems med mfc biogeochemistry operational system bolzon et al 2017 and is close to the sampling frequency of most of the bgc argo floats i e 5 days in 2015 thus all the float profiles within a time window of 3 days centred on the day of a given assimilation step are considered to be synoptic and used in the assimilation when multiple profiles are available for a given float within the given time window the different profiles are treated as independent measurements the effect of the time frequency of the assimilation steps is assessed by decreasing the assimilation cycle length from 7 days to 5 days 3 days and 1 day oetun5d oetun3d oetun1d and assuming the temporal window used in searching for available float profiles has a width of 2 days 1 day and 1 day respectively the set of simulations also includes a reference run ref in which the medbfm model is run without assimilation 2 5 diagnostic metrics following desroziers et al 2005 and mattern et al 2018 diagnostic statistics are calculated to quantify the model data difference for the posterior and prior model solutions 2 d a o y h x a 3 d b o y h x b while the following statistic 4 d b a h x a h x b quantifies the increments at the observation locations two diagnostic quantities the a posteriori observation error σ o and the a posteriori background error σ b 5 σ o d a o t d b o n 6 σ b d b a t d b o n are applied in section 3 1 to tune the observation error using the results of the constant observation error assimilation simulations oetun010 oetun015 and oetun050 the impact of the bgc argo assimilation on biogeochemical fields and the sensitivity of the model to different factors are analysed using a series of diagnostics and novel metrics designed to characterize the intensity shape and extent of the changes caused by the assimilation in particular we define the absolute integral increment int 7 int 150 z 0 d b a dz 150 as the average of the absolute increment over the 0 150 m layer for each float profile and assimilation step the average of int over floats and assimilation cycles quantifies the intensity of the change on the updated chlorophyll fields following mattern et al 2018 the root mean square rms of the differences between observation and prior model solution 8 e b 1 n d b o 2 provides a measurement of da performance it can be intended as a short term forecast skill metric since it is based on observations that are going to be assimilated in the following cycles high values of int without a significant reduction of eb might indicate overfitting mattern et al 2018 thus we define the overfitting metric 9 io n t d b o t 1 2 d a o t 2 that accounts for the reduction of the prior model solution and observation difference at the t 1th assimilation cycle given the previous i e tth cycle posterior model solution and observation difference the metric is computed at time t 1 using the same number of floats at time t an assimilation system achieving a lower value of io indicates that a given increment promotes a better innovation of the model solution at the following assimilation cycle the shape of the innovation profile index isp provides a unique number to describe the shapes of the increment profiles for each assimilated float 10 isp n 0 4 0 if z n d b a 0 2 n if z n d b a 0 where z n are defined as the five 30 m layers i e 0 30 m 30 60 m 60 90 m 90 120 m and 120 150 into which the increment profile is partitioned the value of zero is given to negative increment layers whereas a value of 2 to the power of the layer number minus one i e 2 21 22 23 24 for the five layers is assigned to positive increment layer the sum of the five values then gives the isp which ranges from 0 for entirely negative increment profiles to 31 for entirely positive increment profiles and covers all the possible intermediate shapes of alternating positive and negative layers see upper panel of fig 9 intermediate values and high variability of isp indicate that the assimilation provides not only corrections of the uniform bias along the vertical profile but also adjustments to the shape of the modelled chlorophyll profiles given the sparseness of bgc argo floats distribution the index of spatial increment isi is calculated to measure the impact of the assimilation in the horizontal dimension 11 i s i x y s u r f a c e x y s u c h t h a t x a x b 0 150 m t i s i d x d y where tisi is a threshold equal to 0 001 mg m3 and x a x b 0 150m is the absolute increment averaged over 0 150 m in the model space isi provides the horizontal coverage of the impact of the bgc argo float network in the mediterranean sea in our case finally the time persistency index itp reflects how long the correction of the assimilation persists over time in the vicinity of the position of a float 12 itp time such that 150 z 0 neig hbour x y x t assim x t ref x 0 assim x 0 ref 0 5 where xassim and xref are the model solutions of the assimilation and reference runs averaged in a neighbour i e an area of 30 km of radius of the float trajectory their difference is computed on the assimilation day time t 0 and for the following days t then the time series of the ratios between the differences at time t and t 0 are used to evaluate the time after which the ratio is halved 3 results 3 1 tuning of the observation error the observation error is a critical element of biogeochemical data assimilation teruzzi et al 2014 because quantities are usually measured indirectly e g optical measurements are converted into biogeochemical quantities using theoretical and empirical models leading to additional uncertainty dowd et al 2014 thus the statistical properties of the observation errors are not perfectly known and their determination is not straightforward desroziers et al 2005 in practice several approaches can be used to define the observation error including the precision of the measurement methods the accuracy computed using independent datasets and the representativeness and variability of spatial temporal sampling e g liu et al 2017 verdy and mazloff 2017 gharamti et al 2017a and 2017b further the observation error provides indications about the relative quality of the assimilated observations losa et al 2012 losa et al 2014 thus it depends also on the temporal and spatial scales resolved by the model therefore in order to account for the representation error our approach involves a tuning on a monthly basis of the observation error with respect to the consistency i e equality between the two a posteriori observation σ o and background σ b errors as defined in desroziers et al 2005 the calibration procedure uses the results of the assimilation simulations with constant observation error values equal to 0 01 oe010 0 025 oe025 and 0 05 oe050 mg m3 table 1 and is performed separately for each month the linear regressions of a posteriori errors are shown for two selected months fig 4 and their consistency is achieved at the intersection where the observation error is equal to 0 0149 and 0 0690 mg m3 respectively in august green and january blue results of the calibration procedure for all months indicate a seasonal pattern with higher observation errors in winter and spring months corresponding to periods with higher variability and consistently with the hypothesis that representation errors correlate with high variabilities janjic et al 2017 to quantitatively analyse the effect of the observation error the values of the diagnostic statistics are shown in fig 5 for the constant and tuned observation errors the averages of the absolute increment metric int indicate that the lower the observation errors the higher the values of the int indexes fig 5a in fact the assimilation that features a lower observation error minimizes the cost function and produces profiles that lie closer to the observed ones the oetun run has an average value of int close to oe050 and is characterized by a lower range of the monthly values due to the effect of the time varying observation error to verify whether the monthly tuned observation error represents an optimal solution we computed the rms of the differences between observations and prior model solution eb and the index of the overfitting io fig 5b despite the low variability of eb among the simulations with the mean eb almost equal among the experiments oetun has the lowest value of the prior model error i e 0 0885 and 0 0892 mg m3 for oetun and oe010 respectively and presents reduced evidence of overfitting higher observation errors during winter months of oetun reduce the increments dots on the right part of fig 5a during period of high dynamics limiting the overfitting dots on the right part of fig 5b on the other hand during summer when variability is lower the oetun is characterized by lower observation error which constrains better the model solution thus the time varying observation error consistently with the evolution of model error and its variability represents a superior solution with respect to each one of the fixed observation error experiments the spatio temporal variability of the metrics is pretty high monthly averages are shown in fig 5 highlighting a possible limit of the analysis that uses a small number of sparse observations to constrain such a time varying and heterogeneous marine ecosystem as the mediterranean sea consistently with the hypothesis that the observation error can be set proportional to the data dispersion or variability oke and sakov 2008 the oetuns experiment features an observation error that varies both in time i e monthly tuned values of oetun and in space according to the ratio between the standard deviation of each float profile and the monthly average of the standard deviation of all the floats the average diagnostics statistics yielded by the oetuns simulation are largely consistent with those of oetun fig 5b however the variability of statistics decreases in the case of oetuns because the use of normalized but spatially varying observation error reduces the impact of some floats that have high innovation associated with high standard deviations i e abrupt profiles with very high peaks that occur for less than 10 of cases and mainly in winter the observation error of these profiles is set higher than the monthly tuned values and it causes lower increments not shown filtering the effect of possible anomalous data as an overall effect fig 5 shows that the same average of int is produced despite the slightly lower average of the observation error of oetuns w r t oetun 3 2 assimilation impact on the chlorophyll and nitrate profiles to analyse in details the effects of the bgc argo floats assimilation on vertical patterns the hovmoller diagrams of fig 6 report the temporal evolution of chlorophyll profiles for four selected bgc argo floats in the western 6901491 and 6901600 and eastern 6901528 and 6901773 mediterranean sea chlorophyll profiles of assimilation upper panels and reference run without assimilation ref middle panel are averaged over an area of 30 km of radius surrounding each selected float trajectory the oetun ref differences lower panels in fig 6 show the impact of assimilation on the chlorophyll dynamics the upper middle plots exemplify the behavior of phytoplankton dynamics simulated by the bfm model which are consistent with what described in lavigne et al 2015 they show the increase in chlorophyll at the surface layer bloom during the winter and autumn when vertically mixed conditions occur the presence of a deep chlorophyll maximum dcm during summer stratified conditions and the decreasing trophic gradient from the western e g 6901491 and 6901600 floats to the eastern e g 6901528 and 6901773 floats mediterranean sea fig 7 completes the qualitative analysis by reporting the profiles of prior and posterior model simulation and observation together with the innovation and increment profiles for some selected assimilation cycle of the floats of fig 6 the major changes introduced by the assimilation during winter and early spring months lower panel of fig 6a and b affect the intensity and timing of the chlorophyll surface bloom and to a lesser degree the depth of the vertically mixed bloom in the case of the float 6901491 the assimilation results in higher values of the surface bloom with respect to the reference run during almost all of the assimilation steps except in two weeks during february fig 6a increments are generally homogeneous over the bloom layers till the onset of the dcm in april as shown by the profiles of fig 7a the assimilation forces a change in the depth of the bloom layer which is approximately 15 20 m deeper than the prior state the intensity of correction for float 6901528 fig 6b is pretty low since the model already performs quite well indeed a very low increment is prescribed by the assimilation for float 6901528 at the selected date fig 7b fig 6b shows also that in april and may the assimilation corrects the rate of deepening of the onset of the dcm which starts shallower in april and ends deeper in may in the assimilation simulation with respect to the reference considering all the assimilation cycles during winter and autumn the depth of the layer characterized by the surface bloom i e depth at which the chlorophyll concentration is 10 of the surface value is changed on the 56 of the cases during the summer period the impact of the assimilation occurs mainly in the intermediate layers between 50 and 150 m which correspond to the dcm layer in this case the assimilation changes both the intensity of the dcm and the shapes of the chlorophyll profiles fig 6c and d in the case of float 6901600 fig 6c the comparison between oetun and ref runs highlights a general good performance of the model in reproducing the processes driving the dcm formation in the area of the western mediterranean sub basin visited by the float the sequence of positive and negative corrections around the depth of the dcm displays however the presence of small scale dynamics not properly simulated by the model conversely the assimilation along the trajectory of float 6901773 has a constant impact that deepens the dcm fig 6d highlighting the presence of a possible bias of the model in reproducing the processes sustaining the dcm in this part of the eastern mediterranean basin during summer the innovation and increment profiles assume a characteristic reversed s as in fig 7c and s shapes as in fig 7d highlighting the ability of the assimilation to substantially change the location and width of the layer around the dcm i e the layer where organic matter is produced during the summer season as a result the dcm of the analysis of float 6901600 is 10 m shallower than that of forecast fig 7c while dcm of analysis of 6901773 has a more noticeable peak at 110 m depth w r t forecast fig 7d the comparison of the analysis and forecast profiles of all assimilation cycles reveals that the 52 of the dcm depths are changed during april to august the chlorophyll assimilation updates directly the phytoplankton variables 17 state variables of the bfm model through the v b operator and has an indirect impact on all the model variables as an example the impact of oetun assimilation on nitrate is shown in fig 8 w r t ref simulation in floats 6901773 the assimilation forces a deeper dcm fig 6d which produces an extra consumption of nitrate at the layer of dcm 8b the correction of the timing of the surface bloom for float 6901600 during winter and spring fig 6c triggers extra negative anomalies and lower positive anomalies amounts of nitrate uptake by phytoplankton fig 8a during summer the nitrate differences between oetun and ref are negative with the highest values corresponding to the moments of the highest positive corrections in chlorophyll dynamics at the dcm depths see fig 6c on the other hand the negative chlorophyll corrections have a minor impact in nitrate being phytoplankton in a condition of luxury uptake for nitrate lazzari et al 2016 the nitrate uptake is at the minimum during summer showing negligible sensitivity to the decrease of phytoplankton biomass using the nitrate concentrations from bgc argo floats blue labels in fig 1 the skill performance assessment on the non assimilated variable is reported table 2 in terms of rms of the differences between model and observations along 5 layers and of the rms of the difference of the depth of the nitracline i e the depth at which the nitrate concentration is 2 mmol m3 statistics are given for the ref simulation and in terms of relative variation for the oetun simulation even if our results must be cautiously considered due to the low number of available profiles the chlorophyll assimilation has an overall positive impact quantified as the decrease of the rms in all sub basins and almost all levels beside that the nwm sub basin shows also an improvement of the estimate of the displacement of the depth of the nitracline 3 3 sensitivity to the definition of vv operator to provide a statistical measure of the effectiveness of the data assimilation in changing the profile shapes the isp defined in section 2 5 assigns a unique value to any given alternation of positive and negative layers in the increment profiles eq 10 and the upper panel of fig 9 as an example the isp values of the four increment profiles of fig 7 are 31 0 23 and 24 the frequency of the isp values of oetun lower panels of fig 9 shows that during winter and autumn the increment profiles belong mainly to two categories 0 and 31 i e entirely negative and positive increments respectively this basically underlines a correction of some bias along the water column only isp values of 7 and 15 in winter and 7 24 28 and 30 in autumn are the other more frequent cases of increment profiles frequency higher than 4 that modify the thickness and depth of the layer containing the winter and autumn surface bloom in spring and summer the isp frequency distribution is broader with frequency higher than 4 for isp equal to 0 3 7 16 24 28 30 and 31 spring and 0 7 15 16 24 28 30 and 31 summer a larger range of isp values reflect the capability of the float assimilation to compute complex increment profiles allowing for changes in the position and shape of the dcm as in fig 7c and d to emphasize the higher diversity of possible behaviors of the assimilation in the different seasons the shannon index of diversity is calculated as 13 h i 0 31 p i ln p i using the frequencies of the isp values pi as expected the h value for spring and summer fig 9 is 50 70 higher than that for winter and autumn the sensitivity of the vertical behavior of the assimilation is tested against a reduced number of eof modes of vv oetun5eof and a lower observation error oe010 a data assimilation system able to produce higher number of different types of vertical increments higher h would be preferable since it reflects a superior use of the information from the vertical chlorophyll profile of bgc argo floats oetun5eof results second lower panel in fig 9 indicate that the addition of lower variance eof modes has a very small effect on the isp frequency distribution i e the shannon index does not change substantially highlighting that the first eofs are sufficient to integrate in the vertical direction the chlorophyll profiles in all the seasons on the other hand the use of a low value of the observation error oe010 bottom panel in fig 9 gives the highest values of the shannon index with the exception of autumn the increase is significant in winter but modest in spring and summer the oe010 simulation forces more complex increment profiles and the chlorophyll analysis profiles to be much closer to the bgc argo float profiles than the other two experiments when the model observation difference is the highest i e winter months the low sensitivity during summer results primarily from the vertical resolution of the model in the zone of the dcm which is between 8 and 14 m the coarseness of the vertical model resolution limits the effectiveness of the data assimilation to examine how the range of the vertical subdivision affects this result the isp is recomputed for 8 layers 20 m thick resulting in 256 possible increment profile shapes not shown the new values of h and the isp variability are generally 15 25 higher than in the case of the 5 layer isp but the differences among the simulations remain unchanged 3 4 sensitivity to the definition of vh operator the spatial extent over which the information from the bgc argo profiles propagates through the assimilation is mostly controlled by the vh operator and the correlation radius length scale daily 0 150 m averaged maps of chlorophyll are shown in fig 10 left panels for two assimilation dates along with the increment maps of oetun simulation fig 10 right panels the increment maps are obtained by separately averaging the positive shading and negative contour lines increments over the 0 150 m depths fig 10 shows that the increment patterns are generally rounded patches not overlapping since the distance between floats remains large further increment dimensions are comparable to the pattern of chlorophyll spatial features some of the floats or profiles of the same float e g floats in swm2 nwm and tyr2 fig 10 right panel are sufficiently close one to another that their increment areas overlap showing more complex horizontal patterns increment profiles characterized by isp equal to 0 and 31 promote uniform negative and positive vertical homogeneous patches as in most of the cases of the upper panel of fig 10 during summer increments are composed by vertically overlapping patches of negative and positive values since isp differs from 0 and 31 as in all cases of fig 10 lower panel given the chosen threshold tisi and the number of available floats large areas of the mediterranean sea remain unaffected by the assimilation computing the area with absolute increment values that exceed the threshold during each assimilation steps provides a measure of the spatial impact of assimilation the mean area impacted by oetun is 194 103 km2 table 3 the area impacted by the assimilation depends greatly on the number of available float profiles between 14 and 22 and on the intensity of innovation when isi is normalized by the number of float profiles the average area with increment values above the threshold is approximately 0 4 of the total surface area of the mediterranean sea the normalized isi is 30 higher in winter and autumn w r t spring and summer because of higher absolute innovation and of the uniformity of the increments along the water column isp equal to 0 and 31 on the contrary during summer a lower mean of the extent of the spatial impacted area arises from the vertical integration of the increment profiles with isp shape different from 0 to 31 i e increment profiles have very low values in some layers the correlation radius length scale lr of oetun which is estimated using pre existing modelled chlorophyll fields has been tested against variation of 50 and 100 oetunlr 50 and oetunlr 100 table 1 the results of the sensitivity tests table 3 show that the isi changes more than linearly 90 and 190 in the two tests respectively the increase of lr shows also a slight improvement of the forecast skill performance with respect to the oetun since assimilation with a larger impacted area triggers a better evolution in the next point of emersion of the same float which is usually 40 60 km far from the previous assimilated one however larger horizontal uniform increment patterns might be not always optimal unless for large spatial bias this can be intuitively deduced by the visual comparison of the dimension of horizontal patterns of the chlorophyll maps and the typical roughly round shaped increment patterns fig 10 to investigate that we computed the correlation between esa cci daily satellite maps from cmems colella et al 2016 and model surface chlorophyll for every sub basins and assimilation cycles for the reference ref and assimilation simulations in almost 60 of the cases the correlation between satellite and surface model chlorophyll of the assimilation simulations does not change significantly w r t the one of ref i e correlation variation lower than 0 01 indeed the float assimilation does not substantially change the spatial pattern of the surface chlorophyll during summer however we observe a worsening of the correlation of oetun w r t ref in 30 of the cases mostly in winter with a mean negative variation of the correlation of 0 04 with larger lr the worsening increases table 3 highlighting the possible onset of not consistent spatial patterns and spurious correlation 3 5 sensitivity to the frequency of the assimilation cycle another critical element that determines the effectiveness of the assimilation is the frequency of the assimilation cycle high frequency assimilation cycles may promote the model simulation to more closely approach the evolution of the sequence of observations however insufficient in situ observation spatial coverage may result in unrealistic patchy and scattered analysis and in overfitting when the distance between profiles is large compared to the scale of horizontal decorrelation cane et al 1996 indeed fig 6 shows that corrections introduced by the assimilation can be smoothed by the model integration in the following days and the oetun and ref simulation can converge towards similar chlorophyll profiles i e anomalies oetun ref approaching zero in the lower panels of fig 6 when a local change is introduced by the assimilation the following period of model integration may smooth the new condition depending on the physical horizontal transport and diffusion into and from adjacent areas and vertical mixing and biogeochemical processes that act upon the new condition we propose to quantify the persistence of the assimilation by following the model evolution in a neighbour of the float trajectory the difference between the oetun and ref simulation is computed on the day of the assimilation step t 0 and on the following days t 1 2 6 the ratio between the differences at time t and at initial time t 0 eq 12 is reported in fig 11 for all bgc argo floats and the 365 days of simulation the ratio is equal to 1 on the day of the assimilation steps orange color in fig 11 and decreases from 1 in the following days in almost 80 of the cases shading strips toward green and blue colors in fig 11 the index of temporal persistence itp that accounts for how many days the ratio is above 0 5 after the assimilation steps averages 5 7 days table 4 the 21 of the cases have values higher than 1 grey shadings in fig 11 indicating that chlorophyll assimilation can also initialize local phytoplankton dynamics that differ from those seen in the reference run this difference is also encouraged by the assimilation of data from adjacent floats that drives a larger and self sustaining area with divergent dynamics examples can be noted by concomitant grey shading stripes in adjacent rows of fig 11 which correspond to close float trajectories e g 6901653 6901648 and 6901649 in the nwm in january 6901529 and 6901865 in ion3 in january 6901769 and 6901864 in tyr2 in june 6901771 and 6901863 at the border between ion2 and ion3 in june and 6901764 and 6901766 in lev2 in june when the frequency of the assimilation steps increases from 7 day to 5 3 and 1 day oetun5d oetun3d and oetun1d in table 1 the number of observed profiles that is available in each assimilation cycle decreases significantly table 4 the 7 day assimilation shows the highest persistence and int because the presence of close profiles in some of the assimilation steps produces impacts on larger local areas thus increasing the mean persistence on the other hand the daily assimilation oetun1d has 291 cycles over the 365 total available i e 20 of the days of the year lacks any available float with an average of 4 available float profiles per cycle of assimilation the analyses are less widespread given the decrease of spatial interactions between floats and mean absolute increment int is the lowest among the simulations however the increase of the assimilation frequency improves the skill performance statistics eb and io generally decreasing in table 4 mostly because the chlorophyll profiles are assimilated at the same time and location as the temperature and salinity profiles assimilation in the physical model thus increasing the consistency between the physical vertical properties and chlorophyll at the local scale the best performances are for the 3 days and 1 day simulations the slightly difference of persistence between them is mostly due to the fact that a float is assimilated by oetun3d every 3 and 6 days while generally every 5 days by oetun1d thus allowing a longer time of simulation between two consecutive assimilations in the latter case 4 discussion the scarce availability of in situ data has limited their use in biogeochemical data assimilation studies currently the emerging availability of bgc argo float data creates new opportunities dowd et al 2014 that allows the combination of models and observations in investigating the interior structure of marine ecosystems and for operational purposes we show that the assimilation of bgc argo float data can be carried out in a variational assimilation framework and that this practice results in significant corrections to the chlorophyll state and evolution and in positive impacts on the analysed non assimilated variable although the reference run i e without biogeochemical assimilation already provides reasonable results the assimilation of chlorophyll data from bgc argo floats provides corrections to chlorophyll concentrations and several vertical features such as the onset and dynamics of the dcm layer in spring and summer the thickness of the water column involved in the winter and autumn surface blooms and the timing of the blooms figs 6 and 7 this result is an important novel aspect of this work considering that when assimilation employs satellite chlorophyll the correction along the water column usually relies on a priori knowledge such as predefined covariances song et al 2016 or model ensemble derived covariances ciavatta et al 2014 moreover apart from a few examples teruzzi et al 2014 jones et al 2016 vertical corrections and assessments of the vertical phytoplankton state and dynamics are seldom shown the density of observations in the vertical direction is a key novel factor because bgc argo floats efficiently resolve vertical profiles of chlorophyll concentrations in the mediterranean sea d ortenzio et al 2014 mignot et al 2014 and allow to correct simulated vertical phytoplankton dynamics figs 6 and 7 given the relevance of analysing vertical profiles as a whole as proposed in lavigne et al 2015 the index of shape profile isp which characterizes the increment profiles showed that the first most relevant eofs of the v v operator of 3dvarbio are sufficient to integrate on the vertical direction the chlorophyll profiles in all the seasons low sensitivity of isp in summer and spring is because the highest values of increments occur in the sub surface layer where the vertical resolution of the model is much coarser e g layer thicknesses of 8 15 m at the depths of 100 150 m than that of the observations indeed this result indicates that the specific biogeochemical processes taking place at depth in spring and summer i e the formation of a deep chlorophyll maximum that is closely associated with the presence of a nutricline at the bottom of the photic layer might require a finer vertical model resolution to depths of at least 150 m in the mediterranean sea to fully resolve the vertical plankton structure observed by the bgc argo floats a proper estimate of the observation error of the bgc argo floats data is a crucial aspect in effective assimilation the sources of uncertainty in observations are many first the bgc argo biogeochemical variables are often derived from measurements of optical quantities through complex calibration processes but little reference to the errors is provided dowd et al 2014 the uncertainty of observations can be estimated considering independent datasets when they are available for example mignot et al 2018 employ a triple collocation analysis stoffelen 1998 gruber et al 2016 to estimate the random error standard deviation in chlorophyll a concentrations collected by 21 bgc argo floats in the mediterranean sea by combining the covariances of three independent data sets according to their analysis bgc argo float chlorophyll a concentrations have a random error standard deviation of 0 03 mg m3 in the mediterranean sea which is comparable with our tuned monthly observation errors in biogeochemical data assimilation applications the representation errors janjic et al 2017 can be relevant and difficult to estimate considering that isolated observations are compared with model grid cells that may miss the spatio temporal scales present in the observations given the coarse resolution of the model oke and sakov 2008 objective procedures for tuning the error covariance matrices represent a strategy to improve the assimilation mattern et al 2018 in our case a tuning based on the consistency between the a posteriori errors fig 4 highlighted that observation errors should vary over the course of the year with lower errors in summer when concentrations are lower and high values of chlorophyll are present only in a restricted portion of the water column and higher errors in winter and early spring when the variability is the largest when the standard deviation of the float profiles is used as a proxy of the spatial representation error to be merged into the tuned observation errors oetuns experiment the assimilation scheme can serve as a filter for anomalous data i e data whose high variability may not be fully captured by the model when prior qc rejection fails ingleby and huddleston 2007 however in our simulations the more complex description of the observation error covariance matrix has not given an overall improvement of the skill performance we tested the sensitivity of 3dvarbio to the frequency of the assimilation step fig 11 and table 4 showing that the persistence of the corrections itp index is almost invariant at an average time of half decay of about 4 5 days which being roughly equal to the bgc argo operational frequency confirms that bgc argo observing system provides consistent information to constrain biogeochemical models at least along the float trajectories low persistence of assimilated information might depend also on the biological processes simulated internally by bfm i e adjustments of biological interactions to the new conditions and by possible mismatches between physical and biological processes i e vertical mixing and nutrient availability and mesoscale horizontal dynamics indeed when the frequency is increased despite the decrease of intensity of the increments and the increase of computation burden the diagnostic statistics improved because the bgc argo float observations are assimilated at the same sampling day corresponding to the assimilation of the argo temperature and salinity profiles in the nemooceanvar model clementi et al 2017 thus increasing the local consistency between the physical and phytoplankton 3d fields low persistency has been already observed when satellite chlorophyll is assimilated fontana et al 2013 simon et al 2015 a direct update of the nutrient fields by the chlorophyll assimilation would provide longer impacts on the biogeochemical model dynamics it can be achieved by redesigning the v b operator with a multivariate covariance ciavatta et al 2016 or a balancing scheme hemmings et al 2008 on the other hand the integration of vertical profiles of biogeochemical observations enables the investigation of the roles of physical processes on biogeochemical forecasts dowd et al 2014 and the development of coupled physical biogeochemical data assimilation gehlen et al 2015 given the modularity of the 3dvarbio scheme the representation of missing processes can be improved by introducing an additional component to the v b v h v v operators decomposition to enable the correction of the physical forcing such as vertical mixing diffusivities the 3dvarbio scheme propagates the information of bgc argo float data in the surroundings of the sampling points through the horizontal component v h of the background error covariance decomposition the key factor that controls the extent of the spatial impact is the correlation radius length scale lr which has been set non uniform given the importance in properly reproducing the spatial scales of mesoscale features storto et al 2014 estimated lr has a spatial average of 15 2 km fig 2 which is similar to the value used for the assimilation of the t and s profiles in oceanvar dobricic and pinardi 2008 and to the rossby radius evaluated for the mediterranean sea robinson et al 2001 higher lr values indicate that larger areas are updated by the assimilation with skill performances increased as well table 3 however we verified by comparing with satellite surface chlorophyll that higher lr might generate spurious spatial correlations other data assimilation applications similarly implement limitation of the horizontal correlation length or the decorrelation radius to avoid occurrence of spurious correlations hu et al 2012 liu et al 2017 song et al 2016 tsiaras et al 2017 whatever are the lr estimates the effectiveness of the bgc argo data largely depends on the number of available profiles which in the case of the mediterranean sea is less than one third of those of physical assimilation increasing the number of bgc argo floats would be the ideal approach to enhancing the performance of the floats network in the context of operational data assimilation however given the high cost for a bgc argo float equipment their number might have already reached a sustainable threshold there might be other improvements to be performed on the biogeochemical data pre processing in order to extrapolate bgc argo profiles onto argo profiles for example when two floats one bgc argo and one ts argo are in the same sub basin or an area with same physical biogeochemical characteristics the assimilation of the bgc argo profile can be replicated in the location of ts argo profiles the developed isp metric which underlies a probabilistic approach for which each float profile is considered as a whole lavigne et al 2015 represents a potential tool for this extrapolation alternatively a data pre processing that combines bgc argo and satellite estimated ocean color fields might be used to extend the biogeochemical vertical profiles within spatially homogeneous surface chlorophyll areas as proposed in optimal interpolation of in situ sea surface salinity with thermal decorrelation scale based on satellite sea surface temperature buongiorno nardelli 2012 finally our results indicate that assimilation methods could be strongly informative in the objective design of an optimal strategy for the number and deployment of bgc argo floats the number and deployment locations could be analysed through specific observing system simulation experiments ose osse like those that are routinely performed for the t and s variables of the argo network raicich 2006 in the case of the mediterranean bgc argo network the sampling and deployment strategies are defined on the basis of observational objectives see d ortenzio et al 2014 the integration through assimilation of operational biogeochemical models and bgc argo floats may open interesting perspectives on an even more efficient design of the float deployment positions and sampling strategies 5 conclusions this paper demonstrates that the assimilation of observed chlorophyll vertical profiles from autonomous profiling floats such as bgc argo floats is feasible and effective in constraining a realistic ocean model simulation we have upgraded the 3dvarbio variational scheme of the operational biogeochemical mediterranean sea cmems system and showed that the assimilation of bgc argo float data improves the description of the chlorophyll vertical structure changes in concentration and shapes of profiles during the occurrence of both surface blooms in winter and deep chlorophyll maxima in summer and has a positive impact on a non assimilated variable such as nitrate we have tested different configurations of the 3dvarbio to assess the sensitivity and effectiveness of several key elements of the assimilation i e the observational error the components of the background error covariance matrix and the assimilation frequency by using diagnostic statistics and novel metrics the observation error has been tuned on a monthly basis to incorporate the representation error providing better results than any of the fixed error experiments the estimated non uniform correlation radius length scale average of about 15 km which is of the same order as the mesoscale dynamics and the size of the bgc argo float network i e around 15 floats permits to significantly constrain up to almost 10 of the mediterranean sea surface higher radius values promote more widespread impact of the floats assimilation and better forecast skill performances but cause the onset of spurious spatial patterns and correlation daily or 3 days frequency assimilation cycles have been shown to provide enough time persistence of the increments and the best assimilation performances despite the decrease of the specific impact per assimilation cycle and the increase of computational burden finally this paper represents the first step towards a multi platform biogeochemical data assimilation method in which both remotely sensed surface chlorophyll and chlorophyll profiles are assimilated such an assimilation will point out even more challenging issues related to the hierarchy and consistency of the data used in multi platform data assimilation
