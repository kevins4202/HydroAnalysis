store and release water the catchment water storage and flow ability affect the quantity and timing of runoff soil erosion and sediment transport downstream agriculture on of the major drivers for the changes in water flow pathways which also causes a catastrophic shift of aquatic ecosystems we assessed the impact of land use changes on the water flow characteristics in the upper pangani sub catchment using the hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat land use and cover changes within the upper pangani sub catchment were analyzed between 1987 and 2017 using qgis the result shows that agriculture has expanded from 96 737 ha to 314 871 ha between 1987 and 2017 bare land and built up land have gained 14690 ha and 7083 ha respectively during this period land use changes have affected the basin s land cover forest has decreased from 196558 ha to 106839 ha between 1987 and 2017 bush land cover has lost 83445 ha during this period bushland cover fall victim to agricultural activities whereas forest is cleared for logging and fire incidences consequently surface runoff has increased from 60 84 to 73 02 20 6 increase between 1987 and 2017 sediment yield has increase from 6 9 to 12 74 ton ha 46 increase and groundwater recharge has decreased from 106 53 to 99 56 6 5 decrease it concluded that land cover transformation alters hydrology characteristics of the catchment resulting to fast surface flow high rate of soil erosion and low infiltration rate it is recommended that agro forestry should be emphasized in the catchment keywords gis swat sedimentation surface runoff hydrology model 1 introduction the increasing pressures on the land resources have dramatically affected global water cycle huntington et al 2006 human activities on land which translate into land uses have altered water flow pathways which further cause catastrophic shift of aquatic ecosystems and resources they produce gordon et al 2008 while individual land use activities do not show immediate and significant environmental effects cumulatively alter water cycle and aquatic ecosystems vegetation cover change affects the permeability of the ground surface thus interferes with the hydrologic cycle across multiple scales which eventually change natural functions of a catchment by altering quality and quantity of water most common effects include increase in over land flow short lived high peak flows following storm events huntington et al 2006 change in stream morphology hayhoe et al 2011 changes in sediments dynamics hayhoe et al 2011 and changes in water chemistry randhir et al 2009 agriculture urbanization and forestry have highest effects in both water quantity and quality eisenbies et al 2007 lalika et al 2015 agriculture stands as a major way through which human alters water quantity and quality gordon et al 2008 according to loosmore and ford 2006 extent of agricultural land in the sub catchment is the predictor of water bodies conditions it is associated with alteration of sediment loads and increase in nutrients flow to the aquatic system among the top causes of loss for aquatic biodiversity turpie et al 2005 randhir et al 2009 it also has high potential of modifying the balance between soil loss and deposition leading to excessive soil erosion or high sediment deposition rates tillage disturbs soil hence promotes erosion and alters the abundance and composition of sediment into the water bodies poulenard et al 2001 observed that erosion rate was 5 to 10 times higher and increase in runoff coefficient was 300 in cultivated plots as compared to natural vegetated land there is another view regarding deforestation and water yield the removal of forest cover from a landscape on the other hand has been associated to reduced ecosystem evapotranspiration et and increased water yield hayhoe et al 2011 the argument was also defended by a review study by pugh and gordon 2013 their synthesis concluded that when canopy density is reduced precipitation and shortwave radiation will reach the forest floor in the first few years these process changes will likely result in increased overall water yield pugh and gordon 2013 however the growth of the understory will increase water uptake and interception hence mitigating the hydrologic effects of the infestation and returning the stand close to baseline levels once the forest has fully regrown pugh and gordon 2013 land uses and cover have been constantly changing due to various drivers and reactions to changes lambin et al 2001 remarkable changes in most part of the world occurred in the last half of the 21st century lambin et al 2003 whilst developed regions experienced the greatest land use and cover changes during the 19th century tropical and developing regions have undergone rapid land conversions in the last century fisher et al 2011 asia is currently experiencing rapid land use changes whereas the amazon basin remains a major hotspot of tropical deforestation brink et al 2009 goldewijk et al 2001 in africa farmlands grazing lands human settlements and urban centers land cover are rapidly replacing natural vegetation maitima et al 2009 among others falling of agriculture production per unit land in arid areas of africa has increased demand for land to compensate for decreased yield leading to encroachment by subsistence farmers towards areas of natural vegetation boahene 1998 on the other hand large scale investments in commercial farming such as tea and coffee have become the main driver for forest clearing in areas with largely closed forests of africa fisher 2010 tanzania and kenya experience the greatest land cover transformation as compared to uganda maitima et al 2009 tanzania loses between 400 000 and 130 000 hectares of forest per year a rate twice as much as the world rate of forest loss misana 1999 between 1990 and 2010 the country lost 19 4 of its forested land barchiesi et al 2019 in kenya cultivated land has expanded by 70 between 1958 and 2001 which has resulted in the fragmentation of forests and bushland maitima et al 2009 the urban population of the country has also grown from 7 to 30 of the total population in the same period of time leading to the expansion of urban centers tiffen 2003 maitima et al 2009 uganda has demonstrated a moderate rate of land use and cover change olson et al 2004 maitima et al 2009 in the pangani basin one of the largest basins in tanzania deforestation in the basin ecosystems is linked to decreased flow from several hundred to less than 40 cubic meters per second pwbo iucn 2008 some of the significant wetlands in the basin such as kirua wetland have been shrinking due to changes in hydrology patterns linked to land use changes pwbo iucn 2008 investigation of the impact of land use and cover changes on water flow and aquatic ecosystem therefore becomes important we hypothesize that current water challenges such as floods and soil erosion are linked to land use and cover change in pangani basin we also hypothesized that soil and water assessment tool swat model is effective for simulation the association between land use and cover changes and hydrological patterns changes at the basin level swat has been extensively applied in the east africa and tanzania in particular however there is no comprehensive study that includes most hydrological parameter such as the current study most previous studies that applied swat in east africa concentrated either in analyzing the impact of land use change on sediment yield ndomba and griensven 2011 swallow et al 2009 and water flow yield mwangi et al 2016 notter et al 2012 mbungu and kashaigili 2017 the current study on the other hand has incorporated most hydrological variables in the equation and therefore represent a really situation of the catchment hydrology findings of this study therefore contribute empirical knowledge in application of swat to analyze the link between land uses and cover changes and hydrology characteristics in tanzania and east africa region 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area study area falls within upper part of the pangani river basin fig 1 the whole pangani river basin covers a total area of 43 650 km2 with the river flowing for 500 km from the source to the indian ocean 2 182 5 km2 of the total area which is 5 of the basin falls in kwale county in the republic of kenya the other 95 which is 41 467 5 km2 cover arusha kilimanjaro manyara and tanga administrative regions in the republic of tanzania 2 1 1 climate the rainfall pattern of the area is bimodal with two distinct rainy seasons the highest precipitation totals in the study area occur when the itcz is passing over the region and the flow near the surface is predominantly north easterly hemp 2018 long rains start from march to june and short rains from october to november hemp 2018 the average annual rainfall aar is 1000 mm high altitudes receive more than 2500 mm year while lower altitudes are drier receiving 650 mm year komakech et al 2011 temperature ranges between 14 c jul and aug and 35 c jan and feb the estimated mean annual humidity is 48 chiwa 2012 2 1 2 vegetation the vegetation of the basin consists of alpine desert vegetation at the top of mount kilimanjaro closed forest at the base of mount kilimanjaro and meru mountain wooded grassland in the middle of the basin and true desert vegetation at arid masai steppe and vicinity of the nyumba ya mungu dam riverine forest is important vegetation in the catchment along the rivers there is wetlands vegetation in kirua swamp pangani basin has a total of 164 731 hectares of catchment forest reserves of which kilimanjaro mountain makes large contribution urt 2003 most of the remaining forests are falling within legally protected areas these protected areas include kilimanjaro arusha manyara and mkomazi national parks and some parts of saadani and tsavo west in kenya mt meru game reserve umba game controlled area and amani nature reserve komakech et al 2012 2 1 3 soil and drainage the basin comprises complex geological formations such as north pare mountains mount kilimanjaro mount meru challa and jipe lakes the geology of mt meru and mt kilimanjaro region consists of neogene volcanic and pre cambrian metamorphic rocks covered by superficial calcareous tuffaceous materials ndomba et al 2008 the region is fertile and alkaline due to a combination of soils of lacustrine and volcanic origin the catchment is drained by two rivers kikuletwa river collects water from mt kilimanjaro and mt meru and the ruvu river originating from lake jipe ndomba et al 2008 the two rivers discharge into the nyumba ya mungu dam the outflow from the nyumba ya mungu dam forms a pangani river regarded as the main basin river flowing 432 km through kirua swamp to the indian ocean 2 1 4 population and economic activities the upper part of the pangani basin is the most populated part of the basin the projected population was 4 5 mil people in 2016 with a growth rate of 3 11 per year nbs 2018 the main socio economic activity is agriculture coffee sugar flowers fruits and vegetables are grown for export king et al 2010 rice maize beans and bananas are grown for food and local markets tadross 2010 iucn 2009 the drier part of the mountain foothills and the lower lying floodplain areas are utilized for sisal growing and livestock keeping tadross 2010 industries are growing around arusha and moshi towns important industries are sisal

thematic mapper plus etm for the year 1987 1997 2008 and 2017 were acquired for land use and cover change analysis table 1 imageries were acquired through land sat 4 5 and 8 satellites retrieved from the united states geological survey website https www usgs gov products data and tools real time data remote land sensing and landsat images selection considered cloud cover and seasonality in cases where one of the image in the same year and month was contaminated by clouds the images of the previous or preceding year was used kashaigili 2006 noe 2003 campbell et al 2005 therefore clouds free land sat images were used in assessing temporal and spatial variation of land use and land cover change in the study area 2 3 land use and cover changes detection analysis satellite images pre processing the acquired land sat images were pre processed to reduce noise and facilitate geometric compatibility with other sources of information the images were geo corrected to rectify precisely matching of images and registered to the universal transverse mercator utm coordinate system zone 37 south datum arc 1960 arc 1960 zone 37s image mosaic was conducted to merge images of the same year with the same path but different rows to create a single image that covers the entire area of interest upper pangani sub catchment image enhancement was performed using different color composite band combinations to reinforce visual interpretability to facilitate the accurate identification of temporal changes supervised image classification using maximum likelihood classifier mlc was conducted to classify the images mlc calculates the posterior probability of a pixel belonging to a corresponding class based on bayes theorem algorithms congedo 2016 it uses probability density functions to assign the pixel to the most likely highest probability value class lillesand 2015 which increases the accuracy of classification output a base map for the year 1987 was created and used for ground truthing fieldwork national forest resources monitoring and assessment of tanzania naforma field manual biophysical survey 2010 was used as the basis of land cover type nomenclature table 2 training sites were identified by inspecting an enhanced color composite imagery areas with similar spectral characteristics were trained and classified the semi automatic classification plugin available in qgis 2 12 1 was applied to classify the image into eight land classes which are forest bush land grassland water wetland cultivated land built up area and bare land the error matrices congalton 1991 were prepared and used in the computation of kappa coefficient k for the classification accuracy assessment of final image classification the probability of a classified land cover map corresponds accurately with the ground truthing data assessed by the user s accuracy jansen 2004 and the measures of the agreement of classified maps and ground truthing data assessed by kappa statistics lillesand et al 2015 kappa coefficient statistics was used to assess the accuracy of final image classification its formula is i k n i 1 r x i i i 1 r x i x i n 2 i 1 r x i x i where n is the total number of sites in the matrix r is the number of rows in the matrix χ i i is the number in row column i χ i is the total for row i and χ i is the total for column to analyze the changes between different time epochs a change detection analysis was performed post classification comparison was used to quantify the extent of land cover changes for the periods 1987 and 2017 the estimation for the rate of change for the different land covers was computed based on kashaigili and majaliwa 2010 ii c o v e r c h a n g e a r e a i y e a r x a r e a i y e a r x 1 i 1 n a r e a i y e a r x 100 iii

digital elevation model dem downloaded from nasa https reverb echo nasa gov soil data and information on related soil properties were obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao soil map fao 2005 meteorological data comprised time series rainfall data covering the period of 1974 2018 acquired from tanzania meteorological agency tma time series relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and minimum and maximum temperature data covering the period of 1974 2014 were obtained from swat global weather data https globalweather tam edu hydrological data included time series river discharge recorded from three different flow gauging stations located at two different rivers flowing to nyumba ya mungu dam namely kikuletwa at rongai north kikuletwa at rongai south and ruvu at kifaru covering period of 1971 2018 were acquired from pangani river basin office 2 4 1 model calibration and validation calibration and validation process were performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty programme swat cup calibration is simply the process of parameterizing the model to generate flow similar to the measured flow the process involves adjustment of sensitive parameters in the model until the simulated flow is similar or close to the flow measured directly in the field the process also involves several models run iterations until best values are automatically generated sensitivity analysis was also performed to scrutinize the power of various parameters on the hydrological processes of upper pangani sub catchment nevertheless calibration was restricted to streamflow while other values are all model outputs with no field measurements 2 5 ground truthing areas of arusha chini msitu wa tembo kibaoni

window period table 3 the overall accuracy for all four assessment windows 1987 1997 2007 and 2017 were acceptable and their kappa statistics had almost perfect strength of agreement rwanga ndambuki 2017 results in figures 2 3 4 and 5 show variation in land use and land cover coverage between 1987 and 2017 fig 2 supervised classification results for the upper pangani sub catchment land cover 1987 agriculture is one of the lands uses those experienced major changes fig 2 and 5 the changes have led to remarkable changes in catchment land cover on the other hand forestland covers significantly decreased during the four window period fig 2 and 5 the detailed coverage of each land use in hectares during the four window period is provided table 4 presents the coverage of each land use and land cover class between 1987 and 2017 the extent of lulcc including the area change percentage area change the annual rate of change and percentage annual rate of change for the upper pangani river sub catchment are summarized the increase and decrease amount of land cover is represented by positive and negative signs agricultural land has expanded from 96737 ha to 314871 ha equals to an increase of 218 134 ha of cultivated land in the catchment between 1987 and 2017 table 4 currently agriculture accounts for 26 7 of the total catchment area other land uses that have gain coverage from 1987 to 2017 is bare land and built up land which have gained 14 690 ha and 7 083 ha respectively during the period under study forest has decreased from 196 558 ha to 106 839 ha equal to the loss of 89 719 ha 46 of forest cover between 1987 and 2017 table 4 currently forest occupies 8 73 of the total catchment land cover from 16 06 of catchment land cover in 1987 table 4 bush land cover has lost 83 445 ha it has decreased from 606586 ha to 523142 ha between 1987 and 2017 table 4 it is followed by grassland which has decreased by 57876 ha from 256213 ha to 198337 ha during the period under review wetlands and water bodies have also lost their area estimated at around 6140 ha and 2728 ha respectively 3 2 land uses and covers transformation post classification change detection technique was carried out through cross tabulation statistical data about the spatial distribution of different land cover changes and non change areas are presented in table 5 the analysis indicates that most land converted to agriculture was derived from bush land 182 015 ha equivalent to 30 of bush land have been converted to agricultural land between 1987 and 2017 table 5 forest has contributed 22 930 ha equivalent to 11 6 to agricultural land under the same period interestingly only 5976 ha of agriculture have been changed to forest cover 26471 ha changed to bush land and 2088 ha have changed to built up land 3 3 hydrological response as results of cover changes in nmd catchment 3 3 1 sensitive parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand to examine the influence of different parameter to flow prediction in the model it was found that runoff soil conservation service runoff curve number cn2 was the most sensitive parameter followed by available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqwn groundwater delay time gw delay soil evaporation compensation factor esco surface runoff lag time and baseflow alpha factor alpha bf these results are in agreement with the studies reported by mbungu 2007 and chilagane 2021 that mentioned parameters are most sensitive to flow prediction the most sensitive parameters were then considered for model calibration table 6 3 4 calibration and validation of stream flow model calibration process was done by comparing the simulated stream flows with the measured stream flows for three gauging stations namely kikuletwa rongoi north kikuletwa rongoi south and ruvu table 7 indicates statistics for simulated and measured during calibration and validation period for the three streams the statistics for kikuletwa rongoi south kikuletwa rongoi north and ruvu stream table 7 the observed mean monthly stream flow for the calibration period 1998 2005 at kikuletwa station and rongoi south channel was 31 31 m3 s while the simulated flow was 27 01 m3 s appendix 1 table 7 the divergence was not significant for the period of validation 2006 2010 which has indicated observed mean monthly flow values of 31 31 m3 s and simulated mean monthly flow of 28 19 m3 s appendix 4 table 7 the stream flows at the kikuletwa station 48 rongoi north channel were also not significantly different between observed 5 08 m3 s and simulated 4 85 m3 s during the calibration period as indicated by r2 0 85 and an nse value 0 80 value which were above average recommended values appendix 3 table 7 these values observed stream flow of 5 08 m3 s and simulated stream flow of 4 92 m3 s did not significantly differ during the verification phase as signified by a high r2 value estimated to 0 91 and an nse value of 0 87 appendix 6 table 7 nevertheless the model seems to have overestimated the stream flow for ruvu river this is indicated by the finding that although above average the small values of r2 0 58 for both calibration and validation period and nse 0 55 for calibration period and 0 52 for validation period appendix 2 and 5 table 7 average simulated stream flow values for ruvu river were relatively higher 20 61 m3 s for calibration and 21 41 m3 s for validation period than observed values 17 92 m3 s for both calibration and validation period both observed and simulated stream flows at kikuletwa were lower than that reported by iucn in 2009 which was 43 37 m3 s the model was able to simulate flows for kikuletwa streams but somehow overestimated the stream flow for ruvu this may be due to errors inherited in inputs data such as soil digital maps and land use maps which came from various sources 3 5 water balance and sediments results indicates that overall surface runoff has increased from 60 84 to 73 02 20 6 increase between 1987 and 2017 sediment yield on the other hand has increase from 6 9 to 12 74 ton ha 85 increase during this period groundwater recharge on other hand has decreased from 106 53 to 99 56 7 decrease table 8 agriculture is a higher contributor to surface runoff followed by bare land and bush land fig 6 agriculture also has a high contribution of sediment generation followed by bare land and bush land whereas forest contributes no sediment fig 6 bare land indicated a higher contribution to ground water recharge followed by forest and bush land 4 discussions 4 1 land use and land cover classification accuracy the overall accuracy values for current land use and cover classification indicates that classification was correctly done and data can be utilized for decision making high resolution landsat imageries from more advanced satellites landsat 5 tm bumper and land sat 8 oli tirs contributed high accuracy value in the 2008 and 2017 classification window it indicates that selected pixels during defining of training sites were the true representatives of the land cover class on the ground achieved due to good quality of imageries used land sat images nevertheless some errors might have been committed during classification of cultivated land class abdu 2019 wetland and built up areas on the other hand had broad producers accuracy indicating that the land classes were classified to other land classes for 1987 and 1997 windows of assessment which could be due to relatively lower quality of land sat images used for that particular period of time ge et al 2007 4 2 land use and cover changes in the upper pangani sub catchment land use and cover in the upper part of the pangani basin have significantly changed within the past thirty years cultivated land cover has tripled while the forest cover has decreased by half of its original area between 1987 and 2017 forest cover of mount kilimanjaro and mount meru retreats from the base to the mountain s peaks overtime forest along the rivers and floodplains in the basin has disappeared fig 5 the forests on the pare and usambara mountains between the nyumba ya mungu dam and lake jipe have also disappeared fig 5 towns of arusha and moshi which were not only small but also forested in 1987 fig 2 have expanded and bare in 2017 fig 5 nevertheless cultivated land has replaced forests and bush land on the slopes of the mountains and riverine basing on these findings bush land cover is more prone to conversion into agricultural land forest is not directly converted to agricultural land use table 5 it is initially converted to bush land through other drivers other than agriculture it seems that farmers cultivating small portions within the forest before they clear it completely forest loss on kilimanjaro mountain has been reported by other authors hemp 2018 noe 2003 kalacska et al 2017 iucn 2003 chiwa 2012 chiesa project 2015 hemp 2005 reported that more than half of forest cover on mount kilimanjaro has disappeared in the past 70 years in his study the forest cover of the mount kilimanjaro decreased from 145 500 ha to 126 300 ha between 1976 and 2000 hemp 2005 further added that since 1976 there have been manifold conversions of the vegetation around mount kilimanjaro which lead to disappearance of about 10 of montane forest and about 80 of subalpine cloudy forest from 2001 areas under forest and bush land showed declining trend and scattered trees while the area under cultivation was increasing campbell et al 2005 also found that agricultural land was increasing from 7456 64 ha in 1973 to 29 677 22 ha in year 2000 while the forest was decreasing from 646 34 ha in 1973 to 416 69 ha in 2000 in kajiado district western kilimanjaro kenyan side similar results were also reported by misana et al 2012 they argued that major changes observed in their study area were the expansion of cultivation down the slopes of mount kilimanjaro where cultivated land replaced natural vegetation 4 3 transformation of natural land covers to cultivated land cover transformation of land cover towards cultivated land has been also reported by chiwa 2012 hemp 2018 iucn 2003 kalacska et al 2017 misana et al 2012 noe 2003 chiesa project 2015 chuwa 2013 reported rapid agriculture intensification in the catchment misana et al 2012 also reported similar results they observed expansion of land under cultivation down the slopes of mount kilimanjaro where cultivated land replaced natural vegetation chiesa project 2015 reported that between 1987 and 2010 there was an increase in cultivation with scattered settlements and a decrease of vegetation such as forest grasslands bush land and riverine forest along kikuletwa and ruvu river 4 4 soil and water response to land use cover changes in the catchment hydrology of the catchment has changes along with the changing land uses cover land uses cover determines the ability of the catchment to collect store and release water the catchment water storage and flow ability affect quantity and timing of runoff soil erosion and sediment transport downstream miller and zégre 2014 finding from similar studies reported that agriculture and urbanization leads to increased surface runoffs less percolation and evapotranspiration and sedimentation dos santos et al 2018 chaves et al 2008 gordon et al 2008 miller and zégre 2014 gyamfi et al 2016 also reported similar results changes in land uses were related to different hydrological responses their results reveal that from 2000 to 2013 a 31 6 decrease in rangeland with concomitant increases in agriculture lands 20 1 urban areas 10 5 and forest 0 7 led to a 46 97 increase in surface runoff generation increase in surface runoff during the period understudy is due to decrease in forest cover and increase land under cultivation due to their leafy canopy forests filter and regulate the flow of water makuch 2008 the leafy canopy intercepts rainfall slowing its fall to the ground and the forest floor acts as sponge absorbing rainwater and gradually releasing it to natural channels and recharging ground water makuch 2008 in undisturbed soils forests are highly permeable and have high infiltrability leading to predominantly vertical flow paths on the other hand deforestation alters the hydrological budgets of catchment chaves et al 2008 the results are supported by guzha et al 2018 who after examining 37 studies on effect of land use on hydrology reported that forest cover loss leads to increases in surface runoff 4 90 results from case studies with forest cover increase scenarios show that surface runoff decreased with forest cover gain they added that field experiments also show higher discharge in cultivated catchments in comparison to forest catchments they also observed surface runoff increase with forest cover loss in field experimentation with significantly higher runoff in cultivated plots than in forest plots gyamfi et al 2016 reported similar results a multi regression analysis indicated that land use changes were highly associated to various hydrological reactions their results showed that a decrease of more than 30 of rangeland concurrently with increase of 20 of agricultural and 10 5 urban land between 2000 and 2013 led increase by more than 45 surface runoff basing on the results above hydrology of the catchment has changed alongside the changing land uses and cover land uses and cover determine the ability of the catchment to collect store and release water the catchment water storage and flow ability affect the amount and timing of surface runoff rate of soil attrition and transportation biology and physico chemical characteristics of water downstream miller and zégre 2014 therefore land uses that influences soil and vegetation have high possibilities to influence great variation to both the quantity and characteristics of water flowing into streams in watersheds chaves et al 2008 the increase in soil erosion in the study area between 1987 and 2017 could have been due to increase in land under agriculture and increased surface runoff larger proportion of rainfall was diverted into rapid flow pathways to streams within agricultural land when agriculture is established on a cleared land soil abrasion increases because tillage usually disturbs the soil making it prone to erosion the possibility of delivering water with higher amount solute concentrations increases due to higher rates of soil erosion and lower retention time to allow filtering of some matters carried by water chaves et al 2008 surface water is the primary mechanism for transporting sediments from land into watercourses and surface water bodies as indicated in fig 6 cultivated land cover alters hydrology flow whereas forest cover plays a most important function in stabilizing the hydrology flow in the catchment trees and forest play a greater role in reducing storm water and filtering pollutants that would end up in water bodies due to their leafy canopy forests have high ability to regulate flow and filter water gagnon 2008 the leafy canopy interrupts rainfall drops hence reducing their impact as they fall on the ground leaves fall on the floor of the forest floor acts as sponge that absorbs rainwater hence facilitates ground water recharging gagnon 2008 increased surface runoff causes floods and deposition of logs in the kikuletwa river channels high surface runoff has increased land erosion and deposition of logs in the river channels siltation and logs from upstream of kikuletwa have led to river channel incision leading to floods floods have led to the loss of farmlands and settlements at kahe somanga rongai msitu wa tembo and arusha chini areas fig 7 and 8 the increase in soil erosion in our study area between 1987 and 2017 may be due to deforestation and surface runoff more rainfall is diverted into fast flow paths with high potential of soil erosion this is common on cleared land such as agriculture land tillage on the other hand disturbs the soil hence makes it prone to erosion the potential of delivering water with higher solute concentrations due to erosion also increases chaves et al 2008 surface water and surface runoff is the primary mechanism for transporting sediment from land into watercourses and surface water bodies evapotranspiration did not significantly change in our study area which is contrary to the existing theory that evapotranspiration decreases with decrease in forest cover our findings regarding evapotranspiration differ to that of foley et al 2007 who linked the decrease in evapotranspiration forest clearing in the tropical forest evapotranspiration is the amount of water transpired to the atmosphere through evaporation of plants and carbon fixing trabucco et al 2008 it is dependent on vegetation characteristics quantity of water available in the soil and soil hydrological properties soil water retention curves stability of evapotranspiration in our study area may be due to replacement of trees with crops thus the soil is not left bare land use changes affect evapotranspiration or vapor flows 5 conclusion and recommendations the study concludes that hydrology characteristics of the basin are highly influenced by the use and cover changes in the sub basin the hydrology pattern change contributes to floods and high turbidity water often observed in the basin therefore continuing land use and cover change in the basin may further affect hydrology patterns of the pangani basin it recommended that agro forestry should be emphasized restoration activities guided by the extension officers should be introduced to help farmer s plant trees on their farmlands this approach will benefit the basin ecohydrology and increase soil fertility swat model has managed to reveal the link between land uses and cover change and hydrology characteristics at the sub basin level however simulation involving large area is challenged with the quality of land sat images we recommend simulation using a small area using more recent land sat images 6 financial disclosure the financial support for this work came from the german academic exchange program daad declaration of competing

bushes and epiphytes orchids ferns moss lichen and liverworts cover montane forests riverine forested area adjacent flowing bodies of water such as river streams and dams plantation type of managed forest in which the trees are planted as opposed to naturally regenerated of the same age and generally of the same species and are intended to maximize the production of wood fiber woodland closed area of land covered low density trees forming open habitat with plenty of sunlight and limited shade wooded rock area of land covered with low density trees in a visible exposed mineral rock with scattered cultivation area of land covered with low density and scattered trees with crop cultivation activities bush land thicket a thicket is a very dense stand of trees or tall shrubs often dominated by only one or a few species to the exclusion of all others bushland uncultivated land area dominated with bushes and shrubs or other natural vegetation grassland land area dominated by

store and release water the catchment water storage and flow ability affect the quantity and timing of runoff soil erosion and sediment transport downstream agriculture on of the major drivers for the changes in water flow pathways which also causes a catastrophic shift of aquatic ecosystems we assessed the impact of land use changes on the water flow characteristics in the upper pangani sub catchment using the hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat land use and cover changes within the upper pangani sub catchment were analyzed between 1987 and 2017 using qgis the result shows that agriculture has expanded from 96 737 ha to 314 871 ha between 1987 and 2017 bare land and built up land have gained 14690 ha and 7083 ha respectively during this period land use changes have affected the basin s land cover forest has decreased from 196558 ha to 106839 ha between 1987 and 2017 bush land cover has lost 83445 ha during this period bushland cover fall victim to agricultural activities whereas forest is cleared for logging and fire incidences consequently surface runoff has increased from 60 84 to 73 02 20 6 increase between 1987 and 2017 sediment yield has increase from 6 9 to 12 74 ton ha 46 increase and groundwater recharge has decreased from 106 53 to 99 56 6 5 decrease it concluded that land cover transformation alters hydrology characteristics of the catchment resulting to fast surface flow high rate of soil erosion and low infiltration rate it is recommended that agro forestry should be emphasized in the catchment keywords gis swat sedimentation surface runoff hydrology model 1 introduction the increasing pressures on the land resources have dramatically affected global water cycle huntington et al 2006 human activities on land which translate into land uses have altered water flow pathways which further cause catastrophic shift of aquatic ecosystems and resources they produce gordon et al 2008 while individual land use activities do not show immediate and significant environmental effects cumulatively alter water cycle and aquatic ecosystems vegetation cover change affects the permeability of the ground surface thus interferes with the hydrologic cycle across multiple scales which eventually change natural functions of a catchment by altering quality and quantity of water most common effects include increase in over land flow short lived high peak flows following storm events huntington et al 2006 change in stream morphology hayhoe et al 2011 changes in sediments dynamics hayhoe et al 2011 and changes in water chemistry randhir et al 2009 agriculture urbanization and forestry have highest effects in both water quantity and quality eisenbies et al 2007 lalika et al 2015 agriculture stands as a major way through which human alters water quantity and quality gordon et al 2008 according to loosmore and ford 2006 extent of agricultural land in the sub catchment is the predictor of water bodies conditions it is associated with alteration of sediment loads and increase in nutrients flow to the aquatic system among the top causes of loss for aquatic biodiversity turpie et al 2005 randhir et al 2009 it also has high potential of modifying the balance between soil loss and deposition leading to excessive soil erosion or high sediment deposition rates tillage disturbs soil hence promotes erosion and alters the abundance and composition of sediment into the water bodies poulenard et al 2001 observed that erosion rate was 5 to 10 times higher and increase in runoff coefficient was 300 in cultivated plots as compared to natural vegetated land there is another view regarding deforestation and water yield the removal of forest cover from a landscape on the other hand has been associated to reduced ecosystem evapotranspiration et and increased water yield hayhoe et al 2011 the argument was also defended by a review study by pugh and gordon 2013 their synthesis concluded that when canopy density is reduced precipitation and shortwave radiation will reach the forest floor in the first few years these process changes will likely result in increased overall water yield pugh and gordon 2013 however the growth of the understory will increase water uptake and interception hence mitigating the hydrologic effects of the infestation and returning the stand close to baseline levels once the forest has fully regrown pugh and gordon 2013 land uses and cover have been constantly changing due to various drivers and reactions to changes lambin et al 2001 remarkable changes in most part of the world occurred in the last half of the 21st century lambin et al 2003 whilst developed regions experienced the greatest land use and cover changes during the 19th century tropical and developing regions have undergone rapid land conversions in the last century fisher et al 2011 asia is currently experiencing rapid land use changes whereas the amazon basin remains a major hotspot of tropical deforestation brink et al 2009 goldewijk et al 2001 in africa farmlands grazing lands human settlements and urban centers land cover are rapidly replacing natural vegetation maitima et al 2009 among others falling of agriculture production per unit land in arid areas of africa has increased demand for land to compensate for decreased yield leading to encroachment by subsistence farmers towards areas of natural vegetation boahene 1998 on the other hand large scale investments in commercial farming such as tea and coffee have become the main driver for forest clearing in areas with largely closed forests of africa fisher 2010 tanzania and kenya experience the greatest land cover transformation as compared to uganda maitima et al 2009 tanzania loses between 400 000 and 130 000 hectares of forest per year a rate twice as much as the world rate of forest loss misana 1999 between 1990 and 2010 the country lost 19 4 of its forested land barchiesi et al 2019 in kenya cultivated land has expanded by 70 between 1958 and 2001 which has resulted in the fragmentation of forests and bushland maitima et al 2009 the urban population of the country has also grown from 7 to 30 of the total population in the same period of time leading to the expansion of urban centers tiffen 2003 maitima et al 2009 uganda has demonstrated a moderate rate of land use and cover change olson et al 2004 maitima et al 2009 in the pangani basin one of the largest basins in tanzania deforestation in the basin ecosystems is linked to decreased flow from several hundred to less than 40 cubic meters per second pwbo iucn 2008 some of the significant wetlands in the basin such as kirua wetland have been shrinking due to changes in hydrology patterns linked to land use changes pwbo iucn 2008 investigation of the impact of land use and cover changes on water flow and aquatic ecosystem therefore becomes important we hypothesize that current water challenges such as floods and soil erosion are linked to land use and cover change in pangani basin we also hypothesized that soil and water assessment tool swat model is effective for simulation the association between land use and cover changes and hydrological patterns changes at the basin level swat has been extensively applied in the east africa and tanzania in particular however there is no comprehensive study that includes most hydrological parameter such as the current study most previous studies that applied swat in east africa concentrated either in analyzing the impact of land use change on sediment yield ndomba and griensven 2011 swallow et al 2009 and water flow yield mwangi et al 2016 notter et al 2012 mbungu and kashaigili 2017 the current study on the other hand has incorporated most hydrological variables in the equation and therefore represent a really situation of the catchment hydrology findings of this study therefore contribute empirical knowledge in application of swat to analyze the link between land uses and cover changes and hydrology characteristics in tanzania and east africa region 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area study area falls within upper part of the pangani river basin fig 1 the whole pangani river basin covers a total area of 43 650 km2 with the river flowing for 500 km from the source to the indian ocean 2 182 5 km2 of the total area which is 5 of the basin falls in kwale county in the republic of kenya the other 95 which is 41 467 5 km2 cover arusha kilimanjaro manyara and tanga administrative regions in the republic of tanzania 2 1 1 climate the rainfall pattern of the area is bimodal with two distinct rainy seasons the highest precipitation totals in the study area occur when the itcz is passing over the region and the flow near the surface is predominantly north easterly hemp 2018 long rains start from march to june and short rains from october to november hemp 2018 the average annual rainfall aar is 1000 mm high altitudes receive more than 2500 mm year while lower altitudes are drier receiving 650 mm year komakech et al 2011 temperature ranges between 14 c jul and aug and 35 c jan and feb the estimated mean annual humidity is 48 chiwa 2012 2 1 2 vegetation the vegetation of the basin consists of alpine desert vegetation at the top of mount kilimanjaro closed forest at the base of mount kilimanjaro and meru mountain wooded grassland in the middle of the basin and true desert vegetation at arid masai steppe and vicinity of the nyumba ya mungu dam riverine forest is important vegetation in the catchment along the rivers there is wetlands vegetation in kirua swamp pangani basin has a total of 164 731 hectares of catchment forest reserves of which kilimanjaro mountain makes large contribution urt 2003 most of the remaining forests are falling within legally protected areas these protected areas include kilimanjaro arusha manyara and mkomazi national parks and some parts of saadani and tsavo west in kenya mt meru game reserve umba game controlled area and amani nature reserve komakech et al 2012 2 1 3 soil and drainage the basin comprises complex geological formations such as north pare mountains mount kilimanjaro mount meru challa and jipe lakes the geology of mt meru and mt kilimanjaro region consists of neogene volcanic and pre cambrian metamorphic rocks covered by superficial calcareous tuffaceous materials ndomba et al 2008 the region is fertile and alkaline due to a combination of soils of lacustrine and volcanic origin the catchment is drained by two rivers kikuletwa river collects water from mt kilimanjaro and mt meru and the ruvu river originating from lake jipe ndomba et al 2008 the two rivers discharge into the nyumba ya mungu dam the outflow from the nyumba ya mungu dam forms a pangani river regarded as the main basin river flowing 432 km through kirua swamp to the indian ocean 2 1 4 population and economic activities the upper part of the pangani basin is the most populated part of the basin the projected population was 4 5 mil people in 2016 with a growth rate of 3 11 per year nbs 2018 the main socio economic activity is agriculture coffee sugar flowers fruits and vegetables are grown for export king et al 2010 rice maize beans and bananas are grown for food and local markets tadross 2010 iucn 2009 the drier part of the mountain foothills and the lower lying floodplain areas are utilized for sisal growing and livestock keeping tadross 2010 industries are growing around arusha and moshi towns important industries are sisal

thematic mapper plus etm for the year 1987 1997 2008 and 2017 were acquired for land use and cover change analysis table 1 imageries were acquired through land sat 4 5 and 8 satellites retrieved from the united states geological survey website https www usgs gov products data and tools real time data remote land sensing and landsat images selection considered cloud cover and seasonality in cases where one of the image in the same year and month was contaminated by clouds the images of the previous or preceding year was used kashaigili 2006 noe 2003 campbell et al 2005 therefore clouds free land sat images were used in assessing temporal and spatial variation of land use and land cover change in the study area 2 3 land use and cover changes detection analysis satellite images pre processing the acquired land sat images were pre processed to reduce noise and facilitate geometric compatibility with other sources of information the images were geo corrected to rectify precisely matching of images and registered to the universal transverse mercator utm coordinate system zone 37 south datum arc 1960 arc 1960 zone 37s image mosaic was conducted to merge images of the same year with the same path but different rows to create a single image that covers the entire area of interest upper pangani sub catchment image enhancement was performed using different color composite band combinations to reinforce visual interpretability to facilitate the accurate identification of temporal changes supervised image classification using maximum likelihood classifier mlc was conducted to classify the images mlc calculates the posterior probability of a pixel belonging to a corresponding class based on bayes theorem algorithms congedo 2016 it uses probability density functions to assign the pixel to the most likely highest probability value class lillesand 2015 which increases the accuracy of classification output a base map for the year 1987 was created and used for ground truthing fieldwork national forest resources monitoring and assessment of tanzania naforma field manual biophysical survey 2010 was used as the basis of land cover type nomenclature table 2 training sites were identified by inspecting an enhanced color composite imagery areas with similar spectral characteristics were trained and classified the semi automatic classification plugin available in qgis 2 12 1 was applied to classify the image into eight land classes which are forest bush land grassland water wetland cultivated land built up area and bare land the error matrices congalton 1991 were prepared and used in the computation of kappa coefficient k for the classification accuracy assessment of final image classification the probability of a classified land cover map corresponds accurately with the ground truthing data assessed by the user s accuracy jansen 2004 and the measures of the agreement of classified maps and ground truthing data assessed by kappa statistics lillesand et al 2015 kappa coefficient statistics was used to assess the accuracy of final image classification its formula is i k n i 1 r x i i i 1 r x i x i n 2 i 1 r x i x i where n is the total number of sites in the matrix r is the number of rows in the matrix χ i i is the number in row column i χ i is the total for row i and χ i is the total for column to analyze the changes between different time epochs a change detection analysis was performed post classification comparison was used to quantify the extent of land cover changes for the periods 1987 and 2017 the estimation for

used soil and water assessment tool swat model to analyses the impacts of land use land cover lulc changes on the hydrological characteristics of the upper pangani river sub catchment the model was set and run using spatial data hydrological data and meteorological data spatial data were digital lulc map of the study area for 1987 1997 2007 and 2017 obtained from 2 3 above and a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem downloaded from nasa https reverb echo nasa gov soil data and information on related soil properties were obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao soil map fao 2005 meteorological data comprised time series rainfall data covering the period of 1974 2018 acquired from tanzania meteorological agency tma time series relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and minimum and maximum temperature data covering the period of 1974 2014 were obtained from swat global weather data https globalweather tam edu hydrological data included time series river discharge recorded from three different flow gauging stations located at two different rivers flowing to nyumba ya mungu dam namely kikuletwa at rongai north kikuletwa at rongai south and ruvu at kifaru covering period of 1971 2018 were acquired from pangani river basin office 2 4 1 model calibration and validation calibration and validation process were performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty programme swat cup calibration is simply the process of parameterizing the model to generate flow similar to the measured flow the process involves adjustment of sensitive parameters in the model until the simulated flow is similar or close to the flow measured directly in the field the process also involves several models run iterations until best values are automatically generated sensitivity analysis was also performed to scrutinize the power of various parameters on the hydrological processes of upper pangani sub catchment nevertheless calibration was restricted to streamflow while other values are all model outputs with no field measurements 2 5 ground truthing areas of arusha chini msitu wa tembo kibaoni samanga tpc weruweru marangu himo and tengeru nyumba ya mungu dam were visited forground truthing of land use and cover 3 results 3 1 land use and land cover classification the classified land use and cover maps showed good results indicated by overall classification accuracies of 92 58 90 72 95 and 95 96 for the years 1987 1997 2008 and 2017 supported by their corresponding kappa statistics of 0 91 0 88 0 94 and 0 95 respectively details for each accuracy class for the years 1987 1997 2007 and 2017 images are provided in table 3 cultivated land showed lower user accuracy 28 53 38 63 and 27 76 corresponding to 1987 1997 and 2017 table 3 wetland also showed low accuracy values for both producers accuracy 33 07 and user s accuracy 46 77 for year 1997 and producers accuracy 10 03 for 2007 window period table 3 the overall accuracy for all four assessment windows 1987 1997 2007 and 2017 were acceptable and their kappa statistics had almost perfect strength of agreement rwanga ndambuki 2017 results in figures 2 3 4 and 5 show variation in land use and land cover coverage between 1987 and 2017 fig 2 supervised classification results for the upper pangani sub catchment land cover 1987 agriculture is one of the lands uses those experienced major changes fig 2 and 5 the changes have led to remarkable changes in catchment land cover on the other hand forestland covers significantly decreased during the four window period fig 2 and 5 the detailed coverage of each land use in hectares during the four window period is provided table 4 presents the coverage of each land use and land cover class between 1987 and 2017 the extent of lulcc including the area change percentage area change the annual rate of change and percentage annual rate of change for the upper pangani river sub catchment are summarized the increase and decrease amount of land cover is represented by positive and negative signs agricultural land has expanded from 96737 ha to 314871 ha equals to an increase of 218 134 ha of cultivated land in the catchment between 1987 and 2017 table 4 currently agriculture accounts for 26 7 of the total catchment area other land uses that have gain coverage from 1987 to 2017 is bare land and built up land which have gained 14 690 ha and 7 083 ha respectively during the period under study forest has decreased from 196 558 ha to 106 839 ha equal to the loss of 89 719 ha 46 of forest cover between 1987 and 2017 table 4 currently forest occupies 8 73 of the total catchment land cover from 16 06 of catchment land cover in 1987 table 4 bush land cover has lost 83 445 ha it has decreased from 606586 ha to 523142 ha between 1987 and 2017 table 4 it is followed by grassland which has decreased by 57876 ha from 256213 ha to 198337 ha during the period under review wetlands and water bodies have also lost their area estimated at around 6140 ha and 2728 ha respectively 3 2 land uses and covers transformation post classification change detection technique was carried out through cross tabulation statistical data about the spatial distribution of different land cover changes and non change areas are presented in table 5 the analysis indicates that most land converted to agriculture was derived from bush land 182 015 ha equivalent to 30 of bush land have been converted to agricultural land between 1987 and 2017 table 5 forest has contributed 22 930 ha equivalent to 11 6 to agricultural land under the same period interestingly only 5976 ha of agriculture have been changed to forest cover 26471 ha changed to bush land and 2088 ha have changed to built up land 3 3 hydrological response as results of cover changes in nmd catchment 3 3 1 sensitive parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand to examine the influence of different parameter to flow prediction in the model it was found that runoff soil conservation service runoff curve number cn2 was the most sensitive parameter followed by available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqwn groundwater delay time gw delay soil evaporation compensation factor esco surface runoff lag time and baseflow alpha factor alpha bf these results are in agreement with the studies reported by mbungu 2007 and chilagane 2021 that mentioned parameters are most sensitive to flow prediction the most sensitive parameters were then considered for model calibration table 6 3 4 calibration and validation of stream flow model calibration process was done by comparing the simulated stream flows with the measured stream flows for three gauging stations namely kikuletwa rongoi north kikuletwa rongoi south and ruvu table 7 indicates statistics for simulated and measured during calibration and validation period for the three streams the statistics for kikuletwa rongoi south kikuletwa rongoi north and ruvu stream table 7 the observed mean monthly stream flow for the calibration period 1998 2005 at kikuletwa station and rongoi south channel was 31 31 m3 s while the simulated flow was 27 01 m3 s appendix 1 table 7 the divergence was not significant for the period of validation 2006 2010 which has indicated observed mean monthly flow values of 31 31 m3 s and simulated mean monthly flow of 28 19 m3 s appendix 4 table 7 the stream flows at the kikuletwa station 48 rongoi north channel were also not significantly different between observed 5 08 m3 s and simulated 4 85 m3 s during the calibration period as indicated by r2 0 85 and an nse value 0 80 value which were above average recommended values appendix 3 table 7 these values observed stream flow of 5 08 m3 s and simulated stream flow of 4 92 m3 s did not significantly differ during the verification phase as signified by a high r2 value estimated to 0 91 and an nse value of 0 87 appendix 6 table 7 nevertheless the model seems to have overestimated the stream flow for ruvu river this is indicated by the finding that although above average the small values of r2 0 58 for both calibration and validation period and nse 0 55 for calibration period and 0 52 for validation period appendix 2 and 5 table 7 average simulated stream flow values for ruvu river were relatively higher 20 61 m3 s for calibration and 21 41 m3 s for validation period than observed values 17 92 m3 s for both calibration and validation period both observed and simulated stream flows at kikuletwa were lower than that reported by iucn in 2009 which was 43 37 m3 s the model was able to simulate flows for kikuletwa streams but somehow overestimated the stream flow for ruvu this may be due to errors inherited in inputs data such as soil digital maps and land use maps which came from various sources 3 5 water balance and sediments results indicates that overall surface runoff has increased from 60 84 to 73 02 20 6 increase between 1987 and 2017 sediment yield on the other hand has increase from 6 9 to 12 74 ton ha 85 increase during this period groundwater recharge on other hand has decreased from 106 53 to 99 56 7 decrease table 8 agriculture is a higher contributor to surface runoff followed by bare land and bush land fig 6 agriculture also has a high contribution of sediment generation followed by bare land and bush land whereas forest contributes no sediment fig 6 bare land indicated a higher contribution to ground water recharge followed by forest and bush land 4 discussions 4 1 land use and land cover classification accuracy the overall accuracy values for current land use and cover classification indicates that classification was correctly done and data can be utilized for decision making high resolution landsat imageries from more advanced satellites landsat 5 tm bumper and land sat 8 oli tirs contributed high accuracy value in the 2008 and 2017 classification window it indicates that selected pixels during defining of training sites were the true representatives of the land cover class on the ground achieved due to good quality of imageries used land sat images nevertheless some errors might have been committed during classification of cultivated land class abdu 2019 wetland and built up areas on the other hand had broad producers accuracy indicating that the land classes were classified to other land classes for 1987 and 1997 windows of assessment which could be due to relatively lower quality of land sat images used for that particular period of time ge et al 2007 4 2 land use and cover changes in the upper pangani sub catchment land use and cover in the upper part of the pangani basin have significantly changed within the past thirty years cultivated land cover has tripled while the forest cover has decreased by half of its original area between 1987 and 2017 forest cover of mount kilimanjaro and mount meru retreats from the base to the mountain s peaks overtime forest along the rivers and floodplains in the basin has disappeared fig 5 the forests on the pare and usambara mountains between the nyumba ya mungu dam and lake jipe have also disappeared fig 5 towns of arusha and moshi which were not only small but also forested in 1987 fig 2 have expanded and bare in 2017 fig 5 nevertheless cultivated land has replaced forests and bush land on the slopes of the mountains and riverine basing on these findings bush land cover is more prone to conversion into agricultural land forest is not directly converted to agricultural land use table 5 it is initially converted to bush land through other drivers other than agriculture it seems that farmers cultivating small portions within the forest before they clear it completely forest loss on kilimanjaro mountain has been reported by other authors hemp 2018 noe 2003 kalacska et al 2017 iucn 2003 chiwa 2012 chiesa project 2015 hemp 2005 reported that more than half of forest cover on mount kilimanjaro has disappeared in the past 70 years in his study the forest cover of the mount kilimanjaro decreased from 145 500 ha to 126 300 ha between 1976 and 2000 hemp 2005 further added that since 1976 there have been manifold conversions of the vegetation around mount kilimanjaro which lead to disappearance of about 10 of montane forest and about 80 of subalpine cloudy forest from 2001 areas under forest and bush land showed declining trend and scattered trees while the area under cultivation was increasing campbell et al 2005 also found that agricultural land was increasing from 7456 64 ha in 1973 to 29 677 22 ha in year 2000 while the forest was decreasing from 646 34 ha in 1973 to 416 69 ha in 2000 in kajiado district western kilimanjaro kenyan side similar results were also reported by misana et al 2012 they argued that major changes observed in their study area were the expansion of cultivation down the slopes of mount kilimanjaro where cultivated land replaced natural vegetation 4 3 transformation of natural land covers to cultivated land cover transformation of land cover towards cultivated land has been also reported by chiwa 2012 hemp 2018 iucn 2003 kalacska et al 2017 misana et al 2012 noe 2003 chiesa project 2015 chuwa 2013 reported rapid agriculture intensification in the catchment misana et al 2012 also reported similar results they observed expansion of land under cultivation down the slopes of mount kilimanjaro where cultivated land replaced natural vegetation chiesa project 2015 reported that between 1987 and 2010 there was an increase in cultivation with scattered settlements and a decrease of vegetation such as forest grasslands bush land and riverine forest along kikuletwa and ruvu river 4 4 soil and water response to land use cover changes in the catchment hydrology of the catchment has changes along with the changing land uses cover land uses cover determines the ability of the catchment to collect store and release water the catchment water storage and flow ability affect quantity and timing of runoff soil erosion and sediment transport downstream miller and zégre 2014 finding from similar studies reported that agriculture and urbanization leads to increased surface runoffs less percolation and evapotranspiration and sedimentation dos santos et al 2018 chaves et al 2008 gordon et al 2008 miller and zégre 2014 gyamfi et al 2016 also reported similar results changes in land uses were related to different hydrological responses their results reveal that from 2000 to 2013 a 31 6 decrease in rangeland with concomitant increases in agriculture lands 20 1 urban areas 10 5 and forest 0 7 led to a 46 97 increase in surface runoff generation increase in surface runoff during the period understudy is due to decrease in forest cover and increase land under cultivation due to their leafy canopy forests filter and regulate the flow of water makuch 2008 the leafy canopy intercepts rainfall slowing its fall to the ground and the forest floor acts as sponge absorbing rainwater and gradually releasing it to natural channels and recharging ground water makuch 2008 in undisturbed soils forests are highly permeable and have high infiltrability leading to predominantly vertical flow paths on the other hand deforestation alters the hydrological budgets of catchment chaves et al 2008 the results are supported by guzha et al 2018 who after examining 37 studies on effect of land use on hydrology reported that forest cover loss leads to increases in surface runoff 4 90 results from case studies with forest cover increase scenarios show that surface runoff decreased with forest cover gain they added that field experiments also show higher discharge in cultivated catchments in comparison to forest catchments they also observed surface runoff increase with forest cover loss in field experimentation with significantly higher runoff in cultivated plots than in forest plots gyamfi et al 2016 reported similar results a multi regression analysis indicated that land use changes were highly associated to various hydrological reactions their results showed that a decrease of more than 30 of rangeland concurrently with increase of 20 of agricultural and 10 5 urban land between 2000 and 2013 led increase by more than 45 surface runoff basing on the results above hydrology of the catchment has changed alongside the changing land uses and cover land uses and cover determine the ability of the catchment to collect store and release water the catchment water storage and flow ability affect the amount and timing of surface runoff rate of soil attrition and transportation biology and physico chemical characteristics of water downstream miller and zégre 2014 therefore land uses that influences soil and vegetation have high possibilities to influence great variation to both the quantity and characteristics of water flowing into streams in watersheds chaves et al 2008 the increase in soil erosion in the study area between 1987 and 2017 could have been due to increase in land under agriculture and increased surface runoff larger proportion of rainfall was diverted into rapid flow pathways to streams within agricultural land when agriculture is established on a cleared land soil abrasion increases because tillage usually disturbs the soil making it prone to erosion the possibility of delivering water with higher amount solute concentrations increases due to higher rates of soil erosion and lower retention time to allow filtering of some matters carried by water chaves et al 2008 surface water is the primary mechanism for transporting sediments from land into watercourses and surface water bodies as indicated in fig 6 cultivated land cover alters hydrology flow whereas forest cover plays a most important function in stabilizing the hydrology flow in the catchment trees and forest play a greater role in reducing storm water and filtering pollutants that would end up in water bodies due to their leafy canopy forests have high ability to regulate flow and filter water gagnon 2008 the leafy canopy interrupts rainfall drops hence reducing their impact as they fall on the ground leaves fall on the floor of the forest floor acts as sponge that absorbs rainwater hence facilitates ground water recharging gagnon 2008 increased surface runoff causes floods and deposition of logs in the kikuletwa river channels high surface runoff has increased land erosion and deposition of logs in the river channels siltation and logs from upstream of kikuletwa have led to river channel incision leading to floods floods have led to the loss of farmlands and settlements at kahe somanga rongai msitu wa tembo and arusha chini areas fig 7 and 8 the increase in soil erosion in our study area between 1987 and 2017 may be due to deforestation and surface runoff more rainfall is diverted into fast flow paths with high potential of soil erosion this is common on cleared land such as agriculture land tillage on the other hand disturbs the soil hence makes it prone to erosion the potential of delivering water with higher solute concentrations due to erosion also increases chaves et al 2008 surface water and surface runoff is the primary mechanism for transporting sediment from land into watercourses and surface water bodies evapotranspiration did not significantly change in our study area which is contrary to the existing theory that evapotranspiration decreases with decrease in forest cover our findings regarding evapotranspiration differ to that of foley et al 2007 who linked the decrease in evapotranspiration forest clearing in the tropical forest evapotranspiration is the amount of water transpired to the atmosphere through evaporation of plants and carbon fixing trabucco et al 2008 it is dependent on vegetation characteristics quantity of water available in the soil and soil hydrological properties soil water retention curves stability of evapotranspiration in our study area may be due to replacement of trees with crops thus the soil is not left bare land use changes affect evapotranspiration or vapor flows 5 conclusion and recommendations the study concludes that hydrology characteristics of the basin are highly influenced by the use and cover changes in the sub basin the hydrology pattern change contributes to floods and high turbidity water often observed in the basin therefore continuing land use and cover change in the basin may further affect hydrology patterns of the pangani basin it recommended that agro forestry should be emphasized restoration activities guided by the extension officers should be introduced to help farmer s plant trees on their farmlands this approach will benefit the basin ecohydrology and increase soil fertility swat model has managed to reveal the link between land uses and cover change and hydrology characteristics at the sub basin level however simulation involving large area is challenged with the quality of land sat images we recommend simulation using a small area using more recent land sat images 6 financial disclosure the financial support for this work came from the german academic exchange program daad declaration of competing

941,marine ecosystems have been heavily affected by environmental changes which led to shift of prokaryotic diversity and distribution especially in the arctic ocean however how environmental changes affect prokaryotic community still unclear here prokaryotic diversity community composition and spatial distribution patterns in marine sediments from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean were surveyed the results indicated that the lowest bacterial and archaeal diversities were observed in the western arctic ocean moreover the prokaryotic richness and diversity showed strong correlation r2 0 31 0 83 p 0 05 with heavy metals such as cu zn ni and as the contents of ni and as represented a range with in which biological effects occur occasionally in the bering strait but concentrations of cu zn ni and as in the western arctic ocean showed a probable effect range with in which adverse biological effects occasionally or frequently occur furthermore as geographical distance increased archaeal community similarity decreased faster than bacteria the abundances of gammaproteobacteria firmicutes and thaumarchaeota significantly increased from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean conversely much lower abundances of alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes and crenarchaeota were observed in the western arctic ocean in addition all environmental could explain 73 8 and 85 1 bacterial and archaeal variations respectively and heavy metals could independently explain 40 3 and 30 4 community variation for archaea and bacteria respectively this study emphasized effects of heavy metals on prokaryotic diversities and distribution patterns in marine sediments which were helpful to deep understand microbial variation under environmental changes keywords marine sediment arctic ocean microbial community geographic distribution heavy metal 1 introduction as one of the most complex microbial habitats marine sediments inhabit countless microorganisms which play important roles in biogeochemical element cycling fuhrman 2009 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2018 peoples et al 2018 sunagawa et al 2015 in turn their diversity and distribution pattern are also significantly affected by multiple environmental factors of marine sediments currie et al 2017 xiong et al 2012 although earlier studies have explored the relationship between marine microorganisms and environment factors most of them mainly focused on communities in upper ocean water columns less in sediments especially in the polar ocean regions danovaro et al 2017 dong et al 2017 some of the main reasons were sampling challenge such as lacking of ice breaker funding support and topography information arrigo et al 2014 boeuf et al 2014 therefore existing data are still insufficient to precisely describe how environmental factors impact on microbial diversity and distribution pattern in polar marine sediments barnes and tarling 2017 pedrós alió et al 2015 multifarious of environmental factors such as temperature salinity electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and nutrients have a certain impact on the distribution and community heterogeneity of microorganisms which has been widely confirmed by many studies abirami et al 2021 sun et al 2020 tisthammer et al 2016 chen et al 2022 in addition as marginal seas the bering sea and the bering strait are increasingly affected by human activities such as freshwater and pollutant discharges and commercial operations for example merchant shipping huntington et al 2019 knudson and ravelo 2015 although the arctic ocean is far from the mainland and less directly affected by human activities the environmental contaminants are easily accumulated in the arctic ocean by due to oceanic currents heavy metals are known as common pollutants in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems fulke et al 2020 mohseni et al 2018 yang et al 2022 they are considered as one of the most persistent group of environmental contaminants derived from both naturally formed geological and geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities metal pollutant emissions from industrial and agricultural activities buccolieri et al 2006 fulke et al 2020 rousk and rousk 2018 surface marine sediments act as important repository of heavy metals where the concentrations of accumulated metal ions are 3 to 5 orders of magnitude higher than that in the corresponding upper seawater christophoridis et al 2019 sun et al 2022 these metals may pose a severe threat to the organisms appenroth 2010 chibuike and obiora 2014 rousk and rousk 2018 although the northern polar region is a remote area many studies have shown that metal concentrations in arctic marine sediments are increasing because global warming may cause exacerbating effects such as changes in biological process increased corrosion in river basins and permafrost melting leading to increased metal accumulation in arctic marine sediments however there is less attention has been paid to the effects of heavy metal contamination on microbial diversity and distribution in the arctic ocean lu and kang 2018 previous studies showed that heavy metals such as zn pb cd and as had significant effects on microbial diversity and structure in terrestrial environments bouskill et al 2010 lorenz et al 2006 oliveira and pampulha 2006 therefore more and more studies have begun to focus on the impact of heavy metals on benthic microorganisms but few in the arctic ocean di cesare et al 2020 quero et al 2015 rajeev et al 2021 tangherlini et al 2020 in this study marine sediments were sampled from the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean then amplicon sequencing was performed based on illumina high throughput sequencing to capture the sediment prokaryotes ultimately we mainly aim to i compare the prokaryotic diversity community composition and distribution among three marine regions ii assess the impact of environmental factors especially heavy metals on prokaryotic composition and community variation iii determine the distinct prokaryotes among the three regions the results would provide useful insights into microbial community variation under environmental changes and would be helpful to understand effects of environmental changes on marine ecosystem 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and sample collection sediments were randomly sampled from 18 sites which were located in the bering sea sites b12 nb01 nb02 nb03 and nb04 the bering strait sites c03 cc2 cc4 cc5 and cc6 and the western arctic ocean sites c13 c15 r10 r11 r12 r13 r14 and sic3 during the 7th chinese national arctic research expedition the sampling sites were shown in fig 1 sampling information including longitude latitude and depth was presented in table s1 at each sampling site sediment samples were collected using a negligible disturbance box corer 50 50 65 cm accordingly sediments in the box corer were subsampled by sterile pvc pipe 10 cm diameter 30 cm long the top 5 cm sediments were collected using a sterile test tube and samples were immediately stored at 80 c until dna extraction additional sediment sub samples were collected for the assessment of sediment characteristics 2 2 dna extraction pcr amplification illumina sequencing and data processing the dna extraction pcr amplification and data processing were described in our previous study wang et al 2018 briefly the genomic dna was extracted from 0 5 g of surface sediments using a mobio powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa triplicate dna extractions were pooled for each sample microbial communities were profiled by targeting a region of the 16s rrna gene for bacteria and archaea according to previous study corresponding polymerase chain reaction assays were performed with the primer pairs 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 v3 v4 region for bacteria shang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 and arch519f 5 cagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and arch915r 5 gtgctcccccgccaattcct 3 v4 v5 region for archaea galand et al 2009 teske and sørensen 2008 respectively sequencing was conducted using the miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa raw data were processed and analyzed using an in house pipeline http mem rcees ac cn 8080 as described by previous study feng et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sequences with an average quality score below 20 and sequence length fewer than 200 bp were discarded and sequences were then split into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 similarity level using the uparse pipeline and silva132 reference database was applied to assign the taxonomic identity for bacteria and archaea quast et al 2012 2 3 statistical analysis to equalize efforts sequences were randomly resampled according to the smallest read numbers among all samples 62774 and 26068 sequences for bacteria and archaea respectively prokaryotic α diversity was estimated using otu numbers chao1 index and shannon index in this study good s coverage was also measured to evaluate the sequencing depth finally differences in α diversities among regions were tested by using the kruskal wallis test overall differences in bacterial and archaeal community composition were visualized with principal coordinates analysis pcoa using r software version 4 0 1 base package vegan based on bray curtis distance and the statistic significant difference between any pair of regions were assessed using the permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova run with 999 permutations a corresponding analysis of community similarity was used to assess significant difference among geographical groups geographical distance between sample sites were calculated with function geodist in r package gmt the measuring methods of the sediments about the physicochemical properties and the contents of heavy metals were described in detail in the supplementary information in order to assess the contribution of heavy metals and other environmental factors to prokaryotic community variation all the environmental factors were divided into two groups physicochemical variables including depth ph no3 nh4 tic and toc and heavy metals including cu ni zn pb cd and as correlation analysis between prokaryotic α diversity and environmental factors was conducted based on mantel test additionally sediment quality guidelines sqgs were assessed according to previous study di cesare et al 2020 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa developed a set of empirical sqgs long et al 1995 that provides two values effects range low erl and effects range median erm which delineate three concentration ranges for each particular chemical and the corresponding estimation of the potential biological effect buchman 2008 harikumar and nasir 2010 the concentrations below erl represent a minimal effects range which is intended to estimate conditions where biological effects are rarely observed concentrations equal to or greater than erl but less than erm represents a range with in which biological effects occur occasionally concentrations at or above erm values represents a probable effect range with in which adverse biological effects frequently occur burton 2002 harikumar and nasir 2010 canonical correspondence analysis cca with 999 monte carlo permutation tests was conducted in conjunction with otu table package vegan in r to reveal how environmental factors affected on the microbial community heterogeneity cca method was chosen because preliminary detrended correspondence analysis dca on both bacterial community and archaeal community data showed that the longest gradient lengths were longer than 3 0 indicated that the majority of species exhibited linear responses to the environmental variation subsequently according to previous studies described mo et al 2018 yang et al 2016 variance inflation factors vifs were computed to check the presence of collinearities among environmental variables using the function vif cca in the vegan package in r if vif values 20 the relevant environmental variables were eliminated to avoid collinearity among factors finally only significant p 0 05 environmental variables that were tested by cca with 1 000 permutations were kept for variance partition analysis vpa using the vegan package to determine the relative contribution or environmental factors for prokaryotic community variations accordingly in order to figure out the relationship between each environmental factor and prokaryotes the correlations of main bacterial and archaeal phyla were examined by spearman test in conjunction with environmental variables as well oliverio et al 2017 the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse is an algorithm for high dimensional biomarker discovery and explanation that identifies microbial features characterizing the differences between two or more biological conditions or classes liu et al 2019 it emphasizes both statistical significance and biological relevance allowing researchers to identify differentially abundant features that are also consistent with biologically meaningful categories segata et al 2011 therefore lefse was employed to identify the distinct taxa biomarker across three regions lda score 4 0 3 results 3 1 physicochemical characteristics general sediment characteristics including depth ph no3 nh4 tic toc and the contents of heavy metals were showed in table s1 the sampling depth were ranged from 43 to 2016 meters on average the bering sea was the shallowest sampling region and the western arctic ocean was the deepest the ph values of sediments ranged from 6 93 to 8 40 and with a tendency to increase with latitude on average 7 41 8 05 and 8 15 in the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean respectively the contents of no3 were at the range of 1 50 11 64 g kg and the bering strait was the lowest on average 2 99 1 61 g kg the contents of nh4 much varied across the established sampling sites the contents of tic increased from 82 45 13 62 g kg to 105 07 37 8 g kg and 125 37 37 74 g kg from the bering sea to the bering strait and the arctic ocean on average while the contents of toc showed a total contrary tendency for heavy metals generally the mean values of nearly all the studied metals except pb and cd were increased in the order of the bering sea the bering strait and the arctic ocean table s1 the average contents of cu and ni in sediments from the arctic ocean were more than three and twice folds higher than that in the bering sea and the bering strait respectively furthermore the average contents of as in the western arctic ocean was nearly four and three folds than that in the bering sea and the bering strait generally the distribution of the tested environmental factors in the bering sea or the bering strait were significantly lower compared to the western arctic ocean except pb and cd tables s2 moreover the contents of some heavy metals such as zn ni and as which approached or even exceeded their corresponding threshold of standard values in the western arctic ocean tables s1 in addition according to the evaluation of heavy metal pollution based on erl or erm as shown in fig s3 considering the results the contents of ni and as exceeded the erl levels in the bering sea and the bering strait and the heavy metal concentration of cu zn and as were over erl but below erm in the western arctic ocean however the contents of ni in the western arctic ocean were higher than erm in most sites 3 2 correlation between α diversity and environmental factors after filtering out low quality reads and chimera sequences 2869 and 1265 otus were obtained for bacteria and archaea at 3 dissimilarity level total 1734 1865 and 1525 otus for bacteria and 807 726 and 298 otus for archaea in the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean respectively figs 1a and 1b good s coverage scores were highly obtained in all samples 99 table s3 indicating that the sequencing depth were adequate to reliably describe the prokaryotic diversity the venn plot demonstrated that 45 and 32 of bacterial and archaeal otus were shared by the bering sea and the bering strait together but few proportions of otus 26 and 12 for bacteria and archaea were common between the western arctic ocean region and other regions figs 1a and 1b the chao1 index which represented community richness ranged from 119 to 1867 in all prokaryotic samples the shannon diversity index measures both otu richness and evenness ranged from 3 16 to 6 80 table s3 for bacteria figs 2c and 2e showed that the highest richness and diversity were observed in the bering strait on average 1579 and 6 22 for chao 1 and shannon indices while in the western arctic ocean owned the lowest on average 883 and 5 05 for chao 1 and shannon indices archaeal richness and diversity decreased continuously with latitude on average 582 453 and 178 for chao 1 index and 5 17 4 68 and 3 71 for shannon index for the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean respectively interestingly all α diversity indexes of prokaryotes showed no differences between the bering sea and the bering strait p 0 05 fig 2 but significant differences between the other pairs of regions the bering sea and the western arctic ocean the bering strait and the western arctic ocean p 0 05 fig 2 correlation analysis between prokaryotic α diversity and environmental factors indicated that only the content of toc showed a significant positive correlation with prokaryotic α diversity p 0 05 fig s1 and the lower content of toc in the western arctic ocean resulting in lower bacterial and archaeal diversity in addition bacterial α diversity also significant affected by sampling depth and nh4 concentration compared with physicochemical factors bacterial and archaeal α diversity also significantly had a strong linear relationship with contents of cu zn ni and as fig s2 we also found that contents of all heavy metals increased from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean showed significant negative correlations with chao1 index and shannon index except pb and cd table s1 fig s2 r2 0 31 0 83 p 0 01 3 3 prokaryotic distribution and community composition the overall variability of microbial distribution patterns of bacteria and archaea were analyzed via pcoa based on bray curtis distance fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 the first two pcoa axes explained 54 2 and 79 3 of the total bacterial and archaeal variations respectively figs 3a and 3b moreover the samples belonging to the same region were clustered with each other in most cases both bacterial and archaeal communities in the bering sea were separated from that the bering strait along the second axis while they were separated from the communities of the western arctic ocean along the first axis permanova indicated that bacterial and archaeal community structures were significantly different between any two regions p 0 01 especially compared with the western arctic ocean f 8 74 and 11 44 table 1 in addition both bacterial and archaeal community similarities showed obviously decreased tendency with geographical distance and steeper slope was observed in archaeal community 0 00028 and 0 00017 for archaea and bacteria p 0 001 figs 3c and 3d the abundant prokaryotic communities relative abundance more than 1 on average are presented in fig 4 at phylum level proteobacteria accounted for the largest bacterial fraction in all samples more than 60 however the relative abundances of proteobacteria at sub phylum level were skewed with considerable difference alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria represented up to 37 8 and 65 6 of the communities respectively the relative proportion of gammaproteobacteria showed increasing tendency with latitude while contrary trendcy existed in alphaproteobacteria epsilonproteobacteria occupied a much higher abundance in the bering sea 5 5 but decreased continuously from the bering strait 0 9 to the western arctic ocean 0 04 bacteroidetes was also one of the abundant phyla in the bering sea and the bering strait 20 7 and 21 8 on average respectively while its abundance sharply decreased to 4 7 in the western arctic ocean in addition the proportions of deltaproteobacteria planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia were higher in the bering strait than that in other two regions comparing with bacteria only five abundant archaea phyla were observed fig 4b the relative abundances of archaea were different at phylum level crenarchaeota was the most dominant archaeal phylum and representing 14 8 38 3 of the communities in the bering sea while it turned into the second dominant population in the bering strait range from 10 6 to 13 2 moreover it nearly disappeared in the western arctic ocean except for at c15 on the whole the relative abundance of thaumarchaeota increased from 1 2 to 93 7 as latitude increased euryarchaeota showed the highest abundance in the bering sea among all three regions interestingly unclassified phyla 36 5 65 0 occupied a considerable fraction of archaeal communities in the bering sea and the bering strait but not in the western arctic ocean 3 4 correlation analysis between prokaryotes and environmental factors cca was performed at otu level and monte carlo permutation test were used to determine whether the environmental factors significantly affected prokaryotic community structure fig 5 the results of cca showed that the slected environmental variables together explained 37 2 of the observed bacterial commnuity variations fig 5a specifically depth r2 0 40 p 0 01 ph r2 0 57 p 0 01 no3 r2 0 42 p 0 05 toc r2 0 33 p 0 05 cu r2 0 73 p 0 001 zn r2 0 55 p 0 001 ni r2 0 76 p 0 001 pb r2 0 42 p 0 05 as r2 0 81 p 0 001 were major factors which strongly affected bacterial community structure while nh4 tic and cd had no significant influences on bacterial community table s4 environmental factors could explain more variations 65 8 of archaeal community compared with bacterial community fig 5b heavy metals such as cu r2 0 82 p 0 001 zn r2 0 64 p 0 001 ni r2 0 88 p 0 001 and as r2 0 91 p 0 001 have significant influences on archaeal community table s4 the results of vpa demonstrsated that heavy metals could independedtly account for 40 3 and 30 4 for archaeal and bacterial commuity variations respectively while physicochemical properties explained lower proportions archaeal commuity variations 29 3 figs 5d moreover 11 2 and 15 6 of bacterial and archaeal community variations were explained by physicochemical factors and heavy metals together the correlation between abundant prokaryotes and environmental factors were estimated by spearman correlation analysis at phylum level figs 5e and 5f table s5 the results as shown in table s5 also indicated that heavy metals such as cu zn ni pb and as had significantly positive effects on gammaproteobacteria r 0 51 0 82 and thaumarchaeota r 0 73 0 89 while firmicutes r 0 49 and 0 54 only positively correlated with ni and as conversely cu ni and as exhibited significant negative effects on alphaproteobacteria r 0 60 0 69 bacteroidetes r 0 61 0 79 verrucomicrobia r 0 50 0 59 and crenarchaeota r 0 71 0 81 3 5 distinct bacterial and archaeal biomarkers in these three regions enriched prokaryotic biomarkers for each region were analyzed by lefse as shown in fig 6 based on our dataset total 48 bacterial and 36 archaeal clades exhibited statistically significantly enriched among three marine regions with the lda threshold of 4 0 table s6 briefly lefse separately detected 14 12 and 22 bacterial taxa showed statistically significant and biologically consistent differences in the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean and 21 4 and 10 archaeal taxa were distinguished from these regions as well four bacterial phyla were the significant populations bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia in the bering strait proteobacteria and firmicutes in the western arctic ocean but at class level epsilonproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria sub phylum level of proteobacteria in this study were the enriched populations in the bering sea but flavobacteriia and verrucomicrobiae were enriched in the bering strait gammaproteobacteria and bacilli were the biomarkers in the western arctic ocean fig 6a as for archaea crenarchaeota and aenigmarchaeota were enriched in the bering sea and euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota were significant enriched in the western arctic ocean while thermoprotei was the most differentially archaeal taxa in the bering sea and the western arctic ocean methanomicrobia was the obviously enriched population in the bering strait at class level fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 environmental characteristics of sediments and prokaryotic diversities sediments are recognized as the main reservoir in the marine environment and play irreplaceable roles in transporting and accumulating various of pollutants yan et al 2010 in marine environment the sources of heavy metals generally inputed by natural and anthropogenic activities mainy including freshwater input sewage discharge atmospheric deposition volcanic eruptions ocean currents and hydrothermal vents especially in the arctic ocean al ateeq et al 2014 aquilina et al 2014 chatterjee et al 2007 doney et al 2012 compared with our earlier study which sampled form bering sea and the chukchi sea during the 6th chinese national artic research expedition wang et al 2018 our findings in this study indicated that the contents of some heavy metals such as cu zn and cd significantly increased in the bering sea and the western arctic ocean on average moreover in this study compared with the bering sea and the bering strait we found that heavy metal contents were much higher in the western arctic ocean additionally compared with the latest study which focused on sediments of the southwestern chukchi sea sattarova et al 2022 higher contents of heavy metals such as zn pb and cd were detected in the bering sea and the bering strait of this study remarkably all heavy metal concentrations in the western arctic ocean were significantly higher than the southwestern chukchi sea and the eastern south pacific ocean chandia and salamanca 2012 moreover the concentrations of zn ni cd and as in the western arctic ocean were also higher than the pula bay croatia di cesare et al 2020 in addition considering the results which yield from assessment of heavy metal pollution based on erl or erm fig s3 the contents of ni and as in the bering sea and the bering strait and the heavy metal concentration of cu zn and as in the western arctic which represented a range with in which biological effects occur occasionally notably the contents of ni in the western arctic ocean were higher than erm level in most sites which represents a probable effect range with in which adverse biological effects frequently occur this finding was consistent with the results of an earlier study lu and kang 2018 zheng et al 2022 accordingly previous studies indicated that most metals transport from the bering sea and chukchi shelf to the western arctic ocean khim et al 2018 kondo et al 2016 this can be explained by several aspects as following 1 the increasing anthropogenic activities associated with growing industries within boundary of the arctic areas including hydrocarbon exploration sites and mines 2 the arctic ocean is considered a sink for global pollution because of the flow of oceanic and atmospheric currents it is a delicate ecosystem exposed by land based sources of pollution particularly heavy metals kahkashan et al 2019 3 atmosphere seawater exchange is the main process that controls the residence time and levels of contaminant in the arctic ocean ji et al 2019 moreover the atmospheric pathway is the quickest and most direct way for long range pollutant transportation e g pollutants can be transported from distant sources to the arctic ocean within several days or weeks shevchenko et al 2003 also of concern is the fact that the melting of contaminated ice may lead to more pollutant emission into the arctic ocean with rapid warming of the global climate which intensified the input of metal ions in polar oceans ji et al 2019 generally the increasingly discharge of contaminants through anthropogenic inputs runoff from adjacent lands atmospheric deposition and natural emission have leaded to the shift the benthic environment additionally we also found that the concentrations of nh4 and toc were several folds higher than our early study wang et al 2018 and higher contents of nh4 and toc were detected in the bering sea and the bering strait than western arctic ocean this because as the impact of the surrounding industrial regions such as japan china and alaska which caused large amounts of organic matter runoff from the industrialized areas to move toward the bering sea and the bering strait t cai et al 2012 kahkashan et al 2019 compared with our previous research which carried in the 6th chinese national artic research expedition our results also showed that the lowest prokaryotic richness and diversity were detected in the western arctic ocean however both bacterial and archaeal diversities in bering sea and the western arctic ocean significantly increased here wang et al 2018 for example in the bering sea chao1 indices of bacteria and archaea were at the range of 1047 1824 and 464 809 respectively but they were only 391 501 and 73 124 in our earlier study similar results were also observed for otu numbers and shannon indices all of the different results we obtained from present study suggested that environmental change would lower prokaryotic diversity and richness our findings were well consisted with previous study which focused on heavy metal impacted prokaryotic assemblages in polluted sediments quero et al 2015 tangherlini et al 2020 4 2 effects of environmental factors on prokaryotic community figuring out what and how environmental factors affect microorganisms is crucial to understand microbial response to environmental change as the most persistent environmental contaminants rousk and rousk 2018 we found that the contents of heavy metals had strong correlation with prokaryotic diversity and could explain large proportion of prokaryotic community variation kruskal wallis test indicated that there were no significant differences in prokaryotic diversity between the bering sea and the bering strait figs 2c 2f that was accordance with that no significant differences of heavy metal contents between these two regions table s2 previous studies indicated that heavy metals had significant impacts on microbial composition and geographic distribution hu et al 2021 quero et al 2015 we found that gammaproteobacteria firmicutes and thaumarchaeota had positive correlation with the contents of heavy metals and their relative abundances increased with heavy metal concentrations fig 5 table s1 that phenomenon could be well explained by previous studies which indicated that gammaproteobacteria firmicutes and thaumarchaeota were highly resistant to heavy metals hu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 on the one hand moderate concentrations of metals are helpful to microorganism growth fulke et al 2020 some metals are required as enzyme cofactors for structural integrity or to provide screening of the electrostatic interactions in the aquatic ecosystems jaishankar et al 2014 petukh and alexov 2014 on the other hand once the contents of heavy metals exceed microbial affordable threshold values they become toxic for microbial populations zwolak 2015 for example high concentration of heavy metals have been documented to reduce 30 50 microbial diversity in previous studies fu et al 2016 johnston and roberts 2009 therefore the lowest bacterial and archaeal diversities in the western arctic ocean might related to the highest concentrations of heavy metals here since we found that prokaryotic diversities showed strong negative correlations with contents of heavy metals fig s2 the distance decay relationship is a fundamental pattern in ecology morlon et al 2011 zinger et al 2014 our results found that stronger distance decay pattern was observed in archaeal communities figs 3c and 3d this may be because more susceptible of archaea to heavy metals figs 5d and 5f table s5 resulting in the dramatic change of archaea composition such as thaumarchaeota and crenarchaeota since previous study indicated that organic or inorganic pollutants could contribute to the loss of specific prokaryotic taxa and then decrease community similarity in the sites showing higher contamination levels tangherlini et al 2020 this result was consistent with environmental factor change from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean especially for heavy metals fig s3 tables s1 and s3 furthermore this was also verified by relative low community dissimilarity between the bering sea and the bering strait where environmental heterogeneity was low that is because significant environmental heterogeneity among different regions may contribute to explain and further enhance the high turnover β diversity of the prokaryotic communities in sediments tangherlini et al 2020 because in addition to heavy metals the variables of depth ph no3 tic and toc were all significantly changed in most sites or regions table s2 furthermore vpa results indicated that physicochemical variables could independently explain considerable proportions about 30 of community variation in bacteria and archaea however the variation of the archaeal community explained by heavy metals alone was 10 higher than that in the bacterial counterpart figs 5c and 5d these results suggested that bacteria and archaea have different tolerance or adaptability to heavy metals similar to previous studies proteobacteria in the arctic marine sediments showed a dominant role over half of the bacterial proportion belonging to proteobacteria with a higher clade diversity including alpha gamma epsilon deltaproteobacteria and showed a well adaptive ability in the arctic ocean sediment li et al 2015 pedrós alió et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the response of different prokaryotes to heavy metals differed with the abundances of gammaproteobacteria firmicutes and thaumarchaeota showing increased tendency with heavy metals from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean while other bacterial and archaeal communities showed the opposite trend fig 4 and figs 5e and 5f this might be owning to differences in environmental adaptations cellular structure and cellular metabolisms among prokaryotic populations gao et al 2021 the different prokaryotic response and behavior between physicochemical variables and heavy metals remind us that heavy metals should be considered as important environmental factors when revealing the microbial community structure and distribution patterns in future research 4 3 distinct prokaryotes distribution and their ecological functions microorganisms are assumed present everywhere but affected by the environmental factors baas becking 1934 and drive many biogeochemical process they play significant roles in maintaining and regulating ecological stability due to their ecological functions liu et al 2015 lefse was used to discover the genetic species or functional characteristics of multiple groups of samples under different conditions that best explain the differences between groups and the extent to which these characteristics affect the differences between groups hu et al 2021 from the previous analysis it was clear that proteobacteria was the dominant phylum which with a high clade diversity yet the correlations between heavy metal concentrations and sub phylum of proteobacteria were reversed the abundance of gammaproteobacteria increased from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean fig 4 there were showed positive correlations between gammaproteobacteria and contents of cu zn ni pb as however reversed correlations were observed in alphaproteobacteria and epsilonproteobacteria which significantly enriched in the bering sea fig 5 tables s5 and s6 this shift can be explained by the fact that the phylotypes with heavy metal tolerance were selected while sensitive ones became less frequent singh et al 2014 additionally in the long term adaptive evolution these bacteria have diverse mechanisms that allow them to tolerate the presence of heavy metals haferburg and kothe 2007 ma et al 2016 proteobacteria and firmicutes has been reported to harbor the vast majority of heavy metal resistance genes chen et al 2018 yan et al 2020 which were significantly enriched in heavy metal contaminated area the western arctic ocean the adaptability of these bacterial tolerance to heavy metals may be related to their ability to utilize multiple c n and other energy sources in a complex survival mode bouskill et al 2010 for example genus pseudomonas belong to family pseudomonadaceae order pseudoalteromonas class gammaproteobacteria was reported that isolated from metal contaminated area had the abilities to counteract heavy metals huang et al 2016 phylum verrucomicrobia plays important roles in carbon cycling processes has been known to be present in a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems hu et al 2021 shen et al 2017 positively correlate with toc concentration fig 5e and table s5 it was significantly enriched in the bering strait fig 6 genus nitrosopumilus as one cluster of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa it contributes greatly to the ammonia oxidation process hu et al 2019 and enriched in the bering strait and the western arctic ocean fig 6b and table s6 and methanosarcinales play a central role in global carbon cycling due to its methanogenic function berger 2015 which was significantly enriched in the bering strait table s6 suggesting that the carbon cycling process was more activity in the bering strait since the highest concentration of toc were detected here previous study indicated that the exposure to metal pollution induced an increase in the proportion of euryarchaeota but lowered the proportion of thaumarchaeota in freshwater sediment guo et al 2019 however totally different trend was observed here in this study thaumarchaeota had significant positive correlation coefficients with heavy metals and largely enriched in the western arctic ocean fig 5f table s5 additionally heavy metals do also affect order nitrosopumilales and family nitrosopumilaceae in the western arctic ocean but euryarchaeota was only enriched in the bering strait this is understandable because a variety of thaumarchaeota can survive in heavy metal contaminated soil through a number of detoxification and metabolic mechanisms bartolucci et al 2013 sandaa et al 1999 while phyla crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota had a strong negative correlation with heavy metal concentrations including class thermoprotei class thermoplasmata order thermoproteales order methanomassiliicoccales and family thermofilaceae were enriched in bering sea or bering strait our results verified that heavy metals play an important role in shaping the sediment bacterial and archaeal distribution importantly microorganisms that can survive in environments with high heavy metal contamination have potential for use in the field of biomineralization and soil remediation and their resistance mechanisms are also worth investigating in further study 5 conclusions microbial diversity and distribution in marine sediment mainly shaped by various of environmental factors as persistent toxic pollutants we found that higher contents of heavy metals accumulated in the western arctic ocean than in the bering sea and bering strait and even some heavy metals exceed standard thresholds resulting in strong bacterial and archaeal community variability additionally the community composition and diversity of prokaryotes were found to be closely related to the contents of heavy metals besides stronger distance decay relationship occurred in archaeal community than that in bacterial community moreover due to the concentrations of heavy metals such as cu zn as and ni exceed erl or erm level which produced adverse biological effects on prokaryotic diversity occasionally or frequently occur in the western arctic ocean in addition heavy metals contributed to higher community variation in the archaea but not to the bacteria this work reminded us that heavy metals should be considered as important factors for microbial variation in

941,marine ecosystems have been heavily affected by environmental changes which led to shift of prokaryotic diversity and distribution especially in the arctic ocean however how environmental changes affect prokaryotic community still unclear here prokaryotic diversity community composition and spatial distribution patterns in marine sediments from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean were surveyed the results indicated that the lowest bacterial and archaeal diversities were observed in the western arctic ocean moreover the prokaryotic richness and diversity showed strong correlation r2 0 31 0 83 p 0 05 with heavy metals such as cu zn ni and as the contents of ni and as represented a range with in which biological effects occur occasionally in the bering strait but concentrations of cu zn ni and as in the western arctic ocean showed a probable effect range with in which adverse biological effects occasionally or frequently occur furthermore as geographical distance increased archaeal community similarity decreased faster than bacteria the abundances of gammaproteobacteria firmicutes and thaumarchaeota significantly increased from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean conversely much lower abundances of alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes and crenarchaeota were observed in the western arctic ocean in addition all environmental could explain 73 8 and 85 1 bacterial and archaeal variations respectively and heavy metals could independently explain 40 3 and 30 4 community variation for archaea and bacteria respectively this study emphasized effects of heavy metals on prokaryotic diversities and distribution patterns in marine sediments which were helpful to deep understand microbial variation under environmental changes keywords marine sediment arctic ocean microbial community geographic distribution heavy metal 1 introduction as one of the most complex microbial habitats marine sediments inhabit countless microorganisms which play important roles in biogeochemical element cycling fuhrman 2009 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2018 peoples et al 2018 sunagawa et al 2015 in turn their diversity and distribution pattern are also significantly affected by multiple environmental factors of marine sediments currie et al 2017 xiong et al 2012 although earlier studies have explored the relationship between marine microorganisms and environment factors most of them mainly focused on communities in upper ocean water columns less in sediments especially in the polar ocean regions danovaro et al 2017 dong et al 2017 some of the main reasons were sampling challenge such as lacking of ice breaker funding support and topography information arrigo et al 2014 boeuf et al 2014 therefore existing data are still insufficient to precisely describe how environmental factors impact on microbial diversity and distribution pattern in polar marine sediments barnes and tarling 2017 pedrós alió et al 2015 multifarious of environmental factors such as temperature salinity electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and nutrients have a certain impact on the distribution and community heterogeneity of microorganisms which has been widely confirmed by many studies abirami et al 2021 sun et al 2020 tisthammer et al 2016 chen et al 2022 in addition as marginal seas the bering sea and the bering strait are increasingly affected by human activities such as freshwater and pollutant discharges and commercial operations for example merchant shipping huntington et al 2019 knudson and ravelo 2015 although the arctic ocean is far from the mainland and less directly affected by human activities the environmental contaminants are easily accumulated in the arctic ocean by due to oceanic currents heavy metals are known as common pollutants in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems fulke et al 2020 mohseni et al 2018 yang et al 2022 they are considered as one of the most persistent group of environmental contaminants derived from both naturally formed geological and geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities metal pollutant emissions from industrial and agricultural activities buccolieri et al 2006 fulke et al 2020 rousk and rousk 2018 surface marine sediments act as important repository of heavy metals where the concentrations of accumulated metal ions are 3 to 5 orders of magnitude higher than that in the corresponding upper seawater christophoridis et al 2019 sun et al 2022 these metals may pose a severe threat to the organisms appenroth 2010 chibuike and obiora 2014 rousk and rousk 2018 although the northern polar region is a remote area many studies have shown that metal concentrations in arctic marine sediments are increasing because global warming may cause exacerbating effects such as changes in biological process increased corrosion in river basins and permafrost melting leading to increased metal accumulation in arctic marine sediments however there is less attention has been paid to the effects of heavy metal contamination on microbial diversity and distribution in the arctic ocean lu and kang 2018 previous studies showed that heavy metals such as zn pb cd and as had significant effects on microbial diversity and structure in terrestrial environments bouskill et al 2010 lorenz et al 2006 oliveira and pampulha 2006 therefore more and more studies have begun to focus on the impact of heavy metals on benthic microorganisms but few in the arctic ocean di cesare et al 2020 quero et al 2015 rajeev et al 2021 tangherlini et al 2020 in this study marine sediments were sampled from the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean then amplicon sequencing was performed based on illumina high throughput sequencing to capture the sediment prokaryotes ultimately we mainly aim to i compare the prokaryotic diversity community composition and distribution among three marine regions ii assess the impact of environmental factors especially heavy metals on prokaryotic composition and community variation iii determine the distinct prokaryotes among the three regions the results would provide useful insights into microbial community variation under environmental changes and would be helpful to understand effects of environmental changes on marine ecosystem 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and sample collection sediments were randomly sampled from 18 sites which were located in the bering sea sites b12 nb01 nb02 nb03 and nb04 the bering strait sites c03 cc2 cc4 cc5 and cc6 and the western arctic ocean sites c13 c15 r10 r11 r12 r13 r14 and sic3 during the 7th chinese national arctic research expedition the sampling sites were shown in fig 1 sampling information including longitude latitude and depth was presented in table s1 at each sampling site sediment samples were collected using a negligible disturbance box corer 50 50 65 cm accordingly sediments in the box corer were subsampled by sterile pvc pipe 10 cm diameter 30 cm long the top 5 cm sediments were collected using a sterile test tube and samples were immediately stored at 80 c until dna extraction additional sediment sub samples were collected for the assessment of sediment characteristics 2 2 dna extraction pcr amplification illumina sequencing and data processing the dna extraction pcr amplification and data processing were described in our previous study wang et al 2018 briefly the genomic dna was extracted from 0 5 g of surface sediments using a mobio powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa triplicate dna extractions were pooled for each sample microbial communities were profiled by targeting a region of the 16s rrna gene for bacteria and archaea according to previous study corresponding polymerase chain reaction assays were performed with the primer pairs 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 v3 v4 region for bacteria shang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 and arch519f 5 cagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and

data were processed and analyzed using an in house pipeline http mem rcees ac cn 8080 as described by previous study feng et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sequences with an average quality score below 20 and sequence length fewer than 200 bp were discarded and sequences were then split into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 similarity level using the uparse pipeline and silva132 reference database was applied to assign the taxonomic identity for bacteria and archaea quast et al 2012 2 3 statistical analysis to equalize efforts sequences were randomly resampled according to the smallest read numbers among all samples 62774 and 26068 sequences for bacteria and archaea respectively prokaryotic α diversity was estimated using otu numbers chao1 index and shannon index in this study good s coverage was also measured to evaluate the sequencing depth finally differences in α diversities among regions were tested by using the kruskal wallis test overall differences in bacterial and archaeal community composition were visualized with principal coordinates analysis pcoa using r software version 4 0 1 base package vegan based on bray curtis distance and the statistic significant difference between any pair of regions were assessed using the permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova run with 999 permutations a corresponding analysis of community similarity was used to assess significant difference among geographical groups geographical distance between sample sites were calculated with function geodist in r package gmt the measuring methods of the sediments about the physicochemical properties and the contents of heavy metals were described in detail in the supplementary information in order to assess the contribution of heavy metals and other environmental factors to prokaryotic community variation all the environmental factors were divided into two groups physicochemical variables including depth ph no3 nh4 tic and toc and heavy metals including cu ni zn pb cd and as correlation analysis between prokaryotic α diversity and environmental factors was conducted based on mantel test additionally sediment quality guidelines sqgs were assessed according to previous study di cesare et al 2020 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa developed a set of empirical sqgs long et al 1995 that provides two values effects range low erl and effects range median erm which delineate three concentration ranges for each particular chemical and the corresponding estimation of the potential biological effect buchman 2008 harikumar and nasir 2010 the concentrations below erl represent a minimal effects range which is intended to estimate conditions where biological effects are rarely observed concentrations equal to or greater than erl but less than erm represents a range with in which biological effects occur occasionally concentrations at or above erm values represents a probable effect range with in which adverse biological effects frequently occur burton 2002 harikumar and nasir 2010 canonical correspondence analysis cca with 999 monte carlo permutation tests was conducted in conjunction with otu table package vegan in r to reveal how environmental factors affected on the microbial community heterogeneity cca method was chosen because preliminary detrended correspondence analysis dca on both bacterial community and archaeal community data showed that the longest gradient lengths were longer than 3 0 indicated that the majority of species exhibited linear responses to the environmental variation subsequently according to previous studies described mo et al 2018 yang et al 2016 variance inflation factors vifs were computed to check the presence of collinearities among environmental variables using the function vif cca in the vegan package in r if vif values 20 the relevant environmental variables were eliminated to avoid collinearity among factors finally only significant p 0 05 environmental variables that were tested by cca with 1 000 permutations were kept for variance partition analysis vpa using the vegan package to determine the relative contribution or environmental factors for prokaryotic community variations accordingly in order to figure out the relationship between each environmental factor and prokaryotes the correlations of main bacterial and archaeal phyla were examined by spearman test in conjunction with environmental variables as well oliverio et al 2017 the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse is an algorithm for high dimensional biomarker discovery and explanation that identifies microbial features characterizing the differences between two or more biological conditions or classes liu et al 2019 it emphasizes both statistical significance and biological relevance allowing researchers to identify differentially abundant features that are also consistent with biologically meaningful categories segata et al 2011 therefore lefse was employed to identify the distinct taxa biomarker across three regions lda score 4 0 3 results 3 1 physicochemical characteristics general sediment characteristics including depth ph no3 nh4 tic toc and the contents of heavy metals were showed in table s1 the sampling depth were ranged from 43 to 2016 meters on average the bering sea was the shallowest sampling region and the western arctic ocean was the deepest the ph values of sediments ranged from 6 93 to 8 40 and with a tendency to increase with latitude on average 7 41 8 05 and 8 15 in the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean respectively the contents of no3 were at the range of 1 50 11 64 g kg and the bering strait was the lowest on average 2 99 1 61 g kg the contents of nh4 much varied across the established sampling sites the contents of tic increased from 82 45 13 62 g kg to 105 07 37 8 g kg and 125 37 37 74 g kg from the bering sea to the bering strait and the arctic ocean on average while the contents of toc showed a total contrary tendency for heavy metals generally the mean values of nearly all the studied metals except pb and cd were increased in the order of the bering sea the bering strait and the arctic ocean table s1 the average contents of cu and ni in sediments from the arctic ocean were more than three and twice folds higher than that in the bering sea and the bering strait respectively furthermore the average contents of as in the western arctic ocean was nearly four and three folds than that in the bering sea and the bering strait generally the distribution of the tested environmental factors in the bering sea or the bering strait were significantly lower compared to the western arctic ocean except pb and cd tables s2 moreover the contents of some heavy metals such as zn ni and as which approached or even exceeded their corresponding threshold of standard values in the western arctic ocean tables s1 in addition according to the evaluation of heavy metal pollution based on erl or erm as shown in fig s3 considering the results the contents of ni and as exceeded the erl levels in the bering sea and the bering strait and the heavy metal concentration of cu zn and as were over erl but below erm in the western arctic ocean however the contents of ni in the western arctic ocean were higher than erm in most sites 3 2 correlation between α diversity and environmental factors after filtering out low quality reads and chimera sequences 2869 and 1265 otus were obtained for bacteria and archaea at 3 dissimilarity level total 1734 1865 and 1525 otus for bacteria and 807 726 and 298 otus for archaea in the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean respectively figs 1a and 1b good s coverage scores were highly obtained in all samples 99 table s3 indicating that the sequencing depth were adequate to reliably describe the prokaryotic diversity the venn plot demonstrated that 45 and 32 of bacterial and archaeal otus were shared by the bering sea and the bering strait together but few proportions of otus 26 and 12 for bacteria and archaea were common between the western arctic ocean region and other regions figs 1a and 1b the chao1 index which represented community richness ranged from 119 to 1867 in all prokaryotic samples the shannon diversity index measures both otu richness and evenness ranged from 3 16 to 6 80 table s3 for bacteria figs 2c and 2e showed that the highest richness and diversity were observed in the bering strait on average 1579 and 6 22 for chao 1 and shannon indices while in the western arctic ocean owned the lowest on average 883 and 5 05 for chao 1 and shannon indices archaeal richness and diversity decreased continuously with latitude on average 582 453 and 178 for chao 1 index and 5 17 4 68 and 3 71 for shannon index for the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean respectively interestingly all α diversity indexes of prokaryotes showed no differences between the bering sea and the bering strait p 0 05 fig 2 but significant differences between the other pairs of regions the bering sea and the western arctic ocean the bering strait and the western arctic ocean p 0 05 fig 2 correlation analysis between prokaryotic α diversity and environmental factors indicated that only the content of toc showed a significant positive correlation with prokaryotic α diversity p 0 05 fig s1 and the lower content of toc in the western arctic ocean resulting in lower bacterial and archaeal diversity in addition bacterial α diversity also significant affected by sampling depth and nh4 concentration compared with physicochemical factors bacterial and archaeal α diversity also significantly had a strong linear relationship with contents of cu zn ni and as fig s2 we also found that contents of all heavy metals increased from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean showed significant negative correlations with chao1 index and shannon index except pb and cd table s1 fig s2 r2 0 31 0 83 p 0 01 3 3 prokaryotic distribution and community composition the overall variability of microbial distribution patterns of bacteria and archaea were analyzed via pcoa based on bray curtis distance fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 the first two pcoa axes explained 54 2 and 79 3 of the total bacterial and archaeal variations respectively figs 3a and 3b moreover the samples belonging to the same region were clustered with each other in most cases both bacterial and archaeal communities in the bering sea were separated from that the bering strait along the second axis while they were separated from the communities of the western arctic ocean along the first axis permanova indicated that bacterial and archaeal community structures were significantly different between any two regions p 0 01 especially compared with the western arctic ocean f 8 74 and 11 44 table 1 in addition both bacterial and archaeal community similarities showed obviously decreased tendency with geographical distance and steeper slope was observed in archaeal community 0 00028 and 0 00017 for archaea and bacteria p 0 001 figs 3c and 3d the abundant prokaryotic communities relative abundance more than 1 on average are presented in fig 4 at phylum level proteobacteria accounted for the largest bacterial fraction in all samples more than 60 however the relative abundances of proteobacteria at sub phylum level were skewed with considerable difference alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria represented up to 37 8 and 65 6 of the communities respectively the relative proportion of gammaproteobacteria showed increasing tendency with latitude while contrary trendcy existed in alphaproteobacteria epsilonproteobacteria occupied a much higher abundance in the bering sea 5 5 but decreased continuously from the bering strait 0 9 to the western arctic ocean 0 04 bacteroidetes was also one of the abundant phyla in the bering sea and the bering strait 20 7 and 21 8 on average respectively while its abundance sharply decreased to 4 7 in the western arctic ocean in addition the proportions of deltaproteobacteria planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia were higher in the bering strait than that in other two regions comparing with bacteria only five abundant archaea phyla were observed fig 4b the relative abundances of archaea were different at phylum level crenarchaeota was the most dominant archaeal phylum and representing 14 8 38 3 of the communities in the bering sea while it turned into the second dominant population in the bering strait range from 10 6 to 13 2 moreover it nearly disappeared in the western arctic ocean except for at c15 on the whole the relative abundance of thaumarchaeota increased from 1 2 to 93 7 as latitude increased euryarchaeota showed the highest abundance in the bering sea among all three regions interestingly unclassified phyla 36 5 65 0 occupied a considerable fraction of archaeal communities in the bering sea and the bering strait but not in the western arctic ocean 3 4 correlation analysis between prokaryotes and environmental factors cca was performed at otu level and monte carlo permutation test were used to determine whether the environmental factors significantly affected prokaryotic community structure fig 5 the results of cca showed that the slected environmental variables together explained 37 2 of the observed bacterial commnuity variations fig 5a specifically depth r2 0 40 p 0 01 ph r2 0 57 p 0 01 no3 r2 0 42 p 0 05 toc r2 0 33 p 0 05 cu r2 0 73 p 0 001 zn r2 0 55 p 0 001 ni r2 0 76 p 0 001 pb r2 0 42 p 0 05 as r2 0 81 p 0 001 were major factors which strongly affected bacterial community structure while nh4 tic and cd had no significant influences on bacterial community table s4 environmental factors could explain more variations 65 8 of archaeal community compared with bacterial community fig 5b heavy metals such as cu r2 0 82 p 0 001 zn r2 0 64 p 0 001 ni r2 0 88 p 0 001 and as r2 0 91 p 0 001 have significant influences on archaeal community table s4 the results of vpa demonstrsated that heavy metals could independedtly account for 40 3 and 30 4 for archaeal and bacterial commuity variations respectively while physicochemical properties explained lower proportions archaeal commuity variations 29 3 figs 5d moreover 11 2 and 15 6 of bacterial and archaeal community variations were explained by physicochemical factors and heavy metals together the correlation between abundant prokaryotes and environmental factors were estimated by spearman correlation analysis at phylum level figs 5e and 5f table s5 the results as shown in table s5 also indicated that heavy metals such as cu zn ni pb and as had significantly positive effects on gammaproteobacteria r 0 51 0 82 and thaumarchaeota r 0 73 0 89 while firmicutes r 0 49 and 0 54 only positively correlated with ni and as conversely cu ni and as exhibited significant negative effects on alphaproteobacteria r 0 60 0 69 bacteroidetes r 0 61 0 79 verrucomicrobia r 0 50 0 59 and crenarchaeota r 0 71 0 81 3 5 distinct bacterial and archaeal biomarkers in these three regions enriched prokaryotic biomarkers for each region were analyzed by lefse as shown in fig 6 based on our dataset total 48 bacterial and 36 archaeal clades exhibited statistically significantly enriched among three marine regions with the lda threshold of 4 0 table s6 briefly lefse separately detected 14 12 and 22 bacterial taxa showed statistically significant and biologically consistent differences in the bering sea the bering strait and the western arctic ocean and 21 4 and 10 archaeal taxa were distinguished from these regions as well four bacterial phyla were the significant populations bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia in the bering strait proteobacteria and firmicutes in the western arctic ocean but at class level epsilonproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria sub phylum level of proteobacteria in this study were the enriched populations in the bering sea but flavobacteriia and verrucomicrobiae were enriched in the bering strait gammaproteobacteria and bacilli were the biomarkers in the western arctic ocean fig 6a as for archaea crenarchaeota and aenigmarchaeota were enriched in the bering sea and euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota were significant enriched in the western arctic ocean while thermoprotei was the most differentially archaeal taxa in the bering sea and the western arctic ocean methanomicrobia was the obviously enriched population in the bering strait at class level fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 environmental characteristics of sediments and prokaryotic diversities sediments are recognized as the main reservoir in the marine environment and play irreplaceable roles in transporting and accumulating various of pollutants yan et al 2010 in marine environment the sources of heavy metals generally inputed by natural and anthropogenic activities mainy including freshwater input sewage discharge atmospheric deposition volcanic eruptions ocean currents and hydrothermal vents especially in the arctic ocean al ateeq et al 2014 aquilina et al 2014 chatterjee et al 2007 doney et al 2012 compared with our earlier study which sampled form bering sea and the chukchi sea during the 6th chinese national artic research expedition wang et al 2018 our findings in this study indicated that the contents of some heavy metals such as cu zn and cd significantly increased in the bering sea and the western arctic ocean on average moreover in this study compared with the bering sea and the bering strait we found that heavy metal contents were much higher in the western arctic ocean additionally compared with the latest study which focused on sediments of the southwestern chukchi sea sattarova et al 2022 higher contents of heavy metals such as zn pb and cd were detected in the bering sea and the bering strait of this study remarkably all heavy metal concentrations in the western arctic ocean were significantly higher than the southwestern chukchi sea and the eastern south pacific ocean chandia and salamanca 2012 moreover the concentrations of zn ni cd and as in the western arctic ocean were also higher than the pula bay croatia di cesare et al 2020 in addition considering the results which yield from assessment of heavy metal pollution based on erl or erm fig s3 the contents of ni and as in the bering sea and the bering strait and the heavy metal concentration of cu zn and as in the western arctic which represented a range with in which biological effects occur occasionally notably the contents of ni in the western arctic ocean were higher than erm level in most sites which represents a probable effect range with in which adverse biological effects frequently occur this finding was consistent with the results of an earlier study lu and kang 2018 zheng et al 2022 accordingly previous studies indicated that most metals transport from the bering sea and chukchi shelf to the western arctic ocean khim et al 2018 kondo et al 2016 this can be explained by several aspects as following 1 the increasing anthropogenic activities associated with growing industries within boundary of the arctic areas including hydrocarbon exploration sites and mines 2 the arctic ocean is considered a sink for global pollution because of the flow of oceanic and atmospheric currents it is a delicate ecosystem exposed by land based sources of pollution particularly heavy metals kahkashan et al 2019 3 atmosphere seawater exchange is the main process that controls the residence time and levels of contaminant in the arctic ocean ji et al 2019 moreover the atmospheric pathway is the quickest and most direct way for long range pollutant transportation e g pollutants can be transported from distant sources to the arctic ocean within several days or weeks shevchenko et al 2003 also of concern is the fact that the melting of contaminated ice may lead to more pollutant emission into the arctic ocean with rapid warming of the global climate which intensified the input of metal ions in polar oceans ji et al 2019 generally the increasingly discharge of contaminants through anthropogenic inputs runoff from adjacent lands atmospheric deposition and natural emission have leaded to the shift the benthic environment additionally we also found that the concentrations of nh4 and toc were several folds higher than our early study wang et al 2018 and higher contents of nh4 and toc were detected in the bering sea and the bering strait than western arctic ocean this because as the impact of the surrounding industrial regions such as japan china and alaska which caused large amounts of organic matter runoff from the industrialized areas to move toward the bering sea and the bering strait t cai et al 2012 kahkashan et al 2019 compared with our previous research which carried in the 6th chinese national artic research expedition our results also showed that the lowest prokaryotic richness and diversity were detected in the western arctic ocean however both bacterial and archaeal diversities in bering sea and the western arctic ocean significantly increased here wang et al 2018 for example in the bering sea chao1 indices of bacteria and archaea were at the range of 1047 1824 and 464 809 respectively but they were only 391 501 and 73 124 in our earlier study similar results were also observed for otu numbers and shannon indices all of the different results we obtained from present study suggested that environmental change would lower prokaryotic diversity and richness our findings were well consisted with previous study which focused on heavy metal impacted prokaryotic assemblages in polluted sediments quero et al 2015 tangherlini et al 2020 4 2 effects of environmental factors on prokaryotic community figuring out what and how environmental factors affect microorganisms is crucial to understand microbial response to environmental change as the most persistent environmental contaminants rousk and rousk 2018 we found that the contents of heavy metals had strong correlation with prokaryotic diversity and could explain large proportion of prokaryotic community variation kruskal wallis test indicated that there were no significant differences in prokaryotic diversity between the bering sea and the bering strait figs 2c 2f that was accordance with that no significant differences of heavy metal contents between these two regions table s2 previous studies indicated that heavy metals had significant impacts on microbial composition and geographic distribution hu et al 2021 quero et al 2015 we found that gammaproteobacteria firmicutes and thaumarchaeota had positive correlation with the contents of heavy metals and their relative abundances increased with heavy metal concentrations fig 5 table s1 that phenomenon could be well explained by previous studies which indicated that gammaproteobacteria firmicutes and thaumarchaeota were highly resistant to heavy metals hu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 on the one hand moderate concentrations of metals are helpful to microorganism growth fulke et al 2020 some metals are required as enzyme cofactors for structural integrity or to provide screening of the electrostatic interactions in the aquatic ecosystems jaishankar et al 2014 petukh and alexov 2014 on the other hand once the contents of heavy metals exceed microbial affordable threshold values they become toxic for microbial populations zwolak 2015 for example high concentration of heavy metals have been documented to reduce 30 50 microbial diversity in previous studies fu et al 2016 johnston and roberts 2009 therefore the lowest bacterial and archaeal diversities in the western arctic ocean might related to the highest concentrations of heavy metals here since we found that prokaryotic diversities showed strong negative correlations with contents of heavy metals fig s2 the distance decay relationship is a fundamental pattern in ecology morlon et al 2011 zinger et al 2014 our results found that stronger distance decay pattern was observed in archaeal communities figs 3c and 3d this may be because more susceptible of archaea to heavy metals figs 5d and 5f table s5 resulting in the dramatic change of archaea composition such as thaumarchaeota and crenarchaeota since previous study indicated that organic or inorganic pollutants could contribute to the loss of specific prokaryotic taxa and then decrease community similarity in the sites showing higher contamination levels tangherlini et al 2020 this result was consistent with environmental factor change from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean especially for heavy metals fig s3 tables s1 and s3 furthermore this was also verified by relative low community dissimilarity between the bering sea and the bering strait where environmental heterogeneity was low that is because significant environmental heterogeneity among different regions may contribute to explain and further enhance the high turnover β diversity of the prokaryotic communities in sediments tangherlini et al 2020 because in addition to heavy metals the variables of depth ph no3 tic and toc were all significantly changed in most sites or regions table s2 furthermore vpa results indicated that physicochemical variables could independently explain considerable proportions about 30 of community variation in bacteria and archaea however the variation of the archaeal community explained by heavy metals alone was 10 higher than that in the bacterial counterpart figs 5c and 5d these results suggested that bacteria and archaea have different tolerance or adaptability to heavy metals similar to previous studies proteobacteria in the arctic marine sediments showed a dominant role over half of the bacterial proportion belonging to proteobacteria with a higher clade diversity including alpha gamma epsilon deltaproteobacteria and showed a well adaptive ability in the arctic ocean sediment li et al 2015 pedrós alió et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the response of different prokaryotes to heavy metals differed with the abundances of gammaproteobacteria firmicutes and thaumarchaeota showing increased tendency with heavy metals from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean while other bacterial and archaeal communities showed the opposite trend fig 4 and figs 5e and 5f this might be owning to differences in environmental adaptations cellular structure and cellular metabolisms among prokaryotic populations gao et al 2021 the different prokaryotic response and behavior between physicochemical variables and heavy metals remind us that heavy metals should be considered as important environmental factors when revealing the microbial community structure and distribution patterns in future research 4 3 distinct prokaryotes distribution and their ecological functions microorganisms are assumed present everywhere but affected by the environmental factors baas becking 1934 and drive many biogeochemical process they play significant roles in maintaining and regulating ecological stability due to their ecological functions liu et al 2015 lefse was used to discover the genetic species or functional characteristics of multiple groups of samples under different conditions that best explain the differences between groups and the extent to which these characteristics affect the differences between groups hu et al 2021 from the previous analysis it was clear that proteobacteria was the dominant phylum which with a high clade diversity yet the correlations between heavy metal concentrations and sub phylum of proteobacteria were reversed the abundance of gammaproteobacteria increased from the bering sea to the western arctic ocean fig 4 there were showed positive correlations between gammaproteobacteria and contents of cu zn ni pb as however reversed correlations were observed in alphaproteobacteria and epsilonproteobacteria which significantly enriched in the bering sea fig 5 tables s5 and s6 this shift can be explained by the fact that the phylotypes with heavy metal tolerance were selected while sensitive ones became less frequent singh et al 2014 additionally in the long term adaptive evolution these bacteria have diverse mechanisms that allow them to tolerate the presence of heavy metals haferburg and kothe 2007 ma et al 2016 proteobacteria and firmicutes has been reported to harbor the vast majority of heavy metal resistance genes chen et al 2018 yan et al 2020 which were significantly enriched in heavy metal contaminated area the western arctic ocean the adaptability of these bacterial tolerance to heavy metals may be related to their ability to utilize multiple c n and other energy sources in a complex survival mode bouskill et al 2010 for example genus pseudomonas belong to family pseudomonadaceae order pseudoalteromonas class gammaproteobacteria was reported that isolated from metal contaminated area had the abilities to counteract heavy metals huang et al 2016 phylum verrucomicrobia plays important roles in carbon cycling processes has been known to be present in a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems hu et al 2021 shen et al 2017 positively correlate with toc concentration fig 5e and table s5 it was significantly enriched in the bering strait fig 6 genus nitrosopumilus as one cluster of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa it contributes greatly to the ammonia oxidation process hu et al 2019 and enriched in the bering strait and the western arctic ocean fig 6b and table s6 and methanosarcinales play a central role in global carbon cycling due to its methanogenic function berger 2015 which was significantly enriched in the bering strait table s6 suggesting that the carbon cycling process was more activity in the bering strait since the highest concentration of toc were detected here previous study indicated that the exposure to metal pollution induced an increase in the proportion of euryarchaeota but lowered the proportion of thaumarchaeota in freshwater sediment guo et al 2019 however totally different trend was observed here in this study thaumarchaeota had significant positive correlation coefficients with heavy metals and largely enriched in the western arctic ocean fig 5f table s5 additionally heavy metals do also affect order nitrosopumilales and family nitrosopumilaceae in the western arctic ocean but euryarchaeota was only enriched in the bering strait this is understandable because a variety of thaumarchaeota can survive in heavy metal contaminated soil through a number of detoxification and metabolic mechanisms bartolucci et al 2013 sandaa et al 1999 while phyla crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota had a strong negative correlation with heavy metal concentrations including class thermoprotei class thermoplasmata order thermoproteales order methanomassiliicoccales and family thermofilaceae were enriched in bering sea or bering strait our results verified that heavy metals play an important role in shaping the sediment bacterial and archaeal distribution importantly microorganisms that can survive in environments with high heavy metal contamination have potential for use in the field of biomineralization and soil remediation and their resistance mechanisms are also worth investigating in further study 5 conclusions microbial diversity and distribution in marine sediment mainly shaped by various of environmental factors as persistent toxic pollutants we found that higher contents of heavy metals accumulated in the western arctic ocean than in the bering sea and bering strait and even some heavy metals exceed standard thresholds resulting in strong bacterial and archaeal community variability additionally the community composition and diversity of prokaryotes were found to be closely related to the contents of heavy metals besides stronger distance decay relationship occurred in archaeal community than that in bacterial community moreover due to the concentrations of heavy metals such as cu zn as and ni exceed erl or erm level which produced adverse biological effects on prokaryotic diversity occasionally or frequently occur in the western arctic ocean in addition heavy metals contributed to higher community variation in the archaea but not to the bacteria this work reminded us that heavy metals should be considered as important factors for microbial variation in

942,the physical disturbances of hydrodynamic conditions in shaping the seagrass meadows were studied in the vicinity of seagrass meadows over the south of port blair in the andaman and nicobar islands ani during the lifetime of cyclone lehar using spatial and temporal metrological oceanic parameters and in situ measurements a cyclonic depression formed on 23 november 2013 over the west coast of the malay peninsula and then transformed into a severe cyclone named lehar on 25th november 2013 it made its first landfall south of port blair in the ani and caused extensive damage to life and properties the present study made an attempt to investigate the hydrodynamic condition and their impact on the seagrass meadows during the lifetime of the cyclone the results revealed that the floristic composition of seagrass species such as thalassia hemperichii halodule pinnifolia and halodule uninervis was badly damaged due to the effect of the high gradient of velocities in the vertical direction turbulence high energetic waves and storm surge approximately 32 4 of the seagrass meadows were uprooted in haddo bay and 68 in sesostris bay of the south andaman islands a year after the cyclone passage december 2014 13 0 70 ha of the seagrass meadow in haddo bay and 44 5 0 30 ha of the seagrass in sesostris bay had recovered this study emphasises that the morphometric features of the most dominant species t hemperichii were regulated by the physical hydrodynamic mechanisms and led to substantial destruction in the study sites this study is very useful to understand the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on seagrass ecosystems during a cyclone and brings attention to the real time monitoring of seagrass ecosystems monitoring of the seagrass ecosystem can be further improved by predicting the behavioural dynamics of the marine ecosystem under the various scenarios of extreme weather conditions using high resolution numerical models it also helps to determine the appropriate management policy during extreme natural events keywords andaman and nicobar islands cyclone lehar gis hydrodynamic natural calamities seagrass 1 introduction cyclones are extreme events bringing strong winds heavy rains floods and storm surge along the coastal regions in recent decades the cyclone activity trend has gradually increased in terms of intensity the radius of maximum winds and radial distance and their impact is attributed to global warming and climate change emanuel 2005 murthy et al 2016 the andaman and nicobar islands ani are located in the bay of bengal north indian ocean and experience a high frequency of cyclones five times higher than in the arabian sea sahoo and bhaskaran 2015 murthy et al 2016 recent advancements in satellite technology have significantly improved tropical cyclone prediction in terms of track prediction landfall time and location joshi et al 1998 in addition to causing damage to infrastructure and loss of life cyclones can impact coastal ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and mangroves while crossing or making landfall seagrasses are marine angiosperms and form extensive meadows in the tidal and subtidal areas in the tropical and subtropical regions the global seagrass coverage is presently estimated to exceed 177 000 km2 green and short 2003 globally 13 genera and 60 species of seagrasses are reported in india the total seagrass cover is estimated at about 517 km2 geevarghese et al 2018 with major seagrass meadows along the southeast coast of india palk bay and gulf of mannar the ani in the bay of bengal the gulf of kachchh in the west coast and in lakshadweep islands in the arabian sea the indian coast has 30 61 of the total seagrass species with six genera and 15 species short and wyllie echeverria 1996 short et al 2007 with nine species reported from ani jagtap et al 2003 sachithanandam et al 2014 a few studies have been reported on the seagrass ecosystem over an area of 830 ha and their biomasses of about 860g m 2 in the ani india das 1996 jagtap et al 2003 kannan et al 1999 thangaradjou et al 2010 jagtap et al 2003 reported that the dense seagrass ecosystems with 9 8 and 4 species are in the ani lakshadweep islands and gujarat regions respectively the diversity of seagrass species increased by region with the most recent number of species being 11 10 6 and 5 for ani lakshadweep gujarat and odisha respectively immanuel et al 2016 priyadarsini et al 2014 mahapatro et al 2014 a recent study estimated seagrass coverage in the ani to be about 2 943 38 ha using a geospatial approach nobi et al 2013 the scientific literature clearly indicated that several authors reported on floristic diversity aerial distribution biomass general ecosystem services species specific ecosystem services and seed dispersion but hydrodynamic conditions off the indian coast during extreme weather events have not been studied effectively seagrass ecosystems are important to local fisheries and as a habitat for endangered mammal species such as the sea cow dugong dugon and sea turtles olive ridley green turtles seagrass meadows provide habitat spawning grounds and nursery areas for a variety of marine organisms as well as important food sources for larger animals like sea turtles and sea cows the primary productivity of seagrass species has been estimated between 0 1 and 8 5g of carbon per day jagtap et al 2003 sachithanandam et al 2014 seagrass meadows are also involved in the cycling of nutrients in their environment fonseca and cahalan s 1992 study highlighted that the wave energy reduction of about 40 per metre of seagrass meadows was observed when the length of the seagrass meadows was equal to the water depth seagrass meadows are also believed to reduce wave energy fonseca and cahalan 1992 infantes et al 2012 de boever 2018 oprandi et al 2020 and hence become important in controlling coastal erosion james et al 2020 flow within the seagrass meadows presents a unique situation where individual plants can sway with the flow ackerman okubo 1993 grizzle et al 1996 thereby reducing frictional drag heller 1987 found that the reduction of flow velocities within the seagrass canopy is a function of current speed wave frequency distance into the meadow and seagrass species seagrass lose its effectiveness in reducing wave energy as the water depth increases over the canopy height fonseca and cahalan 1992 elginoz et al 2011 the minimum and maximum water depths at which seagrass can be found as determined by wave orbital velocity tide and light are considered to be important factors paul et al 2012 weitzman et al 2015 carr et al 2016 luhar et al 2017 reidenbach and thomas 2018 factors such as maximum and minimum current velocity pose other thresholds like growth and primary production rate jiménez ramos et al 2018 the potential wave energy reduction depends upon the ranges of water depth and the size and cover of seagrass meadows of the seagrass plants seagrass meadows change the current speed and pattern when the flow is within them the horizontal spatial distribution of plants has a profound effect on the flow field wave characteristics and sediment transport during the high energy period harlin et al 1982 fonseca 1992 however the effect of sediment transport is not yet clear due to the horizontal structure and plant distribution in the meadows under different flow regimes thus the seagrass ecosystem plays a vital role in shore stabilization from erosion in the international context there are a few studies that discussed the loss recovery and restoration of the seagrass meadows over the different regions along the global coastal waters preen et al 1995 carlson et al 2010 côté laurin et al 2017 tan et al 2020 preen et al 1995 revealed that the seagrass meadows recovered in two years after passage of two major floods in the hervey bay due to the seed germination in the deeper water 10 m depth the present study also considered the studies of the great barrier reef gbr in queensland seagrass loss from cyclones and storms birch and birch 1984 campbell and mckenzie 2004 mckenzie et al 2011 carlson et al 2010 discussed the vulnerability and resilience of the seagrasses to the hurricane along florida s west coast they concluded that the category 1 3 tropical cyclones have a moderate impact on the seagrass ecosystems and are affected by the physical disturbances recovered in the less period compared to the other disturbances côté laurin et al 2017 studied the effect of the cyclone haruna on seagrasses in southwest madagascar and suggested monitoring the immediate impacts of an extreme cyclone disturbance on coastal ecosystems where local communities are highly dependent on seagrass meadows a variety of techniques such as seed based restoration of buoy deployed seeding dispenser injection seeding anchoring of shoots with iron nails and artificial in water structures are discussed for large scale restoration of the seagrass ecosystems tan et al 2020 these techniques will improve the efficiency cost effectiveness and scalability of restoration programs of the seagrass meadows under various weather conditions and climatic scenarios the seagrass meadows service becomes vital in the ani where the fringing reef environment is expected to experience the largest impact of extreme events and climate change especially in the low lying areas during low tide the present study considers the real time met ocean parameters recorded by the moored and wave rider buoys on the south andaman islands in the bay of bengal and the field collected seagrass data to reveal the disturbances of hydrodynamic conditions on the seagrass ecosystem and their role in damaging seagrass meadows on either side of the cyclone track of the severe cyclonic storm lehar this is the first of its kind attempt to study the cyclonic disturbances on seagrass ecosystems from the ani off the indian coast 2 study area the ani archipelago consists of 572 islands and islets in the bay of bengal 6 to 14 n 92 to 94 e to the eastern side of the indian mainland figure 1 it is a part of the indo myanmar and sundaland region davidar et al 1999 myers et al 2000 the ani has high biodiversity pristine beaches and diverse coastal ecosystems sachithanandam et al 2013 south andaman island is the southernmost island of the great andaman having a coastal length of 413 km and is the third largest island in the ani group the island has undulating topography with small terrain tracts and coastal low lying land as per the 2011 census the population of south andaman island was 237 586 census of india 2011 the coastal areas are having high population density due to their economic importance dharanirajan et al 2006 the climate is hot and humid with an average temperature ranging from 18 c to 36 c in ani rainfall occurs for eight months of a year with rainfall ranging from 3000 to 3500 mm sachithanandam et al 2020 the major economic activity in ani is fishing and tourism based on coastal ecosystem services which attract tourists from various parts of india and abroad according to a report by dakshin around 4 lakh tourists visited the islands in 2014 which is double the number of footfalls reported in 2011 the ani harbours diverse ecosystems such as tropical evergreen forests rocky and sandy beaches and diverse near shore marine ecosystems in marine ecosystems the seagrass meadows exist as patchy vegetation along the coast of haddo bay and sessostrios bay in south andaman island ragavan et al 2013 these sites are under pressure due to anthropogenic pressures and natural extreme events 3 a brief on cyclone lehar the cyclone lehar originated as a low pressure area in the south china sea on 18th november 2013 and intensified into a tropical depression off the west coast of the malay peninsula on 23rd november 2013 it strengthened into tropical cyclone lehar which moved over ani and towards the indian mainland figures 1a b two days later cyclone lehar caused high waves while crossing ani lashing the coastal area with a wind speed of 140 kph 86 1 mph on 25th november 2013 at 4 25 ist imd 2013 the cyclone crossed andaman nicobar islands ani between hut bay and long island 12 1 n 91 9 e and close to port blair it was the first severe cyclonic storm to cross ani after november 1989 the low lying areas of port blair were inundated with the intensive storm surge imd 2013 this storm surge caused damage to 35 houses 15 units of infrastructure 9 ha of plantation area 7 ha of forest area and 2 3 ha of sandy beaches in the south andaman yuvaraj et al 2015 lehar then emerged into the southeast bay of bengal gradually slowed down and moved towards the northwest coast of andhra pradesh making its second landfall near machilipatnam when the cyclone was traversing ani there was heavy to very heavy rainfall of around 25 cm at most places of south andaman a severe storm surge of about 1 1 5 m height inundated the low lying areas of ani yuvaraj et al 2015 cyclone lehar adversely impacted natural ecosystems such as forests mangroves seagrass meadows and sandy beaches sachithanandam et al 2014 yuvaraj et al 2015 apart from causing damage to infrastructure agriculture fields and plantations 4 data and methodology meteorological and marine oceanic data have numerous applications in the coastal areas to understand and assess the health of marine ecosystems during fair and extreme weather conditions the hydrodynamic conditions and their interaction with the marine ecosystem play a crucial role in the marine infrastructure and the natural shore defence system of the coastal regions therefore there is a need to understand the effect of the hydrodynamic conditions on the seagrass ecosystem the met oceanic parameters such as wind fields ocean currents and wave characteristics were analyzed during the pre during and post cyclonic periods of cyclone lehar along the coastal regions of the south andaman islands the continuous time series measurements of wind fields and wave parameters such as significant wave height and wave period were obtained using the moored buoy cb01 and wave ride buoy at selected locations of mahatma gandhi marine national park mgmnp wandoor and port blair respectively and are identified on the right side of the cyclone track in south andaman similarly the deep sea moored buoy bd12 deployed about 187 km away from port blair provided the wind fields and current measurements and is identified on the left side of the cyclone track figure 1b the maximum wind speed wave height and associated peak spectral wave period and storm surge are also estimated along the track during the lifetime of cyclone lehar a team of scientists from the national centre for sustainable coastal management ncscm carried out three field surveys over the south andaman islands in the month of october and november 2013 and december 2014 as part of the preparation of integration of island management plans iimps and the integrated coastal regulation zone icrz plans for ani the team surveyed the seagrass meadows patches in two areas namely haddo bay and sesostris bay of port blair in south andaman islands during october 2013 with the help of trimble juno 3b handheld gps which has the positional accuracy of 5m ensuring that the projection was set in utm zone 46n wgs84 datum in the gps setting the boundaries of seagrass meadows in the intertidal and subtidal zone and seagrass patches of haddo bay and sesostris bay were demarked as polygon shapefiles using mapping tools in the gps during the surveys the dense seagrass vegetation in the study areas was identified as belonging to three genera and six species of seagrasses namely h uninervis h pinnifolia h ovalis and t hemperichii figure 2 littoral environmental observations leo were conducted for the water levels and wave parameters such as wave height wave direction and wave period at 20 minute intervals for 8 hours during the day of the field surveys after the field survey the shapefiles were collected from the gps and overlaid on the satellite image using arcgis version 10 2 1 software the area of seagrass patches was estimated using the geometry tool in arcgis after the passage of cyclone lehar in november 2013 once again the team surveyed the seagrass meadows and prepared the polygon shapefiles of the seagrass meadows patches over the two regions the extent of damaged seagrass areas was estimated using the change detection technique in arcgis the understanding of physical mechanisms and dynamics of coastal regions depends upon the sea truth data of the atmosphere and ocean parameters there are various datasets such as reanalysis real time in situ measurements and field collected data that were analyzed during the lifetime of cyclone lehar the spatial wind fields data are obtained from national centre for environmental prediction global forecasting system ncep gfs analysis with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 and the information on wave characteristics from the operational european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmrwf analysis with a horizontal resolution of 12 5 km and circulation features eastward northward direction and depth variation currents from the 3 dimensional hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom 3d with the horizontal resolution of 9 5 km the real time data from the deployed deep water and shallow water buoys bd12 cs01 wave rider of the andaman nicobar islands are found to be immensely useful to monitor and predict the characteristics of a cyclone in terms of genesis formation and intensification and for studying the upwelling and nutrient dynamics along the coastal regions these moored buoys were installed by the national institute of ocean technology niot under the omni buoy program of the ministry of earth sciences in may 2011 these buoys measure both surface met ocean and subsurface oceanographic parameters with sensors fitted at specific levels they facilitate the subsurface current sensors to measure vertical profiles of horizontal currents up to 100 m depth from the surface in the water column they provide continuous time series measurements at fixed locations to understand the structure of water column circulation temperature salinity and wind speed over the region during normal and extreme weather conditions these moored buoys added great value to this study to understand the interaction between the water column circulation and seagrass meadows during the lifetime of cyclone lehar all the met ocean parameters were measured at the surface and subsurface levels using various sensors at different resolutions the data was transmitted via satellite every 3 h in real time for operational and research applications through the indian national centre for ocean information services incois hyderabad the wind speed had a resolution of 0 1 m s with an accuracy of 2 in the period of 3h and the direction was provided with 0 1 resolution with an accuracy of 1 5 4 the directional wave spectra had the resolution pitch and roll 0 001 heave 5 cm pitch and roll 0 05 heading 1 2 accuracy the ocean current had a velocity resolution of about 0 1 cm s and a direction 0 01 whereas the accuracy of 1 with direction 2 the physical mechanism of hydrodynamic conditions such as the gradient of horizontal flow movement in the vertical direction turbidity in the water column strong wave activity and surge are studied using the primitive equations of continuity and momentum in shallow water during the extreme weather conditions the gradient of horizontal momentum in the vertical direction and vertical flow conditions in the water column has been evaluated based on the das et al 2016 studies pradhan et al 2012 derived the empirical relation between maximum wind speed and central pressure drop in terms of maximum radial velocity using doppler weather radar dwr data for the coastal regions of india and also estimated the pressure drop in the eye of the cyclone and associated storm surge height the maximum wind speed around the eye of cyclone v m 1 v m 13 673

sanil kumar et al 2003 explained the wind and wave characteristics based on the 11 cyclones along the nagapattinam coast of tamil nadu india they derived the empirical relations relating wind speed wave height and wave period to the storm parameters and estimated the maximum significant wave height within the storm and its associated spectral peak period using young s model the results were compared with the hurricane wave prediction techniques provided in the manual of shore protection published by the us army corps of engineers in 1984 for all the cyclones the empirical formulae of

distribution of wind field before the landfall i e at 1800 utc of 24th november and after the landfall i e at 00utc of 25th nov 2013 the position of the cyclone eye and the mesoscale circulation features associated with the storm were more intensified over the south quadrant with a maximum surface wind speed of 24 m sec in the pre cyclone period the wind speed was about 8 m sec in the northeast direction and was in the eastward direction with a magnitude between 8 and 12 m sec over the north of the south andaman region in the post cyclone period on 25 november 2013 similarly the current speed varied between 0 6 0 8 m sec in the northeast direction of south andaman island the magnitude of the current varied between 1 0 1 2 m sec in the port blair region and was high at about 1 2 2 0 m sec in the north of the south andaman region the predominant direction of the currents is northward in the port blair region and is in the northwest direction over the other regions figures 3 d e f the wave characteristics such as significant wave height and wave period are observed and varied between 0 95 1 02 m and 5 7 5 9 sec respectively figure 4 in the port blair region the significant wave height was observed between 1 2 1 8 m with a period of 6 5 sec during the passage of the cyclone over the south andaman the real time measurements of buoys in shallow water cb01 at mgmnp and deep water location bd12 displayed the variable wind speed between 2 5 20 m sec and 2 5 18 m sec respectively during the lifetime of the cyclone figure 5 a wind direction during peak wind speed was southwest at the mgmnp cb01 location while it was in the northeast at the bd12 buoy location therefore these two buoys indicated the asymmetrical nature of the surface wind fields and revealed that wind intensity is high on the right side of the track during the passage of cyclone lehar figures 6 a b similarly the current speed varied between 0 2 0 8 m sec during the lifetime of the cyclone at the deepwater buoy bd12 location figures 5a 6c the predominant current direction is observed in the northeast and eastward direction whereas the peak current is observed in the northeast direction during the lifetime of the lehar cyclone figure 6c in addition to these measurements the significant wave height and its direction observed at port blair in south andaman varied between 0 5 to 3 m figures 5b table 1 the predominant wave direction in the northeast and the peak wave in the southeast direction were observed during the passage of the cyclone over the south andaman region figures 6d therefore the in situ observations clearly showed that the variations in hydrodynamic parameters are significant on the right side of the track during the landfall of cyclone lehar over south andaman island the analysis of the leo observations at the two sites indicated the water levels varied between 0 7 m to 1 2 m during low and high tide periods and wave height varied between 0 1 m and 0 5 m in the northeast direction with a period of 6 8 sec the significant wave height mean wave period and storm surge were calculated along the cyclone track using the empirical formulations and cyclone track data during the lehar cyclone table 1 in the pre and post cyclone period the wave height varied between 0 5 1 2 m in the south andaman islands during the cyclonic period the wave height varied between 2 5 14 m and the surge was 1 15 m along the track during the landfall over the south andaman islands table 1 figure 7 explained the variation of horizontal current speed in the vertical direction on either side of the track of cyclone lehar the gradient velocity is observed high on the right side of the track figure 7a compared to the left side of the track figure 7b 5 2 impact of seagrass ecosystem during extreme conditions in ani seagrass ecosystems are densely populated in the little andaman and in the south andamans the south andaman islands especially the mgmnp region and the havelock and neil islands are densely populated with seagrass vegetation in their near shore coastal regions savurirajan et al 2015 several researchers have reported seagrass biodiversity during the normal weather conditions and their seasonal dynamics the team reported that three genera and four species viz h uninervis h pinnifolia h ovalis and t hemperichii from the dense seagrass vegetation in both sites in the pre and post cyclonic period the morphometric measurements root system and iucn status were reviewed and compared with other regions for further confirmation of identification the details are given in table 3 during the early stage of cyclone formation in october 2013 the extent of seagrass meadows was mapped the estimated distribution of seagrass meadows before the lehar cyclone was 7 14 ha at haddo bay figure 8 a and 1 16 ha at sesostris bay figure 9 a the survey after the passage of cyclone lehar was carried out on 30th november 2013 post cyclone period over the same regions and the estimated seagrass area was found to be approximately 4 84 ha in haddo bay figure 8b and 0 37 ha in sesostris bay figure 9b indicating a reduction in 32 in haddo bay and 68 in sesostris bay these results indicated that strong physical mechanisms influenced the seagrass meadows in sesostris bay more than in haddo bay this loss in seagrass cover could temporarily impact the endangered animals such as sea cow sea turtles that are dependent on seagrass ecosystems and other seagrass associated flora and fauna until the recovery of seagrass after a year of the cyclone passage a field survey was conducted in december 2014 to estimate the recovery of the seagrass meadows in the cyclone affected areas figures 8c and 9c the recovery of seagrass meadows was observed at about 1 02 ha in the study sites however the recovery of seagrass meadows is more in sesostris bay 44 5 compared to haddo bay 13 6 discussions seagrass is one of the most productive ecosystems in coastal areas it is sensitive to the natural calamities such as cyclones seismic waves shoreline changes sedimentation nutrient run off and algal blooms myers et al 2000 jagtap et al 2003 nobi et al 2013 in india the decline of seagrass areas is reported in many studies with most attributed reasons being anthropogenic but there have been no studies on the impact of physical mechanisms on the seagrass ecosystems during extreme events such as cyclones and floods this study explored the impact of such an extreme event cyclone lehar on the seagrass meadows in south andaman cyclone lehar hit the coastal regions of south andaman on 25th november 2013 with high intensity of wind fields strong waves cyclonic currents and a storm surge sachithanandam et al 2014 yuvaraj et al 2015 before the tropical cyclone formation the wind induced waves and currents were observed insignificant over the seagrass meadows the drag force between the seagrass meadows and the horizontal movement of water mass over the seagrass meadows lead to wave attenuation and reduction in current speed within the seagrass system moki et al 2020 monismith et al 2019 the disturbances in the seagrass meadows during the passage of the cyclone have been analysed with the help of similar studies preen et al 1995 campbell and mckenzie 2004 carlson et al 2010 côté laurin et al 2017 tan et al 2020 along the world s coastal water during the period of the intensified cyclone the wind speed intensified from 18 to 24 m sec and the corresponding wave height and currents raised between 2 5m and 1 5m sec respectively table 2 and figures 3 and 4 the increased wind speed wave height and currents led to strong vertical mixing and turbidity near the coastal areas of south andaman figure 8 the observational analysis data clearly indicated that the strong differential horizontal velocity of water masses 60 cm sec and high vertical velocity 30 cm sec as well as other mechanisms such as cyclone induced cross shore currents sediment transport rate 0 1078 kg s m sediment deposition from drainage discharge due to heavy rainfall and resuspension of the sediments due to high wave activity are the major factors causing damage to the seagrass distribution in haddo bay and sesostris bay of south andaman island high vertical velocity churning due to the turbulence and turbidity of the water masses 7 4 kg m3 are major responses to the uprooting and burying of seagrass plants on either side of the cyclone track sachithanandam et al 2014 the storm surge along the track varied between 1 15 and 2 47 m during the landfall of cyclone lehar over ani and was estimated at about 1 75 m at landfall time due to the high wave action cross shore currents and storm surge most of the sandy beaches were severely eroded by about 1 1 3 m depth of sediments along the coastal beaches of carbyn s cove wandoor and chidyatapu of south andaman yuvaraj et al 2015 seagrass communities depend on the seagrass meadow type structure and coastal morphology i e rock sandy and mud properties table 2 dense seagrass meadows can grow mainly in muddy regions with less wave action the soil texture and composition of the study sites haddo bay and sesosistor bay are observed as muddy and silty the storm induced waves currents sediment transport and turbidity affected approximately 8 3 ha of the total seagrass area in the south andaman islands this is the first ever study attempted in the tropical island ecosystem of andaman and nicobar in the context of indian coastal waters including the andaman and nicobar islands the studies on the hydrodynamic response over the seagrass meadows were very limited due to the scarcity of monitoring data however we provided some of the international work to support the present study serra et al 2020 gonzález ortiz et al 2014 the uprooted buried and damaged seagrass area was about 3 09 ha of the total covered seagrass areas in the haddo bay and sesostris bay of the south andaman the most damaged species were identified as t hemperichii h pinnifolia and h uninervis in that order in the study sites in haddo bay the seagrass locations are close to the open sea having high waves and currents which are immediately transferred to the nearshore causing more impact on the seagrass ecosystem in the case of sesostris bay the seagrass ecosystem is less impacted by cyclone lehar due to sheltering by the adjoining ross island in addition to these parameters the sediments and freshwater runoff from the landward side during the landfall of the cyclone have also affected the seagrass meadow ecosystem by sediment lodging over the seagrass meadows preen and marsh 1995 campbell and mckenzie 2004 after a year of the cyclonic event the coverage of the seagrass meadows was surveyed and observed the recovery of the seagrass meadows of about 1 02 ha in haddo bay 0 72 ha and sesostris bay 0 30 ha the specific morphometric measurements i e blade width and roots system play a vital role in the hydrodynamic environment during normal weather and extreme conditions peralta et al 2008 and are more effective for shore stability in a medium current regime 0 23 0 40 m sec fonseca and cabalan 1992 morphological features of the dominant seagrass species such as h uninervis h ovalis and t hemperichii over the two sites of the study region have changed the hydrodynamic environment vanderklift et al 2016 sachithanandma et al 2014 fonseca and cahalan 1992 the dimensions of the seagrass plant t hemperichii in terms of leave length width and root density are large compared to the other seagrass plants table 2 the hydrodynamic response over the t hemperichii and other seagrass species has been observed over the study region using the littoral environmental observations leo which were conducted before and after the passage of cyclone lehar the hydrodynamic responses over the t hemperichii species were observed in very low wave height 0 1 m current speed 0 14 m sec and sediment transport rate 2 76 10 4 kg s m and turbidity 2 2 10 6 kg m3 compared to the other species of seagrass meadows over the study regions during the field survey t hemperichii meadows were observed as the dominant species in the study sites this species could be played a major role to attenuate the wave energy along the position of the site reidenbach and thomas 2018 john et al 2016 the recovery of the seagrass meadows depends upon specific physical and biological mechanisms the biological mechanisms play a crucial role in seagrass recovery along with physical mechanisms some of the significant biological mechanisms such as seagrass regrowth from fragments of plants that are adverted into the area recovery from seed banks and vegetative growth by seagrass meadow remains for rhizomes to colonise vanderklift et al 2016 the effects of both mechanisms may play a significant role to improve the recovery of seagrass meadows distribution in the two sites in general along the indian coast the seagrass meadow cover and growth are high during the post monsoon season whereas the growth is minimal during the summer season in the context of the andaman and nicobar islands coastal regions the studies on the natural variability of seagrass cover on inter annual and annual scales were very limited due to the scarcity of seagrass monitoring data it made limited to provide a detailed discussion on the natural variability of the seagrass meadows at the study sites dilipan et al 2020 ramesh and mohanraju 2020 however in the present study three field surveys were conducted to estimate the seagrass meadows cover during 2013 2014 at the two sites the annual change of seagrass meadows cover over the study sites is about 1 19 ha and the recovery rate from the storm impact is about 0 23 ha the storm impact is estimated approximately at 32 4 of the seagrass meadows in haddo bay and 68 in sesostris bay of the south andaman islands the annual estimations of the seagrass meadows indicated that the recovery of seagrass meadows from the storm impact is about 13 0 70 ha in haddo bay and 44 5 0 30 ha in sesostris bay similar assessment studies have been observed in different regions such as the san juan archipelago washington south bay virginia and hokkaido island japan and along the global coastal water lacy and wyllie echeverria 2011 hansen and reidenbach 2013 moki et al 2020 however during the passage of the cyclone these seagrass species are unable to withstand the strong action of waves gradient velocity of currents and turbidity 1 4m of wave height 0 9 m sec current speed and 7 4 kg m3 respectively therefore the seagrass meadows were uprooted over the two sites of the study region this loss of seagrass ecosystems results in the reduction of services for the fishing community and marine mammals such as sea cows and turtles this also causes to increase the coastal erosion and turbidity and leads to an impact on the primary producers in these regions in the present study we observed that the spatial area of the seagrass meadow that recovered after the cyclone was 3 4 times greater in sesostris bay compared to haddo bay this difference in the recovery of the seagrass meadow was most likely due to higher water quality within sesostris bay franklin et al 2018 jha et al 2015 therefore the statement of carlson et al 2010 seagrass meadows recovery takes less period due to physical disturbance compared to anthropogenic disturbances is clearly noticed in the present study authors preen et al 1995 carlson et al 2010 côté laurin et al 2017 tan et al 2020 discussed the failure of the recovery of the seagrass ecosystem after the passage of the tropical cyclones due to various mechanisms however the countries such as australia and new zealand provided a good lesson to restore the disturbed seagrass ecosystem systems through various techniques after extreme weather conditions i e tropical cyclones the indian government has implemented various notifications rules acts under the water prevention control of pollution act 1974 and environment protection act 1986 for the management and conservation of coastal waters the ministry of environment forests and climate change moef cc is regulating and ensuring environmental protection and issued the crz notification 2011 the present legal framework for coastal zone management is robust enough to achieve its objectives of protection of the livelihoods of traditional fisherfolk communities preservation of coastal ecology and promotion of necessary economic activity in coastal regions in addition the national environmental policy 2006 linked coastal issues to protecting fragile ecosystems like coral reefs and mangroves but not seagrass meadows recently the national policy of marine fisheries 2017 highlighted the seagrass ecosystem s importance along with the existing ecosystems coral and mangroves seagrass meadows are listed under the ecological sensitive areas esas and are classified under the crz 1a category as per the crz notification 2011 although there are many clauses in different laws and acts such as the wildlife p act 1972 and crz notification under the environment p act 1986 and biodiversity act 2002 shall be used to protect seagrass ecosystems with community participation for the conservation of esas however special attention could be considered to monitoring the immediate impacts of an extreme cyclone disturbance on coastal ecosystems and can be framed as policy action for the restoration of seagrass ecosystem using various restoration techniques which proven scientifically this is the first kind of report on the impact of an extreme event on seagrass meadows in indian regions on analysing how the physical mechanisms influenced to uproot of the seagrass meadows this study emphasises the importance of developing innovative seagrass conservation and management plan to safeguard seagrass ecosystems during severe weather conditions the study will be expanded in the future to include real time monitoring of the seagrass ecosystem in terms of abundance cover density and or biomass extent and species composition through field surveys and the configuration of high resolution numerical models for forecasting ocean state and identifying the health of seagrass habitats 7 conclusions we examined the effect of the cyclone lehar cyclone on the seagrass ecosystem in the south andaman islands of ani as a case study the hydrodynamic environment during the lifetime of cyclone lehar was studied with respect to coastal circulation features wave characteristics and storm surge before during and after the cyclone period over south andaman island the important parameters such as significant wave height currents turbidity and storm surge were observed at about 2 5 m 1 2 m sec and 2 47 m respectively at the time of landfall over south andaman island in this highly disturbing hydrodynamic environment the seagrass meadows of the study areas such as haddo bay and sesostris bay were uprooted due to the strong currents 0 9 m sec with the association of high magnitude waves about 2 5 m turbidity and surge 2 75 m over the coastal regions seagrass ecosystems do not acquire much attention in indian scientific research studies and coastal management plans when compared to other coastal ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs the present work suggests that in future seagrass meadows should be monitored regularly to evaluate changes through in situ and geospatial approaches to ensure that appropriate conservation and management measures are applied the results of this study assume importance in the present scenario of climate change during which storms of increasing intensity have been predicted which can have a considerable adverse impact on coastal ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement v sachithanandam conceptualization formal analysis methodology

942,the physical disturbances of hydrodynamic conditions in shaping the seagrass meadows were studied in the vicinity of seagrass meadows over the south of port blair in the andaman and nicobar islands ani during the lifetime of cyclone lehar using spatial and temporal metrological oceanic parameters and in situ measurements a cyclonic depression formed on 23 november 2013 over the west coast of the malay peninsula and then transformed into a severe cyclone named lehar on 25th november 2013 it made its first landfall south of port blair in the ani and caused extensive damage to life and properties the present study made an attempt to investigate the hydrodynamic condition and their impact on the seagrass meadows during the lifetime of the cyclone the results revealed that the floristic composition of seagrass species such as thalassia hemperichii halodule pinnifolia and halodule uninervis was badly damaged due to the effect of the high gradient of velocities in the vertical direction turbulence high energetic waves and storm surge approximately 32 4 of the seagrass meadows were uprooted in haddo bay and 68 in sesostris bay of the south andaman islands a year after the cyclone passage december 2014 13 0 70 ha of the seagrass meadow in haddo bay and 44 5 0 30 ha of the seagrass in sesostris bay had recovered this study emphasises that the morphometric features of the most dominant species t hemperichii were regulated by the physical hydrodynamic mechanisms and led to substantial destruction in the study sites this study is very useful to understand the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on seagrass ecosystems during a cyclone and brings attention to the real time monitoring of seagrass ecosystems monitoring of the seagrass ecosystem can be further improved by predicting the behavioural dynamics of the marine ecosystem under the various scenarios of extreme weather conditions using high resolution numerical models it also helps to determine the appropriate management policy during extreme natural events keywords andaman and nicobar islands cyclone lehar gis hydrodynamic natural calamities seagrass 1 introduction cyclones are extreme events bringing strong winds heavy rains floods and storm surge along the coastal regions in recent decades the cyclone activity trend has gradually increased in terms of intensity the radius of maximum winds and radial distance and their impact is attributed to global warming and climate change emanuel 2005 murthy et al 2016 the andaman and nicobar islands ani are located in the bay of bengal north indian ocean and experience a high frequency of cyclones five times higher than in the arabian sea sahoo and bhaskaran 2015 murthy et al 2016 recent advancements in satellite technology have significantly improved tropical cyclone prediction in terms of track prediction landfall time and location joshi et al 1998 in addition to causing damage to infrastructure and loss of life cyclones can impact coastal ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and mangroves while crossing or making landfall seagrasses are marine angiosperms and form extensive meadows in the tidal and subtidal areas in the tropical and subtropical regions the global seagrass coverage is presently estimated to exceed 177 000 km2 green and short 2003 globally 13 genera and 60 species of seagrasses are reported in india the total seagrass cover is estimated at about 517 km2 geevarghese et al 2018 with major seagrass meadows along the southeast coast of india palk bay and gulf of mannar the ani in the bay of bengal the gulf of kachchh in the west coast and in lakshadweep islands in the arabian sea the indian coast has 30 61 of the total seagrass species with six genera and 15 species short and wyllie echeverria 1996 short et al 2007 with nine species reported from ani jagtap et al 2003 sachithanandam et al 2014 a few studies have been reported on the seagrass ecosystem over an area of 830 ha and their biomasses of about 860g m 2 in the ani india das 1996 jagtap et al 2003 kannan et al 1999 thangaradjou et al 2010 jagtap et al 2003 reported that the dense seagrass ecosystems with 9 8 and 4 species are in the ani lakshadweep islands and gujarat regions respectively the diversity of seagrass species increased by region with the most recent number of species being 11 10 6 and 5 for ani lakshadweep gujarat and odisha respectively immanuel et al 2016 priyadarsini et al 2014 mahapatro et al 2014 a recent study estimated seagrass coverage in the ani to be about 2 943 38 ha using a geospatial approach nobi et al 2013 the scientific literature clearly indicated that several authors reported on floristic diversity aerial distribution biomass general ecosystem services species specific ecosystem services and seed dispersion but hydrodynamic conditions off the indian coast during extreme weather events have not been studied effectively seagrass ecosystems are important to local fisheries and as a habitat for endangered mammal species such as the sea cow dugong dugon and sea turtles olive ridley green turtles seagrass meadows provide habitat spawning grounds and nursery areas for a variety of marine organisms as well as important food sources for larger animals like sea turtles and sea cows the primary productivity of seagrass species has been estimated between 0 1 and 8 5g of carbon per day jagtap et al 2003 sachithanandam et al 2014 seagrass meadows are also involved in the cycling of nutrients in their environment fonseca and cahalan s 1992 study highlighted that the wave energy reduction of about 40 per metre of seagrass meadows was observed when the length of the seagrass meadows was equal to the water depth seagrass meadows are also believed to reduce wave energy fonseca and cahalan 1992 infantes et al 2012 de boever 2018 oprandi et al 2020 and hence become important in controlling coastal erosion james et al 2020 flow within the seagrass meadows presents a unique situation where individual plants can sway with the flow ackerman okubo 1993 grizzle et al 1996 thereby reducing frictional drag heller 1987 found that the reduction of flow velocities within the seagrass canopy is a function of current speed wave frequency distance into the meadow and seagrass species seagrass lose its effectiveness in reducing wave energy as the water depth increases over the canopy height fonseca and cahalan 1992 elginoz et al 2011 the minimum and maximum water depths at which seagrass can be found as determined by wave orbital velocity tide and light are considered to be important factors paul et al 2012 weitzman et al 2015 carr et al 2016 luhar et al 2017 reidenbach and thomas 2018 factors such as maximum and minimum current velocity pose other thresholds like growth and primary production rate jiménez ramos et al 2018 the potential wave energy reduction depends upon the ranges of water depth and the size and cover of seagrass meadows of the seagrass plants seagrass meadows change the current speed and pattern when the flow is within them the horizontal spatial distribution of plants has a profound effect on the flow field wave characteristics and sediment transport during the high energy period harlin et al 1982 fonseca 1992 however the effect of sediment transport is not yet clear due to the horizontal structure and plant distribution in the meadows under different flow regimes thus the seagrass ecosystem plays a vital role in shore stabilization from erosion in the international context there are a few studies that discussed the loss recovery and restoration of the seagrass meadows over the different regions along the global coastal waters preen et al 1995 carlson et al 2010 côté laurin et al 2017 tan et al 2020 preen et al 1995 revealed that the seagrass meadows recovered in two years after passage of two major floods in the hervey bay due to the seed germination in the deeper water 10 m depth the present study also considered the studies of the great barrier reef gbr in queensland seagrass loss from cyclones and storms birch and birch 1984 campbell and mckenzie 2004 mckenzie et al 2011 carlson et al 2010 discussed the vulnerability and resilience of the seagrasses to the hurricane along florida s west coast they concluded that the category 1 3 tropical cyclones have a moderate impact on the seagrass ecosystems and are affected by the physical disturbances recovered in the less period compared to the other disturbances côté laurin et al 2017 studied the effect of the cyclone haruna on seagrasses in southwest madagascar and suggested monitoring the immediate impacts of an extreme cyclone disturbance on coastal ecosystems where local communities are highly dependent on seagrass meadows a variety of techniques such as seed based restoration of buoy deployed seeding dispenser injection seeding anchoring of shoots with iron nails and artificial in water structures are discussed for large scale restoration of the seagrass ecosystems tan et al 2020 these techniques will improve the efficiency cost effectiveness and scalability of restoration programs of the seagrass meadows under various weather conditions and climatic scenarios the seagrass meadows service becomes vital in the ani where the fringing reef environment is expected to experience the largest impact of extreme events and climate change especially in the low lying areas during low tide the present study considers the real time met ocean parameters recorded by the moored and wave rider buoys on the south andaman islands in the bay of bengal and the field collected seagrass data to reveal the disturbances of hydrodynamic conditions on the seagrass ecosystem and their role in damaging seagrass meadows on either side of the cyclone track of the severe cyclonic storm lehar this is the first of its kind attempt to study the cyclonic disturbances on seagrass ecosystems from the ani off the indian coast 2 study area the ani archipelago consists of 572 islands and islets in the bay of bengal 6 to 14 n 92 to 94 e to the eastern side of the indian mainland figure 1 it is a part of the indo myanmar and sundaland region davidar et al 1999 myers et al 2000 the ani has high biodiversity pristine beaches and diverse coastal ecosystems sachithanandam et al 2013 south andaman island is the southernmost island of the great andaman having a coastal length of 413 km and is the third largest island in the ani group the island has undulating topography with small terrain tracts and coastal low lying land as per the 2011 census the population of south andaman island was 237 586 census of india 2011 the coastal areas are having high population density due to their economic importance dharanirajan et al 2006 the climate is hot and humid with an average temperature ranging from 18 c to 36 c in ani rainfall occurs for eight months of a year with rainfall ranging from 3000 to 3500 mm sachithanandam et al 2020 the major economic activity in ani is fishing and tourism based on coastal ecosystem services which attract tourists from various parts of india and abroad according to a report by dakshin around 4 lakh tourists visited the islands in 2014 which is double the number of footfalls reported in 2011 the ani harbours diverse ecosystems such as tropical evergreen forests rocky and sandy beaches and diverse near shore marine ecosystems in marine ecosystems the seagrass meadows exist as patchy vegetation along the coast of haddo bay and sessostrios bay in south andaman island ragavan et al 2013 these sites are under pressure due to anthropogenic pressures and natural extreme events 3 a brief on cyclone lehar the cyclone lehar originated as a low pressure area in the south china sea on 18th november 2013 and intensified into a tropical depression off the west coast of the malay peninsula on 23rd november 2013 it strengthened into tropical cyclone lehar which moved over ani and towards the indian mainland figures 1a b two days later cyclone lehar caused high waves while crossing ani lashing the coastal area with a wind speed of 140 kph 86 1 mph on 25th november 2013 at 4 25 ist imd 2013 the cyclone crossed andaman nicobar islands ani between hut bay and long island 12 1 n 91 9 e and close to port blair it was the first severe cyclonic storm to cross ani after november 1989 the low lying areas of port blair were inundated with the intensive storm surge imd 2013 this storm surge caused damage to 35 houses 15 units of infrastructure 9 ha of plantation area 7 ha of forest area and 2 3 ha of sandy beaches in the south andaman yuvaraj et al 2015 lehar then emerged into the southeast bay of bengal gradually slowed down and moved towards the northwest coast of andhra pradesh making its second landfall near machilipatnam when the cyclone was traversing ani there was heavy to very heavy rainfall of around 25 cm at most places of south andaman a severe storm surge of about 1 1 5 m height inundated the low lying areas of ani yuvaraj et al 2015 cyclone lehar adversely impacted natural ecosystems such as forests mangroves seagrass meadows and sandy beaches sachithanandam et al 2014 yuvaraj et al 2015 apart from causing damage to infrastructure agriculture fields and plantations 4 data and methodology meteorological and marine oceanic data have numerous applications in the coastal areas to understand and assess the health of marine ecosystems during fair and extreme weather conditions the hydrodynamic conditions and their interaction with the marine ecosystem play a crucial role in the marine infrastructure and the natural shore defence system of the coastal regions therefore there is a need to understand the effect of the hydrodynamic conditions on the seagrass ecosystem the met oceanic parameters such as wind fields ocean currents and wave characteristics were analyzed during the pre during and post cyclonic periods of cyclone lehar along the coastal regions of the south andaman islands the continuous time series measurements of wind fields and wave parameters such as significant wave height and wave period were obtained using the moored buoy cb01 and wave ride buoy at selected locations of mahatma gandhi marine national park mgmnp wandoor and port blair respectively and are identified on the right side of the cyclone track in south andaman similarly the deep sea moored buoy bd12 deployed about 187 km away from port blair provided the wind fields and current measurements and is identified on the left side of the cyclone track figure 1b the maximum wind speed wave height and associated peak spectral wave period and storm surge are also estimated along the track during the lifetime of cyclone lehar a team of scientists from the national centre for sustainable coastal management ncscm carried out three field surveys over the south andaman islands in the month of october and november 2013 and december 2014 as part of the preparation of integration of island management plans iimps and the integrated coastal regulation zone icrz plans for ani the team surveyed the seagrass meadows patches in two areas namely haddo bay and sesostris bay of port blair in south andaman islands during october 2013 with the help of trimble juno 3b handheld gps which has the positional accuracy of 5m ensuring that the projection was set in utm zone 46n wgs84 datum in the gps setting the boundaries of seagrass meadows in the intertidal and subtidal zone and seagrass patches of haddo bay and sesostris bay were demarked as polygon shapefiles using mapping tools in the gps during the surveys the dense seagrass vegetation in the study areas was identified as belonging to three genera and six species of seagrasses namely h uninervis h pinnifolia h ovalis and t hemperichii figure 2 littoral environmental observations leo were conducted for the water levels and wave parameters such as wave height wave direction and wave period at 20 minute intervals for 8 hours during the day of the field surveys after the field survey the shapefiles were collected from the gps and overlaid on the satellite image using arcgis version 10 2 1 software the area of seagrass patches was estimated using the geometry tool in arcgis after the passage of cyclone lehar in november 2013 once again the team surveyed the seagrass meadows and prepared the polygon shapefiles of the seagrass meadows patches over the two regions the extent of damaged seagrass areas was estimated using the change detection technique in arcgis the understanding of physical mechanisms and dynamics of coastal regions depends upon the sea truth data of the atmosphere and ocean parameters there are various datasets such as reanalysis real time in situ measurements and field collected data that were analyzed during the lifetime of cyclone lehar the spatial wind fields data are obtained from national centre for environmental prediction global forecasting system ncep gfs analysis with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 and the information on wave characteristics from the operational european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmrwf analysis with a horizontal resolution of 12 5 km and circulation features eastward northward direction and depth variation currents from the 3 dimensional hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom 3d with the horizontal resolution of 9 5 km the real time data from the deployed deep water and shallow water buoys bd12 cs01 wave rider of the andaman nicobar islands are found to be immensely useful to monitor and predict the characteristics of a cyclone in terms of genesis formation and intensification and for studying the upwelling and nutrient dynamics along the coastal regions these moored buoys were installed by the national institute of ocean technology niot under the omni buoy program of the ministry of earth sciences in may 2011 these buoys measure both surface met ocean and subsurface oceanographic parameters with sensors fitted at specific levels they facilitate the subsurface current sensors to measure vertical profiles of horizontal currents up to 100 m depth from the surface in the water column they provide continuous time series measurements at fixed locations to understand the structure of water column circulation temperature salinity and wind speed over the region during normal and extreme weather conditions these moored buoys added great value to this study to understand the interaction between the water column circulation and seagrass meadows during the lifetime of cyclone lehar all the met ocean parameters were measured at the surface and subsurface levels using various sensors at different resolutions the data was transmitted via satellite every 3 h in real time for operational and research applications through the indian national centre for ocean information services incois hyderabad the wind speed had a resolution of 0 1 m s with an accuracy of 2 in

such as the gradient of horizontal flow movement in the vertical direction turbidity in the water column strong wave activity and surge are studied using the primitive equations of continuity and momentum in shallow water during the extreme weather conditions the gradient of horizontal momentum in the vertical direction and vertical flow conditions in the water column has been evaluated based on the das et al 2016 studies pradhan et al 2012 derived the empirical relation between maximum wind speed and central pressure drop in terms of maximum radial velocity using doppler weather radar dwr

sanil kumar et al 2003 explained the wind and wave characteristics based on the 11 cyclones along the nagapattinam coast of tamil nadu india they derived the empirical relations relating wind speed wave height and wave period to the storm parameters and estimated the maximum significant wave height within the storm and its associated spectral peak period using young s model the results were compared with the hurricane wave prediction techniques provided in the manual of shore protection published by the us army corps of engineers in 1984 for all the cyclones the empirical formulae of

distribution of wind field before the landfall i e at 1800 utc of 24th november and after the landfall i e at 00utc of 25th nov 2013 the position of the cyclone eye and the mesoscale circulation features associated with the storm were more intensified over the south quadrant with a maximum surface wind speed of 24 m sec in the pre cyclone period the wind speed was about 8 m sec in the northeast direction and was in the eastward direction with a magnitude between 8 and 12 m sec over the north of the south andaman region in the post cyclone period on 25 november 2013 similarly the current speed varied between 0 6 0 8 m sec in the northeast direction of south andaman island the magnitude of the current varied between 1 0 1 2 m sec in the port blair region and was high at about 1 2 2 0 m sec in the north of the south andaman region the predominant direction of the currents is northward in the port blair region and is in the northwest direction over the other regions figures 3 d e f the wave characteristics such as significant wave height and wave period are observed and varied between 0 95 1 02 m and 5 7 5 9 sec respectively figure 4 in the port blair region the significant wave height was observed between 1 2 1 8 m with a period of 6 5 sec during the passage of the cyclone over the south andaman the real time measurements of buoys in shallow water cb01 at mgmnp and deep water location bd12 displayed the variable wind speed between 2 5 20 m sec and 2 5 18 m sec respectively during the lifetime of the cyclone figure 5 a wind direction during peak wind speed was southwest at the mgmnp cb01 location while it was in the northeast at the bd12 buoy location therefore these two buoys indicated the asymmetrical nature of the surface wind fields and revealed that wind intensity is high on the right side of the track during the passage of cyclone lehar figures 6 a b similarly the current speed varied between 0 2 0 8 m sec during the lifetime of the cyclone at the deepwater buoy bd12 location figures 5a 6c the predominant current direction is observed in the northeast and eastward direction whereas the peak current is observed in the northeast direction during the lifetime of the lehar cyclone figure 6c in addition to these measurements the significant wave height and its direction observed at port blair in south andaman varied between 0 5 to 3 m figures 5b table 1 the predominant wave direction in the northeast and the peak wave in the southeast direction were observed during the passage of the cyclone over the south andaman region figures 6d therefore the in situ observations clearly showed that the variations in hydrodynamic parameters are significant on the right side of the track during the landfall of cyclone lehar over south andaman island the analysis of the leo observations at the two sites indicated the water levels varied between 0 7 m to 1 2 m during low and high tide periods and wave height varied between 0 1 m and 0 5 m in the northeast direction with a period of 6 8 sec the significant wave height mean wave period and storm surge were calculated along the cyclone track using the empirical formulations and cyclone track data during the lehar cyclone table 1 in the pre and post cyclone period the wave height varied between 0 5 1 2 m in the south andaman islands during the cyclonic period the wave height varied between 2 5 14 m and the surge was 1 15 m along the track during the landfall over the south andaman islands table 1 figure 7 explained the variation of horizontal current speed in the vertical direction on either side of the track of cyclone lehar the gradient velocity is observed high on the right side of the track figure 7a compared to the left side of the track figure 7b 5 2 impact of seagrass ecosystem during extreme conditions in ani seagrass ecosystems are densely populated in the little andaman and in the south andamans the south andaman islands especially the mgmnp region and the havelock and neil islands are densely populated with seagrass vegetation in their near shore coastal regions savurirajan et al 2015 several researchers have reported seagrass biodiversity during the normal weather conditions and their seasonal dynamics the team reported that three genera and four species viz h uninervis h pinnifolia h ovalis and t hemperichii from the dense seagrass vegetation in both sites in the pre and post cyclonic period the morphometric measurements root system and iucn status were reviewed and compared with other regions for further confirmation of identification the details are given in table 3 during the early stage of cyclone formation in october 2013 the extent of seagrass meadows was mapped the estimated distribution of seagrass meadows before the lehar cyclone was 7 14 ha at haddo bay figure 8 a and 1 16 ha at sesostris bay figure 9 a the survey after the passage of cyclone lehar was carried out on 30th november 2013 post cyclone period over the same regions and the estimated seagrass area was found to be approximately 4 84 ha in haddo bay figure 8b and 0 37 ha in sesostris bay figure 9b indicating a reduction in 32 in haddo bay and 68 in sesostris bay these results indicated that strong physical mechanisms influenced the seagrass meadows in sesostris bay more than in haddo bay this loss in seagrass cover could temporarily impact the endangered animals such as sea cow sea turtles that are dependent on seagrass ecosystems and other seagrass associated flora and fauna until the recovery of seagrass after a year of the cyclone passage a field survey was conducted in december 2014 to estimate the recovery of the seagrass meadows in the cyclone affected areas figures 8c and 9c the recovery of seagrass meadows was observed at about 1 02 ha in the study sites however the recovery of seagrass meadows is more in sesostris bay 44 5 compared to haddo bay 13 6 discussions seagrass is one of the most productive ecosystems in coastal areas it is sensitive to the natural calamities such as cyclones seismic waves shoreline changes sedimentation nutrient run off and algal blooms myers et al 2000 jagtap et al 2003 nobi et al 2013 in india the decline of seagrass areas is reported in many studies with most attributed reasons being anthropogenic but there have been no studies on the impact of physical mechanisms on the seagrass ecosystems during extreme events such as cyclones and floods this study explored the impact of such an extreme event cyclone lehar on the seagrass meadows in south andaman cyclone lehar hit the coastal regions of south andaman on 25th november 2013 with high intensity of wind fields strong waves cyclonic currents and a storm surge sachithanandam et al 2014 yuvaraj et al 2015 before the tropical cyclone formation the wind induced waves and currents were observed insignificant over the seagrass meadows the drag force between the seagrass meadows and the horizontal movement of water mass over the seagrass meadows lead to wave attenuation and reduction in current speed within the seagrass system moki et al 2020 monismith et al 2019 the disturbances in the seagrass meadows during the passage of the cyclone have been analysed with the help of similar studies preen et al 1995 campbell and mckenzie 2004 carlson et al 2010 côté laurin et al 2017 tan et al 2020 along the world s coastal water during the period of the intensified cyclone the wind speed intensified from 18 to 24 m sec and the corresponding wave height and currents raised between 2 5m and 1 5m sec respectively table 2 and figures 3 and 4 the increased wind speed wave height and currents led to strong vertical mixing and turbidity near the coastal areas of south andaman figure 8 the observational analysis data clearly indicated that the strong differential horizontal velocity of water masses 60 cm sec and high vertical velocity 30 cm sec as well as other mechanisms such as cyclone induced cross shore currents sediment transport rate 0 1078 kg s m sediment deposition from drainage discharge due to heavy rainfall and resuspension of the sediments due to high wave activity are the major factors causing damage to the seagrass distribution in haddo bay and sesostris bay of south andaman island high vertical velocity churning due to the turbulence and turbidity of the water masses 7 4 kg m3 are major responses to the uprooting and burying of seagrass plants on either side of the cyclone track sachithanandam et al 2014 the storm surge along the track varied between 1 15 and 2 47 m during the landfall of cyclone lehar over ani and was estimated at about 1 75 m at landfall time due to the high wave action cross shore currents and storm surge most of the sandy beaches were severely eroded by about 1 1 3 m depth of sediments along the coastal beaches of carbyn s cove wandoor and chidyatapu of south andaman yuvaraj et al 2015 seagrass communities depend on the seagrass meadow type structure and coastal morphology i e rock sandy and mud properties table 2 dense seagrass meadows can grow mainly in muddy regions with less wave action the soil texture and composition of the study sites haddo bay and sesosistor bay are observed as muddy and silty the storm induced waves currents sediment transport and turbidity affected approximately 8 3 ha of the total seagrass area in the south andaman islands this is the first ever study attempted in the tropical island ecosystem of andaman and nicobar in the context of indian coastal waters including the andaman and nicobar islands the studies on the hydrodynamic response over the seagrass meadows were very limited due to the scarcity of monitoring data however we provided some of the international work to support the present study serra et al 2020 gonzález ortiz et al 2014 the uprooted buried and damaged seagrass area was about 3 09 ha of the total covered seagrass areas in the haddo bay and sesostris bay of the south andaman the most damaged species were identified as t hemperichii h pinnifolia and h uninervis in that order in the study sites in haddo bay the seagrass locations are close to the open sea having high waves and currents which are immediately transferred to the nearshore causing more impact on the seagrass ecosystem in the case of sesostris bay the seagrass ecosystem is less impacted by cyclone lehar due to sheltering by the adjoining ross island in addition to these parameters the sediments and freshwater runoff from the landward side during the landfall of the cyclone have also affected the seagrass meadow ecosystem by sediment lodging over the seagrass meadows preen and marsh 1995 campbell and mckenzie 2004 after a year of the cyclonic event the coverage of the seagrass meadows was surveyed and observed the recovery of the seagrass meadows of about 1 02 ha in haddo bay 0 72 ha and sesostris bay 0 30 ha the specific morphometric measurements i e blade width and roots system play a vital role in the hydrodynamic environment during normal weather and extreme conditions peralta et al 2008 and are more effective for shore stability in a medium current regime 0 23 0 40 m sec fonseca and cabalan 1992 morphological features of the dominant seagrass species such as h uninervis h ovalis and t hemperichii over the two sites of the study region have changed the hydrodynamic environment vanderklift et al 2016 sachithanandma et al 2014 fonseca and cahalan 1992 the dimensions of the seagrass plant t hemperichii in terms of leave length width and root density are large compared to the other seagrass plants table 2 the hydrodynamic response over the t hemperichii and other seagrass species has been observed over the study region using the littoral environmental observations leo which were conducted before and after the passage of cyclone lehar the hydrodynamic responses over the t hemperichii species were observed in very low wave height 0 1 m current speed 0 14 m sec and sediment transport rate 2 76 10 4 kg s m and turbidity 2 2 10 6 kg m3 compared to the other species of seagrass meadows over the study regions during the field survey t hemperichii meadows were observed as the dominant species in the study sites this species could be played a major role to attenuate the wave energy along the position of the site reidenbach and thomas 2018 john et al 2016 the recovery of the seagrass meadows depends upon specific physical and biological mechanisms the biological mechanisms play a crucial role in seagrass recovery along with physical mechanisms some of the significant biological mechanisms such as seagrass regrowth from fragments of plants that are adverted into the area recovery from seed banks and vegetative growth by seagrass meadow remains for rhizomes to colonise vanderklift et al 2016 the effects of both mechanisms may play a significant role to improve the recovery of seagrass meadows distribution in the two sites in general along the indian coast the seagrass meadow cover and growth are high during the post monsoon season whereas the growth is minimal during the summer season in the context of the andaman and nicobar islands coastal regions the studies on the natural variability of seagrass cover on inter annual and annual scales were very limited due to the scarcity of seagrass monitoring data it made limited to provide a detailed discussion on the natural variability of the seagrass meadows at the study sites dilipan et al 2020 ramesh and mohanraju 2020 however in the present study three field surveys were conducted to estimate the seagrass meadows cover during 2013 2014 at the two sites the annual change of seagrass meadows cover over the study sites is about 1 19 ha and the recovery rate from the storm impact is about 0 23 ha the storm impact is estimated approximately at 32 4 of the seagrass meadows in haddo bay and 68 in sesostris bay of the south andaman islands the annual estimations of the seagrass meadows indicated that the recovery of seagrass meadows from the storm impact is about 13 0 70 ha in haddo bay and 44 5 0 30 ha in sesostris bay similar assessment studies have been observed in different regions such as the san juan archipelago washington south bay virginia and hokkaido island japan and along the global coastal water lacy and wyllie echeverria 2011 hansen and reidenbach 2013 moki et al 2020 however during the passage of the cyclone these seagrass species are unable to withstand the strong action of waves gradient velocity of currents and turbidity 1 4m of wave height 0 9 m sec current speed and 7 4 kg m3 respectively therefore the seagrass meadows were uprooted over the two sites of the study region this loss of seagrass ecosystems results in the reduction of services for the fishing community and marine mammals such as sea cows and turtles this also causes to increase the coastal erosion and turbidity and leads to an impact on the primary producers in these regions in the present study we observed that the spatial area of the seagrass meadow that recovered after the cyclone was 3 4 times greater in sesostris bay compared to haddo bay this difference in the recovery of the seagrass meadow was most likely due to higher water quality within sesostris bay franklin et al 2018 jha et al 2015 therefore the statement of carlson et al 2010 seagrass meadows recovery takes less period due to physical disturbance compared to anthropogenic disturbances is clearly noticed in the present study authors preen et al 1995 carlson et al 2010 côté laurin et al 2017 tan et al 2020 discussed the failure of the recovery of the seagrass ecosystem after the passage of the tropical cyclones due to various mechanisms however the countries such as australia and new zealand provided a good lesson to restore the disturbed seagrass ecosystem systems through various techniques after extreme weather conditions i e tropical cyclones the indian government has implemented various notifications rules acts under the water prevention control of pollution act 1974 and environment protection act 1986 for the management and conservation of coastal waters the ministry of environment forests and climate change moef cc is regulating and ensuring environmental protection and issued the crz notification 2011 the present legal framework for coastal zone management is robust enough to achieve its objectives of protection of the livelihoods of traditional fisherfolk communities preservation of coastal ecology and promotion of necessary economic activity in coastal regions in addition the national environmental policy 2006 linked coastal issues to protecting fragile ecosystems like coral reefs and mangroves but not seagrass meadows recently the national policy of marine fisheries 2017 highlighted the seagrass ecosystem s importance along with the existing ecosystems coral and mangroves seagrass meadows are listed under the ecological sensitive areas esas and are classified under the crz 1a category as per the crz notification 2011 although there are many clauses in different laws and acts such as the wildlife p act 1972 and crz notification under the environment p act 1986 and biodiversity act 2002 shall be used to protect seagrass ecosystems with community participation for the conservation of esas however special attention could be considered to monitoring the immediate impacts of an extreme cyclone disturbance on coastal ecosystems and can be framed as policy action for the restoration of seagrass ecosystem using various restoration techniques which proven scientifically this is the first kind of report on the impact of an extreme event on seagrass meadows in indian regions on analysing how the physical mechanisms influenced to uproot of the seagrass meadows this study emphasises the importance of developing innovative seagrass conservation and management plan to safeguard seagrass ecosystems during severe weather conditions the study will be expanded in the future to include real time monitoring of the seagrass ecosystem in terms of abundance cover density and or biomass extent and species composition through field surveys and the configuration of high resolution numerical models for forecasting ocean state and identifying the health of seagrass habitats 7 conclusions we examined the effect of the cyclone lehar cyclone on the seagrass ecosystem in the south andaman islands of ani as a case study the hydrodynamic environment during the lifetime of cyclone lehar was studied with respect to coastal circulation features wave characteristics and storm surge before during and after the cyclone period over south andaman island the important parameters such as significant wave height currents turbidity and storm surge were observed at about 2 5 m 1 2 m sec and 2 47 m respectively at the time of landfall over south andaman island in this highly disturbing hydrodynamic environment the seagrass meadows of the study areas such as haddo bay and sesostris bay were uprooted due to the strong currents 0 9 m sec with the association of high magnitude waves about 2 5 m turbidity and surge 2 75 m over the coastal regions seagrass ecosystems do not acquire much attention in indian scientific research studies and coastal management plans when compared to other coastal ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs the present work suggests that in future seagrass meadows should be monitored regularly to evaluate changes through in situ and geospatial approaches to ensure that appropriate conservation and management measures are applied the results of this study assume importance in the present scenario of climate change during which storms of increasing intensity have been predicted which can have a considerable adverse impact on coastal ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement v sachithanandam conceptualization formal analysis methodology

943,the ecohydrology program of unesco established demonstration sites around the world where the ecohydrologic techniques are demonstrated to disseminate the concept and by learning from visualization of real in situ experiments and examples to analyse the impact of applying ecohydrological solutions at the demonstration sites eg use of bivalves as filter feeders phytoremediation or managing freshwater pulses we propose to use ecosystem service indicators selected by expert judgment and literature the ecosystem services es concept provides a recognizable and easy way to evaluate the changes on the ecosystem by measuring the improvement or degradation of the services that are provided the proposed es indicators table allows the evaluation of relevant ecosystem services for all demosites by comparing the following three temporal situations 1 before the impact occurred 2 after it occurred but without any restoration measure being implemented and 3 after applying ecohydrology restoration solutions the proposed ecosystem services matrix was applied to the guadiana estuary and adjacent coastal area demosite in the south east of portugal based on extensive research on applying ecohydrology solutions at the site and expert judgement results show that the application of the ecosystem services es matrix allows to understand the benefits of applying the ecohydrology approach as it helps defining services and areas where more effort in recuperation is needed 1 introduction the ecohydrology concept was developed and distilled at the unesco intergovernmental hydrologic programme ihp and its ecohydrology program for more than 20 years it was founded based on the knowledge on the evolutionary established processes of aquatic ecosystems and on the dual regulation between hydrology and biota this approach aims to restore the ecosystems carrying capacities so that they can become more resilient on the long term and adaptable to impacts at the entire river basin scale zalewski 2000 2012 2015 chícharo et al 2015a the ecohydrology approach gained higher public and scientific visibility with the inclusion of the concept of nature based solutions in the global political agenda the development of the ecohydrology concept at unesco evolved through different phases and has been constantly upgraded to adapt and respond to new realities and challenges but always keeping the background theoretical backbone the dual regulation and the three main principles hydrological ecological and environmental engineering zalewski 2012 ecosystem services are defined by burkhard et al 2012 as the contributions of ecosystem structure and function in combination with other inputs to human well being since that approach emerged many methods are being used to allow their assessment quantification some of them mapping the ecosystem services in the literature several ecosystem service classification frameworks can be found e g costanza et al 1997 boyd and banzhaf 2007 costanza 2008 wallace 2008 fisher and turner 2008 daily et al 2009 de groot et al 2002 2010 staub et al 2011 mea 2005 burkhard et al 2009 teeb 2010 haines young and potschin 2010a b 2013 cices 2013 all these distinctions are based on different structures and viewpoints despite the many classifications ecosystem services are broadly included in three categories provisioning regulating and cultural according to muller et al 2015 provisioning services comprise all material outputs from ecosystems processes that are used for human nutrition processing and energy as soil formation nutrients cycle water cycle regulating services are the benefits people obtain from the regulation of natural processes and the control or modification of biotic and abiotic factors e g processes of flood erosion or water quality control by wetlands and cultural services that are the intangible benefits people obtain from the ecosystem in the form of non material spiritual religious inspirational and educational experience crossman et al 2013 presented a review of 122 papers including two documents with their own reviews martínez harms and balvanera 2012 and egoh et al 2012 with 70 and 67 papers reviewed respectively and one of their findings is that comparisons of mapped ecosystem services across studies are rarely applicable because many studies use unique primary indicators to map single ecosystem services or multiple in cases where single indicators are insufficient recently a new approach emerged from the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes called nature s contributions to people ncp with several differences from the three frameworks above mentioned first the ncp approach recognizes the central and pervasive role that culture plays in defining all links between people and nature second use of ncp elevates emphasizes and operationalizes the role of indigenous and local knowledge in understanding nature s contribution to people diaz et al 2018 in fact the ecohydrology demonstration sites are places where ecohydrology is studied in a living laboratory approach the ecosystem services approach contributes to evaluate and determine the consequences of human activities on natural systems moreover it can also provide information on the status of recovery and which actions of recovery need to be corrected to foster the ecosystem services however despite ecohydrology focus on the development of solutions to tackle the different environmental degradations existing in all regions of the world no common evaluation of the benefits achieved or further improvements and corrections needed were developed so far chícharo et al 2015 articulated for the first time the concept of applying ecosystem services to evaluate ecohydrology solutions in the book ecosystem services and river basin ecohydrology thus our aim is to propose the of use ecosystem services indicators as a common methodology to analyze the results of applying ecohydrology solutions in the unesco ihp network of ecohydrology demonstration sites 27 in 19 countries in the current paper we will use the guadiana estuary demosite in the southeast of portugal as a case study 2 methodology 2 1 study area the guadiana demosite was established in 2006 as the first coastal ecohydrology site of the unesco eh program the guadiana estuary was selected to demonstrate how ecohydrology solutions eg use of bivalves as filter feeders phytoremediation or managing freshwater pulses tested during several years after the dam operation began in 2002 can tackle the impact of a river flow constrained by the construction of a large dam on an estuary and adjacent coastal area in 2002 the large alqueva dam was built in the guadiana transboundary river basin the fourth largest of the iberian peninsula being 83 in spanish territory and 17 in portuguese fig 1 despite the environmental impact studies and the implementation of the indicated measures several changes in the natural river and estuarine system were observed at the estuary and adjacent coastal area gonçalves et al 2015 2017 leitão et al 2015 encarnação et al 2013a b carvalho et al 2014 sroczynska et al 2012 morais et al 2009 2010a b 2012 chícharo chícharo 2006 chícharo et al 2006 2009a b c wolanski et al 2006 ecohydrologic solutions aiming to control water quantity and water quality were developed and tested at the site from 2006 until 2017 impacts at the estuary and coastal area that are common after a dam enter into functioning included changes in the phytoplankton assemblages that were due to the modification of the redfield brezinski ratio c n p sio 106 16 1 16 that limited diatom growth resulting in the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms and of water quality degradation domingues et al 2005 bivalve filter feeders assemblages as eco hydrology solution reduced the risk for algal bloom moreover at the mid estuary change in the isohalines caused a shift in fish assemblages distribution also at the lower estuary changes were noticed on the fish assemblages and on the saltmarsh sediment depositions and structure which caused a cascade effect impacting on saltmarsh nursery functions the reduction of river flow and inherent decrease in the sediment transport unbalanced the sediment deposition at the saltmarsh area that receives a higher load of marine sediments the consequent shift to higher granulometry and less compactable and more erodible sediment affected the stability of the vegetation and the saltmarsh vegetation sustainability as consequence indirect effects related to the services provided by the vegetation such as nursery functions have occurred in fact the mid and low estuary area provide refuge and feeding areas for the reproduction and development of early life stages of invertebrates and fish some of which of relevant economic importance eco hydrologic solution was developed based on modelling with mohid moreover the decrease in the vegetated saltmarsh area reduces the recharge of the groundwater system monteiro comm pers reduces the buffer effect in trapping contaminants from the continent and also reduces the coastal protection against storms wolanski et al 2006 the ecohydrologic solutions developed for the guadiana demosite were proposed and accepted by the unesco eh program and their aims are indicated in the fig 2 solutions considered the promotion of freshwater pulses to increase the input of nutrients to the estuary promoting the microzooplankton diversity and the top down control of phytoplanktonic blooms the use of bivalve filter feeding ability to reduce the concentration of phytoplankton and control water quality to establish required volume of water to be discharged by the dam to create the river plume conditions at the river mouth that will attract the anchovy adults to enter in to the estuary and spawn gonçalves et al 2015 2017 leitão et al 2015 encarnação et al 2013a b carvalho et al 2014 sroczynska et al 2012 morais et al 2009 2010a b 2012 chícharo chícharo 2006 chícharo et al 2006 2009a b c wolanski et al 2006 the solutions were developed since 2004 two years after the dam was built based on the ecosystem functions and outputs to humans we identify the more relevant ecosystem services at the guadiana fig 3 2 2 ecosystem services at the guadiana estuary and adjacent coastal areas based on the knowledge previously obtained about the guadiana estuary and coastal area we selected the most relevant ecosystem services of the guadiana system gonçalves et al 2015 2017 leitão et al 2015 encarnação et al 2013a b carvalho et al 2014 sroczynska et al 2012 morais et al 2009 2010a b 2012 chícharo chícharo 2006 chícharo et al 2006 2009a b c wolanski et al 2006 based on the list of important ecosystem services for the river basins from kandziora et al 2012 each ecosystem service classification has its own advantages and disadvantages due to the specific context within which they were developed this demonstrates that there are many useful ways to classify ecosystem services depending on the objectives of the expert judgment thus based on the ecosystem services listed by muller at all 2015 we selected based on expert judgement and knowledge about the system the most relevant ecosystem services for river guadiana basin table 1 2 3 ecosystem services calculations the most relevant ecosystem services es for the guadiana demosite were selected based on expert judgment and relevant literature gonçalves et al 2015 2017 leitão et al 2015 encarnação et al 2013a b carvalho et al 2014 sroczynska et al 2012 morais et al 2009 2010a b 2012 chícharo chícharo 2006 chícharo et al 2006 2009a b c wolanski et al 2006 the contribution by each es was valued the between zero and five lowest 0 and highest 5 contribution from the ecosystem service indicator we applied this methodology to three temporal and environmental different situations 1 before the impact occurred in the guadiana case the dam construction 2 after the impact but before any restoration measures are implemented and 3 after the ecohydrological solutions are applied this allows to identify and understand the changes occurring with the impact and to evaluate the success of the restoration measures put into place 3 results based on the selection and valuation 0 5 of the relevant ecosystem services at the guadiana site based on expert judgment the following table was produced for the guadiana demosite comparing data and observations before the dam was build with the observations after the dam start operating and with the expected consequences of the general application of the eco hydrologic solutions developed in the period between 2000 and 2017 it was observed that the category of the provisioning es decreased with the impact but the application of ecohydrology contributed to the restoration of the previous es category that even exceeded the previous to impact situation fig 4 in fact with the ecohydrology proposals some existing impacts apart from the dam construction were also mitigated a similar response was observed for the regulating and cultural es as all increased their contributions with the implementation of ecohydrological solutions when comparing the relative importance of the es categories between the tested situation it was noticed that before the impact the most important es was the regulating 39 and that the impact reduced most this category 21 what can be restored with the application of ecohydrology solutions 36 fig 5 the provisioning services increased after the impact because the dam provided more freshwater and supported energy production with the implementation of ecohydrology solutions several provisioning services became more relevant such as catch of seafood algae for food fishmeal and fish oil harvest of seafood algae from marine and terrestrial aquaculture farms and fish catch from recreational fishing natural products used as biochemicals medicine and or cosmetics and use freshwater e g for drinking domestic use industrial use irrigation which contributed to an increase in the category the cultural es did not change significantly with the impact and slightly increased with the ecohydrological restoration the fig 6 graphs show that most of the es indicators recovered with the implementation of ecohydrology solutions and that generally the impact reduced the es provided except in cultural services 4 discussion ecosystem services analysis can provide a framework to compare the changes in the ecosystems due to impacts human or natural by comparing gains and losses of services we considered that the observed changes in the estuary and coastal areas are mostly linked with the changes in the river flow discharge caused by the dam despite other impacts may also have occurred such as land use changes at the river basin that will not also may affect water quality and quantity reaching the estuary but not causing the same level of disturbance managing human impacted systems such as river basins is strongly accompanied by several decisions about the intensity of human actions which potentially affect ecological systems at river basin upstream uses of water have an impact on the ecohydrologic functioning of downstream ecosystems and on the tradeoffs between provision of upstream and downstream ecosystem services ecosystem services can be classified in many ways depending on the objectives of the expert judgment the quality of the judgment is very important as ecosystem services can be used to support decision making processes about the fate of these systems as ecohydrology demosites are the face of the unesco eh program before the stakeholders and society it is important to clearly show the benefits obtained by applying the ecohydrology approach thus having a common methodology that allows a simple but effective analysis of the state of progress of each ecosystem where these types of solutions were and are being tested will allow the proactive correction of measures taken to maximize the restoration results to all ecosystem services provided by that ecosystem in fact the results showed that understanding the guadiana estury and coastal interrelations as shown by several authors morais et al 2009 2010a b 2012 chícharo chícharo 2006 chícharo et al 2006 2009a b c wolanski et al 2006 it is possible to develop ecohydrologic solutions that contribute to restore the ecosystem services at the guadiana estuary and adjacent coastal area to levels close to the pre impact eg chícharo 2003 situation the provisioning es decreased after the dam starting to operate in 2002 due to the fish catches that were reduced as well as the harvesting of sea food by the contrary services of freshwater use for drinking and for energy production increased with the proposed ecohydrology solutions it is expected that the catches and recreational fishing increased significantly what justifies the increase of the provision es still to values inferior to the ones before the dam was built the regulating services also declined with the impact of the dam operation despite there was an increase in local climate regulation as well as in the water flow regulation services ecosystem services responsible for the overall decline after the dam operation were erosion regulation nutrient regulation and natural hazards protection with the implementation of the ecohydrologic solutions water flow regulation nutrient regulation and erosion regulation increase the cultural ecosystem services decreased slightly with the operation of the dam caused by a decline in cultural heritage and cultural diversity as well as the natural heritage and natural diversity ecosystem services and increased with ecohydrology as it creates good water quality for recreation and tourism and creates the potential for environmental education as well as contributes to saltmarsh ecosystems aesthetics when comparing the modification of the ecosystems services categories at the three moments in time before the impact 2000 2001 after the impact without restoration 2002 2003 and with ecohydrology restoration solutions 2006 2017 it can be noticed that before the dam the regulating services as water purification nutrient regulation erosion regulation and natural hazard protections were more relevant then the provisioning services despite the higher catches of fishes and sea food at the estuary and adjacent coastal area after the dam and before any ecohydrology measures the provisioning services became more relevant in percentage due to increase in crops aquaculture potential and local climate regulation at this time the regulating services were reduced due to the negative impacts on water flow regulation water purification nutrient regulation erosion regulation and also reduction of natural hazard protection with the ecohydrology solutions it is expected that these services become more important and their relative percentage increased while the provisioning services kept the same but in smaller percentage to the overall services when compared to the after impacted situation the cultural services were mainly recreation and tourism and represented approximately the same relative percentage after along the periods in analysis but the services changed before the dam operation natural heritage and natural diversity as well as landscape aesthetic and recreation and tourism were more important after the dam there was a reduction in services related to heritage but an increase in potential for environment education and with landscape aesthetic we consider that this table adapted from the relevant ecosystem services for river basin ecohydrology muller et al 2015 and calculations based on published data together with expert judgment can be a tool to the valuation of the ecosystem services at each unesco ecohydrology demonstration site what allows to have quantitative and comparable data on the application of ecohydrology solutions at each site contributing to the cooperation harmonization and transference of knowledge among the ecohydrology and ihp family declaration of competing interest none 
943,the ecohydrology program of unesco established demonstration sites around the world where the ecohydrologic techniques are demonstrated to disseminate the concept and by learning from visualization of real in situ experiments and examples to analyse the impact of applying ecohydrological solutions at the demonstration sites eg use of bivalves as filter feeders phytoremediation or managing freshwater pulses we propose to use ecosystem service indicators selected by expert judgment and literature the ecosystem services es concept provides a recognizable and easy way to evaluate the changes on the ecosystem by measuring the improvement or degradation of the services that are provided the proposed es indicators table allows the evaluation of relevant ecosystem services for all demosites by comparing the following three temporal situations 1 before the impact occurred 2 after it occurred but without any restoration measure being implemented and 3 after applying ecohydrology restoration solutions the proposed ecosystem services matrix was applied to the guadiana estuary and adjacent coastal area demosite in the south east of portugal based on extensive research on applying ecohydrology solutions at the site and expert judgement results show that the application of the ecosystem services es matrix allows to understand the benefits of applying the ecohydrology approach as it helps defining services and areas where more effort in recuperation is needed 1 introduction the ecohydrology concept was developed and distilled at the unesco intergovernmental hydrologic programme ihp and its ecohydrology program for more than 20 years it was founded based on the knowledge on the evolutionary established processes of aquatic ecosystems and on the dual regulation between hydrology and biota this approach aims to restore the ecosystems carrying capacities so that they can become more resilient on the long term and adaptable to impacts at the entire river basin scale zalewski 2000 2012 2015 chícharo et al 2015a the ecohydrology approach gained higher public and scientific visibility with the inclusion of the concept of nature based solutions in the global political agenda the development of the ecohydrology concept at unesco evolved through different phases and has been constantly upgraded to adapt and respond to new realities and challenges but always keeping the background theoretical backbone the dual regulation and the three main principles hydrological ecological and environmental engineering zalewski 2012 ecosystem services are defined by burkhard et al 2012 as the contributions of ecosystem structure and function in combination with other inputs to human well being since that approach emerged many methods are being used to allow their assessment quantification some of them mapping the ecosystem services in the literature several ecosystem service classification frameworks can be found e g costanza et al 1997 boyd and banzhaf 2007 costanza 2008 wallace 2008 fisher and turner 2008 daily et al 2009 de groot et al 2002 2010 staub et al 2011 mea 2005 burkhard et al 2009 teeb 2010 haines young and potschin 2010a b 2013 cices 2013 all these distinctions are based on different structures and viewpoints despite the many classifications ecosystem services are broadly included in three categories provisioning regulating and cultural according to muller et al 2015 provisioning services comprise all material outputs from ecosystems processes that are used for human nutrition processing and energy as soil formation nutrients cycle water cycle regulating services are the benefits people obtain from the regulation of natural processes and the control or modification of biotic and abiotic factors e g processes of flood erosion or water quality control by wetlands and cultural services that are the intangible benefits people obtain from the ecosystem in the form of non material spiritual religious inspirational and educational experience crossman et al 2013 presented a review of 122 papers including two documents with their own reviews martínez harms and balvanera 2012 and egoh et al 2012 with 70 and 67 papers reviewed respectively and one of their findings is that comparisons of mapped ecosystem services across studies are rarely applicable because many studies use unique primary indicators to map single ecosystem services or multiple in cases where single indicators are insufficient recently a new approach emerged from the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes called nature s contributions to people ncp with several differences from the three frameworks above mentioned first the ncp approach recognizes the central and pervasive role that culture plays in defining all links between people and nature second use of ncp elevates emphasizes and operationalizes the role of indigenous and local knowledge in understanding nature s contribution to people diaz et al 2018 in fact the ecohydrology demonstration sites are places where ecohydrology is studied in a living laboratory approach the ecosystem services approach contributes to evaluate and determine the consequences of human activities on natural systems moreover it can also provide information on the status of recovery and which actions of recovery need to be corrected to foster the ecosystem services however despite ecohydrology focus on the development of solutions to tackle the different environmental degradations existing in all regions of the world no common evaluation of the benefits achieved or further improvements and corrections needed were developed so far chícharo et al 2015 articulated for the first time the concept of applying ecosystem services to evaluate ecohydrology solutions in the book ecosystem services and river basin ecohydrology thus our aim is to propose the of use ecosystem services indicators as a common methodology to analyze the results of applying ecohydrology solutions in the unesco ihp network of ecohydrology demonstration sites 27 in 19 countries in the current paper we will use the guadiana estuary demosite in the southeast of portugal as a case study 2 methodology 2 1 study area the guadiana demosite was established in 2006 as the first coastal ecohydrology site of the unesco eh program the guadiana estuary was selected to demonstrate how ecohydrology solutions eg use of bivalves as filter feeders phytoremediation or managing freshwater pulses tested during several years after the dam operation began in 2002 can tackle the impact of a river flow constrained by the construction of a large dam on an estuary and adjacent coastal area in 2002 the large alqueva dam was built in the guadiana transboundary river basin the fourth largest of the iberian peninsula being 83 in spanish territory and 17 in portuguese fig 1 despite the environmental impact studies and the implementation of the indicated measures several changes in the natural river and estuarine system were observed at the estuary and adjacent coastal area gonçalves et al 2015 2017 leitão et al 2015 encarnação et al 2013a b carvalho et al 2014 sroczynska et al 2012 morais et al 2009 2010a b 2012 chícharo chícharo 2006 chícharo et al 2006 2009a b c wolanski et al 2006 ecohydrologic solutions aiming to control water quantity and water quality were developed and tested at the site from 2006 until 2017 impacts at the estuary and coastal area that are common after a dam enter into functioning included changes in the phytoplankton assemblages that were due to the modification of the redfield brezinski ratio c n p sio 106 16 1 16 that limited diatom growth resulting in the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms and of water quality degradation domingues et al 2005 bivalve filter feeders assemblages as eco hydrology solution reduced the risk for algal bloom moreover at the mid estuary change in the isohalines caused a shift in fish assemblages distribution also at the lower estuary changes were noticed on the fish assemblages and on the saltmarsh sediment depositions and structure which caused a cascade effect impacting on saltmarsh nursery functions the reduction of river flow and inherent decrease in the sediment transport unbalanced the sediment deposition at the saltmarsh area that receives a higher load of marine sediments the consequent shift to higher granulometry and less compactable and more erodible sediment affected the stability of the vegetation and the saltmarsh vegetation sustainability as consequence indirect effects related to the services provided by the vegetation such as nursery functions have occurred in fact the mid and low estuary area provide refuge and feeding areas for the reproduction and development of early life stages of invertebrates and fish some of which of relevant economic importance eco hydrologic solution was developed based on modelling with mohid moreover the decrease in the vegetated saltmarsh area reduces the recharge of the groundwater system monteiro comm pers reduces the buffer effect in trapping contaminants from the continent and also reduces the coastal protection against storms wolanski et al 2006 the ecohydrologic solutions developed for the guadiana demosite were proposed and accepted by the unesco eh program and their aims are indicated in the fig 2 solutions considered the promotion of freshwater pulses to increase the input of nutrients to the estuary promoting the microzooplankton diversity and the top down control of phytoplanktonic blooms the use of bivalve filter feeding ability to reduce the concentration of phytoplankton and control water quality to establish required volume of water to be discharged by the dam to create the river plume conditions at the river mouth that will attract the anchovy adults to enter in to the estuary and spawn gonçalves et al 2015 2017 leitão et al 2015 encarnação et al 2013a b carvalho et al 2014 sroczynska et al 2012 morais et al 2009 2010a b 2012 chícharo chícharo 2006 chícharo et al 2006 2009a b c wolanski et al 2006 the solutions were developed since 2004 two years after the dam was built based on the ecosystem functions and outputs to humans we identify the more relevant ecosystem services at the guadiana fig 3 2 2 ecosystem services at the guadiana estuary and adjacent coastal areas based on the knowledge previously obtained about the guadiana estuary and coastal area we selected the most relevant ecosystem services of the guadiana system gonçalves et al 2015 2017 leitão et al 2015 encarnação et al 2013a b carvalho et al 2014 sroczynska et al 2012 morais et al 2009 2010a b 2012 chícharo chícharo 2006 chícharo et al 2006 2009a b c wolanski et al 2006 based on the list of important ecosystem services for the river basins from kandziora et al 2012 each ecosystem service classification has its own advantages and disadvantages due to the specific context within which they were developed this demonstrates that there are many useful ways to classify ecosystem services depending on the objectives of the expert judgment thus based on the ecosystem services listed by muller at all 2015 we selected based on expert judgement and knowledge about the system the most relevant ecosystem services for river guadiana basin table 1 2 3 ecosystem services calculations the most relevant ecosystem services es for the guadiana demosite were selected based on expert judgment and relevant literature gonçalves et al 2015 2017 leitão et al 2015 encarnação et al 2013a b carvalho et al 2014 sroczynska et al 2012 morais et al 2009 2010a b 2012 chícharo chícharo 2006 chícharo et al 2006 2009a b c wolanski et al 2006 the contribution by each es was valued the between zero and five lowest 0 and highest 5 contribution from the ecosystem service indicator we applied this methodology to three temporal and environmental different situations 1 before the impact occurred in the guadiana case the dam construction 2 after the impact but before any restoration measures are implemented and 3 after the ecohydrological solutions are applied this allows to identify and understand the changes occurring with the impact and to evaluate the success of the restoration measures put into place 3 results based on the selection and valuation 0 5 of the relevant ecosystem services at the guadiana site based on expert judgment the following table was produced for the guadiana demosite comparing data and observations before the dam was build with the observations after the dam start operating and with the expected consequences of the general application of the eco hydrologic solutions developed in the period between 2000 and 2017 it was observed that the category of the provisioning es decreased with the impact but the application of ecohydrology contributed to the restoration of the previous es category that even exceeded the previous to impact situation fig 4 in fact with the ecohydrology proposals some existing impacts apart from the dam construction were also mitigated a similar response was observed for the regulating and cultural es as all increased their contributions with the implementation of ecohydrological solutions when comparing the relative importance of the es categories between the tested situation it was noticed that before the impact the most important es was the regulating 39 and that the impact reduced most this category 21 what can be restored with the application of ecohydrology

944,while numerous studies demonstrated the reduction effect of infiltration changes with natural vegetation conversion to croplands few information is available examining inherent differences between natural ecosystems we examined the steady state infiltration rate and other topsoil properties in two adjacent native ecosystem types of the brazilian tropical savanna occurring under a similar soil type oxisol a native grassland and a savanna we found a significantly higher steady state infiltration rate in the savanna 698 521 mm h 1 compared to native grassland 413 181 mm h 1 all soil properties were significantly different when comparing both ecosystem types indicating that higher topsoil permeability in the savanna is potentially related to higher organic matter content lower bulk density and lower penetration resistance previous studies have documented differences in soil hydraulic properties between natural and anthropogenic ecosystems under a similar soil type here we showed that such differences can also occur among natural ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords infiltrability hydrological services hydrology surface soil properties 1 introduction numerous studies of land use change compared natural vegetation i e forests with anthropogenic ecosystems such as soybean neill et al 2013 sugarcane silva et al 2016 pastures germer et al 2010 and eucalyptus plantations salemi et al 2013 such studies and many others usually demonstrated marked differences in terms of hydrological functioning with the main changes as follows a changes in the amount of water reaching the soil due to differences in interception losses b reductions in infiltrability and hydraulic conductivity and increased runoff in more compacted soils under more intense land uses leading to higher peak of runoff these studies clearly showed that anthropogenic ecosystems differ in terms of hydrological functioning compared to native ecosystems however what about differences in hydrological processes within native ecosystems the cerrado biome brazilian tropical savanna is considered a global biodiversity hotspot myers et al 2000 and is composed of a complex mosaic of different native ecosystem types native grasslands forests and savannas with savannas being the dominant one furley 1999 ribeiro and walter 2008 however this biome s ecosystems have received less attention so far compared to other brazilian biomes such as the amazon forest overbeck et al 2015 strassburg et al 2017 the cerrado biome stands out because in many cases its different ecosystem types occur side by side under similar soil type landscape position ball et al 2015 eiten 1972 this kind of distribution in the landscape provides an opportunity to understand how the vegetation gradient influences various soil properties li et al 2004 including water infiltration neris et al 2012 furthermore studies comparing natural ecosystems under similar soil type are important because i they can provide insights on factors affecting hydrological processes other than human activity and ii they may provide information on the different effects of distinct native ecosystems on hydrological processes and thus on hydrological ecosystem services they provide kremen and merenlender 2018 water infiltration is an important hydrological process within the ecosystems it is essential to provide water for plant growth and groundwater recharge de morais 2012 horton 1933 and maintain the baseflow of water bodies bruijnzeel 2004 this hydrological process might be modulated by several inter related factors such as fine roots abundance cui et al 2019 species richness fischer et al 2015 su et al 2018 faunal activity lee and foster 1991 soil bulk density total porosity sun et al 2018 soil organic matter content boyle et al 1989 sun et al 2018 and soil cover almeida et al 2018 cerdà 1999 given that natural ecosystems with contrasting vegetation have different species composition diversity and above and belowground biomass castro and kauffman 1998 they likely have different effects on soil infiltration as well thus apart from land use change studies it is expected that natural ecosystems may also have substantial variation regarding various hydrological processes including infiltration in this context native grasslands and savannas of the cerrado biome are different ecosystems regarding their structure castro kauffman 1998 oliveira et al 2014 native grasslands are dominated by herbaceous plants and thus have lower biomass than savannas castro and kauffman 1998 scholes and archer 1997 previous studies in the region demonstrated an increase in litter production with an increase in woody density costa et al 2020 and that there are differences in belowground biomass between such systems oliveira et al 2005 these differences likely impact on the overall functioning of them costa et al 2020 however experimental evidence is still lacking the objective of the present paper is to understand hydrological differences in natural ecosystems in doing so we examined the steady state infiltration rate in two native ecosystem types occurring adjacent to each other under a similar soil type oxisol native grassland regionally known as campo sujo with few shrubs and savanna regionally known as cerrado típico given that litter production affect the amount of organic matter added to the soil which in turn impacts soil properties such as density and pore space weil and brady 2017 we hypothesize that soil under the savanna system would have higher topsoil permeability to water compared to the one under grassland 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we carried out the study in the strictly protected area reserva ecológica do instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística recor ibge which is located in the south of the federal district brazil 15 56 s e 47 52 w figure 1 brasília is the nearest city located around 35 km from the reserve recor ibge was founded in 1975 before the foundation the area had been used for small scale agriculture subsistence farming ibge 2004 the climate at recor ibge is classified as tropical savanna aw according to the köppen geiger system with annual precipitation of approximately 1430 mm and an average temperature around 20 c figure 2 rainfall is concentrated 94 in the rainy season from october to march malaquias et al 2010 we selected two adjacent ecosystems cerrado típico and campo sujo pereira and furtado 2011 cerrado típico hereafter savanna is a woody type savanna with shrubs and trees according to ribeiro and walter 2008 this ecosystem is characterized by i predominantly arboreal shrub vegetation with low sloping crooked trees with irregular and twisted branches ii common species found are acosmium dasycarpum annona crassiflora hymenaea stignocarpa kielmeyera coriacea caryocar brasiliense pouteria ramiflora anacardium occidentale and salvertia convallariaeodora among many others and iii tree cover is 20 to 50 woody components i e trees and shrubs density is around 1900 individuals ha 1 andrade et al 2002 on the other hand campo sujo hereafter native grassland is composed of a continuous herbaceous layer with shrubs figure 1 common species found in this area are gomphrema officinalis griffinia spp paepalanthus spp aristida

ha 1 giácomo et al 2013 based on a detailed soil mapping in the study area oliveira 2011 the soil under which both cerrado típico and campo sujo occur is a deep well drained soil classified as latossolo brazilian classification or oxisol us soil taxonomy our field sampling revealed that soil texture in the savanna had the following contents of clay sand and silt respectively 78 7 11 7 16 9 11 3 and 4 4 0 5 in the case of the native grassland these contents were 69 5 11 8 clay 21 5 9 4 sand and 9 2 3 silt the soils of both areas had clay texture the thickness of the o and a horizons were 1 and 6 cm in the native grassland and 6 and 9 cm in the savanna 2 2 variables and sampling design we carried out this study in the dry season may to september of 2018 we measured steady state infiltration rate and related topsoil properties during this period such as soil penetration resistance soil bulk density total porosity and soil organic matter content to understand soil permeability to water steady state infiltration rate was measured using the mini disk infiltrometer decagon devices this device uses the analytical solution proposed by zhang 1997 we measured 30 points in each ecosystem type using three transects with ten points each murta et al 2020 the mean distance between each sampling point was 2 m figure 3 we carefully removed the litter layer which had a thickness of 2 cm thus measurements took place on the top of the a horizon moreover to enhance the contact between the infiltrometer and the soil surface a thin 1 mm of fine sand was used to capture the highest range of soil pores we used a suction pressure of 0 kpa the rates of water discharge through the mini disk as inferred from changes in the water levels in the apparatus storage chamber were recorded until steady state rates were reached for at least three times consecutively in cases where no steady state flow was reached the measurement procedure was repeated in the same sampling point until steady state flow rates were recorded after each measurement we inspected the area subjected to measurement to check appropriate round contact between the steel disk and the soil surface in case no round contact was made we repeated the measurement again in the same sampling point to minimize the influence of soil moisture on steady state infiltration rate such variable was measured in a dry month may a previous study in these sites revealed no significant differences in topsoil moisture between savanna ad native grassland in the dry season oliveira et al 2005 thus based on such study we assumed the differences in topsoil moisture content to be negligible between our sites in the dry season in order to predict the response the soil under savana and grassland in accommodating storms of the region we compared our mean of steady state infiltration rate with 5 minutes rainfall intensities of different return periods 100 50 and 25 years available in souza 2014 we measured soil penetration resistance using the stolf impact penetrometer kamaq this device operates using 2 kg weight which drives a slender metal rod into the soil to calculate the soil resistance four impacts were arbitrarily selected and for each of them the depth of penetration was recorded murta et al 2020 the first impact was the inherent rod weight resting on the soil surface and the other three impacts resulted from the impact of the 2 kg weight on the rod into the soil we measured soil penetration resistance in 10 points for each vegetation type these sampling units were chosen randomly between the infiltration linear transects figure 3 we performed the soil penetration resistance assays during the dry season to avoid soil moisture content interference though we have not determined soil moisture in the field we assumed such differences to be negligible especially at the first soil horizon since this region is characterized by a highly marked dry season malaquias et al 2010 we collected 13 soil cores 100 cm³ using an uhland soil sampler to measure soil bulk density 0 0 1 m depth litter layer has been carefully removed before sampling after sampling soil cores were dried for 24 hours at 105 c benegas et al 2014 zhipeng et al 2018 we randomly collected the soil samples within the infiltration linear transects we calculated soil total porosity based on soil bulk density and assuming a soil particle density of 2 65 g cm 3 eq 1 1 α 1 p p s 100 where α soil total porosity p soil bulk density ps soil particle density after soil bulk density determination we took 10 out of the 13 soil samples used to determine soil bulk density and determined soil organic matter content using the loss on ignition method after drying the samples for 48 hours at 105 c we took a subsample of 10 g and then put them in a muffle for 5 hours at 500 c we weighed the soil mass before initial and after final ignition after that we calculated the proportion eq 2 and percentage eq 3 of organic

topsoil properties under savanna and native grassland both occurring in a similar soil type in other words the savanna had significantly higher soil organic matter and water infiltration rate compared to native grassland also soil penetration resistance and bulk density was significantly lower in the savanna compared to native grassland factors such as lower soil bulk density and higher total porosity and organic matter are the likely causes of such difference since lower soil bulk density leads to higher pore space which in turn leads to higher water conductivity weil and brady 2017 the savanna presented a higher infiltration variability standard deviation of 521 mm h 1 than our native grassland 181 mm h 1 generally this is attributed to spatial variability of the soil hydraulic conductivity especially at the soil surface bagarello et al 2004 silva kato 1997 given that savannas have both herbaceous and woody plants scholes and archer 1997 and these plants have different rooting depth and root diameters oliveira et al 2005 the decay of such roots may lead to different size of soil pores that may influence water infiltration the higher soil organic matter content in the savanna might be explained by two interrelated factors namely i the higher and more continuous addition of litter costa et al 2020 and ii the higher below and aboveground biomass in the savanna compared to native grassland castro kauffman 1998 oliveira et al 2005 the fluxes of these organic pools over time along with their decay may generate differences in soil bulk density which were lower in the savanna thus there are probably more preferential flowpaths in the savanna compared to native grassland in fact the role of woody species in increasing infiltration has already been shown in pastures benegas et al 2014 here we argue that a similar effect might occur within natural ecosystems more studies are needed to clarify such point like topsoil bulk density differences regarding soil penetration resistance indicated that the savanna had lower resistance for all impacts reflecting probably a higher quantity of soil pores to a greater depth these findings in turn may explain our infiltration results since a higher amount of pores leads to greater water conductivity in the savanna compared to native grassland once again such pattern may mirror the abundance and diversity in terms of root diameter and rooting depth with the higher abundance of woody components trees and shrubs providing more deep roots in the savanna steady state infiltration rate estimate for the savanna was in the middle range compared to those reported previously by other authors table 1 as for native grassland we could not find studies that examined steady state infiltration rate in a similar type of ecosystem thus we compared our estimate with studies in a native grassland regionally known as campo limpo shrubs free grasslands in doing so we found that our estimate had the same magnitude as those reported in such ecosystem table 1 high variability of soil hydraulic properties had already been documented for similar soils under natural and anthropogenic ecosystems elsenbeer 2001 scheffler et al 2011 leading to significant changes between them generally attributed to land use transformations hunke et al 2015a hunke et al 2015b scheffler et al 2011 zimmermann et al 2006 unlike these studies here we add showing that variability among natural ecosystem can also lead to such significant differences finally when focusing on water infiltration despite differences in infiltration presented in these natural ecosystems the topsoil of both ecosystems are permeable to preclude hortonian overlandflow this in turn makes both ecosystems to benefit water entering the soil which is a key process to soil and groundwater recharge bruijnzeel 2004 horton 1933 further studies are necessary to understand infiltration and other hydrological processes in the diversity of natural ecosystems given the high diversity of natural ecosystems within the brazilian tropical savanna regionally known as cerrado we advocate that such a huge biome can be one region for these research efforts 5 conclusion in the present paper we conclude that natural ecosystems under similar soils can have significant differences in terms of topsoil properties including infiltration savannas for their higher presence of woody components biomass and litterfall have higher topsoil permeability to water compared to native grassland declaration of competing interest none 
944,while numerous studies demonstrated the reduction effect of infiltration changes with natural vegetation conversion to croplands few information is available examining inherent differences between natural ecosystems we examined the steady state infiltration rate and other topsoil properties in two adjacent native ecosystem types of the brazilian tropical savanna occurring under a similar soil type oxisol a native grassland and a savanna we found a significantly higher steady state infiltration rate in the savanna 698 521 mm h 1 compared to native grassland 413 181 mm h 1 all soil properties were significantly different when comparing both ecosystem types indicating that higher topsoil permeability in the savanna is potentially related to higher organic matter content lower bulk density and lower penetration resistance previous studies have documented differences in soil hydraulic properties between natural and anthropogenic ecosystems under a similar soil type here we showed that such differences can also occur among natural ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords infiltrability hydrological services hydrology surface soil properties 1 introduction numerous studies of land use change compared natural vegetation i e forests with anthropogenic ecosystems such as soybean neill et al 2013 sugarcane silva et al 2016 pastures germer et al 2010 and eucalyptus plantations salemi et al 2013 such studies and many others usually demonstrated marked differences in terms of hydrological functioning with the main changes as follows a changes in the amount of water reaching the soil due to differences in interception losses b reductions in infiltrability and hydraulic conductivity and increased runoff in more compacted soils under more intense land uses leading to higher peak of runoff these studies clearly showed that anthropogenic ecosystems differ in terms of hydrological functioning compared to native ecosystems however what about differences in hydrological processes within native ecosystems the cerrado biome brazilian tropical savanna is considered a global biodiversity hotspot myers et al 2000 and is composed of a complex mosaic of different native ecosystem types native grasslands forests and savannas with savannas being the dominant one furley 1999 ribeiro and walter 2008 however this biome s ecosystems have received less attention so far compared to other brazilian biomes such as the amazon forest overbeck et al 2015 strassburg et al 2017 the cerrado biome stands out because in many cases its different ecosystem types occur side by side under similar soil type landscape position ball et al 2015 eiten 1972 this kind of distribution in the landscape provides an opportunity to understand how the vegetation gradient influences various soil properties li et al 2004 including water infiltration neris et al 2012 furthermore studies comparing natural ecosystems under similar soil type are important because i they can provide insights on factors affecting hydrological processes other than human activity and ii they may provide information on the different effects of distinct native ecosystems on hydrological processes and thus on hydrological ecosystem services they provide kremen and merenlender 2018 water infiltration is an important hydrological process within the ecosystems it is essential to provide water for plant growth and groundwater recharge de morais 2012 horton 1933 and maintain the baseflow of water bodies bruijnzeel 2004 this hydrological process might be modulated by several inter related factors such as fine roots abundance cui et al 2019 species richness fischer et al 2015 su et al 2018 faunal activity lee and foster 1991 soil bulk density total porosity sun et al 2018 soil organic matter content boyle et al 1989 sun et al 2018 and soil cover almeida et al 2018 cerdà 1999 given that natural ecosystems with contrasting vegetation have different species composition diversity and above and belowground biomass castro and kauffman 1998 they likely have different effects on soil infiltration as well thus apart from land use change studies it is expected that natural ecosystems may also have substantial variation regarding various hydrological processes including infiltration in this context native grasslands and savannas of the cerrado biome are different ecosystems regarding their structure castro kauffman 1998 oliveira et al 2014 native grasslands are dominated by herbaceous plants and thus have lower biomass than savannas castro and kauffman 1998 scholes and archer 1997 previous studies in the region demonstrated an increase in litter production with an increase in woody density costa et al 2020 and that there are differences in belowground biomass between such systems oliveira et al 2005 these differences likely impact on the overall functioning of them costa et al 2020 however experimental evidence is still lacking the objective of the present paper is to understand hydrological differences in natural ecosystems in doing so we examined the steady state infiltration rate in two native ecosystem types occurring adjacent to each other under a similar soil type oxisol native grassland regionally known as campo sujo with few shrubs and savanna regionally known as cerrado típico given that litter production affect the amount of organic matter added to the soil which in turn impacts soil properties such as density and pore space weil and brady 2017 we hypothesize that soil under the savanna system would have higher topsoil permeability to water compared to the one under grassland 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we carried out the study in the strictly protected area reserva ecológica do instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística recor ibge which is located in the south of the federal district brazil 15 56 s e 47 52 w figure 1 brasília is the nearest city located around 35 km from the reserve recor ibge was founded in 1975 before the foundation the area had been used for small scale agriculture subsistence farming ibge 2004 the climate at recor ibge is classified as tropical savanna aw according to the köppen geiger system with annual precipitation of approximately 1430 mm and an average temperature around 20 c figure 2 rainfall is concentrated 94 in the rainy season from october to march malaquias et al 2010 we selected two adjacent ecosystems cerrado típico and campo sujo pereira and furtado 2011 cerrado típico hereafter savanna is a woody type savanna with shrubs and trees according to ribeiro and walter 2008 this ecosystem is characterized by i predominantly arboreal shrub vegetation with low sloping crooked trees with irregular and twisted branches ii common species found are acosmium dasycarpum annona crassiflora hymenaea stignocarpa kielmeyera coriacea caryocar brasiliense pouteria ramiflora anacardium occidentale and salvertia convallariaeodora among many others and iii tree cover is 20 to 50 woody components i e trees and shrubs density is around 1900 individuals ha 1 andrade et al 2002 on the other hand campo sujo hereafter native grassland is composed of a continuous herbaceous layer with shrubs figure 1 common species found in this area are gomphrema officinalis griffinia spp paepalanthus spp aristida

ha 1 giácomo et al 2013 based on a detailed soil mapping in the study area oliveira 2011 the soil under which both cerrado típico and campo sujo occur is a deep well drained soil classified as latossolo brazilian classification or oxisol us soil taxonomy our field sampling revealed that soil texture in the savanna had the following contents of clay sand and silt respectively 78 7 11 7 16 9 11 3 and 4 4 0 5 in the case of the native grassland these contents were 69 5 11 8 clay 21 5 9 4 sand and 9 2 3 silt the soils of both areas had clay texture the thickness of the o and a horizons were 1 and 6 cm in the native grassland and 6 and 9 cm in the savanna 2 2 variables and sampling design we carried out this study in the dry season may to september of 2018 we measured steady state infiltration rate and related topsoil properties during this period such as soil penetration resistance soil bulk density total porosity and soil organic matter content to understand soil permeability to water steady state infiltration rate was measured using the mini disk infiltrometer decagon devices this device uses the analytical solution proposed by zhang 1997 we measured 30 points in each ecosystem type using three transects with ten points each murta et al 2020 the mean distance between each sampling point was 2 m figure 3 we carefully removed the litter layer which had a thickness of 2 cm thus measurements took place on the top of the a horizon moreover to enhance the contact between the infiltrometer and the soil surface a thin 1 mm of fine sand was used to capture the highest range of soil pores we used a suction pressure of 0 kpa the rates of water discharge through the mini disk as inferred from changes in the water levels in the apparatus storage chamber were recorded until steady state rates were reached for at least three times consecutively in cases where no steady state flow was reached the measurement procedure was repeated in the same sampling point until steady state flow rates were recorded after each measurement we inspected the area subjected to measurement to check appropriate round contact between the steel disk and the soil surface in case no round contact was made we repeated the measurement again in the same sampling point to minimize the influence of soil moisture on steady state infiltration rate such variable was measured in a dry month may a previous study in these sites revealed no significant differences in topsoil moisture between savanna ad native grassland in the dry season oliveira et al 2005 thus based on such study we assumed the differences in topsoil moisture content to be negligible between our sites in the dry season in order to predict the response the soil under savana and grassland in accommodating storms of the region we compared our mean of steady state infiltration rate with 5 minutes rainfall intensities of different return periods 100 50 and 25 years available in souza 2014 we measured soil penetration resistance using the stolf impact penetrometer kamaq this device operates using 2 kg weight which drives a slender metal rod into the soil to calculate the soil resistance four impacts were arbitrarily selected and for each of them the depth of penetration was recorded murta et al 2020 the first impact was the inherent rod weight resting on the soil surface and the other three impacts resulted from the impact of the 2 kg weight on the rod into the soil we measured soil penetration resistance in 10 points for each vegetation type these sampling units were chosen randomly between the infiltration linear transects figure 3 we performed the soil penetration resistance assays during the dry season to avoid soil moisture content interference though we have not determined soil moisture in the field we assumed such differences to be negligible especially at the first soil horizon since this region is characterized by a highly marked dry season malaquias et al 2010 we collected 13 soil cores 100 cm³ using an uhland soil sampler to measure soil bulk density 0 0 1 m depth litter layer has been carefully removed before sampling after sampling soil cores were dried for 24 hours at 105 c benegas et al 2014 zhipeng et al 2018 we randomly collected the soil samples within the infiltration linear transects we calculated soil total porosity based on soil bulk density and assuming a soil particle density of 2 65 g cm 3 eq 1 1 α 1 p p s 100 where α soil total porosity p soil bulk density ps soil particle density after soil bulk density determination we took 10 out of the 13 soil samples used to determine soil bulk density and determined soil organic matter content using the loss on ignition method after drying the samples for 48 hours at 105 c we took a subsample of 10 g and then put them in a muffle for 5 hours at 500 c we weighed the soil mass before initial and after final ignition after that we calculated the proportion eq 2 and percentage eq 3 of organic matter content as follows 2 p o m f s m i s m where pom proportion of organic matter fsm final soil mass ism initial soil mass 3 1 p o m 100 where percentage of organic matter pom proportion of
