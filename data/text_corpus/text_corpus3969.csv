concern about climate change and scarcity of natural resources nowadays chemical and physico chemical processes in addition to biological processes are becoming very prominent in new wastewater and sludge treatment technologies and ways of design and operation of wwtp specifically liquid gas transfer is crucial to study several aspects such as the efficiency of the aeration process in a wwtp for the reduction of energy consumption the greenhouse gases emissions or their effect on buffer system in wastewaters crucial for the right description of crystallization and other chemical processes for example regarding the study of the efficiency of the aeration process in a wwtp it is estimated that in biological treatment with forced aeration electrical energy consumed by aeration equipment represents the highest percentage of the total energy consumption in a wwtp some works indicate that the energy consumed by aeration process often exceeds 50 of the total energy consumed in a wwtp rosso and sternstrom 2005 wef 2009 olsson 2013 thus it is clear that finding optimum operating strategies regarding aeration efficiency may translate into significant cost savings in wwtps however the study of the cost savings related to the aeration process in a wwtp is not straightforward due to the multiple interrelations among different operating variables there are various factors affecting the efficiency of the aeration process such as type of diffusers state of diffusers organic loading rate temperature etc in this context mathematical modelling and simulation tools have been proven to be very valuable to carry out these studies several works have been developed in the last years for the description of the oxygen transfer rate in aerated systems on the one hand some authors gillot et al 2005 rieger et al 2006 beltrán et al 2013 describe the oxygen mass transfer rate based on a lumped parameter kla which is a function of superficial gas velocity the liquid properties density of water dynamic viscosity and molecular diffusion air flow rate geometry of the reactor diffuser submergence surface of the tank surface of the diffusers and the aerated area and the characteristics of the diffusers the standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote in addition to all these factors these models also consider the loss of efficiency of oxygen transfer due to wastewater characteristics α fouling of the diffusers f and temperature rosso et al 2008 gillot and hauduc 2008 on the other hand other authors have employed computational fluid dynamic cfd techniques for a detailed description of the bubble size distribution and the effect of hydrodynamics over the mass transfer rate rehman et al 2014 however each of these approaches has its own particular advantages and disadvantages the first approach is based on empirical relationships and utilize a lumped parameter kla that compile the different phenomena that affect the mass transfer rate these models are oriented to the description of oxygen transfer and do not describe transfer of other gaseous components which are crucial for the description of other phenomena such as precipitation redissolution or buffer capacity of the system the second approach describes in a very detailed way the process behaviour albeit on high computational load amaral et al 2017 due to the current needs a compromise is required between a detailed description of the mass transfer rate considering separately the liquid properties air flow rate geometry and dimensions of the reactors and aeration characteristics of the diffusers and the computational cost in this context this paper presents a methodology able to describe liquid gas transfer phenomena for any gaseous components on the definition of different gaseous phases in the reactor it must be pointed out that this modelling methodology is particularly interesting in three cases in which traditional models present difficulties in the implementation or limitations in the prediction 1 aquatic chemistry is relevant in the process in this case having a right description of the liquid gas transfer of co2 or components involved in chemical equilibrium processes is crucial 2 when it is relevant to analyse the supply of gases with different compositions such as supply of pure oxygen to guarantee oxygen concentration supply of co2 gas for ph regulation or analysis of optimum o2 o3 relation in ozonation processes and 3 when very high reactors are being analysed in this case the traditionally used standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote curves given by suppliers cannot be used directly because the curves are available up to some determined height and some specific measurements may be required the modelling approach presented in this paper may be implemented in any mathematical model describing biological and chemical phenomena and in which dissolved gaseous components are considered barat et al 2013 ikumi et al 2014 solon et al 2017 specifically in this paper the plant wide modelling pwm methodology proposed by ceit ik4 grau et al 2007 fernández arévalo et al 2014 2017 lizarralde et al 2015 has been used in this case this methodology constitutes a suitable solution because of the consideration of biological chemical and physico chemical reactions and the incorporation of aqueous solid and gaseous phases and interactions among them offering a detailed description of the effect of the different parameters over the mass transfer rate in this context the objective of this paper is to validate a mathematical model able to represent liquid gas transfer processes in a wwtp constructed based on a physico chemical plant wide modelling pc pwm methodology lizarralde et al 2015 the mathematical model will describe the aeration process and will be calibrated and validated using oxygen transfer efficiency ote values experimentally collected in galindo bilbao wwtp finally once the model has been validated an exploration by simulation is undertaken 2 description of galindo wwtp galindo wwtp is located in sestao bizkaia spain the main purpose of the wwtp is the treatment of wastewater from 20 municipalities 1 5 million population equivalent so the quality of discharge meets the requirements in the nervión estuary the biological treatment in the water line of galindo wwtp treats 345 600 m3 d and contains six equal lines for organic matter and nitrogen removal additionally each of the six lines contains three secondary settlers fig 1 all the dimensions and relevant characteristics of the units present in the biological treatment are gathered in table 1 one of the particularities of the reactors in galindo wwtp is that the reactors are 9 m tall the main characteristics of the flows and concentration in the influent wastewater to galindo wwtp are compiled in table 2 3 mathematical model construction the mathematical model presented in this paper describes the dynamic cod and nitrogen removal and reproduces the liquid gas transfer to represent the aeration process in galindo wwtp this model has been constructed using the physico chemical plant wide modelling pc pwm methodology proposed by lizarralde et al 2015 which offers a systematic way to incorporate chemical and physico chemical processes into biochemical models this methodology requires two steps i the definition of the model components and transformations and ii the mass transport definition for a multi phase model of a wwtp the details for the definition of the model components and transformations can be found in lizarralde et al 2015 this work focuses on the application of the pc pwm methodology for the mass transfer description between aqueous and gaseous phases and the definition of the mass transport for each phase 3 1 definition of the model components and transformations 3 1 1 definition of the biochemical model in this step the biological model is constructed to represent the cod and nitrogen removal processes that take place in galindo wwtp this is done based on the general list of proposed by grau et al 2007 and highlighted in fig 2 the intracellular transformations selected are the ones related to heterotrophic biomass activity under aerobic and anoxic conditions 1 4 nitrifier bacteria activity 3 additionally extracellular transformations to describe hydrolysis 14 and endogenous respiration 15 are selected 3 1 2 definition of liquid gas mass transfer rate liquid gas transfer equations describe the dissolution and stripping process of the gaseous components consumed or formed during the biological activity taking into account the biological processes considered in this case study four gaseous components need to be included o2 co2 nh3 and n2 the mathematical model describes the tendency of the system to reach the equilibrium state the kinetic rate eq 1 of the process is based on fick s first law and is proportional to the difference between the saturation concentration and the real concentration of the gas in the aqueous phase and to the contact area between the gaseous and the aqueous phase 1 ρ k l g a k h i p i c i the saturation concentration of the gas in the liquid is given by henry s law of dissolution which states that the saturation concentration is equal to the product of henry s constant kh multiplied by the partial pressure of the gas pi for gases which dissociate in aqueous solution co2 and nh3 to form ionic species the equilibrium relationship is a little more complex the henry s law coefficient relates that gas phase partial pressures to the concentrations of the un ionised aqueous phase species co2 and nh3 these undissociated species form only a part of the total dissolved concentrations and depend on the solution conditions particular the ph these species concentration are obtained from the general aquatic chemistry model the contact area of the gaseous and aqueous phase depends on the unit process model and is discussed in the mass transport definition the mass transfer rate constant kl g is calculated for each gaseous component the method used for its calculation depends on the solubility of the gas considered the values of the henry s constant table 3 show the solubility of the gaseous components considered in this paper based on these values it can be said that all gases included in the model are low solubility gases except for nh3 for gases with low solubility the mass transfer mechanism of the gas is controlled by the aqueous phase resistance lewis and whitman 1924 thus the overall gas transfer rate constant kl g is limited by the gas transfer rate constant in the aqueous phase kl this kl constant is calculated with a proportionality factor ψ from the kl of the reference compound oxygen kl o2 the proportionality factor of the mass transfer rate constants is given by eq 2 munz and roberts 1988 the proportionality factor depends on the relation of the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid dl i over the diffusivity of oxygen in the liquid dl o2 2 ψ k l g i k l g o 2 k l i k l o 2 d l i d l o 2 n for aqueous phase controlled mass transfer different studies propose different values for the exponent n the most likely values expected are 1 2 2 3 or 1 however the proposed values range between 0 1 n 0 8 the mass transfer rate of oxygen kl o2 is calculated based on higbie s penetration theory higbie 1935 which states that the mass transfer rate constant depends on the diffusivity of oxygen in the aqueous phase dl the slip velocity between the gaseous phase and the aqueous phase υ r and is inversely proportional to the diameter of the bubbles db 3 k l g o 2 k l o 2 d l υ r π d b however the slip velocity is often not measurable and consequently this mass transfer rate needs to be calibrated based on experimental results for very soluble gases such as nh3 mass transfer is limited by the diffusion in the gaseous phase and consequently the overall gas transfer rate is controlled by the gas transfer rate in the gaseous phase kg the mass transfer rate for nh3 was experimentally determined by arogo et al 1999 4 k l g n h 3 k g n h 3 values reported for the mass transfer rate constant for oxygen and ammonia kl o2 kg nh3 are gathered in table 4 if other gaseous components need to be considered their solubility needs to be taken into account in the case of the included component is slightly soluble their kl can be estimated through the kl o2 using eq 2 in the case it is very soluble it can be estimated through the kg nh3 and relation of diffusivities the kinetic rate presented is valid for the conditions for which the model was proposed i e standard condition and clean water however the transfer depends on operational conditions and thus correction factors need to be incorporated into the transfer rate these correction factors need to consider temperature type and state of the aeration system process water characteristics and atmospheric conditions 3 2 mass transport definition for a multi phase model of wwtp following the methodology proposed in lizarralde et al 2015 once the biochemical chemical and physico chemical transformations are defined the multi phase unit processes describing mass transport in the different units of the plant need to be constructed with this purpose the following steps are followed i definition of phases ii definition of transformations inside phases and mass transfer among different phases and iii mass transport definition the detailed description of the construction of a general reactor can be found in lizarralde et al 2015 this section presents the construction of a biological open reactor model 3 2 1 definition of phases the phases included in the biological reactor units to describe the water line in galindo wwtp are presented in fig 3 the unit processes are divided into three phases 1 the aqueous phase vw where all biochemical and chemical reactions take place 2 the gas hold up phase vghu representing the bubbles retained in the aqueous phase and 3 the off gas phase that represents the open atmosphere in contact with the water surface the aqueous and gas hold up phases are considered to be completely stirred reactors whereas it is assumed that the composition in the off gas phase is constant 3 2 2 definition of transformations inside phases and mass transfer among different phases in this particular case the following transformations and interactions are considered transformations in the aqueous phase mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the off gas mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the gas hold up the mass fluxes among different phases are expressed in a modular way using as many state vectors gujer matrixes and kinetic vectors as phases and interactions among them fig 4 see fig 5 the kinetics of the mass transfer processes are presented in the following subsections 3 2 2 1 transformations in the aqueous phase the biochemical and chemical transformations to describe cod and n biological removal selected in section 3 1 1 are the transformations taking place in the aqueous phase 3 2 2 2 mass transfer between the aqueous and off gas phase the mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the off gas phase refers to the gaseous components selected with the kinetics presented in section 3 1 2 5 ρ α k l g a o f f k h i p g o f f i c i the interfacial area aoff of the contact between the aqueous and off gas phase is the area of the reactor under study in the case of transfer between the aqueous phase and the off gas phase the partial pressure of the gaseous component pgoff i is calculated as the molar fraction of the gaseous component in the atmosphere in contact co2 0 01 n2 0 79 and o2 0 20 multiplied by the total atmospheric pressure poff 1 033 atm 3 2 2 3 mass transfer between the aqueous and the gas hold up the mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the gas hold up phase refers to the gaseous components selected with the kinetics presented in section 2 1 6 ρ α k l g a g h u k h i p g h u i c i the interfacial area aghu is the total contact surface between aqueous and gaseous phase this area is calculated assuming spherical bubbles with constant diameter db along the reactor there are various models to calculate the interfacial area in literature however this approach uses the particle model de souza santos 2010 which mathematically models the area with the following expression 7 a g h u 6 v g h u d b f in the case of aerated reactors the bubble diameter db is determined by the type of diffuser being used and the f factor represents the clogging of the diffusers in the case of non aerated reactors the bubble diameter is selected arbitrarily as the most relevant factor is the quantity of gas being formed and the total contact area in the non aerated reactors the f factor is assumed to take the value of 1 since no diffusers are present the volume of the gas hold up vghu phase is calculated using the ideal gas expression 8 v g h u n g h u r t p g h u nghu represent the total moles of gas contained in the gas hold up phase pghu is the pressure of the gas hold up phase which is assumed to be equal in the entire gas hold up phase and its value is an average value et the middle of the height of the reactor pghu is calculated as the sum of the pressure of the atmosphere in contact pgoff and the pressure exerted by the column of water above the middle point 1 2 v l a tan k the pressure of the water column above the middle point needs to be expressed in atmospheres thus a unit conversion is done dividing it by 10 33 9 p g h u p g o f f 1 2 v l a tan k 1 10 33 finally the partial pressure of the gaseous component in the gas hold up phase pghu i is calculated as the product of the molar composition of the gas in the gas hold up phase by the total pressure of the gas hold up pghu phase 3 2 3 mass transport definition the methodology requires the definition of the mass balances at each of the phases present in the unit process the mass transport is applied to the phases that are considered to be completely stirred thus two mass balances need to be applied it is assumed that the off gas phase does not change in time and consequently no mass transport is applied to this phase mass balance for each phase is formulated as follows mass transport in the aqueous phase 10 d m w d t m w i n m w o u t e w w t ρ w w e w o f f t ρ w o f f e w g h u t ρ w g h u ew w and ρw w represents the stoichiometric matrix and kinetic vector of the transformations taking place in the aqueous phase ew off and ρw off represents the stoichiometry and kinetics of mass transfer between aqueous and off gas in the aqueous phase ew ghu and ρw ghu represents the stoichiometric matrix and kinetic vector of mass transfer between aqueous and gas hold up in the aqueous phase m w i n is the inlet water flux and m w o u t is the outlet flux of water mass transport in the gas hold up phase the general expression for the mass transport in the gas hold up phase is shown in eq 11 11 d m g h u d t m g h u i n m g h u o f f e g h u w t ρ g h u w eghu w and ρghu w represents the stoichiometric matrix and kinetic vector of the mass transfer between the aqueous and gas hold up in the gas it must be pointed out that ρw ghu is equal to ρghu w m g h u i n is inlet gas hold up flux and m g h u o f f is the transference flux between gas hold up and off gas the mass flux is calculated from the concentration in the gas hold up cghu i and the gas flow rate as follows 12 m ghu off c g h u i q g h u o f f where qout ghu is the outflow rate which depends on the up flow velocity cs of the bubbles with the following mathematical expression 13 q g h u o f f c s a t a n k v g h u v l however in this case it is interesting to make a distinction between aerated and non aerated reactors in the case of reactors with forced aeration m g h u i n is different to zero and this is the main reason of existence of the gas hold up phase when considering the aerated reactors the mass balance is the same as the general expression 14 d m g h u d t m g h u i n m g h u o f f e g h u w t ρ g h u w in the case of non aerated reactors m g h u i n is zero in this case the main reason of the presence of the gas hold up phase is the biological activity in the aqueous phase and subsequent mass transfer between the aqueous and gas hold up phase in the case of non aerated reactors the mass balance can be expressed as follows 15 d m g h u d t m g h u o f f e g h u w t ρ g h u w 3 3 model implementation procedure as abovementioned the modelling approach presented in this paper may be implemented in any biological mathematical model in which dissolved gaseous components are considered if the gas hold up approach is to be implemented it is required that the gaseous components that are considered to be dissolved in water so2 snh3 sn2 sco2 are defined in a gas hold up phase gghu o2 gghu nh3 gghu n2 gghu co2 the stoichiometry between the aqueous and gas hold up phase is defined as shown in fig 4 having the components and stoichiometry defined the kinetic model is implemented following the procedure presented in fig 6 starting from the input data parameters and state variables intermediate variables are calculated finally from this intermediate variables the kinetics and mass flow rates that are required for the mass transport equations are calculated finally the mass transport equations are defined for each phase present in the reactor 3 4 model based ote estimation from pc pwm once the mathematical model is constructed this section exposes the methodology to estimate the oxygen transfer efficiency ote based on the pc pwm the ote represents the fraction of oxygen transferred into the activated sludge over the total oxygen supplied this is calculated from an oxygen mass balance throughout the reactor 16 o t e q g h u i n y o 2 i n q g h u o f f y o 2 o u t q g h u i n y o 2 i n where yo2 is the volumetric fraction of o2 q is the flow rate and the subscripts out and in stand for outflow and inflow respectively these volumetric fractions are calculated through the mass balances established for the oxygen in all the gaseous phases mass transport of o2 in the aqueous phase 17 m 02 w t c s o 2 w i n q w i n c s o 2 w q w o u t e w t ρ w k l g a g h u k h p g h u o 2 c s o 2 k l g a o f f k h p o f f o 2 c s o 2 w mass transport of o2 in the gas hold up phase 18 m 02 g h u t c s o 2 i n g h u q g h u i n c s o 2 g h u q g h u o f f k l g a g h u k h p g h u o 2 c s o 2 w where qghu off is the outflow rate which depends on the up flow velocity cs of the bubbles with the following mathematical expression 19 q g h u o f f c s a t a n k v g h u v l in addition the up flow velocity is affected by the db f ratio the smaller the db f ratio the lower up flow velocity and consequently the lower the outflow rate from the mass balance it can be seen that the lower the outflow rate the higher the contact time and consequently the higher the ote thus the pc pwm enables the prediction of the composition of the gas hold up phase based on the model parameters such as bubble diameter operating temperature the geometry of the reactor and the air flow rate in contrast to traditional mathematical models this methodology estimates the oxygen transfer independently from the characteristic sheets provided by manufacturers this fact makes the model valid for different reactor heights an experimental estimation of the ote permits determining the parameters that describe the characteristics of process water α the fouling of the diffusers f and the bubble diameter db which are relevant in oxygen transfer as seen in equations eq 5 6 11 and 15 next section shows the calibration of these parameters carried out in galindo wwtp 4 calibration and validation of the aeration process model from the ote values once the mathematical model has been constructed a calibration and validation process have been carried out in order to check the capability of the model to reproduce the real behaviour of the plant the calibration of the model is an iterative process first the plant layout is built by connecting the different process units developed for the case study second the influent characterization is carried out in order to convert the measurements available in the plant into model state variables third biochemical parameters are set starting from values suggested in literature the influent characterization and biochemical parameters are adjusted until the simulations match experimental results finally the model representing the aeration process is calibrated by checking the capability of the model to reproduce the outflow gas flow rate in the aerated reactors and the ote values obtained from experimental measurements the only parameter selected for calibration in the aeration process are the α factor and the db f ratio since the kl values have been taken from literature the biochemical model was calibrated in previous works carried out in the plant grau 2007 beltrán 2013 thus the influent characterization and the parameters for the biochemical model have been adopted from these works therefore this section focuses on the calibration and validation of the methodology to reproduce the oxygen transfer efficiency in the aerated reactors in galindo wwtp with this purpose an experimental campaign was undertaken in the wwtp in order to measure the oxygen transfer efficiency this section presents the main results obtained in the experimental campaign and then the calibration of the liquid gas transfer model to represent the aeration process is carried out 4 1 experimental campaigns this section present the results obtained in the experimental campaigns relevant for model calibration eight experimental campaigns were carried out between july 2013 and february 2014 to test the six lines under different operating conditions the methodology followed for the measurements is named the off gas method and the details are gathered in the asce 18 96 1997 report 4 1 1 equipment set up fig 7 shows a schematic representation of the equipment set up the main features of the equipment are detailed in the following paragraphs the off gas is pulled by a suction pump through the fume hood constructed by ceit it is made out of expanded polystyrene due to its lightness resistance to humidity resistance to the biological activity of biomass present in the activated sludge and floatability the dimension of the internal volume where the off gas is locater are 2 m2 of surface and 0 44 m3 of volume the gas is drawn through two humidity filters filled with silica gel to remove any vapour water present in the off gas in order to measure the gas flow rate and the gas temperature a gas flow rate metre is used additionally in order to have a more precise temperature measurement a temperature sensors pt100 is located after the humidity filter the gas is taken through a co2 o2 analyser that measures the molar fraction of the o2 and co2 in the off gas finally the fume hood has a sensor to measure the dissolved oxygen and temperature in the mixed liquor at a depth of 2 m this is displayed by a controller located near the rest of the equipment all the measurements taken with each of the devices are stored by personal computer pc 4 1 2 measurement procedure the procedure followed for the measurement of the oxygen transfer efficiency is described below the details of the procedure are presented in the asce 18 96 1997 report 1 turn all the equipment on and wait for the time recommended by the provider of the equipment to guarantee the correctness of the measurements 2 calibration of o2 and co2 measurements two points of calibration are used 0 and 21 of o2 are calibrated this is done using the air the atmosphere for the 21 and a nitrogen gas container for 0 analogously co2 is calibrated with 0 and 30 of co2 the same nitrogen container is used for 0 co2 point and a gas containing 30 of co2 for the 30 calibration point 3 locate and secure the off gas extraction hood in the desired position 4 allow the sufficient time for off gas regeneration in the position this time is named aerobic retention time art and is calculated from the suction flow qa and the volume of air underneath the hood va with the following expression 20 a r t q a v a 5 take the measurement every two minutes for a total time equivalent to one art measured variables are i o2 and co2 composition in the extracted gas extracted off gas flow temperature of the off gas dissolved oxygen concentration temperature of the mixed liquor suction pressure and environmental conditions temperature atmospheric pressure and relative humidity 6 repeat from point three until at least 2 of the total surface is covered this section present the results obtained in the experimental campaigns relevant for the model calibration next the results from model calibration and validation are presented 4 1 3 experimental results following the procedure presented above eight experimental campaigns ec were carried out to study the aerated reactors in the six lines in the biological treatment each of the campaigns measured the efficiency of transfer in the aerated reactors in one line the measured reactors were r1 and r2 when working and in all campaigns n1 n2 and n3 in order to cover at least 2 of the total surface as required by the methodology several points were selected in each reactor table 5 shows the number of points measured in each reactor and the percentage of the surface covered the distribution of the points in the surface is illustrated in fig 8 the main results obtained in the experimental campaigns are compiled in table 6 generally speaking the ote values measured experimentally are within the expected values observed in literature trillo 2004 this leads us to think that the aeration process in galindo wwtp has not lost its efficiency due to the use and evolution of time besides it can be seen that the transfer efficiency increases as the flow advances in the reactors due to the lower soluble organic matter content however some exceptions to this general trend are found and need to be analysed particularly the efficiency observed in the aerated reactor n3 during the first experimental campaign is low in contrast to the values proposed in literature trillo 2004 this may be caused due to the low aeration in the reactor during the experimental campaign for the measuring technique to be valid or due to an actual lose in the efficiency nevertheless the second experimental campaign was undertaken in the same line just one week later the efficiency observed in this campaign is for aerated reactor n3 is within the expected values this may leads us to think that the drop in the first experimental campaign was due to the operational conditions rather than a real loss in efficiency the experimental campaign number 4 presents a low efficiency in aerated reactor n2 compared to the rest of the experimental campaigns in the same reactor this need to be taken into consideration since this may reflect a loss in efficiency in the diffusers in this reactor the values observed during the fifth experimental campaign are within the limits presented in literature however some points could not be measured during this experimental campaign in aerated reactor n3 another point that needs to be analysed is aerated reactor n3 during the seventh experimental campaign it can be observed that the measured efficiency at this point is slightly higher than the maximum values reported in literature this could be caused by a lower load of organic matter in the influent during this period of time also the aeration flow rate was low and some points could not be measured using the methodology these deviations from the values expected from the literature need to be taken into consideration and analysed in the validation of the model 4 2 steady state calibration and validation of the aeration process model for the calibration of the aeration process a manual parameter adjusting procedure has been undertaken which was based on the steady state conditions during the experimental campaigns carried out in galindo wwtp according to equations eq 5 6 11 and 15 the transfer efficiency depends on the process water α the fouling of the diffusers f and the bubble diameter db during the experimental campaigns the oxygen transfer efficiency has been measured for the operating conditions in galindo wwtp consequently the effect of process water and diffuser fouling has not been measured separately thus the parameters α and f are considered as one αf for calibration the bubble diameter db has been assumed to be 2 mm which is within the range of expected values for the diffusers present in galindo wwtp the parameter αf has been adjusted for each reactor to match as far as possible the gas flow rate qghu and the ote in each of the aerated reactors in which this was measured the values selected to minimize the error between experimental and simulated data are presented in table 7 the calibrated values are in accordance with values found in literature trillo 2004 the αf factor has been calibrated jointly even if α and f represent different effects because the experimental procedure can only establish the overall value and not the values for α and f independently the α factor represents the influence of surfactants sludge age and other wastewater characteristics over the diffusion of gases in water whereas the f factor reproduces the loss of efficiency of the gas supply system after having been used for a period of time for example by solids that clog the pores in the diffusers consequently the αf factors considers the variation of the diffusion of gases in water due to surfactants sludge age wastewater characteristics and loss of efficiency of diffusers as an example of variation of αf it is observed in that average values for αf in reactors r1 and r2 are lower than in n1 n2 and n3 this is in accordance with expected values since r1 and r2 work at higher solid concentrations table 8 shows the values of experimental and simulated values and the error done with the selected αf ratio for the different lines present in galindo wwtp in the reactor n3 in line 6 the experimental and simulated values do not match the type of diffusers is the same as in reactor n1 and n2 so the same value of diameter should be valid this may lead us to think that the experimentally measured ote and αf is low for the operating conditions as stated in the experimental result discussion the aeration in this reactor was low and consequently the conditions were not valid for the experimental campaign to give good results thus the simulated value is assumed to be correct since the values predicted are within the range expected for urban wwtps in line 2 the measured ote was low compared to the rest of the reactor n1 in the rest of the lines this could lead to think that the efficiency of the diffusers was lower at that point however the simulated data predicts that under the operating conditions during that week the experimental ote is the one expected this means that there is no loss of efficiency in that reactor but that the operating conditions in that week were very inefficient finally the results related to the reactor n3 in lines 1 4 and 6 are analysed since the error at these points is high during the experimental campaigns in which these measurements were taken the aeration flow rate was low for the methodology to give good results consequently it can be assumed that the mismatch between experimental and simulated data could be caused by this effect data gathered in table 8 is shown graphically in fig 9 this figure permits to see at one glance the differences between experimental and simulated data it can be seen that the fit between experimental and simulated results is relatively good fig 9a shows the comparison of the experimental and simulated data the black line represents the linear regression of both sets of data and the dashed lines represent the confidence interval of a 95 for the linear regression fig 9b represent the residuals of the simulated data the mean value of the residuals is 0 22 with a standard deviation of 1 03 4 3 model predictive features the model constructed in this paper has some advantages compared with traditional models available in literature these advantages are mainly given by the capacity of the model to predict the liquid gas transfer of gases other than oxygen and chemical reactions jointly and due to the fact of separating traditional kla into kl and a variable representing the contact area this separation is motivated by the physical fundamentals behind the liquid gas transfer phenomena and illustrated in section 4 3 2 this section presents additional information provided by the model that could be of great interest in the study of novel technologies and processes 4 3 1 prediction of the gas hold up composition one of the main advantages of this model is the separation of different gaseous phases this enables having an off gas phase representing the open atmosphere which does not change in time and a gas hold up phase which varies depending on the biochemical and chemical processes taking place in the reactor fig 10 shows the composition of the gas hold up and the off gas phase in reactors present in the water line in galindo bilbao wwtp the off gas phase has the same composition in all reactors since these are considered to be open reactors the difference between the aerated and non aerated reactors arises in the gas hold up composition fig 10 in the aerated reactors the composition of the gas hold up is determined by the air introduced and the changes in its composition due to the biological activity that consumes o2 and produces co2 in the case of galindo wwtp the reactors present are very high and consequently the composition of the gas hold up is very different from the composition of the gas injected the effect of the height of the reactors will be studied in the exploration by simulation section in the case of non aerated reactors the composition of the gas hold up is determined by the biological activity in the reactor the results predicted by the mathematical model show that in non aerated reactors reactor d fig 1 co2 and nh3 composition are considerably higher in comparison to the off gas due to biological activity taking place in the reactors in fig 10 it can be seen that the main gas in the gas hold up in the anoxic reactor is co2 this illustrates that the transfer of co2 is high with the gas hold up phase if this transfer would not be reproduced there would be co2 accumulation in the aqueous phase this would alter the chemical equilibrium of the system causing a ph drop although at a first glance one could think that n2 composition in bubbles formed in anoxic reactors should be higher the main transfer is done with the off gas phase so most of the n2 formed is transferred to the atmosphere 4 3 2 estimation of kla a second advantage is that separating the traditionally used kla value into a kl parameter and a variable representing the specific interface area enables reproducing the transfer of the oxygen and the rest of the gases independently on the one hand kl refers to the diffusivity of a gas in water and to determine this parameter the phase that limits the mass transfer has to be taken into consideration in the case of gases with low solubility o2 co2 and n2 the transfer kinetics is limited by water phase in the case of these gases as usually done the kl can be determined by the relation of diffusivities and the kl of oxygen as presented in eq 2 for very soluble gases nh3 the transfer is limited by the gaseous phase and in this case kl cannot be calculated through kl of oxygen using the expression in eq 2 the resulting kl for nh3 would be 0 04 d 1 when the values from literature say table 4 that this value ranges between 0 18 and 0 54 on the other hand the variable a refers to the contact area between gaseous and aqueous phases if kla of any gas is referred to the kla of oxygen this would be equal to zero in the non aerated reactors however even if there is no aeration in those reactors the mass transfer of other gases continue existing having the kl of any gas referred to oxygen and a calculated independently enables a good description of the gas mass transfer in aerated and non aerated tanks for any gaseous component for example in the anoxic reactor the contact area of the oxygen is null if the traditional approach would be used the kla of other gases would need further calibration whereas with this new approach kl of all gases is calculated through the kl of the oxygen but the area is calculated independently table 9 the importance of having a good prediction of kla eq 2 and 3 for the correct description of aquatic chemistry and consequently of all biological processes dependent on it must be highlighted being able to describe gas stripping correctly particularly co2 allows predicting ph correctly since the accumulation of the total dissolved carbonate system is avoided specifically in the anoxic reactor 5 exploration by simulation once the mathematical model has been validated further model capabilities have been analysed specifically this section presents the effect of various design and operational parameters over the aeration process efficiency studied by simulation 5 1 effect of bubble size and submergence of diffusers over ote the first exploration carried out studies the coupled effect of the db f factor and the submergence of the diffusers on the ote in total 140 simulations have been run to cover all combinations of the values selected the db f factor represents two effects together the type of diffuser used by means of db and the clogging of the diffusers by means of f the relationship between the diffuser type and the diameter is gathered in table 10 where different providers give a range of db of their system the clogging of the diffusers is modelled with the f factor by changing this value between 0 and 1 the more obstructed the diffusers the bigger the bubble formed f value closer to 0 the db f factor is critical in the efficiency of the aeration process and consequently in the aeration requirements the ratio db f affects the transfer efficiency due to its effect over two mechanisms i on the one hand it affects the up flow velocity of the gaseous phase and thus it affects the contact time the smaller the db f the lower the up flow velocity cs and consequently the gas hold up outflow rate decreases from the mass balance proposed for the gas hold up phase it can be seen that the lower the outflow rate the higher the contact time thus the mass transfer efficiency increases and ii on the other hand the db f determines the specific surface available for liquid gas transfer the mass transfer rate is proportional to the interfacial area concentration thus the higher the interfacial area concentration the higher the transfer rate and so is the transfer efficiency the effect of the db f over the two mechanisms has the same direction thus the smaller the db f the higher the transfer efficiency in this study the db f factor has changed from 1 mm to 14 mm the 1 mm value has been selected to check the potential benefits that would offer changing from the current diffusers of 2 mm to newer diffusers with that produce 1 mm size bubbles and the value of 14 mm has been selected in order to check the effect of losing transfer efficiency or the effect of having other types of diffusers the effect of the bubble diameter has been studied in combination with the submergence of the diffusers this affects the transfer efficiency by two mechanisms i on the one hand the higher the submergence of the diffusers the higher the pressure exerted by the column of water increasing the solubility of oxygen in water and ii on the other hand the higher the column of water above the diffuser the higher the contact time between the gaseous and aqueous phase in order to study the effect of the submergence the reactor height has been changed between 4 5 and 9 m the effect of both parameters on the oxygen transfer efficiency has been analysed and it is presented in fig 11 the blue zone indicates a low value of ote meaning low transfer efficiency the yellow zone represents an average value of ote i e average transfer efficiency and the red zone points out the operating conditions for good oxygen transfer efficiency fig 11 shows that there is an increase of oxygen transfer efficiency the higher the reactor is the maximum transfer efficiency values are achieved for the higher reactors this is caused by higher contact times between the gaseous and aqueous phases also higher reactors exert higher pressures increasing the solubility of the oxygen in the aqueous phase increasing transfer efficiency besides it can be observed that the transfer efficiency is lower when bigger bubbles are formed due to clogging this effect is strengthened when working in short reactors when the bubble size increases from 1 mm to 14 mm the transfer efficiency is 87 lower in short reactors whereas it is 33 lower in tall reactors this indicates that the clogging of the diffusers is more critical in wwtp where short reactors are present 5 2 effect of combining aeration with pure oxygen finally this section is focused on the flexibility of the methodology to incorporate new phases with any composition not necessarily air with this purpose the possibility of combining air with pure oxygen has been studied by simulation as it has been stated previously one of the main capacities of the model is the prediction of the composition of the gas hold up phase when different gas compositions are used for aeration the compositions of the different gas hold up phases considered are also estimated by the model as an example the composition of the different gas hold up phases is estimated in this study fig 12 shows the average composition of the two gaseous phases in the dynamic simulation run in the previous section it can be seen that there exists transfer between the aqueous and two gas hold up phases since their composition is different from the supply composition in the case of the first gas hold up phase slightly differs from the atmospheric composition as it happened when the system was aerated with air however the main difference is observed in the gas hold up phase that results from the aeration with pure oxygen in this case initially just o2 is injected nevertheless due to the biological activity co2 is formed and transferred into the gas hold up phase additionally this model has permitted to estimate the oxygen transfer efficiency of the system present in galindo wwtp when pure oxygen is supplied fig 13 the oxygen transfer efficiency using different supply systems by changing db and submergences have been obtained in a similar way to fig 11 have been analysed compared to the results obtained when using air the oxygen transfer efficiency is observed to be higher in the reactors using pure oxygen these results are unique for this methodology since this information is usually not easily available using this methodology the comparison between pure oxygen and air is more precise than using other models this study shows the flexibility of the model to incorporate new phases in a systematic way and shows the capabilities of the model to correctly estimate the mass transfer when the system is aerated with different gas compositions the mathematical model is devoted to describe the mass transfer among aqueous and gaseous phases for different applications this paper shows its usefulness for analysing o2 transfer however it is suitable for the description of ph by co2 transfer or description of greenhouse gases 6 conclusions the work undertaken in this paper has enabled the study of the efficiency of the aeration process in galindo wwtp in this study the benefits of using a mathematical model that describes in a detailed way different aqueous and gaseous phases and mass transfer among them has been shown first a mathematical model that jointly describes biochemical chemical and physico chemical processes tailored to galindo wwtp has been constructed specifically it has been illustrated that for the liquid gas mass transfer the model is able to reproduce the formation dissolution and stripping of gases for galindo wwtp distinguishing different gaseous phases and their evolution in aerated and anoxic reactors the mathematical model has been calibrated and validated by means of an experimental campaign carried out in galindo wwtp to estimate the oxygen transfer efficiency these ote measurements have been employed to estimate the relevant model parameters the structure of the model uncoupling the mass transfer phenomena from the geometry enables a right description of the mass transfer of all gases considered this permits a correct description of variables such as ote and co2 stripping the right description of co2 stripping enables a good prediction of co2 accumulation in the aqueous phase this permits a right description of the aquatic chemistry and consequently a right description of the ph an exploration by simulation has been carried out to check the effect of various design and operational parameters such as reactor height bubble size total suspended solids concentration or temperature over the aeration efficiency from this exploration the following conclusions can be drawn the effect of the damage of the state of the diffusers reflected by an increase in bubble size and the submergence of the diffusers has been jointly analysed this study has shown the loss of efficiency due to these factors and that the loss of efficiency of diffusers is more critical in short reactors finally the effect of aerating with pure oxygen has been studied showing as expected lower volumetric flow rates the case study has shown the potential of the model to estimate the transfer rate of any gas supplied into the system showing the benefits of having the phenomena described in detailed against modelling depending on engineering parameters additionally with this case study the flexibility of the methodology has been demonstrated to use different gas hold up phases to represent the different aeration form acknowledgment the authors would

concern about climate change and scarcity of natural resources nowadays chemical and physico chemical processes in addition to biological processes are becoming very prominent in new wastewater and sludge treatment technologies and ways of design and operation of wwtp specifically liquid gas transfer is crucial to study several aspects such as the efficiency of the aeration process in a wwtp for the reduction of energy consumption the greenhouse gases emissions or their effect on buffer system in wastewaters crucial for the right description of crystallization and other chemical processes for example regarding the study of the efficiency of the aeration process in a wwtp it is estimated that in biological treatment with forced aeration electrical energy consumed by aeration equipment represents the highest percentage of the total energy consumption in a wwtp some works indicate that the energy consumed by aeration process often exceeds 50 of the total energy consumed in a wwtp rosso and sternstrom 2005 wef 2009 olsson 2013 thus it is clear that finding optimum operating strategies regarding aeration efficiency may translate into significant cost savings in wwtps however the study of the cost savings related to the aeration process in a wwtp is not straightforward due to the multiple interrelations among different operating variables there are various factors affecting the efficiency of the aeration process such as type of diffusers state of diffusers organic loading rate temperature etc in this context mathematical modelling and simulation tools have been proven to be very valuable to carry out these studies several works have been developed in the last years for the description of the oxygen transfer rate in aerated systems on the one hand some authors gillot et al 2005 rieger et al 2006 beltrán et al 2013 describe the oxygen mass transfer rate based on a lumped parameter kla which is a function of superficial gas velocity the liquid properties density of water dynamic viscosity and molecular diffusion air flow rate geometry of the reactor diffuser submergence surface of the tank surface of the diffusers and the aerated area and the characteristics of the diffusers the standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote in addition to all these factors these models also consider the loss of efficiency of oxygen transfer due to wastewater characteristics α fouling of the diffusers f and temperature rosso et al 2008 gillot and hauduc 2008 on the other hand other authors have employed computational fluid dynamic cfd techniques for a detailed description of the bubble size distribution and the effect of hydrodynamics over the mass transfer rate rehman et al 2014 however each of these approaches has its own particular advantages and disadvantages the first approach is based on empirical relationships and utilize a lumped parameter kla that compile the different phenomena that affect the mass transfer rate these models are oriented to the description of oxygen transfer and do not describe transfer of other gaseous components which are crucial for the description of other phenomena such as precipitation redissolution or buffer capacity of the system the second approach describes in a very detailed way the process behaviour albeit on high computational load amaral et al 2017 due to the current needs a compromise is required between a detailed description of the mass transfer rate considering separately the liquid properties air flow rate geometry and dimensions of the reactors and aeration characteristics of the diffusers and the computational cost in this context this paper presents a methodology able to describe liquid gas transfer phenomena for any gaseous components on the definition of different gaseous phases in the reactor it must be pointed out that this modelling methodology is particularly interesting in three cases in which traditional models present difficulties in the implementation or limitations in the prediction 1 aquatic chemistry is relevant in the process in this case having a right description of the liquid gas transfer of co2 or components involved in chemical equilibrium processes is crucial 2 when it is relevant to analyse the supply of gases with different compositions such as supply of pure oxygen to guarantee oxygen concentration supply of co2 gas for ph regulation or analysis of optimum o2 o3 relation in ozonation processes and 3 when very high reactors are being analysed in this case the traditionally used standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote curves given by suppliers cannot be used directly because the curves are available up to some determined height and some specific measurements may be required the modelling approach presented in this paper may be implemented in any mathematical model describing biological and chemical phenomena and in which dissolved gaseous components are considered barat et al 2013 ikumi et al 2014 solon et al 2017 specifically in this paper the plant wide modelling pwm methodology proposed by ceit ik4 grau et al 2007 fernández arévalo et al 2014 2017 lizarralde et al 2015 has been used in this case this methodology constitutes a suitable solution because of the consideration of biological chemical and physico chemical reactions and the incorporation of aqueous solid and gaseous phases and interactions among them offering a detailed description of the effect of the different parameters over the mass transfer rate in this context the objective of this paper is to validate a mathematical model able to represent liquid gas transfer processes in a wwtp constructed based on a physico chemical plant wide modelling pc pwm methodology lizarralde et al 2015 the mathematical model will describe the aeration process and will be calibrated and validated using oxygen transfer efficiency ote values experimentally collected in galindo bilbao wwtp finally once the model has been validated an exploration by simulation is undertaken 2 description of galindo wwtp galindo wwtp is located in sestao bizkaia spain the main purpose of the wwtp is the treatment of wastewater from 20 municipalities 1 5 million population equivalent so the quality of discharge meets the requirements in the nervión estuary the biological treatment in the water line of galindo wwtp treats 345 600 m3 d and contains six equal lines for organic matter and nitrogen removal additionally each of the six lines contains three secondary settlers fig 1 all the dimensions and relevant characteristics of the units present in the biological treatment are gathered in table 1 one of the particularities of the reactors in galindo wwtp is that the reactors are 9 m tall the main characteristics of the flows and concentration in the influent wastewater to galindo wwtp are compiled in table 2 3 mathematical model construction the mathematical model presented in this paper describes the dynamic cod and nitrogen removal and reproduces the liquid gas transfer to represent the aeration process in galindo wwtp this model has been constructed using the physico chemical plant wide modelling pc pwm methodology proposed by lizarralde et al 2015 which offers a systematic way to incorporate chemical and physico chemical processes into biochemical models this methodology requires two steps i the definition of the model components and transformations and ii the mass transport definition for a multi phase model of a wwtp the details for the definition of the model components and transformations can be found in lizarralde et al 2015 this work focuses on the application of the pc pwm methodology for the mass transfer description between aqueous and gaseous phases and the definition of the mass transport for each phase 3 1 definition of the model components and transformations 3 1 1 definition of the biochemical model in this step the biological model is constructed to represent the cod and nitrogen removal processes that take place in galindo wwtp this is done based on the general list of proposed by grau et al 2007 and highlighted in fig 2 the intracellular transformations selected are the ones related to heterotrophic biomass activity under aerobic and anoxic conditions 1 4 nitrifier bacteria activity 3 additionally extracellular transformations to describe hydrolysis 14 and endogenous respiration 15 are selected 3 1 2 definition of liquid gas mass transfer rate liquid gas transfer equations describe the dissolution and stripping process of the gaseous components consumed or formed during the biological activity taking into account the biological processes considered in this case study four gaseous components need to be included o2 co2 nh3 and n2 the mathematical model describes the tendency of the system to reach the equilibrium state the kinetic rate eq 1 of the process is based on fick s first law and is proportional to the difference between the saturation concentration and the real concentration of the gas in the aqueous phase and to the contact area between the gaseous and the aqueous phase 1 ρ k l g a k h i p i c i the saturation concentration of the gas in the liquid is given by henry s law of dissolution which states that the saturation concentration is equal to the product of henry s constant kh multiplied by the partial pressure of the gas pi for gases which dissociate in aqueous solution co2 and nh3 to form ionic species the equilibrium relationship is a little more complex the henry s law coefficient relates that gas phase partial pressures to the concentrations of the un ionised aqueous phase species co2 and nh3 these undissociated species form only a part of the total dissolved concentrations and depend on the solution conditions particular the ph these species concentration are obtained from the general aquatic chemistry model the contact area of the gaseous and aqueous phase depends on the unit process model and is discussed in the mass transport definition the mass transfer rate constant kl g is calculated for each gaseous component the method used for its calculation depends on the solubility of the gas considered the values of the henry s constant table 3 show the solubility of the gaseous components considered in this paper based on these values it can be said that all gases included in the model are low solubility gases except for nh3 for gases with low solubility the mass transfer mechanism of the gas is controlled by the aqueous phase resistance lewis and whitman 1924 thus the overall gas transfer rate constant kl g is limited by the gas transfer rate constant in the aqueous phase kl this kl constant is calculated with a proportionality factor ψ from the kl of the reference compound oxygen kl o2 the proportionality factor of the mass transfer rate constants is given by eq 2 munz and roberts 1988 the proportionality factor depends on the relation of the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid dl i over the diffusivity of oxygen in the liquid dl o2 2 ψ k l g i k l g o 2 k l i k l o 2 d l i d l o 2 n for aqueous phase controlled mass transfer different studies propose different values for the exponent n the most likely values expected are 1 2 2 3 or 1 however the proposed values range between 0 1 n 0 8 the mass transfer rate of oxygen kl o2 is calculated based on higbie s penetration theory higbie 1935 which states that the mass transfer rate constant depends on the diffusivity of oxygen in the aqueous phase dl the slip velocity between the gaseous phase and the aqueous phase υ r and is inversely proportional to the diameter of the bubbles db 3 k l g o 2 k l o 2 d l υ r π d b however the slip velocity is often not measurable and consequently this mass transfer rate needs to be calibrated based on experimental results for very soluble gases such as nh3 mass transfer is limited by the diffusion in the gaseous phase and consequently the overall gas transfer rate is controlled by the gas transfer rate in the gaseous phase kg the mass transfer rate for nh3 was experimentally determined by arogo et al 1999 4 k l g n h 3 k g n h 3 values reported for the mass transfer rate constant for oxygen and ammonia kl o2 kg nh3 are gathered in table 4 if other gaseous components need to be considered their solubility needs to be taken into account in the case of the included component is slightly soluble their kl can be estimated through the kl o2 using eq 2 in the case it is very soluble it can be estimated through the kg nh3 and relation of diffusivities the kinetic rate presented is valid for the conditions for which the model was proposed i e standard condition and clean water however the transfer depends on operational conditions and thus correction factors need to be incorporated into the transfer rate these correction factors need to consider temperature type and state of the aeration system process water characteristics and atmospheric conditions 3 2 mass transport definition for a multi phase model of wwtp following the methodology proposed in lizarralde et al 2015 once the biochemical chemical and physico chemical transformations are defined the multi phase unit processes describing mass transport in the different units of the plant need to be constructed with this purpose the following steps are followed i definition of phases ii definition of transformations inside phases and mass transfer among different phases and iii mass transport definition the detailed description of the construction of a general reactor can be found in lizarralde et al 2015 this section presents the construction of a biological open reactor model 3 2 1 definition of phases the phases included in the biological reactor units to describe the water line in galindo wwtp are presented in fig 3 the unit processes are divided into three phases 1 the aqueous phase vw where all biochemical and chemical reactions take place 2 the gas hold up phase vghu representing the bubbles retained in the aqueous phase and 3 the off gas phase that represents the open atmosphere in contact with the water surface the aqueous and gas hold up phases are considered to be completely stirred reactors whereas it is assumed that the composition in the off gas phase is constant 3 2 2 definition of transformations inside phases and mass transfer among different phases in this particular case the following transformations and interactions are considered transformations in the aqueous phase mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the off gas mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the gas hold up the mass fluxes among different phases are expressed in a modular way using as many state vectors gujer matrixes and kinetic vectors as phases and interactions among them fig 4 see fig 5 the kinetics of the mass transfer processes are presented in the following subsections 3 2 2 1 transformations in the aqueous phase the biochemical and chemical transformations to describe cod and n biological removal selected in section 3 1 1 are the transformations taking place in the aqueous phase 3 2 2 2 mass transfer between the aqueous and off gas phase the mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the off gas phase refers to the gaseous components selected with the kinetics presented in section 3 1 2 5 ρ α k l g a o f f k h i p g o f f i c i the interfacial area aoff of the contact between the aqueous and off gas phase is the area of the reactor under study in the case of transfer between the aqueous phase and the off gas phase the partial pressure of the gaseous component pgoff i is calculated as the molar fraction of the gaseous component in the atmosphere in contact co2 0 01 n2 0 79 and o2 0 20 multiplied by the total atmospheric pressure poff 1 033 atm 3 2 2 3 mass transfer between the aqueous and the gas hold up the mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the gas hold up phase refers to the gaseous components selected with the kinetics presented in section 2 1 6 ρ α k l g a g h u k h i p g h u i c i the interfacial area aghu is the total contact surface between aqueous and gaseous phase this area is calculated assuming spherical bubbles with constant diameter db along the reactor there are various models to calculate the interfacial area in literature however this approach uses the particle model de souza santos 2010 which mathematically models the area with the following expression 7 a g h u 6 v g h u d b f in the case of aerated reactors the bubble diameter db is determined by the type of diffuser being used and the f factor represents the clogging of the diffusers in the case of non aerated reactors the bubble diameter is selected arbitrarily as the most relevant factor is the quantity of gas being formed and the total contact area in the non aerated reactors the f factor is assumed to take the value of 1 since no diffusers are present the volume of the gas hold up vghu phase is calculated using the ideal gas expression 8 v g h u n g h u r t p g h u nghu represent the total moles of gas contained in the gas hold up phase pghu is the pressure of the gas hold up phase which is assumed to be equal in the entire gas hold up phase and its value is an average value et the middle of the height of the reactor pghu is calculated as the sum of the pressure of the atmosphere in contact pgoff and the pressure exerted by the column of water above the middle point 1 2 v l a tan k the pressure of the water column above the middle point needs to be expressed in atmospheres thus a unit conversion is done dividing it by 10 33 9 p g h u p g o f f 1 2 v l a tan k 1 10 33 finally the partial pressure of the gaseous component in the gas hold up phase pghu i is calculated as the product of the molar composition of the gas in the gas hold up phase by the total pressure of the gas hold up pghu phase 3 2 3 mass transport definition the methodology requires the definition of the mass balances at each of the phases present in the unit process the mass transport is applied to the phases that are considered to be completely stirred thus two mass balances need to be applied it is assumed that the off gas phase does not change in time and consequently no mass transport is applied to this phase mass balance for each phase is formulated as follows mass transport in the aqueous phase 10 d m w d t m w i n m w o u t e w w t ρ w w e w o f f t ρ w o f f e w g h u t ρ w g h u ew w and ρw w represents the stoichiometric matrix and kinetic vector of the transformations taking place in the aqueous phase ew off and ρw off represents the stoichiometry and kinetics of mass transfer between aqueous and off gas in the aqueous phase ew ghu and ρw ghu represents the stoichiometric matrix and kinetic vector of mass transfer between aqueous and gas hold up in the aqueous phase m w i n is the inlet water flux and m w o u t is the outlet flux of water mass transport in the gas hold

stoichiometric matrix and kinetic vector of the mass transfer between the aqueous and gas hold up in the gas it must be pointed out that ρw ghu is equal to ρghu w m g h u i n is inlet gas hold up flux and m g h u o f f is the transference flux between gas hold up and off gas the mass flux is calculated from the concentration in the gas hold up cghu i and the gas flow rate as follows 12 m ghu off c g h u i q g h u o f f where qout ghu is the outflow rate which depends on the up flow velocity cs of the bubbles with the following mathematical expression 13 q g h u o f f c s a t a n k v g h u v l however in this case it is interesting to make a distinction between aerated and non aerated reactors in the case of reactors with forced aeration m g h u i n is different to zero and this is the main reason of existence of the gas hold up phase when considering the aerated reactors the mass balance is the same as the general expression 14 d m g h u d t m g h u i n m g h u o f f e g h u w t ρ g h u w in the case of non aerated reactors m g h u i n is zero in this case the main reason of the presence of the gas hold up phase is the biological activity in the aqueous phase and subsequent mass transfer between the aqueous and gas hold up phase in the case of non aerated reactors the mass balance can be expressed as follows 15 d m g h u d t m g h u o f f e g h u w t ρ g h u w 3 3 model implementation procedure as abovementioned the modelling approach presented in this paper may be implemented in any biological mathematical model in which dissolved gaseous components are considered if the gas hold up approach is to be implemented it is required that the gaseous components that are considered to be dissolved in water so2 snh3 sn2 sco2 are defined in a gas hold up phase gghu o2 gghu nh3 gghu n2 gghu co2 the stoichiometry between the aqueous and gas hold up phase is defined as shown in fig 4 having the components and stoichiometry defined the kinetic model is implemented following the procedure presented in fig 6 starting from the input data parameters and state variables intermediate variables are calculated finally from this intermediate variables the kinetics and mass flow rates that are required for the mass transport equations are calculated finally the mass transport equations are defined for each phase present in the reactor 3 4 model based ote estimation from pc pwm once the mathematical model is constructed this section exposes the methodology to estimate the oxygen transfer efficiency ote based on the pc pwm the ote represents the fraction of oxygen transferred into the activated sludge over the total oxygen supplied this is calculated from an oxygen mass balance throughout the reactor 16 o t e q g h u i n y o 2 i n q g h u o f f y o 2 o u t q g h u i n y o 2 i n where yo2 is the volumetric fraction of o2 q is the flow rate and the subscripts out and in stand for outflow and inflow respectively these volumetric fractions are calculated through the mass balances established for the oxygen in all the gaseous phases mass transport of o2 in the aqueous phase 17 m 02 w t c s o 2 w i n q w i n c s o 2 w q w o u t e w t ρ w k l g a g h u k

p g h u o 2 c s o 2 w where qghu off is the outflow rate which depends on the up flow velocity cs of the bubbles with the following mathematical expression 19 q g h u o f f c s a t a n k v g h u v l in addition the up flow velocity is affected by the db f ratio the smaller the db f ratio the lower up flow velocity and consequently the lower the outflow rate from the mass balance it can be seen that the lower the outflow rate the higher the contact time and consequently the higher the ote thus the pc pwm enables the prediction of the composition of the gas hold up phase based on the model parameters such as bubble diameter operating temperature the geometry of the reactor and the air flow rate in contrast to traditional mathematical models this methodology estimates the oxygen transfer independently from the characteristic sheets provided by manufacturers this fact makes the model valid for different reactor heights an experimental estimation of the ote permits determining the parameters that describe the characteristics of process water α the fouling of the diffusers f and the bubble diameter db which are relevant in oxygen transfer as seen in equations eq 5 6 11 and 15 next section shows the calibration of these parameters carried out in galindo wwtp 4 calibration and validation of the aeration process model from the ote values once the mathematical model has been constructed a calibration and validation process have been carried out in order to check the capability of the model to reproduce the real behaviour of the plant the calibration of the model is an iterative process first the plant layout is built by connecting the different process units developed for the case study second the influent characterization is carried out in order to convert the measurements available in the plant into model state variables third biochemical parameters are set starting from values suggested in literature the influent characterization and biochemical parameters are adjusted until the simulations match experimental results finally the model representing the aeration process is calibrated by checking the capability of the model to reproduce the outflow gas flow rate in the aerated reactors and the ote values obtained from experimental measurements the only parameter selected for calibration in the aeration process are the α factor and the db f ratio since the kl values have been taken from literature the biochemical model was calibrated in previous works carried out in the plant grau 2007 beltrán 2013 thus the influent characterization and the parameters for the biochemical model have been adopted from these works therefore this section focuses on the calibration and validation of the methodology to reproduce the oxygen transfer efficiency in the aerated reactors in galindo wwtp with this purpose an experimental campaign was undertaken in the wwtp in order to measure the oxygen transfer efficiency this section presents the main results obtained in the experimental campaign and then the calibration of the liquid gas transfer model to represent the aeration process is carried out 4 1 experimental campaigns this section present the results obtained in the experimental campaigns relevant for model calibration eight experimental campaigns were carried out between july 2013 and february 2014 to test the six lines under different operating conditions the methodology followed for the measurements is named the off gas method and the details are gathered in the asce 18 96 1997 report 4 1 1 equipment set up fig 7 shows a schematic representation of the equipment set up the main features of the equipment are detailed in the following paragraphs the off gas is pulled by a suction pump through the fume hood constructed by ceit it is made out of expanded polystyrene due to its lightness resistance to humidity resistance to the biological activity of biomass present in the activated sludge and floatability the dimension of the internal volume where the off gas is locater are 2 m2 of surface and 0 44 m3 of volume the gas is drawn through two humidity filters filled with silica gel to remove any vapour water present in the off gas in order to measure the gas flow rate and the gas temperature a gas flow rate metre is used additionally in order to have a more precise temperature measurement a temperature sensors pt100 is located after the humidity filter the gas is taken through a co2 o2 analyser that measures the molar fraction of the o2 and co2 in the off gas finally the fume hood has a sensor to measure the dissolved oxygen and temperature in the mixed liquor at a depth of 2 m this is displayed by a controller located near the rest of the equipment all the measurements taken with each of the devices are stored by personal computer pc 4 1 2 measurement procedure the procedure followed for the measurement of the oxygen transfer efficiency is described below the details of the procedure are presented in the asce 18 96 1997 report 1 turn all the equipment on and wait for the time recommended by the provider of the equipment to guarantee the correctness of the measurements 2 calibration of o2 and co2 measurements two points of calibration are used 0 and 21 of o2 are calibrated this is done using the air the atmosphere for the 21 and a nitrogen gas container for 0 analogously co2 is calibrated with 0 and 30 of co2 the same nitrogen container is used for 0 co2 point and a gas containing 30 of co2 for the 30 calibration point 3 locate and secure the off gas extraction hood in the desired position 4 allow the sufficient time for off gas regeneration in the position this time is named aerobic retention time art and is calculated from the suction flow qa and the volume of air underneath the hood va with the following expression 20 a r t q a v a 5 take the measurement every two minutes for a total time equivalent to one art measured variables are i o2 and co2 composition in the extracted gas extracted off gas flow temperature of the off gas dissolved oxygen concentration temperature of the mixed liquor suction pressure and environmental conditions temperature atmospheric pressure and relative humidity 6 repeat from point three until at least 2 of the total surface is covered this section present the results obtained in the experimental campaigns relevant for the model calibration next the results from model calibration and validation are presented 4 1 3 experimental results following the procedure presented above eight experimental campaigns ec were carried out to study the aerated reactors in the six lines in the biological treatment each of the campaigns measured the efficiency of transfer in the aerated reactors in one line the measured reactors were r1 and r2 when working and in all campaigns n1 n2 and n3 in order to cover at least 2 of the total surface as required by the methodology several points were selected in each reactor table 5 shows the number of points measured in each reactor and the percentage of the surface covered the distribution of the points in the surface is illustrated in fig 8 the main results obtained in the experimental campaigns are compiled in table 6 generally speaking the ote values measured experimentally are within the expected values observed in literature trillo 2004 this leads us to think that the aeration process in galindo wwtp has not lost its efficiency due to the use and evolution of time besides it can be seen that the transfer efficiency increases as the flow advances in the reactors due to the lower soluble organic matter content however some exceptions to this general trend are found and need to be analysed particularly the efficiency observed in the aerated reactor n3 during the first experimental campaign is low in contrast to the values proposed in literature trillo 2004 this may be caused due to the low aeration in the reactor during the experimental campaign for the measuring technique to be valid or due to an actual lose in the efficiency nevertheless the second experimental campaign was undertaken in the same line just one week later the efficiency observed in this campaign is for aerated reactor n3 is within the expected values this may leads us to think that the drop in the first experimental campaign was due to the operational conditions rather than a real loss in efficiency the experimental campaign number 4 presents a low efficiency in aerated reactor n2 compared to the rest of the experimental campaigns in the same reactor this need to be taken into consideration since this may reflect a loss in efficiency in the diffusers in this reactor the values observed during the fifth experimental campaign are within the limits presented in literature however some points could not be measured during this experimental campaign in aerated reactor n3 another point that needs to be analysed is aerated reactor n3 during the seventh experimental campaign it can be observed that the measured efficiency at this point is slightly higher than the maximum values reported in literature this could be caused by a lower load of organic matter in the influent during this period of time also the aeration flow rate was low and some points could not be measured using the methodology these deviations from the values expected from the literature need to be taken into consideration and analysed in the validation of the model 4 2 steady state calibration and validation of the aeration process model for the calibration of the aeration process a manual parameter adjusting procedure has been undertaken which was based on the steady state conditions during the experimental campaigns carried out in galindo wwtp according to equations eq 5 6 11 and 15 the transfer efficiency depends on the process water α the fouling of the diffusers f and the bubble diameter db during the experimental campaigns the oxygen transfer efficiency has been measured for the operating conditions in galindo wwtp consequently the effect of process water and diffuser fouling has not been measured separately thus the parameters α and f are considered as one αf for calibration the bubble diameter db has been assumed to be 2 mm which is within the range of expected values for the diffusers present in galindo wwtp the parameter αf has been adjusted for each reactor to match as far as possible the gas flow rate qghu and the ote in each of the aerated reactors in which this was measured the values selected to minimize the error between experimental and simulated data are presented in table 7 the calibrated values are in accordance with values found in literature trillo 2004 the αf factor has been calibrated jointly even if α and f represent different effects because the experimental procedure can only establish the overall value and not the values for α and f independently the α factor represents the influence of surfactants sludge age and other wastewater characteristics over the diffusion of gases in water whereas the f factor reproduces the loss of efficiency of the gas supply system after having been used for a period of time for example by solids that clog the pores in the diffusers consequently the αf factors considers the variation of the diffusion of gases in water due to surfactants sludge age wastewater characteristics and loss of efficiency of diffusers as an example of variation of αf it is observed in that average values for αf in reactors r1 and r2 are lower than in n1 n2 and n3 this is in accordance with expected values since r1 and r2 work at higher solid concentrations table 8 shows the values of experimental and simulated values and the error done with the selected αf ratio for the different lines present in galindo wwtp in the reactor n3 in line 6 the experimental and simulated values do not match the type of diffusers is the same as in reactor n1 and n2 so the same value of diameter should be valid this may lead us to think that the experimentally measured ote and αf is low for the operating conditions as stated in the experimental result discussion the aeration in this reactor was low and consequently the conditions were not valid for the experimental campaign to give good results thus the simulated value is assumed to be correct since the values predicted are within the range expected for urban wwtps in line 2 the measured ote was low compared to the rest of the reactor n1 in the rest of the lines this could lead to think that the efficiency of the diffusers was lower at that point however the simulated data predicts that under the operating conditions during that week the experimental ote is the one expected this means that there is no loss of efficiency in that reactor but that the operating conditions in that week were very inefficient finally the results related to the reactor n3 in lines 1 4 and 6 are analysed since the error at these points is high during the experimental campaigns in which these measurements were taken the aeration flow rate was low for the methodology to give good results consequently it can be assumed that the mismatch between experimental and simulated data could be caused by this effect data gathered in table 8 is shown graphically in fig 9 this figure permits to see at one glance the differences between experimental and simulated data it can be seen that the fit between experimental and simulated results is relatively good fig 9a shows the comparison of the experimental and simulated data the black line represents the linear regression of both sets of data and the dashed lines represent the confidence interval of a 95 for the linear regression fig 9b represent the residuals of the simulated data the mean value of the residuals is 0 22 with a standard deviation of 1 03 4 3 model predictive features the model constructed in this paper has some advantages compared with traditional models available in literature these advantages are mainly given by the capacity of the model to predict the liquid gas transfer of gases other than oxygen and chemical reactions jointly and due to the fact of separating traditional kla into kl and a variable representing the contact area this separation is motivated by the physical fundamentals behind the liquid gas transfer phenomena and illustrated in section 4 3 2 this section presents additional information provided by the model that could be of great interest in the study of novel technologies and processes 4 3 1 prediction of the gas hold up composition one of the main advantages of this model is the separation of different gaseous phases this enables having an off gas phase representing the open atmosphere which does not change in time and a gas hold up phase which varies depending on the biochemical and chemical processes taking place in the reactor fig 10 shows the composition of the gas hold up and the off gas phase in reactors present in the water line in galindo bilbao wwtp the off gas phase has the same composition in all reactors since these are considered to be open reactors the difference between the aerated and non aerated reactors arises in the gas hold up composition fig 10 in the aerated reactors the composition of the gas hold up is determined by the air introduced and the changes in its composition due to the biological activity that consumes o2 and produces co2 in the case of galindo wwtp the reactors present are very high and consequently the composition of the gas hold up is very different from the composition of the gas injected the effect of the height of the reactors will be studied in the exploration by simulation section in the case of non aerated reactors the composition of the gas hold up is determined by the biological activity in the reactor the results predicted by the mathematical model show that in non aerated reactors reactor d fig 1 co2 and nh3 composition are considerably higher in comparison to the off gas due to biological activity taking place in the reactors in fig 10 it can be seen that the main gas in the gas hold up in the anoxic reactor is co2 this illustrates that the transfer of co2 is high with the gas hold up phase if this transfer would not be reproduced there would be co2 accumulation in the aqueous phase this would alter the chemical equilibrium of the system causing a ph drop although at a first glance one could think that n2 composition in bubbles formed in anoxic reactors should be higher the main transfer is done with the off gas phase so most of the n2 formed is transferred to the atmosphere 4 3 2 estimation of kla a second advantage is that separating the traditionally used kla value into a kl parameter and a variable representing the specific interface area enables reproducing the transfer of the oxygen and the rest of the gases independently on the one hand kl refers to the diffusivity of a gas in water and to determine this parameter the phase that limits the mass transfer has to be taken into consideration in the case of gases with low solubility o2 co2 and n2 the transfer kinetics is limited by water phase in the case of these gases as usually done the kl can be determined by the relation of diffusivities and the kl of oxygen as presented in eq 2 for very soluble gases nh3 the transfer is limited by the gaseous phase and in this case kl cannot be calculated through kl of oxygen using the expression in eq 2 the resulting kl for nh3 would be 0 04 d 1 when the values from literature say table 4 that this value ranges between 0 18 and 0 54 on the other hand the variable a refers to the contact area between gaseous and aqueous phases if kla of any gas is referred to the kla of oxygen this would be equal to zero in the non aerated reactors however even if there is no aeration in those reactors the mass transfer of other gases continue existing having the kl of any gas referred to oxygen and a calculated independently enables a good description of the gas mass transfer in aerated and non aerated tanks for any gaseous component for example in the anoxic reactor the contact area of the oxygen is null if the traditional approach would be used the kla of other gases would need further calibration whereas with this new approach kl of all gases is calculated through the kl of the oxygen but the area is calculated independently table 9 the importance of having a good prediction of kla eq 2 and 3 for the correct description of aquatic chemistry and consequently of all biological processes dependent on it must be highlighted being able to describe gas stripping correctly particularly co2 allows predicting ph correctly since the accumulation of the total dissolved carbonate system is avoided specifically in the anoxic reactor 5 exploration by simulation once the mathematical model has been validated further model capabilities have been analysed specifically this section presents the effect of various design and operational parameters over the aeration process efficiency studied by simulation 5 1 effect of bubble size and submergence of diffusers over ote the first exploration carried out studies the coupled effect of the db f factor and the submergence of the diffusers on the ote in total 140 simulations have been run to cover all combinations of the values selected the db f factor represents two effects together the type of diffuser used by means of db and the clogging of the diffusers by means of f the relationship between the diffuser type and the diameter is gathered in table 10 where different providers give a range of db of their system the clogging of the diffusers is modelled with the f factor by changing this value between 0 and 1 the more obstructed the diffusers the bigger the bubble formed f value closer to 0 the db f factor is critical in the efficiency of the aeration process and consequently in the aeration requirements the ratio db f affects the transfer efficiency due to its effect over two mechanisms i on the one hand it affects the up flow velocity of the gaseous phase and thus it affects the contact time the smaller the db f the lower the up flow velocity cs and consequently the gas hold up outflow rate decreases from the mass balance proposed for the gas hold up phase it can be seen that the lower the outflow rate the higher the contact time thus the mass transfer efficiency increases and ii on the other hand the db f determines the specific surface available for liquid gas transfer the mass transfer rate is proportional to the interfacial area concentration thus the higher the interfacial area concentration the higher the transfer rate and so is the transfer efficiency the effect of the db f over the two mechanisms has the same direction thus the smaller the db f the higher the transfer efficiency in this study the db f factor has changed from 1 mm to 14 mm the 1 mm value has been selected to check the potential benefits that would offer changing from the current diffusers of 2 mm to newer diffusers with that produce 1 mm size bubbles and the value of 14 mm has been selected in order to check the effect of losing transfer efficiency or the effect of having other types of diffusers the effect of the bubble diameter has been studied in combination with the submergence of the diffusers this affects the transfer efficiency by two mechanisms i on the one hand the higher the submergence of the diffusers the higher the pressure exerted by the column of water increasing the solubility of oxygen in water and ii on the other hand the higher the column of water above the diffuser the higher the contact time between the gaseous and aqueous phase in order to study the effect of the submergence the reactor height has been changed between 4 5 and 9 m the effect of both parameters on the oxygen transfer efficiency has been analysed and it is presented in fig 11 the blue zone indicates a low value of ote meaning low transfer efficiency the yellow zone represents an average value of ote i e average transfer efficiency and the red zone points out the operating conditions for good oxygen transfer efficiency fig 11 shows that there is an increase of oxygen transfer efficiency the higher the reactor is the maximum transfer efficiency values are achieved for the higher reactors this is caused by higher contact times between the gaseous and aqueous phases also higher reactors exert higher pressures increasing the solubility of the oxygen in the aqueous phase increasing transfer efficiency besides it can be observed that the transfer efficiency is lower when bigger bubbles are formed due to clogging this effect is strengthened when working in short reactors when the bubble size increases from 1 mm to 14 mm the transfer efficiency is 87 lower in short reactors whereas it is 33 lower in tall reactors this indicates that the clogging of the diffusers is more critical in wwtp where short reactors are present 5 2 effect of combining aeration with pure oxygen finally this section is focused on the flexibility of the methodology to incorporate new phases with any composition not necessarily air with this purpose the possibility of combining air with pure oxygen has been studied by simulation as it has been stated previously one of the main capacities of the model is the prediction of the composition of the gas hold up phase when different gas compositions are used for aeration the compositions of the different gas hold up phases considered are also estimated by the model as an example the composition of the different gas hold up phases is estimated in this study fig 12 shows the average composition of the two gaseous phases in the dynamic simulation run in the previous section it can be seen that there exists transfer between the aqueous and two gas hold up phases since their composition is different from the supply composition in the case of the first gas hold up phase slightly differs from the atmospheric composition as it happened when the system was aerated with air however the main difference is observed in the gas hold up phase that results from the aeration with pure oxygen in this case initially just o2 is injected nevertheless due to the biological activity co2 is formed and transferred into the gas hold up phase additionally this model has permitted to estimate the oxygen transfer efficiency of the system present in galindo wwtp when pure oxygen is supplied fig 13 the oxygen transfer efficiency using different supply systems by changing db and submergences have been obtained in a similar way to fig 11 have been analysed compared to the results obtained when using air the oxygen transfer efficiency is observed to be higher in the reactors using pure oxygen these results are unique for this methodology since this information is usually not easily available using this methodology the comparison between pure oxygen and air is more precise than using other models this study shows the flexibility of the model to incorporate new phases in a systematic way and shows the capabilities of the model to correctly estimate the mass transfer when the system is aerated with different gas compositions the mathematical model is devoted to describe the mass transfer among aqueous and gaseous phases for different applications this paper shows its usefulness for analysing o2 transfer however it is suitable for the description of ph by co2 transfer or description of greenhouse gases 6 conclusions the work undertaken in this paper has enabled the study of the efficiency of the aeration process in galindo wwtp in this study the benefits of using a mathematical model that describes in a detailed way different aqueous and gaseous phases and mass transfer among them has been shown first a mathematical model that jointly describes biochemical chemical and physico chemical processes tailored to galindo wwtp has been constructed specifically it has been illustrated that for the liquid gas mass transfer the model is able to reproduce the formation dissolution and stripping of gases for galindo wwtp distinguishing different gaseous phases and their evolution in aerated and anoxic reactors the mathematical model has been calibrated and validated by means of an experimental campaign carried out in galindo wwtp to estimate the oxygen transfer efficiency these ote measurements have been employed to estimate the relevant model parameters the structure of the model uncoupling the mass transfer phenomena from the geometry enables a right description of the mass transfer of all gases considered this permits a correct description of variables such as ote and co2 stripping the right description of co2 stripping enables a good prediction of co2 accumulation in the aqueous phase this permits a right description of the aquatic chemistry and consequently a right description of the ph an exploration by simulation has been carried out to check the effect of various design and operational parameters such as reactor height bubble size total suspended solids concentration or temperature over the aeration efficiency from this exploration the following conclusions can be drawn the effect of the damage of the state of the diffusers reflected by an increase in bubble size and the submergence of the diffusers has been jointly analysed this study has shown the loss of efficiency due to these factors and that the loss of efficiency of diffusers is more critical in short reactors finally the effect of aerating with pure oxygen has been studied showing as expected lower volumetric flow rates the case study has shown the potential of the model to estimate the transfer rate of any gas supplied into the system showing the benefits of having the phenomena described in detailed against modelling depending on engineering parameters additionally with this case study the flexibility of the methodology has been demonstrated to use different gas hold up phases to represent the different aeration form acknowledgment the authors would

formation was also observed with various real water sources given that zvi ubiquitously exists in the unlined cast iron distribution pipes the deiodination of ipm by zvi during distribution may

during chloramination of ipm containing water with zvi 500 μg l 1 ipm was spiked into four real waters including the raw and filtered waters of a ground water gw based and a surface water sw based drinking water treatment plant in beijing whose major quality parameters are summarized in table s1 these water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane and stored at 4 c until use 2 3 analysis

at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the injection volume was 50 μl and the column temperature was maintained at 25 c the limit of quantitation of ipm by hplc was determined to be 8 0 μg l 1 i concentration was analyzed by ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex ca usa with an as19 column 4 250 mm and an eluent of 30 mm koh at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 water samples were filtered 0 45 μm prior to

detector based on the modified usepa method 551 1 usepa method 551 1 1995 iaa diaa and tiaa were analyzed by liquid liquid extraction with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe derivatization with acidified methanol and quantification by gc ecd with the same capillary column based on the modified usepa method 552 2 usepa method 552 2 1995 the loqs were in the range of 0 1 1 0 μg l 1 for iodinated trihalomethanes i thms and iodinated haloacetic acids i haas as described in our previous study liu et al 2017 concentrations of nh2cl were determined using the standard dpd method rice et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of ipm by zvi the effect of zvi dosage on the degradation of ipm is shown in fig 1 the degradation of ipm by zvi is a slow process ipm was not completely degraded after 72 h with zvi dosage up to 10 g l 1 stieber et al 2011 compared the degradation rates of various micro pollutants with zvi and the degradation rates of two iodinated x ray contrast media were obviously lower than those of ciprofloxacin cefuroxime and methotrexate when the initial dosage of zvi increased from 0 5 to 5 0 g l 1 the removal efficiency of ipm after 72 h increased from 12 8 to 60 8 however with the further increase of zvi dosages to 7 5 and 10 g l 1 the removal efficiencies of ipm after 72 h exhibited decreasing trends compared with 5 0 g l 1 zvi li et al 2008 also found that higher zvi dosage resulted in the higher cr vi reduction rate however over dosed zvi may induce the particle aggregation of zvi which decreases the reactivity of zvi during the transformation of ipm the total organic carbon of the solution remained unchanged data not shown indicating that the transformation of ipm by zvi played a major role while the adsorption of ipm to zvi is neglectable the evolution of ipm with zvi was further evaluated with a kinetic model it was found that the concentration of ipm exhibited a pseudo first order kinetics within 6 h showing a linear dependence of ln c c o on time with a good correlation r 2 0 98 if plotting the k obs values as a function of initial zvi concentration 0 5 5 0 g l 1 a linear correlation 0 02 0 18 h 1 with a zero intercept was observed fig s1 indicating that the reaction was also of first order with respect to zvi 1 d ipm d t k obs ipm where ipm is the concentration of ipm μm t is time h and k obs is observed reaction rate constants h 1 previous studies showed that the reduction of halogenated organic compound could be described by two different mechanisms including direct and indirect reductions li and farrell 2000 stieber et al 2011 the direct reduction may occur after formation of a chemisorption complex eqs 2 3 or by electron tunneling to the physically adsorbed compound which is separated from the iron surface by adsorbed water or an oxide film the indirect reduction is suggested as a reaction of the organic compounds with adsorbed atomic hydrogen hads by the formation of chemisorbed hydride complexes as described in eqs 4 5 i direct electron transfer from zvi at the metal surface 2 fe 0 ri h fe 2 rh i ii reduction by fe2 which results from the corrosion of zvi 3 2 fe 2 ri h 2 fe 3 rh i iii catalytic hydrogenation by atomic hydrogen formed by reduction of h2o or acidic iron corrosion 4 fe 0 2 h fe 2 2 h ads 5 2 h ads ri h rh i as shown in eqs 2 5 both the direct and indirect reductions of ipm by zvi would induce the release of i the evolution of i concentration during the transformation of ipm by zvi was shown in fig s2 there existed a lag period for release of i within 2 h at the beginning the released i from ipm may be very reactive and could re incorporate to organic matter easily yan et al 2016 which induced this lag period after the lag period the concentration of i increased with the transformation of ipm the released concentration of i reached 2 9 μm after 72 h 9 6 of the iodine containing in ipm the transformation of iodine from organic ipm to inorganic i by zvi would influence the i dbps formation during chloramination which needs a further evaluation 3 2 effect of water matrix on transformation of ipm by zvi it has been widely accepted that the water quality plays a vital role in the surface corrosion of zvi which further influences the degradation rate of pollutant stachowicz et al 2008 observed that the existence of anion significantly impacted the removal of contaminants by zvi fig 2 depicts the influence of water quality including ph so4 2 cl sio3 2 and nom on the removal of ipm by zvi as shown in fig 2a the removal of ipm by zvi was highly ph dependent after 72 h approximately 88 8 of ipm was removed by zvi at ph 5 0 whereas only 28 8 68 8 of ipm was removed at ph 7 0 9 0 within the same time period this ph dependent trend of pollutant removal by zvi had also been reported previously kanel et al 2006 sasaki et al 2009 during the direct reduction the ph may affect the formation of an oxide film on the zvi surface and therefore the number of reactive adsorption sites and the distance to the iron surface stieber et al 2011 meanwhile a thin layer consisting of a mixture of feo and fe oh 2 with polymeric structure would be formed under the acidic circumstance which does not increase with time and changes slightly to an akageneite like structure however under neutral or alkaline circumstances the oxidation would lead to the formation of lepidocrocite structure with a continuously increasing surface layer and subsequent a decreasing reaction yield with ipm mielczarski et al 2005 the effects of different levels of so4 2 cl and sio3 2 on the removal of ipm by zvi at ph 7 0 were shown in fig 2b c and d respectively the presence of so4 2 or cl promoted the corrosion of zvi and the removal of ipm the enhancement of zvi corrosion in the presence of cl could be explained by the fact that cl is well known to destroy the passive film on zvi by inducing pitting corrosion strehblow and marcus 2012 similarly so4 2 could be incorporated into the crystal structure and its inner double layer of iron oxide hydroxides to promote zvi corrosion tresintsi et al 2014 after 72 h the removal of ipm with 10 mm so4 2 or cl could reach 78 9 and 88 7 respectively promoted zvi corrosion with the presence of so4 2 or cl could provide fresh zvi which accelerated the transformation of ipm indirectly on the contrary with so4 2 and cl sio3 2 acted as a corrosion inhibitor in fig 2d which could be ascribed to its polymerization and coating effects yang et al 2017 smith and edwards 2005 reported that sio3 2 could be adsorbed on the corrosion products as a barrier as soon as the corrosion of zvi starts which then gradually form silica polymers or amorphous solid phases on the zvi surface to inhibit corrosion the silica polymer coating on the zvi surface remarkably inhibited corrosion of zvi and thus limited fresh zvi was available for the removal of ipm moreover the shielding effect of the sio3 2 shell may further block mass transfer as well as the electron transfer pathway between zvi and ipm thus with the increase of sio3 2 concentration from 0 to 10 mm the removal of ipm decreased from 68 8 to 26 8 because of the ubiquitous presence of natural organic matter in the source water and drinking water different humic acid ha levels 0 10 mgdoc l 1 were adopted to evaluate the impact of nom on the transformation of ipm by zvi it was found that the effect of ha on the removal of ipm by zvi was not obvious like anions fig 2e with the increase of ha concentration from 0 to 5 0 mgdoc l 1 the removal efficiencies of ipm by zvi after 72 h changed slightly 68 8 74 6 when the nom concentration increased to 10 mgdoc l 1 the removal of ipm increased to 81 5 previous study showed that ha was able to act as the electron shuttle to rapidly transfer electrons leading to enhanced reductive degradation of contaminants doong and lai 2005 meanwhile the presence of ha could impact the corrosion process of zvi liu and lo 2011 reported that ha could enhanced the release of dissolved iron in the forms of soluble fe ha complexes and stabilized fe hydroxide colloids which may suppress the precipitation of iron corrosion products on zvi surfaces and enhance the removal of pollutant subsequently the accelerated transformation of ipm by zvi with the presences of ha indicates that the released i ha and residual disinfectant e g nh2cl or free chlorine may coexist during the distribution of drinking water which induces the concern of i dbps formation 3 3 enhanced formation of i dbps induced by deiodination of ipm because of the transformation of ipm from organic iodinated compound to inorganic i the formation species and amounts of i dbps from ipm may change correspondingly which needs a further evaluation the effect of nh2cl on the transformation of ipm by zvi was firstly investigated it was found that the transformation of ipm by zvi could be promoted after the addition of nh2cl fig s3 previous study showed that oxidants including naclo kmno4 and h2o2 could accelerate zvi corrosion and thereby the removal of heavy metals by zvi guo et al 2016 thus nh2cl could promote the ipm transformation via accelerating zvi corrosion meanwhile the oxidation of released i by nh2cl may promote the deiodination of ipm either fig 3 exhibits the formation of i dbps including chcl2i chcli2 chi3 iaa diaa and tiaa with different zvi dosages it was found that the presence of zvi during the chloramination of ipm containing water changed both the species and amounts of i dbps formed after 72 h chcl2i and iaa were the predominant species of i thms and i haas respectively in the absence of zvi the average formation amount of chcl2i was 5 9 0 52 μg l 1 significantly higher than those of other evaluated i dbps the formation amounts of i haas were always lower than those of i thms in the presence and absence of zvi duirk et al 2011 also observed that chcl2i and chcli2 were the predominant i thms formed and iaa was the predominant i haas formed when chloramination of ipm containing water and the formation amounts of i dbps were comparable to this study as shown in fig 3 both the formation species and amounts of i dbps changed obviously with the increase of zvi dosages when the initial zvi dosages increased to 5 0 g l 1 chi3 20 8 1 2 μg l 1 and tiaa 6 9 0 3 μg l 1 became the predominant species of i thms and i haas respectively the presence of 5 0 g l 1 zvi increased the formation amounts of i dbps 6 0 folds indicating that the deiodination of ipm by zvi shifted the iodine source of i dbps from organic ipm to inorganic source i compared with the chloramination of ipm chloramination of i would quickly form hoi i2 eq 6 previous studies have shown that the second order rate constants for the reaction of nom with hoi and i2 were in the ranges of 0 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 and 0 4 1 5 10 4 m 1 s 1 respectively bichsel and von gunten 2000 warner et al 2000 the formed hoi i2 would react with nom or the transformation products of ipm to form i dbps eq 7 6 nh 2 cl i h 2 o hoi i 2 cl nh 3 7 hoi i 2 nom i dbps 3 4 effect of nom and nh2cl concentrations on formation of i dbps the effects of nom and nh2cl concentrations on i dbps formation were also investigated fig 4 shows the formation of i dbps as a function of increasing nom concentration expressed as doc at ph 7 0 the concentrations of chi3 and tiaa increased significantly with increasing doc concentration from 0 to 2 0 mg l 1 and then decreased at a higher doc concentration 5 0 10 0 mg l 1 whereas the concentrations of chcl2i and iaa remained nearly constant in the presence of nom the formation amount of i dbps in the absence of nom was just 8 2 μg l 1 20 3 of the formation amount of i dbps with 1 0 mg l 1 nom obviously the presence of nom provided the organic precursor of i dbps the decrease of chi3 and tiaa concentrations at 5 0 10 0 mg l 1 doc was attributable to the fact that triiodo dbps were less likely to be formed when excess reaction sites of nom were available liu et al 2017 the effect of nh2cl dosage 0 0 2 mm on i dbps formation with the presences of ipm zvi and nom is shown in fig 5 i dbps formation was not observed without nh2cl addition indicating that hoi i2 was not formed during the reduction of ipm by zvi after the addition of nh2cl chi3 and tiaa were always the predominant i thms and i haas species respectively under the tested nh2cl dosages indicating that the deiodination reaction of ipm by zvi occurred and inorganic iodine source was abundant for the i dbps formation xia et al 2017 also observed that the presence of nh2cl could accelerate the reduction of io3 to i via converting i to hoi i2 by chloramine meanwhile all the evaluated i dbps concentrations significantly increased with increasing nh2cl dosages in the range of 0 01 0 1 mm and then decreased at 0 2 mm nh2cl dosage the decrease in the i dbps concentrations at 0 2 mm nh2cl dosage indicated that more i reduced from ipm may be directly oxidized to io3 by free chlorine produced from nh2cl hydrolysis which resulted in less organic i dbps formation 3 5 effect of ph on formation of i dbps as depicted in fig 2a ph is a vital factor governing the reactivity of zvi and the deiodination of ipm our previous results showed that ph also played important roles in the hydrolysis of nh2cl the reactivity of hoi i2 and the formation of i dbps during the chloramination of i containing water liu et al 2017 thus the effects of ph on the i dbps formation during the chloramination of ipm containing water with zvi were investigated fig 6 it was found that acidic circumstances ph 5 0 6 0 facilitated the i thms and i haas formation during the chloramination of ipm containing water with zvi the chi3 and tiaa concentrations decreased obviously from 37 9 1 3 and 12 3 0 2 μg l 1 at ph 5 0 to 1 8 0 2 and 1 2 0 2 μg l 1 at ph 9 0 respectively in general acidic circumstance favored the formation of i haas which is similar to the formation of the regulated haas at various ph values however the most abundant formation of i thms formation at ph 5 0 in this study was on the contrary with previous results that neutral and alkaline circumstances are more favorable for i thms formation during chloramination of i containing water hua and reckhow 2008 liu et al 2017 this inconsistence could be ascribed to that the deiodination of ipm by zvi was preferred under the acidic circumstance which is also the prerequisite for subsequent i dbps formation 3 6 enhanced formation of i dbps with real waters and environmental implications to investigate the i dbps formation with real water sources four water samples including the raw and filtered waters of a ground water based and a surface water based drinking water treatment plant were spiked with 500 μg l 1 ipm respectively then the i dbps formation species and amounts in the presence of 5 0 g l 1 zvi and 0 04 mm nh2cl were analyzed after 72 h due to the different doc contents of the four samples normalized concentrations of i thms and i haas by the doc concentration are shown in fig 7 similar with the ha spiked water in section 3 3 chi3 and tiaa were always the predominant species of i thms and i haas formed respectively indicating that i dbps could form in real drinking water containing ipm during chloramiation overall the doc normalized total yield of i dbps in the four real waters followed the descending order of gw raw gw filtered sw raw sw filtered which may be attributed to their different contents of organic matter the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is widely used as an indicator of aromatic content and dbps formation potential of nom the higher suva254 values of sw raw and sw filtered samples indicated their higher aromatic content than those of gw raw and gw filtered samples in this study it appears that low suva254 nom form more i dbps than high suva254 nom during chloramination consistent with previous results jones et al 2012 chu et al 2016b note that although the i dbps formation amounts after filtration were reduced by 20 4 and 16 8 for the gw raw and sw raw samples respectively 7 1 and 3 6 μg mg 1 i dbps were still formed from the gw filtered and sw filtered after 72 h the insufficient removals of ipm and nom during drinking water treatment processes would provide the opportunity for the coexistence of disinfectant nh2cl nom and ipm in the distribution process then the released i by deiodination of ipm may promote the toxic i dbps formation during chloramination apart from the zvi various iron corrosion products including goethite lepidocrocite hematite and magnetite may exist in iron distribution pipes yang et al 2012 and impact the formation and transformation of i dbps which needs a further research 4 conclusions based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn zvi could transform organic ipm into inorganic i and the transformation of ipm exhibited a pseudo first order kinetics acidic circumstance so4 2 cl and monochloramine could promote the transformation of ipm by zvi while sio3 2 inhibited the transformation deiodination of ipm by zvi shifted the formed dominant i thms and i haas from chcl2i and iodoacetic acid to chi3 and triiodoacetic acid respectively deiodination of ipm by zvi increased i dbps formation amounts by 6 0 folds after 72 h and maximum formation of i dbps occurred at ph 5 0 acknowledgment this work was financially supported by the national natural science

19846,iodinated x ray contrast media icm is considered as one of iodine sources for formation of toxic iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps during disinfection this study investigated transformation of a typical icm iopamidol ipm by zero valent iron zvi and the effect of transformation on the formation of i dbps during chloramination it was found that the presence of zvi could deiodinate ipm into i and the transformation of ipm exhibited a pseudo first order kinetics acidic circumstance so4 2 cl and monochloramine could promote the transformation of ipm by zvi while sio3 2 inhibited the transformation of ipm moreover the transformation of ipm by zvi changed both the formed species and amounts of i dbps during chloramination during the chloramination of ipm containing water chcl2i and iodoacetic acid were the predominant iodinated trihalomethanes i thms and iodinated haloacetic acids i haas respectively in the absence of zvi while chi3 and triiodoacetic acid became the predominant ones with 1 0 g l 1 zvi the addition of 5 0 g l 1 zvi increased i dbps formation amounts by 6 0 folds after 72 h and maximum formation of i dbps occurred at ph 5 0 enhanced i dbps formation was also observed with various real water sources given that zvi ubiquitously exists in the unlined cast iron distribution pipes the deiodination of ipm by zvi during distribution may increase the formation of i dbps which needs receive enough attention graphical abstract image 1 keywords iodinated disinfection by products iopamidol zvi chloramination 1 introduction because of their potential adverse health effects disinfection by products dbps formation during water treatment and distribution is one of the great concerns hu et al 2016 dong et al 2017 many water utilities

quality arnold and edwards 2012 sakai et al 2016 liu et al 2017 formation of toxic i dbps is a growing concern for water utilities it has been verified that i dbps generally are more cytotoxic genotoxic and developmental toxic than their chlorinated or brominated analogs richardson et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 the iodine source for the i dbps formation including inorganic iodide i and iodine containing organic compound wang et al 2014 as a medical diagnostic agent used for imaging blood vessels and organs in iodinated x ray contrast media iopamidol ipm is among the most recalcitrant and highly persistent pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment seitz et al 2006 oulton et al 2010 increasing concentrations of ipm have been detected in the hospital and domestic wastewater treated wastewater effluent surface water groundwater and even finished drinking water with concentration up to μg l 1 level echeverria et al 2013 as the iodine element of ipm is up to 50 ipm not only contributes substantially to the total organic indine in water but also acts as a potential iodine source for the formation i dbps duirk et al 2011 continued efforts have been made to identify the formation mechanism and pathway of i dbps with different iodine sources i e organic iodine containing compound and inorganic i during disinfection duirk et al 2011 yan et al 2016 xia et al 2017 wang et al 2014 reported that the chloramination of i exhibited much higher i dbps formation than that of ipm duirk et al 2011 found that both the formation amounts and species of i dbps during chloramination differed with inorganic and organic iodine sources dichloroiodomethane chcl2i dominated the formed i dbps when ipm was the iodine source whereas the most abundant i dbps was iodoform chi3 during the chloramination of i and nom the transformation of ipm during water treatment and distribution processes may induce the release of inorganic i from ipm which would influence the formation amount and species of i dbps wendel et al 2016 unlined cast iron pipe is widely adopted in the distribution of drinking water from dwtps to consumers for several centuries all over the world zhu et al 2014 as a kind of highly reactive cost effective and environment friendly material zero valent iron zvi has been extensively employed to remove various contaminants via releasing electrons to target compound noubactep 2015 it has been verified that the presence of zvi in the unlined cast iron distribution pipe could promote or diminish the formation of dbps during drinking water distribution wang and zhu 2010 xia et al 2017 chu et al 2016a observed that dichloroacetamide can be formed in the absence of chlorinated disinfectants through reduction of three chloramphenicol antibiotics by zvi which provided new insights to rethink the effect of distribution process on the formation pathway of dbps meanwhile various halogenated organic molecules are susceptible to zvi reduction including haloacetic acids halonitromethane trichloroethylene and polychlorinated biphenyls chu et al 2016b pearson et al 2005 yin et al 2016 recently xia et al 2017 found that highly cytotoxic iodinated trihalomethanes could be generated from iodate containing waters in the presence of zvi during chloramination the reduction of io3 to i by zvi and subsequent oxidation of i by chloramine enhance the formation of i dbps as most water distribution networks contain unlined cast iron pipes the presence of zvi in cast iron pipes may induce the deiodination of ipm and the release of i however the transformation of ipm during drinking water distribution and the effects of ipm transformation on the formation i dbps during chloramination were rarely reported the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the transformation of ipm by zvi 2 clarify the effects of water matrix on the transformation of ipm by zvi 3 investigate the effect of ipm transformation by zvi on toxic i dbps formation during chloramination it is expected to illustrate the behavior and fate of ipm during distribution to understand the potential i dbps formation mechanisms and pathways 2

trihalomethanes i thms and iodinated haloacetic acids i haas as described in our previous study liu et al 2017 concentrations of nh2cl were determined using the standard dpd method rice et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of ipm by zvi the effect of zvi dosage on the degradation of ipm is shown in fig 1 the degradation of ipm by zvi is a slow process ipm was not completely degraded after 72 h with zvi dosage up to 10 g l 1 stieber et al 2011 compared the degradation rates of various micro pollutants with zvi and the degradation rates of two iodinated x ray contrast media were obviously lower than those of ciprofloxacin cefuroxime and methotrexate when the initial dosage of zvi increased from 0 5 to 5 0 g l 1 the removal efficiency of ipm after 72 h increased from 12 8 to 60 8 however with the further increase of zvi dosages to 7 5 and 10 g l 1 the removal efficiencies of ipm after 72 h exhibited decreasing trends compared with 5 0 g l 1 zvi li et al 2008 also found that higher zvi dosage resulted in the higher cr vi reduction rate however over dosed zvi may induce the particle aggregation of zvi which decreases the reactivity of zvi during the transformation of ipm the total organic carbon of the solution remained unchanged data not shown indicating that the transformation of ipm by zvi played a major role while the adsorption of ipm to zvi is neglectable the evolution of ipm with zvi was further evaluated with a kinetic model it was found that the concentration of ipm exhibited a pseudo first order kinetics within 6 h showing a linear dependence of ln c c o on time with a good correlation r 2 0 98 if plotting the k obs values as a function of initial zvi concentration 0 5 5 0 g l 1 a linear correlation 0 02 0 18 h 1 with a zero intercept was observed fig s1 indicating that the reaction was also of first order with respect to zvi 1 d ipm d t k obs ipm where ipm is the concentration of ipm μm t is time h and k obs is observed reaction rate constants h 1 previous studies showed that the reduction of halogenated organic compound could be described by two different mechanisms including direct and indirect reductions li and farrell 2000 stieber et al 2011 the direct reduction may occur after formation of a chemisorption complex eqs 2 3 or by electron tunneling to the physically adsorbed compound which is separated from the iron surface by adsorbed water or an oxide film the indirect reduction is suggested as a reaction of the organic compounds with adsorbed atomic hydrogen hads by the formation of chemisorbed hydride complexes as described in eqs 4 5 i direct electron transfer from zvi at the metal surface 2 fe 0 ri h fe 2 rh i ii reduction by fe2 which results from the corrosion of zvi 3 2 fe 2 ri h 2 fe 3 rh i iii catalytic hydrogenation by atomic hydrogen formed by reduction of h2o or acidic iron corrosion 4 fe 0 2 h fe 2 2 h ads 5 2 h ads ri h rh i as shown in eqs 2 5 both the direct and indirect reductions of ipm by zvi would induce the release of i the evolution of i concentration during the transformation of ipm by zvi was shown in fig s2 there existed a lag period for release of i within 2 h at the beginning the released i from ipm may be very reactive and could re incorporate to organic matter easily yan et al 2016 which induced this lag period after the lag period the concentration of i increased with the transformation of ipm the released concentration of i reached 2 9 μm after 72 h 9 6 of the iodine containing in ipm the transformation of iodine from organic ipm to inorganic i by zvi would influence the i dbps formation during chloramination which needs a further evaluation 3 2 effect of water matrix on transformation of ipm by zvi it has been widely accepted that the water quality plays a vital role in the surface corrosion of zvi which further influences the degradation rate of pollutant stachowicz et al 2008 observed that the existence of anion significantly impacted the removal of contaminants by zvi fig 2 depicts the influence of water quality including ph so4 2 cl sio3 2 and nom on the removal of ipm by zvi as shown in fig 2a the removal of ipm by zvi was highly ph dependent after 72 h approximately 88 8 of ipm was removed by zvi at ph 5 0 whereas only 28 8 68 8 of ipm was removed at ph 7 0 9 0 within the same time period this ph dependent trend of pollutant removal by zvi had also been reported previously kanel et al 2006 sasaki et al 2009 during the direct reduction the ph may affect the formation of an oxide film on the zvi surface and therefore the number of reactive adsorption sites and the distance to the iron surface stieber et al 2011 meanwhile a thin layer consisting of a mixture of feo and fe oh 2 with polymeric structure would be formed under the acidic circumstance which does not increase with time and changes slightly to an akageneite like structure however under neutral or alkaline circumstances the oxidation would lead to the formation of lepidocrocite structure with a continuously increasing surface layer and subsequent a decreasing reaction yield with ipm mielczarski et al 2005 the effects of different levels of so4 2 cl and sio3 2 on the removal of ipm by zvi at ph 7 0 were shown in fig 2b c and d respectively the presence of so4 2 or cl promoted the corrosion of zvi and the removal of ipm the enhancement of zvi corrosion in the presence of cl could be explained by the fact that cl is well known to destroy the passive film on zvi by inducing pitting corrosion strehblow and marcus 2012 similarly so4 2 could be incorporated into the crystal structure and its inner double layer of iron oxide hydroxides to promote zvi corrosion tresintsi et al 2014 after 72 h the removal of ipm with 10 mm so4 2 or cl could reach 78 9 and 88 7 respectively promoted zvi corrosion with the presence of so4 2 or cl could provide fresh zvi which accelerated the transformation of ipm indirectly on the contrary with so4 2 and cl sio3 2 acted as a corrosion inhibitor in fig 2d which could be ascribed to its polymerization and coating effects yang et al 2017 smith and edwards 2005 reported that sio3 2 could be adsorbed on the corrosion products as a barrier as soon as the corrosion of zvi starts which then gradually form silica polymers or amorphous solid phases on the zvi surface to inhibit corrosion the silica polymer coating on the zvi surface remarkably inhibited corrosion of zvi and thus limited fresh zvi was available for the removal of ipm moreover the shielding effect of the sio3 2 shell may further block mass transfer as well as the electron transfer pathway between zvi and ipm thus with the increase of sio3 2 concentration from 0 to 10 mm the removal of ipm decreased from 68 8 to 26 8 because of the ubiquitous presence of natural organic matter in the source water and drinking water different humic acid ha levels 0 10 mgdoc l 1 were adopted to evaluate the impact of nom on the transformation of ipm by zvi it was found that the effect of ha on the removal of ipm by zvi was not obvious like anions fig 2e with the increase of ha concentration from 0 to 5 0 mgdoc l 1 the removal efficiencies of ipm by zvi after 72 h changed slightly 68 8 74 6 when the nom concentration increased to 10 mgdoc l 1 the removal of ipm increased to 81 5 previous study showed that ha was able to act as the electron shuttle to rapidly transfer electrons leading to enhanced reductive degradation of contaminants doong and lai 2005 meanwhile the presence of ha could impact the corrosion process of zvi liu and lo 2011 reported that ha could enhanced the release of dissolved iron in the forms of soluble fe ha complexes and stabilized fe hydroxide colloids which may suppress the precipitation of iron corrosion products on zvi surfaces and enhance the removal of pollutant subsequently the accelerated transformation of ipm by zvi with the presences of ha indicates that the released i ha and residual disinfectant e g nh2cl or free chlorine may coexist during the distribution of drinking water which induces the concern of i dbps formation 3 3 enhanced formation of i dbps induced by deiodination of ipm because of the transformation of ipm from organic iodinated compound to inorganic i the formation species and amounts of i dbps from ipm may change correspondingly which needs a further evaluation the effect of nh2cl on the transformation of ipm by zvi was firstly investigated it was found that the transformation of ipm by zvi could be promoted after the addition of nh2cl fig s3 previous study showed that oxidants including naclo kmno4 and h2o2 could accelerate zvi corrosion and thereby the removal of heavy metals by zvi guo et al 2016 thus nh2cl could promote the ipm transformation via accelerating zvi corrosion meanwhile the oxidation of released i by nh2cl may promote the deiodination of ipm either fig 3 exhibits the formation of i dbps including chcl2i chcli2 chi3 iaa diaa and tiaa with different zvi dosages it was found that the presence of zvi during the chloramination of ipm containing water changed both the species and amounts of i dbps formed after 72 h chcl2i and iaa were the predominant species of i thms and i haas respectively in the absence of zvi the average formation amount of chcl2i was 5 9 0 52 μg l 1 significantly higher than those of other evaluated i dbps the formation amounts of i haas were always lower than those of i thms in the presence and absence of zvi duirk et al 2011 also observed that chcl2i and chcli2 were the predominant i thms formed and iaa was the predominant i haas formed when chloramination of ipm containing water and the formation amounts of i dbps were comparable to this study as shown in fig 3 both the formation species and amounts of i dbps changed obviously with the increase of zvi dosages when the initial zvi dosages increased to 5 0 g l 1 chi3 20 8 1 2 μg l 1 and tiaa 6 9 0 3 μg l 1 became the predominant species of i thms and i haas respectively the presence of 5 0 g l 1 zvi increased the formation amounts of i dbps 6 0 folds indicating that the deiodination of ipm by zvi shifted the iodine source of i dbps from organic ipm to inorganic source i compared with the chloramination of ipm chloramination of i would quickly form hoi i2 eq 6 previous studies have shown that the second order rate constants for the reaction of nom with hoi and i2 were in the ranges of 0 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 and 0 4 1 5 10 4 m 1 s 1 respectively bichsel and von gunten 2000 warner et al 2000 the formed hoi i2 would react with nom or the transformation products of ipm to form i dbps eq 7 6 nh 2 cl i h 2 o hoi i 2 cl nh 3 7 hoi i 2 nom i dbps 3 4 effect of nom and nh2cl concentrations on formation of i dbps the effects of nom and nh2cl concentrations on i dbps formation were also investigated fig 4 shows the formation of i dbps as a function of increasing nom concentration expressed as doc at ph 7 0 the concentrations of chi3 and tiaa increased significantly with increasing doc concentration from 0 to 2 0 mg l 1 and then decreased at a higher doc concentration 5 0 10 0 mg l 1 whereas the concentrations of chcl2i and iaa remained nearly constant in the presence of nom the formation amount of i dbps in the absence of nom was just 8 2 μg l 1 20 3 of the formation amount of i dbps with 1 0 mg l 1 nom obviously the presence of nom provided the organic precursor of i dbps the decrease of chi3 and tiaa concentrations at 5 0 10 0 mg l 1 doc was attributable to the fact that triiodo dbps were less likely to be formed when excess reaction sites of nom were available liu et al 2017 the effect of nh2cl dosage 0 0 2 mm on i dbps formation with the presences of ipm zvi and nom is shown in fig 5 i dbps formation was not observed without nh2cl addition indicating that hoi i2 was not formed during the reduction of ipm by zvi after the addition of nh2cl chi3 and tiaa were always the predominant i thms and i haas species respectively under the tested nh2cl dosages indicating that the deiodination reaction of ipm by zvi occurred and inorganic iodine source was abundant for the i dbps formation xia et al 2017 also observed that the presence of nh2cl could accelerate the reduction of io3 to i via converting i to hoi i2 by chloramine meanwhile all the evaluated i dbps concentrations significantly increased with increasing nh2cl dosages in the range of 0 01 0 1 mm and then decreased at 0 2 mm nh2cl dosage the decrease in the i dbps concentrations at 0 2 mm nh2cl dosage indicated that more i reduced from ipm may be directly oxidized to io3 by free chlorine produced from nh2cl hydrolysis which resulted in less organic i dbps formation 3 5 effect of ph on formation of i dbps as depicted in fig 2a ph is a vital factor governing the reactivity of zvi and the deiodination of ipm our previous results showed that ph also played important roles in the hydrolysis of nh2cl the reactivity of hoi i2 and the formation of i dbps during the chloramination of i containing water liu et al 2017 thus the effects of ph on the i dbps formation during the chloramination of ipm containing water with zvi were investigated fig 6 it was found that acidic circumstances ph 5 0 6 0 facilitated the i thms and i haas formation during the chloramination of ipm containing water with zvi the chi3 and tiaa concentrations decreased obviously from 37 9 1 3 and 12 3 0 2 μg l 1 at ph 5 0 to 1 8 0 2 and 1 2 0 2 μg l 1 at ph 9 0 respectively in general acidic circumstance favored the formation of i haas which is similar to the formation of the regulated haas at various ph values however the most abundant formation of i thms formation at ph 5 0 in this study was on the contrary with previous results that neutral and alkaline circumstances are more favorable for i thms formation during chloramination of i containing water hua and reckhow 2008 liu et al 2017 this inconsistence could be ascribed to that the deiodination of ipm by zvi was preferred under the acidic circumstance which is also the prerequisite for subsequent i dbps formation 3 6 enhanced formation of i dbps with real waters and environmental implications to investigate the i dbps formation with real water sources four water samples including the raw and filtered waters of a ground water based and a surface water based drinking water treatment plant were spiked with 500 μg l 1 ipm respectively then the i dbps formation species and amounts in the presence of 5 0 g l 1 zvi and 0 04 mm nh2cl were analyzed after 72 h due to the different doc contents of the four samples normalized concentrations of i thms and i haas by the doc concentration are shown in fig 7 similar with the ha spiked water in section 3 3 chi3 and tiaa were always the predominant species of i thms and i haas formed respectively indicating that i dbps could form in real drinking water containing ipm during chloramiation overall the doc normalized total yield of i dbps in the four real waters followed the descending order of gw raw gw filtered sw raw sw filtered which may be attributed to their different contents of organic matter the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is widely used as an indicator of aromatic content and dbps formation potential of nom the higher suva254 values of sw raw and sw filtered samples indicated their higher aromatic content than those of gw raw and gw filtered samples in this study it appears that low suva254 nom form more i dbps than high suva254 nom during chloramination consistent with previous results jones et al 2012 chu et al 2016b note that although the i dbps formation amounts after filtration were reduced by 20 4 and 16 8 for the gw raw and sw raw samples respectively 7 1 and 3 6 μg mg 1 i dbps were still formed from the gw filtered and sw filtered after 72 h the insufficient removals of ipm and nom during drinking water treatment processes would provide the opportunity for the coexistence of disinfectant nh2cl nom and ipm in the distribution process then the released i by deiodination of ipm may promote the toxic i dbps formation during chloramination apart from the zvi various iron corrosion products including goethite lepidocrocite hematite and magnetite may exist in iron distribution pipes yang et al 2012 and impact the formation and transformation of i dbps which needs a further research 4 conclusions based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn zvi could transform organic ipm into inorganic i and the transformation of ipm exhibited a pseudo first order kinetics acidic circumstance so4 2 cl and monochloramine could promote the transformation of ipm by zvi while sio3 2 inhibited the transformation deiodination of ipm by zvi shifted the formed dominant i thms and i haas from chcl2i and iodoacetic acid to chi3 and triiodoacetic acid respectively deiodination of ipm by zvi increased i dbps formation amounts by 6 0 folds after 72 h and maximum formation of i dbps occurred at ph 5 0 acknowledgment this work was financially supported by the national natural science

19847,here we detail a previously unappreciated loss mechanism inherent to capacitive deionization cdi cycling operation that has a substantial role determining performance this mechanism reflects the fact that desalinated water inside a cell is partially lost to re salination if desorption is carried out immediately after adsorption we describe such effects by a parameter called the flow efficiency and show that this efficiency is distinct from and yet multiplicative with other highly studied adsorption efficiencies flow losses can be minimized by flowing more feed solution through the cell during desalination however this also results in less effluent concentration reduction while the rationale outlined here is applicable to all cdi cell architectures that rely on cycling we validate our model with a flow through electrode cdi device operated in constant current mode we find excellent agreement between flow efficiency model predictions and experimental results thus giving researchers simple equations by which they can estimate this distinct loss process for their operation keywords capacitive desalination capacitive deionization cdi flow efficiency 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a promising technology for low cost selective ion removal from low ionic strength solvent streams oren 2008 ferreira and trierweiler 2009 andelman 2011 porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 li et al 2016 zhao et al 2012b the technique uses an applied bias across conductive porous or redox active electrodes to remove ions from solution and store them within electric double layers or redox sites biesheuvel and bazant 2010 johnson and newman 1971 lee et al 2014 after a period of removal the trapped ions are subsequently discharged from the electrodes to create a brine stream by either short circuiting or reversing lessening the current voltage of the many active areas of research in this field including materials development and cell design liu et al 2015 suss et al 2015 porada et al 2013b huang et al 2017 the influence of charge flow operational mode remains open and highly important qu et al 2016 garcía quismondo et al 2013a b garcía quismondo et al 2016 lado et al 2014 hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2013b kim et al 2015 the two most common electrical operation approaches are constant voltage cv wherein a constant potential difference is maintained across the electrodes and the current is variable and constant current cc wherein a constant current is applied until a desired voltage is reached cv has been the most common mode of operation for cdi research biesheuvel et al 2009 but cc is most common for commercial operation and recently there has been significant investigation and comparison of both approaches zhao et al 2013b a han et al 2015 jande and kim 2013 choi 2015 kang et al 2014 results from some of these investigations strongly indicate that cc is both experimentally and theoretically superior to cv from an energy consumption standpoint qu et al 2016 kang et al 2014 thus motivating further exploration of this mode of operation in terms of fluid flow both cc and cv modes are typically operated under a simple constant volumetric flow rate while the relationship between electrical input and performance has received significant attention the effect of flow rate has been less studied zhao et al 2013b because there are multiple important aspects of desalination such as throughput concentration reduction water recovery and energy consumption hemmatifar et al 2016 it is necessary to evaluate these operation modes in terms of multiple performance parameters in the cdi community these parameters include but are not limited to the average salt adsorption rate asar the energy normalized adsorbed salt enas the expended energy per ion removed k t ion and the energy consumed per unit volume of desalinated water in kwh m3 suss et al 2015 kim and yoon 2015 hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2013a other metrics that underly cdi performance are the salt adsorption capacity sac dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle and round trip coulombic efficiency andelman 2014 shanbhag et al 2016 zhao et al 2010 pillay and newman 1996 zhao et al 2012a here we explore a largely unrecognized yet distinct and highly important efficiency characteristic of cdi cycling operation that is directly proportional to salt removal and thus relevant to all of the previously mentioned cdi performance metrics the effect is summarized by a parameter called the flow efficiency λ f l o w defined here as the ratio of salt removed moles from the effluent stream to salt adsorbed moles within the device over a cycle this concept was originally recognized and defined by johnson and newman 1971 in brief the flow efficiency quantifies the fact that desalinated or brine water inside the cell must be flushed out from the interior of the device before the next step is initiated otherwise the solution is either re concentrated or unnecessarily enriched for the next step additionally since removing desalinated water from the cell often involves flowing feed water mixing acts to drive the desalinated water concentration back toward the feed concentration resulting in less average concentration reduction during desalination johnson and newman 1971 did not explore this tradeoff in detail and only considered cv operation remarkably the flow efficiency and associated mixing losses are unexplored in contemporary cdi research knapp and leffew ii 2014 we show here that the flow efficiency is on equal footing with and yet distinct from the well known double layer adsorption and parasitic faradaic efficiencies avraham et al 2009a b 2010 zhao et al 2010 he et al 2016 shapira et al 2016 we examine the flow efficiency in cc operation because of its superior energy consumption characteristics over cv and simpler theoretical description qu et al 2016 kang et al 2014 for cc operation we demonstrate that the flow efficiency arises from the interplay between the cell fluid volume volumetric flow rate and the durations of the charge discharge and flush steps we find that the flow efficiency can strongly influence performance for reasonable cc operating conditions moreover we delineate the tradeoffs between flow efficiency traditional cdi performance metrics and effluent concentration reduction interestingly to our knowledge there is not a standard cdi performance metric that captures effluent concentration reduction which is a critical characteristic because the ultimate goal of desalination is to reduce ion concentration rather than remove moles of salt thus the tradeoff between flow efficiency and concentration reduction for cc operation is another primary focus of this work to quantify the flow efficiency we use a well verified device model based on treating the cell as a well mixed flow reactor i e continuous stirred tank reactor cstr oren and soffer 1983 jande and kim 2013 biesheuvel et al 2009 zhao et al 2012a 2013b to validate this model we compare predictions against experimental data taken on a flow through electrode cdi ftecdi device suss et al 2012 guyes et al 2017 qu et al 2015 2016 note here that ftecdi is equivalent to ftcdi in our previous work hemmatifar et al 2015 qu et al 2015 2016 we change the description to avoid confusion with identically named devices that are not based on the same flow concept andelman 1993 2 background 2 1 performance metrics quantitatively several cdi performance metrics of interest are written as 1 δ n e f f t c y c l e q c f e e d c e f f d t where q c f e e d c e f f 0 2 λ d y n f δ n e f f q i n 3 η c o u l q o u t q i n 4 s a c m m δ n e f f 5 a s a r δ n e f f n a t c y c l e 6 e n a s δ n e f f e i n e o u t where δ n e f f is the salt removed over one cycle as measured from the effluent stream moles q is the total volumetric flow rate through the cell ml min m is the molar mass of the salt g mol m is the mass of the electrodes g is the total duration of the cdi cycle min f is faraday s constant 96485 33 c mol n is the number of cells in the cdi stack here always one a is the projected electrode face area cm2 c f e e d is the inlet influent salt concentration mm c e f f is the time varying outlet effluent salt concentration mm λ d y n is the measured dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle zhao et al 2012a i is the externally applied cc charging current ma η c o u l is the round trip cycle coulombic efficiency between equivalent voltages q o u t is the charge transferred from the cell during the cycle c q i n is the charge transferred to the cell during the cycle c t c is the time spent charging the cell in cc mode at i min and t d c is the time spent discharging the cell in cc mode at i min a table that summarizes these and other defined parameters used herein is presented in the supporting information si note that we normalize asar by the projected electrode face area rather than by total electrode mass we argue that electrode area rather than electrode mass is a better characteristic for performance comparisons because of its direct relation to cell geometry resistance and device cost hemmatifar et al 2016 kim and yoon 2015 qu et al 2015 2016 dykstra et al 2016 as discussed above the flow efficiency λ f l o w is defined as the ratio of measured salt removed from the effluent stream to the actual salt adsorbed in the cell over a cycle or 7 λ f l o w δ n e f f δ n a d s where δ n a d s is the total amount of salt adsorbed during the cycle moles since δ n e f f is central to all the performance metrics except coulombic efficiency it is clear that λ f l o w is an important intermediate efficiency that translates salt adsorbed to experimentally realized salt removed for the remainder of the paper the primary goal will be twofold first to derive a theoretical prediction for eqn 7 for relevant cc operation modes and compare this prediction with experimental data and second to highlight how flow efficiency relates to concentration reduction and the previously mentioned cdi performance metrics 2 2 cc operation mode fig 1 schematically outlines the cc cdi operational conditions under consideration in this work the cell is cycled between equal and opposite charge adsorption and discharge desorption applied electrical currents with the option of an open circuit flush in between fig 1a and b an optional flush step is included because it can be beneficial to evacuate desalinated brine solution under open circuit conditions before moving on to the next step at the beginning of a cycle a charge current i adsorption is sourced until the upper voltage limit is reached at which point a flush step is commenced if desired and then the current is switched to i desorption until the lower voltage limit is reached once the lower voltage limit is realized a final flush step is carried out identical to the first and then the cycling process is started over the difference between the upper and lower voltage limits is referred to as the voltage window depending upon the operational inputs fig 1a and b after a certain number of cycles the effluent concentration waveform e g fig 1c becomes identical from cycle to cycle this is the so called dynamic steady state dss condition referred to herein and elsewhere porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2013b hemmatifar et al 2016 here we define no flush operation as the limit in which discharge occurs immediately after the charging step meaning that the time spent flushing is zero t f l 0 conversely we refer to stop flow operation as the limit in which the flow rate during charging is set to zero q c 0 and all desalinated brine water is removed during the flushing step at i 0 and q q f l 2 3 model we seek a simple model that can calculate the effluent concentration profile with cc operational input parameters as shown in fig 1 from the calculated effluent concentration and salt adsorbed we can evaluate the flow efficiency as a function of operational inputs along these lines jande and kim 2013 have outlined elements of such a framework giving indications of the effects of cell volume applied current flow rate feed concentration and capacitance on the effluent concentration in a similar fashion but initially for cv operation biesheuvel et al 2009 developed a model for describing basic cdi characteristics in terms of a simple ideally mixed flow reactor for salt zhao et al 2012a 2013b later used a similar model in conjunction with experimental observations to examine the effect of adsorption desorption time feed concentration flow rate current and cell voltage on asar water recovery charge efficiency and energy consumed in both cc and cv operation while these works have clearly explained the salient features of cdi operation in cc and cv modes an examination of the underlying flow efficiency has not been explored herein we employ elements of these previously verified models using them with simplifying assumptions to quantitatively predict the flow efficiency we note that this model was originally derived and verified for flow between cdi cell architectures here we will show it to be equally valid for fte cdi architectures demonstrating that the model is general and independent of cell geometry as expected to calculate δ n e f f we make the commonly employed and well verified assumption that the cdi device behaves like a partially mixed flow reactor for salt i e cstr biesheuvel et al 2009 hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2013b porada et al 2013a jande and kim 2013 thus c e f f t can be derived from solving the ion continuity equation for cc conditions 8 d c e f f d t q v c e l l c f e e d c e f f i λ f v c e l l 9 δ c q s s i λ q s s f q c where λ is the differential charge efficiency biesheuvel et al 2009 δ c q s s is the maximum possible influent concentration reduction during cc charging which is achieved once c e f f reaches quasi steady state λ q s s is λ at maximum quasi steady state concentration reduction and v c e l l is the effective cell fluid volume ml that participates in fluid flow and salt removal reflecting the spatial dependence over which c f e e d transitions to c e f f this volume can be expressed as v c e l l m f v g where v g is the relevant geometric cell volume corrected for material porosities and m f is the mixing factor which is equal to unity for a well mixed cstr reactor and 1 2 for a linearly mixed reactor see si for discussion of m f in the si we also use eqn 8 to demonstrate how to experimentally measure v c e l l it is also worth noting that eqn 8 could be easily adapted to be species specific and then utilized to analyze selective ion removal tang et al 2016 eqn 9 is instructive because it highlights an important tradeoff between the flow rate to current ratio i q and the amount of concentration reduction in cc operation too small of a concentration reduction is not practical for real cdi operation as it would require numerous stages to achieve a desired salinity zhao et al 2013a thus careful attention must be paid to reports of high performance metrics on their own without a discussion of other parameters like the average reduction of influent concentration in order to solve eqn 8 analytically and calculate the flow efficiency we make the assumption that the differential charge efficiency λ is constant in time over the cycle this is a valid assumption here because the flow efficiency is not sensitive to the detailed differential charge efficiency due to how it is defined in eqn 7 since both the salt actually adsorbed and the salt removed from the effluent stream both scale in the same way with adsorption efficiency the ratio in eqn 7 largely cancels out these effects we provide experimental data below and in the si that strongly supports this assumption for the particular measurements made herein moreover we experimentally confirm the validity of this assumption with a 50 mm nacl feed solution which is expected to be more strongly influenced by adsorption efficiency effects than a typical cdi feed stream at 20 mm nacl zhao et al 2010 while the charge efficiency is a heavily studied topic in cdi research and is well known to be concentration voltage and time dependent zhao et al 2010 avraham et al 2009a 2010 gao et al 2014 the use of an effective time averaged value is most reasonable if a suitable operating voltage window is chosen kim et al 2015 hemmatifar et al 2016 we find that the minor loss of accuracy in predicted flow efficiency incurred by not including a full charge efficiency model is far outweighed by the analytical insight obtained by assuming an effective time averaged value finally optimal desalination operation will nearly always occur in voltage windows where the differential charge efficiency is high and slowly varying making the assumption most valid for optimized operating conditions a further discussion of our effective time averaged λ assumption is presented in the si for solutions to eqn 8 that were obtained using this assumption we substitute λ λ for clarity in the end λ will be fit as a scaling factor and can be thought of as representing the effective product of coulombic and double layer adsorption efficiencies this is not to be confused with the measured dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle λ d y n obtained from eqn 2 the difference between λ d y n and λ will be delineated in detail below see eqn 15 using these assumptions we start by solving eqn 8 for c e f f generally for constant current i and flow rate q and rearranging to give part of the integrand of eqn 1 10 c f e e d c e f f i λ f q 1 e t τ c f e e d c 0 e t τ where τ v c e l l q is the fluid residence time in the cell min or time taken to flow one cell volume of liquid through the device c 0 is the initial concentration of the step charging discharging or flushing which is equivalent to the final concentration of the previous step because the residence time τ is the time required to flow one cell volume of fluid t τ is therefore the volume of fluid flowed through the cell in dimensionless units of cell volumes eqn 10 can be applied to each step of fig 1 by substituting q q c for charging q q c and i i for discharging and q q f l and i 0 for flushing an example solution of eqn 10 over three cycles starting from equilibrium with the inputs of fig 1a and b is presented in fig 1c note that the differential charge efficiency used to calculate fig 1c is different for charging and discharging to preserve dss salt conservation see si for detailed discussion this is done for illustrative purposes but we will show is ultimately irrelevant to the accurate evaluation of flow efficiency from the model 3 experimental details the ftecdi cells were constructed with two sheets of hierarchical carbon aerogel monoliths hcams derived from carbonized and activated resorcinol formaldehyde aerogel baumann et al 2008 biener et al 2011 suss et al 2012 the dimensions of the electrodes were 4 5 6 cm with an average thickness of 350 μm the material has an electrical conductivity of 20 30 s cm mass density of 0 65 g cm 3 after drying at 70 c total mass of 0 5 g electrode and approximate bet surface area of 1100 m2 g assuming a carbon density of 1 95 g cm 3 the measured density implies an average total porosity of 67 for an electrode separator we employed 125 μm dry thickness white coffee filter paper for contacts strips of 0 03 mm thickness 99 6 titanium foil solution materials llc santa clara ca were inserted into the cell the electrodes and filter paper were stacked between laser roughened polycarbonate endplates with tubulation ports and the cell was sealed with a uv cure epoxy and clamped to reduce contact resistance see si for full device schematic the header volume on either side of the electrodes is difficult to estimate due to its roughness however an effective thickness of approximately 75 μm is reasonable assuming a 150 μm total header thickness a microporosity of 20 and a separator porosity of 50 the total fluid volume of the assembly is expected to be 1 21 ml the resistances and capacitance of each cell were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis cyclic voltammetry and simple galvanostatic charging see si eis and cyclic voltammetry using a biologic vsp 300 potentiostat claix france an analysis of the operational galvanostatic discharge voltage vs time revealed device differential capacitances of 10 13 f in 50 mm nacl alfa aesar acs 99 min a total measured cell differential capacitance of 10 13 f here implies an operational material capacitance of approximately 46 f g or 30 f cm 3 in 50 mm nacl the desalination performance of each cell was tested by applying a constant current and simultaneously monitoring the terminal voltage not corrected for series resistance using a keithley 2602b sourcemeter tektronix inc beaverton or to monitor the effluent concentration we used a flow through conductivity sensor edaq et916 17 μl denistone east australia installed downstream of the cdi cell the sensor was kept close to the effluent port and attached to a narrow 1 59 mm diameter tube in order to minimize delay times guyes et al 2017 the sensor was 2 point calibrated with nist traceable kcl conductivity standards with base values of 12 88 ms cm and 1 413 ms cm which were corrected for their 23 2 c ambient temperature oakton instruments vernon hills il multipoint conductivity calibration over the range of interest is important because it corrects for both the proportional and offset errors of the sensor due to temperature drift of the solution conductivity wu and berezansky 1995 spivey and shedlovsky 1967 we assumed that under dss conditions the integrated salt flux over a cycle was zero and hence corrected the conductivity accordingly see si finally the flow of the feed solution through the cell was controlled through a peristaltic pump watson marlow falmouth cornwall uk from 0 to 100 rpm 0 12 91 ml min in closed loop circulation with a 2 l reservoir continuously purged with hydrated nitrogen the water used to make all solutions was milli q ultrapure 18 2 m ω cm we observed no change in the reservoir fluid volume and ph over time and thus assume the inlet concentration as constant in order to achieve dss 5 full cdi cycles were performed for each operational condition 4 results and discussion 4 1 the flow efficiency substituting eqn 10 into eqn 1 with the proper c 0 initial conditions for each step and integrating in time where q c f e e d c e f f 0 i e the lower blue shaded regions in fig 1c yields the measured salt removed δ n e f f for a cycle in moles for the cc operation mode of fig 1 finally using periodic boundary conditions for the initial and final effluent concentration over a cycle recognizing that the actual salt adsorbed during the cycle in the model is δ n a d s i t c λ f and assuming for simplicity that the coulombic efficiency is unity a more realistic non unity coulombic efficiency does not effect the predictions see fig 2 b we arrive at the following simple equations for the flow efficiency eqn 7 for the operation modes considered herein 11 λ f l o w 2 τ c t c ln e t c τ c t f l τ f l 1 e t f l τ f l 1 1 12 λ f l o w n f 2 τ c t c ln e t c τ c 1 2 1 13 λ f l o w s f tanh t f l 2 τ f l 14 δ n e f f i t c λ f λ f l o w here τ c v c e l l q c is the residence time during charging and τ f l v c e l l q f l is the residence time during flushing fig 1 importantly the ratios t c τ c and t f l τ f l directly correspond respectively to the number of fluid volumes flowed through the cell during charging and flushing in dimensionless units of cell volumes special cases of λ f l o w include λ f l o w n f in eqn 12 which is the flow efficiency of eqn 11 for the case of no flush operation t f l 0 and λ f l o w s f in eqn 13 which is the flow efficiency of eqn 11 for the case of stop flow operation q c 0 we emphasize that eqns 11 13 are solved for dss conditions making them relevant to only equilibrated continuous cdi cycling operation this newly detailed efficiency primarily arises as a consequence of cycling and mixing and quantifies the fact that desalinated or brine water inside the cell should be swept out from the interior of the device before the next step is initiated thus if a cell discharge is carried out immediately after charging with no flush which is the typical cc operation mode zhao et al 2013a hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2012a dykstra et al 2016 then a portion of the desalinated water inside the cell will always be lost due to immediate resalination in other words the total amount of salt adsorbed during charging equal here to i t c λ f is effectively never measured through the effluent concentration during charging due to a finite amount of desalinated water residing within the cell for conditions of low volumes flowed during desalination step s i e low t c τ c t f l τ f l much of the desalinated water is still inside the cell when the next step is initiated making it an extremely inefficient process fig 2a while we elucidate these effects with a ftecdi geometry the rationale here is clearly applicable to any other cdi device that relies on cycling hemmatifar et al 2016 fig 2a plots the flow efficiencies in eqn 11 as a function of the ratios t c τ c and t f l τ f l which can be thought of as the number of cell volumes of fluid flowed through the cell during the respective step under many operational circumstances clearly the flow loss can be substantial the asymmetric scales in fig 2a show that the open circuit flushing step is far more effective at minimizing flow losses λ f l o w s f 90 for t f l τ f l 3 for the case of little or no flush only with very large cell volumes of fluid flowed through the device during charging do the flow losses become reasonable λ f l o w n f 90 for t c τ c 14 this result is consistent with observations in the literature by zhao et al zhao et al 2013b who found that higher flow rates and thus higher cell volumes flowed yielded better asar for no flush cc operation hence experimentally one can avoid a low flow efficiency by either significantly increasing t c τ c or by introducing a flushing step following the charging discharging step which is done at zero current and elevated flow rate to minimize energy use and time taken unfortunately though with more volumes of feed water flown through the device the effluent concentration is driven back toward feed concentration thus the price of a higher flow efficiency is often a lower depth of desalination 4 1 1 parameter extraction for model verification in terms of the following discussion and experiments for model verification the only free parameters are the cell volume v c e l l and the effective time averaged differential charge efficiency λ however v c e l l can be estimated geometrically and confirmed by independent measurements see si and experimental section in order to best test the model one can vary the experimentally controlled flow rates q c or q f l or the flush time duration t f l at constant values of feed concentration c f e e d charging discharging current i and voltage window e g 0 2 1 v which thereby also makes t c essentially constant this approach helps ensure that λ is invariant over different experiments thereby allowing the functional forms of eqns 11 13 to be examined for the cases below we chose to vary q c or q f l and hold the rest of the parameters constant throughout a given experimental run the results of such experiments allow the model to be tested and for the extraction of v c e l l and λ for use in predicting the corresponding performance metrics outlined in eqns 2 and 4 6 here we specifically extracted the flow efficiency by fitting the measured cycle charge efficiency λ d y n of eqn 2 to that calculated by the model from eqns 11 13 and eqn 15 note also that the charge time t c was different between the two comparisons here because the voltage window for the stop flow case was narrowed to avoid depletion effects see si for tables of all experimental data the flush time t f l was arbitrarily chosen in the stop flow case to be 1 min 4 1 2 stop flow and no flush results fig 2b plots the limiting cases of 2a along with experimental data from a ftecdi cell for the remainder of the paper we chose to verify the model with data from the limiting cases of stop flow eqn 13 and no flush eqn 12 for several reasons 1 the no flush case is the most commonly used and is most relevant to previous studies zhao et al 2013a hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2012a dykstra et al 2016 2 according to fig 2a these limiting cases represent the largest disparate linear trajectories over the flow efficiency manifold 3 they present the simplest possible comparison in terms of independent variables and 4 the general case can often be thought of as a smooth transition between the two cases fig 2b experimentally confirms the significantly sharper rise in flow efficiency per cell volume flowed for open circuit flushing as opposed to continuous flow charging as expected from fig 2a and eqns 12 and 13 this implies that the maximum average concentration reduction for stop flow is superior to no flush which is a significant factor in limiting the number of stages required to reduce an effluent concentration to a desired level fig 2b also demonstrates outstanding agreement between the model predictions and experimental results over a wide range of cell volumes flowed during their respective desalination steps in terms of parameter extraction only the cell volume v c e l l 1 23 ml identical in both operation modes and the scaling factor λ 0 86 for stop flow and λ 0 93 for no flush were fit to match model to experiment the fitted cell volume of 1 23 ml is in excellent agreement with the geometric fluid volume expected from the assembly 1 21 ml see experimental section and alternative measurements of the cell fluid volume detailed in the si suggesting that the device behaves like a well mixed reactor m f 1 the difference in λ was simply due to a slightly different voltage window chosen for stop flow to avoid depletion effects these constants are used below to compare cdi performance metrics with experiment all of the other parameters needed were directly taken from experiment in order to better illustrate the tradeoff between flow efficiency and concentration reduction fig 3 shows the quasi steady state concentration reduction of the feed concentration eqn 9 plotted against flow rate during charging for the no flush case the fitted value of λ q s s 0 98 from fig 3 supports the high fitted value of λ 0 93 for no flush operation we provide further support of the accuracy of our differential charge efficiency fits assumptions by calculating λ directly over an experimental no flush charging step see si this calculation further confirms the near constant value of λ and high overall fitted values found herein comparison of the top axis in fig 3 and the bottom axis of fig 2b also directly shows that the flow efficiency and concentration reduction are in opposition to each other in this case for high flow efficiencies of 90 the maximum concentration reduction is less than 10 5 mm out of 50 mm overall future work is needed on defining acceptable concentration reduction levels for cdi processes we will further highlight this problem below with regard to the standard cdi performance metrics overall the excellent agreement between eqns 12 and 13 and experiment mean that researchers can with an estimate of their cell s effective fluid volume calculate their flow efficiency losses for any of the cc operation modes described herein such an estimate is critical to breaking down where losses arise and how they tradeoff with other effects like concentration reduction we emphasize that the set of experiments conducted herein are primarily done to confirm the accuracy of eqns 11 13 by establishing their accuracy eqns 11 13 can be confidently used as tools in understanding a given cc cdi operation s performance 4 1 2 1 cdi performance metrics we can now examine how the flow efficiency factors into cdi performance metrics by combining eqns 11 14 with eqns 2 and 4 6 the experimentally measured dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle λ d y n eqn 2 can be readily calculated with the aid of eqns 11 14 giving 15 λ d y n λ λ f l o w thus here the measured dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle can be thought of as the product of the effective time average of the differential charge efficiency and the flow efficiency here λ ultimately captures double layer and faradaic adsorption efficiencies that are well known to cdi researchers this work shows that these processes are also convoluted with the flow efficiency in a multiplicative manner hence the dependence and coupling in physics associated with electric double layers faraday type reaction losses and transport limitations results in effectively three respective efficiencies which multiply together that is the overall dependence between salt removed from the stream and electric charge input is reflected by a relation of the form λ d y n λ c o u l λ d l λ f l o w where λ c o u l and λ d l would represent coulombic and double layer type adsorption efficiencies the dss cycle sac can be obtained from combining eqns 4 and 14 to give 16 s a c m i t c m f λ λ f l o w which here will take the same shape as the flow efficiency in fig 2b but with different vertical axis units see si for sac plots eqn 16 shows that the sac has many degrees of freedom and depends heavily on experimentally chosen parameters like the charging current flow rates and step time durations while the sac is traditionally intended to be more of a material metric relations like eqn 16 show that sac is as much an operational figure of merit as it is a material one the peak sac values that we measure here are 4 2 mg g under no flush conditions and 2 mg g under stop flow conditions the stop flow case was lower largely because a narrower voltage window due to increased susceptibility to depletion effects and slightly different cell characteristics see si in a similar fashion to dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle and sac the asar for fig 1 like operation is 17 a s a r i t c λ λ f l o w f a t c y c l e thus the time penalty introduced in asar effectively constrains the flush time t f l to smaller values the enas in contrast to asar has no time penalty which means that from a salt removal perspective the enas simply goes as eqn 14 divided by the energy consumed modeling energy consumption in dss cc cdi is beyond the scope of this work though in the absence of an energy consumption model that includes parasitic parallel losses dykstra et al 2017 it is worth noting that a simplified constant resistance model for enas with no faradaic losses i e λ q η c o u l t d c t c 1 means that energy consumption should scale as 18 e i n e o u t 2 i 2 r t c 19 e n a s λ λ f l o w 2 f i r here r is the quasi steady state cell resistance which includes ionic separator and contact contributions as defined in dunn and newman 2000 and t c r c 3 posey and morozumi 1966 where c is the total cell capacitance f further discussion of energy consumption and parameter optimization is reserved for a future study however it is worth noting that eqns 17 and 19 have an inverse relationship with respect to applied current which is consistent with results in our previous work hemmatifar et al 2016 since finite contact ionic and separator resistances are fundamental parts of any cdi device qu et al 2015 dykstra et al 2016 eqns 17 and 19 outline the best case scenario for the tradeoff between throughput and energy consumption all enas values reported herein assume perfect energy recovery during discharge with no energy recovery the values would be 2 2 5 lower than reported here see si finally in light of the results above we introduce a simple new parameter that we argue should always be reported when evaluating cdi performance namely we add the average concentration reduction over a cycle δ c we can estimate δ c in the present cc model with 20 δ c i t c λ λ f l o w f q c t c q f l t f l the average concentration reduction is introduced because asar enas sac and dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle are not linked to how effectively the influent concentration was reduced during operation this means that these performance metrics can be highly impressive but are not practically important because only minor changes in the influent concentration were induced higher values of δ c are desirable because it means that fewer stages are required to drop the influent concentration to a given desired value 4 1 3 performance metrics model and experiment we now explore how the flow efficiency quantitatively relates to the performance metrics discussed above for the present case fig 4 compares model and experiment under stop flow and no flush operation for asar fig 4a enas fig 4b dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle fig 4c and δ c fig 4d as expected the model fits all the cdi metrics exceedingly well which follows from its accurate prediction of flow efficiency in fig 2 and use of experimental parameters for other inputs it should be noted that the enas was calculated using the experimentally measured energy consumed in place of an energy consumption model however the energy consumed was nearly constant here for different experiments in the same series making the flow efficiency the primary factor underlying the changes in enas in this series of experiments the flow efficiency fully accounts for the variability in these performance metrics over a wide range of relevant operation fig 4 demonstrating the crucial role it plays in understanding dss cdi behavior without an understanding of this new loss factor a researcher could easily choose flow rates that yield performance metrics that are uniformly 2 4 worse and perhaps also incorrectly infer a poor λ notably in the experiments performed here the dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle peaks at 84 which is high for membrane free cdi and consistent with the fitted λ prefactors suss et al 2015 note that the optimal measured λ d y n values for stop flow vs no flush fig 4c tend in the opposite direction of the respective fitted λ parameters until large volumes of feed are flowed during desalination thus only by accounting for flow efficiency can the correct interpretation of loss factors be made for the experiments underlying fig 4 the asar enas and dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle all increase monotonically with increasing volume delivered during charging or flushing i e higher t c τ c or t f l τ f l while the average concentration reduction fig 4d actually decreases this is expected as more volume flowed for a given amount of salt adsorbed will result in an effluent concentration that is closer to the influent concentration it is clear from fig 4 that it is critical to consider a metric like δ c otherwise the best performance comes from delivering as much feed water as possible and re concentrating the effluent to values very nearly identical to the feed nevertheless asar and enas measured at close to zero concentration reduction may still be useful as an upper limit for the device performance finally in terms of the comparison between stop flow and no flush operation fig 4a shows that in this case for larger cell volumes of fluid delivered 4 7 the no flush operation has an advantage in asar over stop flow due to a shorter cycling period i e no additional time spent flushing note though that the maximum asars could be made more comparable here without change of other metrics by simply decreasing t f l and increasing q f l while holding t f l τ f l constant when looking at enas fig 4b though it is not until 8 9 cell volumes flowed during desalination that no flush overtakes stop flow at this point the effluent concentration is mixed with significant amounts of feed water leading to a δ c of around 6 4 mm fig 4d or a 12 8 reduction in concentration by contrast the stop flow case would remove 9 4 mm out of 50 mm or a 18 8 reduction at 87 of that enas which is a reasonable tradeoff in energy cost for a 1 5 increase in desalination depth the dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle in fig 4c largely mimics the shape of fig 2b showing how important it is to understand the role of flow efficiency in the overall salt adsorption efficiency landscape by factoring out the flow efficiency with the equations presented herein researchers will be able to better assess the impact of material treatments and operational modes on the true charge adsorption efficiency srimuk et al 2016 cai et al 2017 srimuk et al 2017 in terms of δ c fig 2d indicates that stop flow operation is capable of delivering larger desalination depths ultimately yielding δ c values that are unattainable with no flush operation lastly it should be noted that the operational parameters underlying fig 4 were not optimized in any particular manner but rather chosen to best highlight the effect of flow efficiency 5 limitations and constraints the flow efficiency predictions made in this work eqns 11 13 are primarily influenced by the number of cell fluid volumes flowed and are not sensitive to the detailed differential charge efficiency profile or round trip coulombic efficiency nevertheless the model presented herein will be most accurate when faradaic currents are low corresponding to measured η c o u l values of approximately 80 or greater when faradaic processes are substantial within a cycle the charge discharge times become highly asymmetric t c t d c with respect to a given voltage window and significant salt desorption can result due to voltage decay during flushing and or a decrease in applied current that goes towards adsorption in terms of effluent concentration faradaic processes result in a c e f f profile during cc charging that never reaches quasi steady state e g fig 3 inset but instead turns up strongly towards the feed concentration after reaching a minimum such an effluent profile is not captured by the simple solution to the continuity equation used here eqn 10 cdi cycling with significant faradaic currents requires more detailed modeling than that used here to understand dykstra et al 2017 guyes et al 2017 shocron and suss 2017 similar to excessive parallel losses significant depletion of the feed concentration is not accounted for within the present model indeed there is no explicit mechanism built into eqn 10 that prevents c e f f from going negative when there are excessively high adsorption rates relative to the feed supply i λ q s s f q c c f e e d this is not a major concern though as such experimental conditions are usually avoided because of the negative impact on energy consumption additionally the model herein does not explicitly account for significant salt desorption effects due to chemical surface charge which can be significant at low voltages especially with purposefully functionalized electrodes biesheuvel et al 2015 gao et al 2015 wu et al 2016 hemmatifar et al 2017 similar to the other limiting situations though a voltage window is typically chosen to avoid significant desorption peaks in the effluent concentration due to its negative impact on performance finally it is worth summarizing the implicit constraints for the parameters in eqns 11 14 first the dss charge time t c is constrained to first order by the capacitance voltage window cell resistance and charging current for a simple ohmic situation no parallel faradaic or parallel losses like that assumed in eqn 18 t c can be estimated as jande and kim 2013 dunn and newman 2000 21 t c c δ v i 2 r where δ v is the experimentally chosen voltage window v and t c r c 3 posey and morozumi 1966 thus there is a tradeoff between charging current i and time spent charging t c in eqns 11 14 hemmatifar et al 2016 the voltage window here is constrained on the lower end by the double layer adsorption efficiency and on the high end by faradaic loss processes biesheuvel et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 pillay and newman 1996 while the total cell capacitance can be changed with device geometry this also impacts the residence times through v c e l l and potentially asar through the face area however an increase in the capacitance per unit volume or in the voltage window where differential charge efficiency is high does circumvent flow efficiency concentration reduction tradeoffs by allowing for both a lower average effluent concentration and a higher flow efficiency since membrane cdi mcdi has a larger practical operating window due to its high differential charge efficiency at low voltages it is expected that mcdi will have generally higher flow efficiency than regular cdi due to increased t c through higher δ v finally the residence times τ c and τ f l are constrained by the desired concentration reduction 6 conclusions in summary we have analyzed cdi performance metrics under cc operation with a simple cstr type model in doing so we detail a previously unappreciated loss mechanism inherent to cdi cycling we quantify this loss mechanism with a parameter called the flow efficiency originally defined by johnson and newman 1971 and demonstrate the accuracy of the model with excellent agreement between predictions and experiment we show that the flow efficiency arises from desalinated water within the cell being partially lost due to re salination by the subsequent step this loss can be substantial for many operating conditions and is multiplicative with the other well known charge adsorption efficiencies flow losses can be largely avoided by flowing 14 cell volumes of feed solution during charging or by including a 1 5 cell volume open circuit flush after charging and discharging steps these strategies however come with the tradeoff of less concentration reduction and therefore in principle the need for more cdi stages to reduce feed water salinity along these lines we find that optimal asar enas and sac values always occur in the low concentration reduction limit overall we provide simple and accurate equations that researchers can use to evaluate the flow efficiency and break down their cdi performance acknowledgments work at llnl was performed under the auspices of the us doe by llnl

19847,here we detail a previously unappreciated loss mechanism inherent to capacitive deionization cdi cycling operation that has a substantial role determining performance this mechanism reflects the fact that desalinated water inside a cell is partially lost to re salination if desorption is carried out immediately after adsorption we describe such effects by a parameter called the flow efficiency and show that this efficiency is distinct from and yet multiplicative with other highly studied adsorption efficiencies flow losses can be minimized by flowing more feed solution through the cell during desalination however this also results in less effluent concentration reduction while the rationale outlined here is applicable to all cdi cell architectures that rely on cycling we validate our model with a flow through electrode cdi device operated in constant current mode we find excellent agreement between flow efficiency model predictions and experimental results thus giving researchers simple equations by which they can estimate this distinct loss process for their operation keywords capacitive desalination capacitive deionization cdi flow efficiency 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a promising technology for low cost selective ion removal from low ionic strength solvent streams oren 2008 ferreira and trierweiler 2009 andelman 2011 porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 li et al 2016 zhao et al 2012b the technique uses an applied bias across conductive porous or redox active electrodes to remove ions from solution and store them within electric double layers or redox sites biesheuvel and bazant 2010 johnson and newman 1971 lee et al 2014 after a period of removal the trapped ions are subsequently discharged from the electrodes to create a brine stream by either short circuiting or reversing lessening the current voltage of the many active areas of research in this field including materials development and cell design liu et al 2015 suss et al 2015 porada et al 2013b huang et al 2017 the influence of charge flow operational mode remains open and highly important qu et al 2016 garcía quismondo et al 2013a b garcía quismondo et al 2016 lado et al 2014 hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2013b kim et al 2015 the two most common electrical operation approaches are constant voltage cv wherein a constant potential difference is maintained across the electrodes and the current is variable and constant current cc wherein a constant current is applied until a desired voltage is reached cv has been the most common mode of operation for cdi research biesheuvel et al 2009 but cc is most common for commercial operation and recently there has been significant investigation and comparison of both approaches zhao et al 2013b a han et al 2015 jande and kim 2013 choi 2015 kang et al 2014 results from some of these investigations strongly indicate that cc is both experimentally and theoretically superior to cv from an energy consumption standpoint qu et al 2016 kang et al 2014 thus motivating further exploration of this mode of operation in terms of fluid flow both cc and cv modes are typically operated under a simple constant volumetric flow rate while the relationship between electrical input and performance has received significant attention the effect of flow rate has been less studied zhao et al 2013b because there are multiple important aspects of desalination such as throughput concentration reduction water recovery and energy consumption hemmatifar et al 2016 it is necessary to evaluate these operation modes in terms of multiple performance parameters in the cdi community these parameters include but are not limited to the average salt adsorption rate asar the energy normalized adsorbed salt enas the expended energy per ion removed k t ion and the energy consumed per unit volume of desalinated water in kwh m3 suss et al 2015 kim and yoon 2015 hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2013a other metrics that underly cdi performance are the salt adsorption capacity sac dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle and round trip coulombic efficiency andelman 2014 shanbhag et al 2016 zhao et al 2010 pillay and newman 1996 zhao et al 2012a here we explore a largely unrecognized yet distinct and highly important efficiency characteristic of cdi cycling operation that is directly proportional to salt removal and thus relevant to all of the previously mentioned cdi performance metrics the effect is summarized by a parameter called the flow efficiency λ f l o w defined here as the ratio of salt removed moles from the effluent stream to salt adsorbed moles within the device over a cycle this concept was originally recognized and defined by johnson and newman 1971 in brief the flow efficiency quantifies the fact that desalinated or brine water inside the cell must be flushed out from the interior of the device before the next step is initiated otherwise the solution is either re concentrated or unnecessarily enriched for the next step additionally since removing desalinated water from the cell often involves flowing feed water mixing acts to drive the desalinated water concentration back toward the feed concentration resulting in less average concentration reduction during desalination johnson and newman 1971 did not explore this tradeoff in detail and only considered cv operation remarkably the flow efficiency and associated mixing losses are unexplored in contemporary cdi research knapp and leffew ii 2014 we show here that the flow efficiency is on equal footing with and yet distinct from the well known double layer adsorption and parasitic faradaic efficiencies avraham et al 2009a b 2010 zhao et al 2010 he et al 2016 shapira et al 2016 we

demonstrate that the flow efficiency arises from the interplay between the cell fluid volume volumetric flow rate and the durations of the charge discharge and flush steps we find that the flow efficiency can strongly influence performance for reasonable cc operating conditions moreover we delineate the tradeoffs between flow efficiency traditional cdi performance metrics and effluent concentration reduction interestingly to our knowledge there is not a standard cdi performance metric that captures effluent concentration reduction which is a critical characteristic because the ultimate goal of desalination is to reduce ion concentration rather than remove moles of salt thus the tradeoff between flow efficiency and concentration reduction for cc operation is another primary focus of this work to quantify the flow efficiency we use a well verified device model based on treating the cell as a well mixed flow reactor i e continuous stirred tank reactor cstr oren and soffer 1983 jande and kim 2013 biesheuvel et al 2009 zhao et al 2012a 2013b to validate this model we compare predictions against experimental data taken on a flow through electrode cdi ftecdi device suss et al 2012 guyes et al 2017 qu et al 2015 2016 note here that ftecdi is equivalent to ftcdi in our previous work hemmatifar et al 2015 qu et al 2015 2016 we change the description to avoid confusion with identically named devices that are not based on the same flow concept andelman 1993 2 background 2 1 performance metrics quantitatively several cdi performance metrics of interest are written as 1 δ n e f f t c y c l e q c f e e d c e f f d t where q c f e e d c e f f 0 2 λ d y n f δ n e f f q i n 3 η c o u l q o u t q i n 4 s a c m m δ n e f f 5 a s a r δ n e f f n a t c y c l e 6 e n a s δ n e f f e i n e o u t where δ n e f f is the salt removed over one cycle as measured from the effluent stream moles q is the total volumetric flow rate through the cell ml min m is the molar mass of the salt g mol m is the mass of the electrodes g is the total duration of the cdi cycle min f is faraday s constant 96485 33 c mol n is the number of cells in the cdi stack here always one a is the projected electrode face area cm2 c f e e d is the inlet influent salt concentration mm c e f f is the time varying outlet effluent salt concentration mm λ d y n is the measured dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle zhao et al 2012a i is the externally applied cc charging current ma η c o u l is the round trip cycle coulombic efficiency between equivalent voltages q o u t is the charge transferred from the cell during the cycle c q i n is the charge transferred to the cell during the cycle c t c is the time spent charging the cell in cc mode at i min and t d c is the time spent discharging the cell in cc mode at i min a table that summarizes these and other defined parameters used herein is presented in the supporting information si note that we normalize asar by the projected electrode face area rather than by total electrode mass we argue that electrode area rather than electrode mass is a better characteristic for performance comparisons because of its direct relation to cell geometry resistance and device cost hemmatifar et al 2016 kim and yoon 2015 qu et al 2015 2016 dykstra et al 2016 as discussed above the flow efficiency λ f l o w is defined as the ratio of measured salt removed from the effluent stream to the actual salt adsorbed in the cell over a cycle or 7 λ f l o w δ n e f f δ n a d s where δ n a d s is the total amount of salt adsorbed during the cycle moles since δ n e f f is central to all the performance metrics except coulombic efficiency it is clear that λ f l o w is an important intermediate efficiency that translates salt adsorbed to experimentally realized salt removed for the remainder of the paper the primary goal will be twofold first to derive a theoretical prediction for eqn 7 for relevant cc operation modes and compare this prediction with experimental data and second to highlight how flow efficiency relates to concentration reduction and the previously mentioned cdi performance metrics 2 2 cc operation mode fig 1 schematically outlines the cc cdi operational conditions under consideration in this work the cell is cycled between equal and opposite charge adsorption and discharge desorption applied electrical currents with the option of an open circuit flush in between fig 1a and b an optional flush step is included because it can be beneficial to evacuate desalinated brine solution under open circuit conditions before moving on to the next step at the beginning of a cycle a charge current i adsorption is sourced until the upper voltage limit is reached at which point a flush step is commenced if desired and then the current is switched to i desorption until the lower voltage limit is reached once the lower voltage limit is realized a final flush step is carried out identical to the first and then the cycling process is started over the difference between the upper and lower voltage limits is referred to as the voltage window depending upon the operational inputs fig 1a and b after a certain number of cycles the effluent concentration waveform e g fig 1c becomes identical from cycle to cycle this is the so called dynamic steady state dss condition referred to herein and elsewhere porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2013b hemmatifar et al 2016 here we define no flush operation as the limit in which discharge occurs immediately after the charging step meaning that the time spent flushing is zero t f l 0 conversely we refer to stop flow operation as the limit in which the flow rate during charging is set to zero q c 0 and all desalinated brine water is removed during the flushing step at i 0 and q q f l 2 3 model we seek a simple model that can calculate the effluent concentration profile with cc operational input parameters as shown in fig 1 from the calculated effluent concentration and salt adsorbed we can evaluate the flow efficiency as a function of operational inputs along these lines jande and kim 2013 have outlined elements of such a framework giving indications of the effects of cell volume applied current flow rate feed concentration and capacitance on the effluent concentration in a similar fashion but initially for cv operation biesheuvel et al 2009 developed a model for describing basic cdi characteristics in terms of a simple ideally mixed flow reactor for salt zhao et al 2012a 2013b later used a similar model in conjunction with experimental observations to examine the effect of adsorption desorption time feed concentration flow rate current and cell voltage on asar water recovery charge efficiency and energy consumed in both cc and cv operation while these works have clearly explained the salient features of cdi operation in cc and cv modes an examination of the underlying flow efficiency has not been explored herein we employ elements of these previously verified models using them with simplifying assumptions to quantitatively predict the flow efficiency we note that this model was originally derived and verified for flow between cdi cell architectures here we will show it to be equally valid for fte cdi architectures demonstrating that the model is general and independent of cell geometry as expected to calculate δ n e f f we make the commonly employed and well verified assumption that the cdi device behaves like a partially mixed flow reactor for salt i e cstr biesheuvel et al 2009 hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2013b porada et al 2013a jande and kim 2013 thus c e f f t can be derived from solving the ion continuity equation for cc conditions 8 d c e f f d t q v c e l l c f e e d c e f f i λ f v c e l l 9 δ c q s s i λ q s s f q c where λ is the differential charge efficiency biesheuvel et al 2009 δ c q s s is the maximum possible influent concentration reduction during cc charging which is achieved once c e f f reaches quasi steady state λ q s s is λ at maximum quasi steady state concentration reduction and v c e l l is the effective cell fluid volume ml that participates in fluid flow and salt removal reflecting the spatial dependence over which c f e e d transitions to c e f f this volume can be expressed as v c e l l m f v g where v g is the relevant geometric cell volume corrected for material porosities and m f is the mixing factor which is equal to unity for a well mixed cstr reactor and 1 2 for a linearly mixed reactor see si for discussion of m f in the si we also use eqn 8 to demonstrate how to experimentally measure v c e l l it is also worth noting that eqn 8 could be easily adapted to be species specific and then utilized to analyze selective ion removal tang et al 2016 eqn 9 is instructive because it highlights an important tradeoff between the flow rate to current ratio i q and the amount of concentration reduction in cc operation too small of a concentration reduction is not practical for real cdi operation as it would require numerous stages to achieve a desired salinity zhao et al 2013a thus careful attention must be paid to reports of high performance metrics on their own without a discussion of other parameters like the average reduction of influent concentration in order to solve eqn 8 analytically and calculate the flow efficiency we make the assumption that the differential charge efficiency λ is constant in time over the cycle this is a valid assumption here because the flow efficiency is not sensitive to the detailed differential charge efficiency due to how it is defined in eqn 7 since both the salt actually adsorbed and the salt removed from the effluent stream both scale in the same way with adsorption efficiency the ratio in eqn 7 largely cancels out these effects we provide experimental data below and in the si that strongly supports this assumption for the particular measurements made herein moreover we experimentally confirm the validity of this assumption with a 50 mm nacl feed solution which is expected to be more strongly influenced by adsorption efficiency effects than a typical cdi feed stream at 20 mm nacl zhao et al 2010 while the charge efficiency is a heavily studied topic in cdi research and is well known to be concentration voltage and time dependent zhao et al 2010 avraham et al 2009a 2010 gao et al 2014 the use of an effective time averaged value is most reasonable if a suitable operating voltage window is chosen kim et al 2015 hemmatifar et al 2016 we find that the minor loss of accuracy in predicted flow efficiency incurred by not including a full charge efficiency model is far outweighed by the analytical insight obtained by assuming an effective time averaged value finally optimal desalination operation will nearly always occur in voltage windows where the differential charge efficiency is high and slowly varying making the assumption most valid for optimized operating conditions a further discussion of our effective time averaged λ assumption is presented in the si for solutions to eqn 8 that were obtained using this assumption we substitute λ λ for clarity in the end λ will be fit as a scaling factor and can be thought of as representing the effective product of coulombic and double layer adsorption efficiencies this is not to be confused with the measured dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle λ d y n obtained from eqn 2 the difference between λ d y n and λ will be delineated in detail below see eqn 15 using these assumptions we start by solving eqn 8 for c e f f generally for constant current i and flow rate q and rearranging to give part of the integrand of eqn 1 10 c f e e d c e f f i λ f q 1 e t τ c f e e d c 0 e t τ where τ v c e l l q is the fluid residence time in the cell min or time taken to flow one cell volume of liquid through the device c 0 is the initial concentration of the step charging discharging or flushing which is equivalent to the final concentration of the previous step because the residence time τ is the time required to flow one cell volume of fluid t τ is therefore the volume of fluid flowed through the cell in dimensionless units of cell volumes eqn 10 can be applied to each step of fig 1 by substituting q q c for charging q q c and i i for discharging and q q f l and i 0 for flushing an example solution of eqn 10 over three cycles starting from equilibrium with the inputs of fig 1a and b is presented in fig 1c note that the differential charge efficiency used to calculate fig 1c is different for charging and discharging to preserve dss salt conservation see si for detailed discussion this is done for illustrative purposes but we will show is ultimately irrelevant to the accurate evaluation of flow efficiency from the model 3 experimental details the ftecdi cells were constructed with two sheets of hierarchical carbon aerogel monoliths hcams derived from carbonized and activated resorcinol formaldehyde aerogel baumann et al 2008 biener et al 2011 suss et al 2012 the dimensions of the electrodes were 4 5 6 cm with an average thickness of 350 μm the material has an electrical conductivity of 20 30 s cm mass density of 0 65 g cm 3 after drying at 70 c total mass of 0 5 g electrode and approximate bet surface area of 1100 m2 g assuming a carbon density of 1 95 g cm 3 the measured density implies an average total porosity of 67 for an electrode separator we employed 125 μm dry thickness white coffee filter paper for contacts strips of 0 03 mm thickness 99 6 titanium foil solution materials llc santa clara ca were inserted into the cell the electrodes and filter paper were stacked between laser roughened polycarbonate endplates with tubulation ports and the cell was sealed with a uv cure epoxy and clamped to reduce contact resistance see si for full device schematic the header volume on either side of the electrodes is difficult to estimate due to its roughness however an effective thickness of approximately 75 μm is reasonable assuming a 150 μm total header thickness a microporosity of 20 and a separator porosity of 50 the total fluid volume of the assembly is expected to be 1 21 ml the resistances and capacitance of each cell were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis cyclic voltammetry and simple galvanostatic charging see si eis and cyclic voltammetry using a biologic vsp 300 potentiostat claix france an analysis of the operational galvanostatic discharge voltage vs time revealed device differential capacitances of 10 13 f in 50 mm nacl alfa aesar acs 99 min a total measured cell differential capacitance of 10 13 f here implies an operational material capacitance of approximately 46 f g or 30 f cm 3 in 50 mm nacl the desalination performance of each cell was tested by applying a constant current and simultaneously monitoring the terminal voltage not corrected for series resistance using a keithley 2602b sourcemeter tektronix inc beaverton or to monitor the effluent concentration we used a flow through conductivity sensor edaq et916 17 μl denistone east australia installed downstream of the cdi cell the sensor was kept close to the effluent port and attached to a narrow 1 59 mm diameter tube in order to minimize delay times guyes et al 2017 the sensor was 2 point calibrated with nist traceable kcl conductivity standards with base values of 12 88 ms cm and 1 413 ms cm which were corrected for their 23 2 c ambient temperature oakton instruments vernon hills il multipoint conductivity calibration over the range of interest is important because it corrects for both the proportional and offset errors of the sensor due to temperature drift of the solution conductivity wu and berezansky 1995 spivey and shedlovsky 1967 we assumed that under dss conditions the integrated salt flux over a cycle was zero and hence corrected the conductivity accordingly see si finally the flow of the feed solution through the cell was controlled through a peristaltic pump watson marlow falmouth cornwall uk from 0 to 100 rpm 0 12 91 ml min in closed loop circulation with a 2 l reservoir continuously purged with hydrated nitrogen the water used to make all solutions was milli q ultrapure 18 2 m ω cm we observed no change in the reservoir fluid volume and ph over time and thus assume the inlet concentration as constant in order to achieve dss 5 full cdi cycles were performed for each operational condition 4 results and discussion 4 1 the flow efficiency substituting eqn 10 into eqn 1 with the proper c 0 initial conditions for each step and integrating in time where q c f e e d c e f f 0 i e the lower blue shaded regions in fig 1c yields the measured salt removed δ n e f f for a cycle in moles for the cc operation mode of fig 1 finally using periodic boundary conditions for the initial and final effluent concentration over a cycle recognizing that the actual salt adsorbed during the cycle in the model is δ n a d s i t c λ f and assuming for simplicity that the coulombic efficiency is unity a more realistic non unity coulombic efficiency does not effect the predictions see fig 2 b we arrive at the following simple equations for the flow efficiency eqn 7 for the operation modes considered herein 11 λ f l o w 2 τ c t c ln e t c τ c t f l τ f l 1 e t f l τ f l 1 1 12 λ f l o w n f 2 τ c t c ln e t c τ c 1 2 1 13 λ f l o w s f tanh t f l 2 τ f l 14 δ n e f f i t c λ f λ f l o w here τ c v c e l l q c is the residence time during charging and τ f l v c e l l q f l is the residence time during flushing fig 1 importantly the ratios t c τ c and t f l τ f l directly correspond respectively to the number of fluid volumes flowed through the cell during charging and flushing in dimensionless units of cell volumes special cases of λ f l o w include λ f l o w n f in eqn 12 which is the flow efficiency of eqn 11 for the case of no flush operation t f l 0 and λ f l o w s f in eqn 13 which is the flow efficiency of eqn 11 for the case of stop flow operation q c 0 we emphasize that eqns 11 13 are solved for dss conditions making them relevant to only equilibrated continuous cdi cycling operation this newly detailed efficiency primarily arises as a consequence of cycling and mixing and quantifies the fact that desalinated or brine water inside the cell should be swept out from the interior of the device before the next step is initiated thus if a cell discharge is carried out immediately after charging with no flush which is the typical cc operation mode zhao et al 2013a hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2012a dykstra et al 2016 then a portion of the desalinated water inside the cell will always be lost due to immediate resalination in other words the total amount of salt adsorbed during charging equal here to i t c λ f is effectively never measured through the effluent concentration during charging due to a finite amount of desalinated water residing within the cell for conditions of low volumes flowed during desalination step s i e low t c τ c t f l τ f l much of the desalinated water is still inside the cell when the next step is initiated making it an extremely inefficient process fig 2a while we elucidate these effects with a ftecdi geometry the rationale here is clearly applicable to any other cdi device that relies on cycling hemmatifar et al 2016 fig 2a plots the flow efficiencies in eqn 11 as a function of the ratios t c τ c and t f l τ f l which can be thought of as the number of cell volumes of fluid flowed through the cell during the respective step under many operational circumstances clearly the flow loss can be substantial the asymmetric scales in fig 2a show that the open circuit flushing step is far more effective at minimizing flow losses λ f l o w s f 90 for t f l τ f l 3 for the case of little or no flush only with very large cell volumes of fluid flowed through the device during charging do the flow losses become reasonable λ f l o w n f 90 for t c τ c 14 this result is consistent with observations in the literature by zhao et al zhao et al 2013b who found that higher flow rates and thus higher cell volumes flowed yielded better asar for no flush cc operation hence experimentally one can avoid a low flow efficiency by either significantly increasing t c τ c or by introducing a flushing step following the charging discharging step which is done at zero current and elevated flow rate to minimize energy use and time taken unfortunately though with more volumes of feed water flown through the device the effluent concentration is driven back toward feed concentration thus the price of a higher flow efficiency is often a lower depth of desalination 4 1 1 parameter extraction for model verification in terms of the following discussion and experiments for model verification the only free parameters are the cell volume v c e l l and the effective time averaged differential charge efficiency λ however v c e l l can be estimated geometrically and confirmed by independent measurements see si and experimental section in order to best test the model one can vary the experimentally controlled flow rates q c or q f l or the flush time duration t f l at constant values of feed concentration c f e e d charging discharging current i and voltage window e g 0 2 1 v which thereby also makes t c essentially constant this approach helps ensure that λ is invariant over different experiments thereby allowing the functional forms of eqns 11 13 to be examined for the cases below we chose to vary q c or q f l and hold the rest of the parameters constant throughout a given experimental run the results of such experiments allow the model to be tested and for the extraction of v c e l l and λ for use in predicting the corresponding performance metrics outlined in eqns 2 and 4 6 here we specifically extracted the flow efficiency by fitting the measured cycle charge efficiency λ d y n of eqn 2 to that calculated by the model from eqns 11 13 and eqn 15 note also that the charge time t c was different between the two comparisons here because the voltage window for the stop flow case was narrowed to avoid depletion effects see si for tables of all experimental data the flush time t f l was arbitrarily chosen in the stop flow case to be 1 min 4 1 2 stop flow and no flush results fig 2b plots the limiting cases of 2a along with experimental data from a ftecdi cell for the remainder of the paper we chose to verify the model with data from the limiting cases of stop flow eqn 13 and no flush eqn 12 for several reasons 1 the no flush case is the most commonly used and is most relevant to previous studies zhao et al 2013a hemmatifar et al 2016 zhao et al 2012a dykstra et al 2016 2 according to fig 2a these limiting cases represent the largest disparate linear trajectories over the flow efficiency manifold 3 they present the simplest possible comparison in terms of independent variables and 4 the general case can often be thought of as a smooth transition between the two cases fig 2b experimentally confirms the significantly sharper rise in flow efficiency per cell volume flowed for open circuit flushing as opposed to continuous flow charging as expected from fig 2a and eqns 12 and 13 this implies that the maximum average concentration reduction for stop flow is superior to no flush which is a significant factor in limiting the number of stages required to reduce an effluent concentration to a desired level fig 2b also demonstrates outstanding agreement between the model predictions and experimental results over a wide range of cell volumes flowed during their respective desalination steps in terms of parameter extraction only the cell volume v c e l l 1 23 ml identical in both operation modes and the scaling factor λ 0 86 for stop flow and λ 0 93 for no flush were fit to match model to experiment the fitted cell volume of 1 23 ml is in excellent agreement with the geometric fluid volume expected from the assembly 1 21 ml see experimental section and alternative measurements of the cell fluid volume detailed in the si suggesting that the device behaves like a well mixed reactor m f 1 the difference in λ was simply due to a slightly different voltage window chosen for stop flow to avoid depletion effects these constants are used below to compare cdi performance metrics with experiment all of the other parameters needed were directly taken from experiment in order to better illustrate the tradeoff between flow efficiency and concentration reduction fig 3 shows the quasi steady state concentration reduction of the feed concentration eqn 9 plotted against flow rate during charging for the no flush case the fitted value of λ q s s 0 98 from fig 3 supports the high fitted value of λ 0 93 for no flush operation we provide further support of the accuracy of our differential charge efficiency fits assumptions by calculating λ directly over an experimental no flush charging step see si this calculation further confirms the near constant value of λ and high overall fitted values found herein comparison of the top axis in fig 3 and the bottom axis of fig 2b also directly shows that the flow efficiency and concentration reduction are in opposition to each other in this case for high flow efficiencies of 90 the maximum concentration reduction is less than 10 5 mm out of 50 mm overall future work is needed on defining acceptable concentration reduction levels for cdi processes we will further highlight this problem below with regard to the standard cdi performance metrics overall the excellent agreement between eqns 12 and 13 and experiment mean that researchers can with an estimate of their cell s effective fluid volume calculate their flow efficiency losses for any of the cc operation modes described herein such an estimate is critical to breaking down where losses arise and how they tradeoff with other effects like concentration reduction we emphasize that the set of experiments conducted herein are primarily done to confirm the accuracy of eqns 11 13 by establishing their accuracy eqns 11 13 can be confidently used as tools in understanding a given cc cdi operation s performance 4 1 2 1 cdi performance metrics we can now examine how the flow efficiency factors into cdi performance metrics by combining eqns 11 14 with eqns 2 and 4 6 the experimentally measured dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle λ d y n eqn 2 can be readily calculated with the aid of eqns 11 14 giving 15 λ d y n λ λ f l o w thus here the measured dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle can be thought of as the product of the effective time average of the differential charge efficiency and the flow efficiency here λ ultimately captures double layer and faradaic adsorption efficiencies that are well known to cdi researchers this work shows that these processes are also convoluted with the flow efficiency in a multiplicative manner hence the dependence and coupling in physics associated with electric double layers faraday type reaction losses and transport limitations results in effectively three respective efficiencies which multiply together that is the overall dependence between salt removed from the stream and electric charge input is reflected by a relation of the form λ d y n λ c o u l λ d l λ f l o w where λ c o u l and λ d l would represent coulombic and double layer type adsorption efficiencies the dss cycle sac can be obtained from combining eqns 4 and 14 to give 16 s a c m i t c m f λ λ f l o w which here will take the same shape as the flow efficiency in fig 2b but with different vertical axis units see si for sac plots eqn 16 shows that the sac has many degrees of freedom and depends heavily on experimentally chosen parameters like the charging current flow rates and step time durations while the sac is traditionally intended to be more of a material metric relations like eqn 16 show that sac is as much an operational figure of merit as it is a material one the peak sac values that we measure here are 4 2 mg g under no flush conditions and 2 mg g under stop flow conditions the stop flow case was lower largely because a narrower voltage window due to increased susceptibility to depletion effects and slightly different cell characteristics see si in a similar fashion to dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle and sac the asar for fig 1 like operation is 17 a s a r i t c λ λ f l o w f a t c y c l e thus the time penalty introduced in asar effectively constrains the flush time t f l to smaller values the enas in contrast to asar has no time penalty which means that from a salt removal perspective the enas simply goes as eqn 14 divided by the energy consumed modeling energy consumption in dss cc cdi is beyond the scope of this work though in the absence of an energy consumption model that includes parasitic parallel losses dykstra et al 2017 it is worth noting that a simplified constant resistance model for enas with no faradaic losses i e λ q η c o u l t d c t c 1 means that energy consumption should scale as 18 e i n e o u t 2 i 2 r t c 19 e n a s λ λ f l o w 2 f i r here r is the quasi steady state cell resistance which includes ionic separator and contact contributions as defined in dunn and newman 2000 and t c r c 3 posey and morozumi 1966 where c is the total cell capacitance f further discussion of energy consumption and parameter optimization is reserved for a future study however it is worth noting that eqns 17 and 19 have an inverse relationship with respect to applied current which is consistent with results in our previous work hemmatifar et al 2016 since finite contact ionic and separator resistances are fundamental parts of any cdi device qu et al 2015 dykstra et al 2016 eqns 17 and 19 outline the best case scenario for the tradeoff between throughput and energy consumption all enas values reported herein assume perfect energy recovery during discharge with no energy recovery the values would be 2 2 5 lower than reported here see si finally in light of the results above we introduce a simple new parameter that we argue should always be reported when evaluating cdi performance namely we add the average concentration reduction over a cycle δ c we can estimate δ c in the present cc model with 20 δ c i t c λ λ f l o w f q c t c q f l t f l the average concentration reduction is introduced because asar enas sac and dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle are not linked to how effectively the influent concentration was reduced during operation this means that these performance metrics can be highly impressive but are not practically important because only minor changes in the influent concentration were induced higher values of δ c are desirable because it means that fewer stages are required to drop the influent concentration to a given desired value 4 1 3 performance metrics model and experiment we now explore how the flow efficiency quantitatively relates to the performance metrics discussed above for the present case fig 4 compares model and experiment under stop flow and no flush operation for asar fig 4a enas fig 4b dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle fig 4c and δ c fig 4d as expected the model fits all the cdi metrics exceedingly well which follows from its accurate prediction of flow efficiency in fig 2 and use of experimental parameters for other inputs it should be noted that the enas was calculated using the experimentally measured energy consumed in place of an energy consumption model however the energy consumed was nearly constant here for different experiments in the same series making the flow efficiency the primary factor underlying the changes in enas in this series of experiments the flow efficiency fully accounts for the variability in these performance metrics over a wide range of relevant operation fig 4 demonstrating the crucial role it plays in understanding dss cdi behavior without an understanding of this new loss factor a researcher could easily choose flow rates that yield performance metrics that are uniformly 2 4 worse and perhaps also incorrectly infer a poor λ notably in the experiments performed here the dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle peaks at 84 which is high for membrane free cdi and consistent with the fitted λ prefactors suss et al 2015 note that the optimal measured λ d y n values for stop flow vs no flush fig 4c tend in the opposite direction of the respective fitted λ parameters until large volumes of feed are flowed during desalination thus only by accounting for flow efficiency can the correct interpretation of loss factors be made for the experiments underlying fig 4 the asar enas and dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle all increase monotonically with increasing volume delivered during charging or flushing i e higher t c τ c or t f l τ f l while the average concentration reduction fig 4d actually decreases this is expected as more volume flowed for a given amount of salt adsorbed will result in an effluent concentration that is closer to the influent concentration it is clear from fig 4 that it is critical to consider a metric like δ c otherwise the best performance comes from delivering as much feed water as possible and re concentrating the effluent to values very nearly identical to the feed nevertheless asar and enas measured at close to zero concentration reduction may still be useful as an upper limit for the device performance finally in terms of the comparison between stop flow and no flush operation fig 4a shows that in this case for larger cell volumes of fluid delivered 4 7 the no flush operation has an advantage in asar over stop flow due to a shorter cycling period i e no additional time spent flushing note though that the maximum asars could be made more comparable here without change of other metrics by simply decreasing t f l and increasing q f l while holding t f l τ f l constant when looking at enas fig 4b though it is not until 8 9 cell volumes flowed during desalination that no flush overtakes stop flow at this point the effluent concentration is mixed with significant amounts of feed water leading to a δ c of around 6 4 mm fig 4d or a 12 8 reduction in concentration by contrast the stop flow case would remove 9 4 mm out of 50 mm or a 18 8 reduction at 87 of that enas which is a reasonable tradeoff in energy cost for a 1 5 increase in desalination depth the dynamic charge efficiency over a cycle in fig 4c largely mimics the shape of fig 2b showing how important it is to understand the role of flow efficiency in the overall salt adsorption efficiency landscape by factoring out the flow efficiency with the equations presented herein researchers will be able to better assess the impact of material treatments and operational modes on the true charge adsorption efficiency srimuk et al 2016 cai et al 2017 srimuk et al 2017 in terms of δ c fig 2d indicates that stop flow operation is capable of delivering larger desalination depths ultimately yielding δ c values that are unattainable with no flush operation lastly it should be noted that the operational parameters underlying fig 4 were not optimized in any particular manner but rather chosen to best highlight the effect of flow efficiency 5 limitations and constraints the flow efficiency predictions made in this work eqns 11 13 are primarily influenced by the number of cell fluid volumes flowed and are not sensitive to the detailed differential charge efficiency profile or round trip coulombic efficiency nevertheless the model presented herein will be most accurate when faradaic currents are low corresponding to measured η c o u l values of approximately 80 or greater when faradaic processes are substantial within a cycle the charge discharge times become highly asymmetric t c t d c with respect to a given voltage window and significant salt desorption can result due to voltage decay during flushing and or a decrease in applied current that goes towards adsorption in terms of effluent concentration faradaic processes result in a c e f f profile during cc charging that never reaches quasi steady state e g fig 3 inset but instead turns up strongly towards the feed concentration after reaching a minimum such an effluent profile is not captured by the simple solution to the continuity equation used here eqn 10 cdi cycling with significant faradaic currents requires more detailed modeling than that used here to understand dykstra et al 2017 guyes et al 2017 shocron and suss 2017 similar to excessive parallel losses significant depletion of the feed concentration is not accounted for within the present model indeed there is no explicit mechanism built into eqn 10 that prevents c e f f from going negative when there are excessively high adsorption rates relative to the feed supply i λ q s s f q c c f e e d this is not a major concern though as such experimental conditions are usually avoided because of the negative impact on energy consumption additionally the model herein does not explicitly account for significant salt desorption effects due to chemical surface charge which can be significant at low voltages especially with purposefully functionalized electrodes biesheuvel et al 2015 gao et al 2015 wu et al 2016 hemmatifar et al 2017 similar to the other limiting situations though a voltage window is typically chosen to avoid significant desorption peaks in the effluent concentration due to its negative impact on performance finally it is worth summarizing the implicit constraints for the parameters in eqns 11 14 first the dss charge time t c is constrained to first order by the capacitance voltage window cell resistance and charging current for a simple ohmic situation no parallel faradaic or parallel losses like that assumed in eqn 18 t c can be estimated as jande and kim 2013 dunn and newman 2000 21 t c c δ v i 2 r where δ v is the experimentally chosen voltage window v and t c r c 3 posey and morozumi 1966 thus there is a tradeoff between charging current i and time spent charging t c in eqns 11 14 hemmatifar et al 2016 the voltage window here is constrained on the lower end by the double layer adsorption efficiency and on the high end by faradaic loss processes biesheuvel et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 pillay and newman 1996 while the total cell capacitance can be changed with device geometry this also impacts the residence times through v c e l l and potentially asar through the face area however an increase in the capacitance per unit volume or in the voltage window where differential charge efficiency is high does circumvent flow efficiency concentration reduction tradeoffs by allowing for both a lower average effluent concentration and a higher flow efficiency since membrane cdi mcdi has a larger practical operating window due to its high differential charge efficiency at low voltages it is expected that mcdi will have generally higher flow efficiency than regular cdi due to increased t c through higher δ v finally the residence times τ c and τ f l are constrained by the desired concentration reduction 6 conclusions in summary we have analyzed cdi performance metrics under cc operation with a simple cstr type model in doing so we detail a previously unappreciated loss mechanism inherent to cdi cycling we quantify this loss mechanism with a parameter called the flow efficiency originally defined by johnson and newman 1971 and demonstrate the accuracy of the model with excellent agreement between predictions and experiment we show that the flow efficiency arises from desalinated water within the cell being partially lost due to re salination by the subsequent step this loss can be substantial for many operating conditions and is multiplicative with the other well known charge adsorption efficiencies flow losses can be largely avoided by flowing 14 cell volumes of feed solution during charging or by including a 1 5 cell volume open circuit flush after charging and discharging steps these strategies however come with the tradeoff of less concentration reduction and therefore in principle the need for more cdi stages to reduce feed water salinity along these lines we find that optimal asar enas and sac values always occur in the low concentration reduction limit overall we provide simple and accurate equations that researchers can use to evaluate the flow efficiency and break down their cdi performance acknowledgments work at llnl was performed under the auspices of the us doe by llnl

19848,fouling mechanisms underlying the filtration behaviors of alginate solution caused by calcium addition were investigated by terahertz time domain spectroscopy thz tds and density functional theory dft techniques filtration tests showed that specific filtration resistance sfr of alginate solution 0 75 g l 1 monotonously increased with calcium addition at a relatively low range of calcium concentration 0 1 0 mm and sfr 2 61 1015 m kg 1 of alginate solution with 1 0 mm calcium addition was extremely high as compared with sludge suspension characterizations by x ray photoelectric spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and thermogravimetric analysis tga showed that the composition of functional groups elements and thermal stability of alginate was not apparently affected by calcium concentration howbeit thz tds spectra showed that calcium addition caused structural variation of alginate polymer in solution dtf calculation results showed that initial binding of alginate chains induced by calcium ions preferentially occurred in intermolecular other than intramolecular and moreover the two alginate chains bridged by a calcium atom tend to stretch in a tetrahedron structure cross to each other other than parallel to each other according to these results chemical potential gap depicted by flory huggins theory was suggested to be responsible for the filtration behaviors of alginate solution caused by calcium addition this study provided the mechanistic insights into membrane fouling graphical abstract image keywords membrane fouling wastewater treatment calcium ion dft calculation membrane bioreactor 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology has been popularly used for treatment and reclamation of wastewater mainly owning to its outstanding performances and distinct advantages over conventional activated sludge process cas lin et al 2012 wang et al 2014 2016 shen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 however membrane fouling remains the primary limitation for the broader application of this technology yuan et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 cai et al 2017 undoubtedly membrane fouling in mbrs are caused by various foulants which can be generally classified into biofoulants and inorganic foulants liao et al 2004 lin et al 2013 chen et al 2017 tan et al 2017 it has been reported that soluble microbial products smp extracellular polymeric substances eps biopolymer clusters bpc and transparent exopolymeric particles tep were of kind of critical biofoulants affecting membrane fouling liao et al 2004 wang et al 2013 lin et al 2014 guo and chang 2017 zhao et al 2017 among various inorganic foulants divalent cations have drawn significant attention abrahamse et al 2008 in particular calcium ions appear important all the more for membrane fouling due to their universal existence in real wastewater and their complicated interactions with biofoulants van den brink et al 2009 mo et al 2011 meng et al 2015 xin et al 2016 for example it was reported that municipal wastewater subjected to treatment by mbrs had calcium concentrations within 0 5 3 mm arabi and nakhla 2008 despite the low concentration in natural water bodies associated with biofoulants calcium ions were reported to involve into several processes including gel layer formation sludge bioflocculation and biological precipitation directly related with membrane fouling wang et al 2008 van den brink et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 it is difficult to study these processes individually due to the interrelationship among these processes van den brink et al 2009 rendering effect of calcium ions on membrane fouling and its mechanisms very complicated so far extensive efforts have been devoted into investigating effect of calcium ions on membrane fouling ang and elimelech 2007 de kerchove and elimelech 2007 katsoufidou et al 2007 listiarini et al 2009 chen et al 2011 mo et al 2011 kim and dempsey 2013 wu et al 2014 mahlangu et al 2015 however most of them focused on effect of calcium ions at relatively high concentrations of calcium ion which were obviously higher than the concentrations in natural water bodies moreover the observation results regarding the effect seemed controversial some reported a decline in the filtration performance with increase in calcium ion concentration de kerchove and elimelech 2007 katsoufidou et al 2007 van den brink et al 2009 meng et al 2015 while some others found the adverse result listiarini et al 2009 chen et al 2011 kim and dempsey 2013 wu et al 2014 in addition by broadening the testing range of calcium ion concentration several studies mo et al 2011 mahlangu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 observed a unimodal pattern of filtration resistance with increase in calcium ion concentration the underlying causes of these controversial results are unclear and have not been investigated previously this research status on effect of calcium ion on membrane fouling may be attributed to three indisputable facts variety and complexity of biofoulants in mbrs different calcium ion concentration studied and lack of effective tools to explore the underlying mechanisms although biofoulants in mbrs are complex and various it is generally accepted that polysaccharides and proteins are the most abundant components in these biofoulants and this is especially for polysaccharides in most cases gao et al 2013 meng and liu 2013 hong et al 2014 however polysaccharides in mbrs are actually a group of various organic matters with different sources which brings difficulty to explore the exact fouling mechanisms due to its similar behaviors to polysaccharides during filtration alginate has been most frequently used as a model compound for polysaccharides in membrane fouling studies kim and dempsey 2013 meng et al 2015 xin et al 2016 moreover alginate is prone to form a gel through ionotropic gelation ig when associated with calcium ions excluding effects of other less important fouling processes therefore exploring the effects of calcium ions on fouling behaviors of alginate should be very conductive to reveal exact causes of above inconsistent results or puzzlements meanwhile the rapid developments in experimental technique and computational chemistry provides new approaches for membrane fouling study terahertz time domain spectroscopy thz tds is a developed technique extensively applied in detecting photoelectrical properties of crystal polymer and organic liquid lien nguyen et al 2007 due to its high sensibility to structures interactions and dynamic of molecules and molecules complexes zeitler et al 2007 hoshina et al 2014 thz spectral could provide more information than fourier transform infrared ftir spectral such as adsorption coefficients vibration rotation and refractive indices the density functional theory dft is a computational quantum mechanical modelling method used to investigate the electronic structure of many body systems yu 2014 shkir et al 2015 yu et al 2015 according to the computational results about molecular structures and binding energies dft can provide accurate prediction for the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions however to our knowledge none study has investigated membrane fouling by using these approaches this study focuses on investigating the underlying reaction mechanism of alginate and calcium ions at relatively low calcium concentration by the combinational usage of thz tds and dft tools the experimental situation was set to be that biofoulant alginate amount is abundant while calcium ions are limited much similar to the real wastewater in this situation it is possible to investigate the initial process of binding of alginate chains induced by a calcium ion which is the key of gel formation and membrane fouling the specific filtration resistances of alginate solutions with different calcium addition were firstly determined experimental characterizations including art ftir x ray photoelectric spectroscopy xps thermogravimetric analysis tga and thz tds were carried out to determine the physiochemical properties of alginate calcium complexes finally detailed dft calculations were performed and the binding energies were calculated the underlying mechanism of the filtration behavior were analyzed and discussed this hand in hand approach of both experimental determinations and theoretical calculations would provide a comprehensive insight into the effect of calcium ions on fouling properties of alginate 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation both sodium alginate sa and cacl2 used for the preparation of alginate samples were provided by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china molecular weight of sa is in range of 32000 250000 da deionized di water obtained by an eped ultrapure water system shanghai pigeon electronic technology co ltd china was applied for sample preparation in this study a series of 0 75 g l 1 alginate working solutions with ca2 concentrations of 0 without calcium addition 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 mm were prepared with the following steps 0 75 g sa powder and series amount of cacl2 were firstly added in 900 ml and 100 ml di water respectively and then magnetically stirred for 2 h until completely dissolved sa can be easily dissolved in the water when calcium ions are added an alginate gel can be obviously formed within 2 h indicating that 2 h is enough to form a gel thereafter 100 ml of the cacl2 solutions were gradually added to 900 ml of the sa solutions under continuous stirring for 2 h all the working solutions were prepared at room temperature 20 c and used within one day to prevent microgram growth it should be noted that sa was used to model smp rather than sludge mass in aerobic mbrs this study focused on gel formation process for this consideration a relatively higher sa concentration 0 75 g l was set in this study to highlight gel formation process literature studies also reported comparable sa concentrations used for membrane fouling research derradji et al 2000 van de ven et al 2008 motsa et al 2014 in this study the experimental sfr measurements and dft calculations were conducted by analyzing alginate samples in bulk solution composition and structure analysis including ftir spectra xps tga and thz tds were performed by analyzing the gel layer samples formed on membrane surface the sample type is required by these analytical techniques 2 2 evaluation of specific filtration resistance specific filtration resistance r c of alginate solution and sludge suspension samples was determined through batch filtration tests with a dead end mode all the filtration tests were carried out in a stirred cell msc300 purchased from shanghai sinap co ltd china with 300 ml effective filtration volume effective filtration area is 0 00332 m2 the stirred cell was filled with 250 ml of alginate working solution and driven by pressurized nitrogen from a gas cylinder the pressure was maintained to be 40 kpa during the filtration and the permeate weight was recorded by a digital balance polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf provided by shanghai sinap co ltd china flat sheet membrane with 0 1 μm pore size and 140 kda molecular weight cut off mwco was used in this study prior to the tests fresh membranes were pretreated using ultrasonic for 30 min and then placed in di water for 24 h to remove impurities all membranes were pre compacted with 40 kpa pressure for 20 min in order to stabilize the membrane flux measurements of sa concentration in filtrate indicated that almost all the alginate molecules can be rejected by the pvdf membrane during filtration process possibly due to the large mw and gelation of alginate molecules in a dead end batch filtration tests the relationship between total permeate volume and time can be described as 1 t v μ c s a r c 2 a m 2 δ p v μ r m δ p a m where t and v represent the time and total permeate volume at time t respectively μ is the dynamic viscosity of permeate c sa is the concentration of sa solution a m is the effective membrane area δp is the trans membrane pressure r m is the membrane resistance plotting t v versus v yields a straight line setting that k is the time to filtration ratio r c can be calculated by 2 r c 2 a m 2 δ p k μ c s a these two equations represent the standard process to experimentally obtain sfr of foulant suspensions solutions kim and dempsey 2013 zhang et al 2013 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 atr ftir analysis functional groups of alginate samples were determined by a nicolet 670 ftir spectrometer the samples were prepared by dehydrating series of alginate solutions with ca2 concentrations of 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 mm respectively with a stirred cell to form a thin layer then the prepared gel layers were dried by a vacuum freeze dryer freezone 2 5 labconco usa for 12 h and stored in a dryer before atr ftir analysis the spectral data of each sample were collected by an overhead and detachable multi reflection attenuated total reflectance accessory atr in the range of 4000 500 cm 1 in order to eliminate background interference a background spectrum was taken by the empty atr crystal and recorded in computer before scanning each sample omnic software was utilized to analyze the obtained spectrum data 2 3 2 x ray photoelectric spectroscopy xps analysis surface chemical composition of alginate samples was characterized in an escalab 250xi xps spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa by using al k x rays 1486 6 ev as the excitation source the pressure in the sample chamber was 1 10 9 mbar and the pass energy constant was 20 ev for high resolution scans for each sample a survey scan encompassing the binding energy region of 0 1200 ev was firstly obtained and the spectra of ca2p were further recorded to get accurate information about the oxidation state of the calcium 2 3 3 thermogravimetric analysis tga thermal stabilities of alginate gels were examined using a sta449 f5 thermogravimetric analyzer ta instruments netasch germany under a nitrogen atmosphere the condensed samples were placed in oxide aluminium pans and heated from room temperature to 600 c at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the residual weights of the alginate gels were recorded 2 3 4 terahertz time domain spectroscopy thz tds analysis thz spectra of alginate samples were measured using a standard thz tds apparatus with the transmission measurement mode femtosecond laser mai tai spectra physics was used to generate 100 fs pulses at a wavelength of 800 nm with average power of 700 mw and a repetition rate of 80 mhz the output was separated by a beam splitter into two parts a pump beam illuminated the thz emitter gaas crystal to produce thz pulses and a probe beam detected the pulsed thz radiation in a znte crystal via electro optical sampling signal noise ratio snr was higher than 1000 1 the used bandwidth of the spectrometer is 0 4 2 8 thz and the frequency resolution is 1 9 ghz sample thickness was approximately 0 1 mm all the measurements were conducted at room temperature and the entire thz beam pathway was purged with dry nitrogen in order to minimize the interference of water vapor 2 4 dft calculations all the quantum chemical calculations were performed using density functional theory dft method with b3lyp hybrid functional implemented in gaussian 09 program an alginate model containing 20 uronic units was firstly constructed to uncover the favorable configuration of single alginate chain a cluster model including a ca2 and two alginate chains was then constructed to explore the interactions between the alginate and calcium ion at the molecular level each alginate chain contains six uronic rings molecular geometries were optimized with the 6 31g basis set to obtain more accurate energies single point calculations on the optimized structures were performed with the larger basis set 6 31 g d p frequency calculations were performed with the 6 31g basis set to obtain zero point energies zpe and to confirm the nature of all the stationary points that have no imaginary frequency for the local minima note that the energies reported in this paper are thus the single point energies corrected for zpes 2 5 flory huggins theory flory huggins theory a mathematical theory was proposed to describe the chemical potential change in mixing process of a polymer solution or gel lay formation flory 1941 according to this theory the polymer molecules in the solution are regarded as chains of segments and each segment equals in size to a solvent molecule flory 1941 under constant temperature t and pressure δ p gibbs free energy change δ g m during the mixing process can be expressed by 3 δ g m δ h m t δ s m where δ s m signifies the combinatorial entropy of mixing and δ h m is the enthalpy change which can be given by eqs 4 and 5 respectively for the random and ideal mixing process 4 δ h m r t χ n 1 ϕ 2 5 δ s m r n 1 ln ϕ 1 n 2 ln ϕ 2 where r and χ represent the universal gas constant and the flory huggins interaction parameter respectively n 1 and n 2 are the molar number of water and polymer respectively ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the volume fraction of water and polymer respectively as ϕ 1 ϕ 2 1 the chemical potential change δ μ m of mixing can be further deduced by 6 δ μ m δ g m n 1 t p n 2 r t ln 1 ϕ 2 1 n 1 ϕ 2 χ ϕ 2 2 where n is the degree of polymerization 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of calcium ions on the filtration resistance of alginate solution fig 1 a shows the original data with t v versus v for calculating specific filtration resistance sfr of a gel solution it is clear that sfr of a gel solution can be easily obtained by batch filtration tests fig 1b illustrates the effect of calcium ions on the sfr of alginate solution it can be seen that sfr of alginate solution is remarkably affected by calcium concentration the alginate sfr continuously increases with calcium concentration increases in the range of 0 1 0 mm the tested calcium concentration range was quite low as compared with alginate concentration in this study suggesting that calcium ions are limited when they complex ionisable groups in alginate in such a relatively low calcium concentration range alginate sfr change trend with calcium concentration in this study is agreeable with literature studies de kerchove and elimelech 2007 katsoufidou et al 2007 van den brink et al 2009 meng et al 2015 moreover the alginate solution with 1 0 mm calcium ions possesses a sfr of 2 61 1015 m kg 1 which is about 13 times higher than that of pure sa solution 2 01 1014 m kg 1 meanwhile the sfr of the sludge suspension in the mbr with 10 64 g l 1 and 0 75 g l 1 mlss possess sfr of 2 11 1012 and 1 91 1012 m kg 1 respectively comparable sfr values of sludge suspension with similar mlss concentration have been reported in the literature pollice et al 2007 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 the sfr of alginate solution with 1 0 mm calcium ions was more than 1000 times higher than that of sludge suspension with the same solid concentration fig 1b and the comparison to sludge suspension presented two interesting results the monotonical increase trend of sfr of alginate solution with calcium addition and the extremely high sfr of alginate solution with calcium addition to our knowledge the underlying causes for these results have not been well investigated to date since calcium ion addition could not change the chemical element composition these interesting results should stem from the changes of chemical and physical geometrical configuration of alginate caused by calcium ion addition therefore in this study detailed characterizations of alginate solution hydrogel including art ftir xps tga and thz tds were conducted to explore the exact cause of the alginate filtration behaviors at low range of calcium concentration meanwhile detailed dft calculations were performed and the corresponding binding energies were calculated 3 2 characterization of alginate gels with different calcium addition 3 2 1 ftir spectra continuous addition of calcium ions to alginate solution could cause formation of an apparent alginate gel fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of alginate gels with different calcium additions a broad region of absorption between 3600 and 3000 cm 1 is due to the stretching of o h bond in hydroxyl functional groups treenate and monvisade 2017 the characteristic peaks at near 1593 and 1409 cm 1 are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretch vibration of coo associated with carboxylic acid salts simpson et al 2004 an absorption peak at near 1023 cm 1 is assigned to the ionic binding wong et al 2002 moreover the addition of calcium leads to a slight shift of the characteristic peaks for coo symmetric stretching of sa from 1405 cm 1 to higher wavenumbers 1408 1409 and 1411 cm 1 apparently the functional groups of the alginate gels are similar regardless of the calcium concentration this means that the functional groups of alginate are not apparently changed by the addition of calcium ions therefore above mentioned interesting results should reside in other changes 3 2 2 xps analyses fig 3 shows the xps spectra of ca 2p for alginate gels with different calcium addition as shown in fig 3 the typical ca 2p core level spectra of alginate gels can be fitted by two peaks at binding energies of around 350 6 and 347 0 ev jiao et al 2016 which are ascribed to the coexistence of two different modifications of calcium in alginate gels in addition the intensity of the ca 2p signals in fig 3c f is higher than that in fig 3a and b indicating that the amount of calcium in the alginate gels as well as the cross linking of calcium ions with coo is increased with the increase of calcium concentration it should be noted that two decomposed peaks at binding energies of around 350 6 and 347 0 ev are also observed for the alginate gel without calcium addition showing the existence of calcium in the pure sa sample however the measured intensity is weak indicating that the amount of calcium in the solution is low as sa is a linear copolymer composed of varied combinations and sequences of homopolymeric blocks and heteropolymeric block refined from brown algae or seaweeds the weak signal in fig 3a should originate essentially from the calcium residual during the extraction process nevertheless elemental composition difference is not the underlying cause for the phenomenon observed in fig 1 3 2 3 tga analyses fig 4 shows the thermogravimetric analysis tga results of the alginate gels with different calcium addition it can be seen from fig 4 that the tga curve of the samples can be divided into two phases the first phase is a low temperature region where a sharp decrease occurred at temperatures 100 c under nitrogen gas corresponding to the evaporation of water these results indicate that the water in the alginate gels mainly exists in the form of free water regardless of calcium content the second region in the range of 100 c 600 c shows an approximately constant weight residual fig 4 clearly shows that there is no significant difference in thermal stability of alginate gels with different calcium addition it was reported that the thermal stability of alginate will be changed by the addition of metal ions liu et al 2016 pan et al 2017 which may be caused by the proportion variation of free water and bound water resulted from the cross linking effect lei et al 2016 accordingly the similar profiles and variation trends of the alginate with different calcium addition shown in fig 4 suggest that tga technique is not sensitive enough to detect the structural and energy difference between alginate gels with different calcium addition and help of other techniques like thz tds and dft analyses should be sought 3 2 4 thz tds analyses fig 5 shows the terahertz time domain spectra thz tds of alginate gels with different calcium addition the green solid curve reference represents the thz pulse passing through nitrogen directly as shown in fig 5 the amplitude intensity of alginate gels is much weaker than that of nitrogen suggesting the absorption of thz wave by alginate samples in addition the signal of alginate gels has an obvious time delay as compared with the reference signal this indicates that the larger refractive index of alginate samples for thz wave than that of nitrogen for thz wave from the comparison of alginate samples with different calcium addition partial enlarged drawing in fig 5 it can be seen that the samples have similar amplitude while different time delay it would indicate that different amount of calcium addition changes the refractive index of alginate gels but not the absorbility for thz wave fig 6 shows the absorption coefficient and refraction index of alginate gels with different calcium addition in frequency range of 0 4 2 8 thz the data below 0 4 thz are not considered because of the multiple thz reflections inside the detection crystal and the sample pellets it can be seen from fig 6a that the absorption coefficient of the alginate samples increases with the increase of frequency which is caused by the scattering of thz wave moreover there is no obvious difference between the alginate samples in absorption coefficient in the frequency range of 0 4 2 8 thz further demonstrating the similar absorption capacity of the alginate samples for thz wave fig 6b shows the variation of refractive index of alginate gels with frequency of thz wave it is clear that the refractive index is changed with frequency approximately constant and the value is in the range of 1 5 2 5 the largest refractive index of alginate sample with 0 mm calcium concentration may result from its better homogeneity it can be seen that thz technology is more sensitive than ftir technique in characterization of photoelectrical properties of polymer and organic liquid these results suggests that the physical properties of alginate gels with different calcium additions are significantly different which may be the cause of the fouling phenomenon shown in fig 1b changes of physical properties should stem from physical configuration changes since calcium addition does not change the chemical composition and functional groups of alginate therefore dft simulation was then used to identify the possible physical configuration changes of alginate gels 3 3 dft simulation fig 7 shows the two optimized geometric states for a single alginate chain that includes 20 uronic units energetically curved structure is 532 9 kcal mol 1 higher than the nearly flat linear state suggesting that the curved conformation is extremely unstable in solution on one hand there are the intramolecular hydrogen bonds and steric hindrance between each two uronic rings which will decrease partly the degrees of freedom of molecular movement on the other hand the polar carboxylic groups in alginate chain must stay away from each other to retain a low energy conformation leading to an almost linear molecular structure clearly the results suggest that a single short alginate chain should be exist via a linear arrangement in other words the intramolecular coordination interactions between the alginate chain and calcium ions may be impossible to elucidate the intermolecular coordination interactions another computational model composed of two alginate chains and a calcium ion was constructed fig 8 shows the optimized geometries for two binding states if the existing solvent is ignored the calcium ion is capable of forming six coordination bonds with the oxygen containing groups of alginates including carboxyl hydroxyl and oxygen atoms of sugar ring and glycosidic bond generally the negatively charged carboxyl groups can induce the stronger coordination binding with calcium ion than the other groups dft calculations suggest that two alginate chains can be almost parallel or cross to each other in the parallel state ps1 except for the coordination bonds and intramolecular hydrogen bonds there two additional intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of terminal uronic rings of two alginate chains with the distances of 1 72 and 1 91 å respectively these two hydrogen bonds make sure that the terminal uronic rings are connected tightly which thereby induces these two chains to parallel to each other nevertheless the calculated relative energy of ps1 is 82 3 kcal mol 1 higher than the perpendicular state ps2 indicating that the ps2 is more energetically stable in ps2 two alginate chains are coordinated tightly to one calcium ion but show a remarkable cross with an angle of almost 90 stereochemically this geometry is more favorable than ps1 because it effectively disperses the negatively charged groups thereby decreasing the van der waals repulsion interactions among the alginate chains taking together in the alginate solution with low calcium concentration it is proposed that the alginate chains prefer to show a cross linking process rather than show a parallel process induced by a small amount of calcium ions owing to the high energetical and stereochemical stability actually dft simulations were performed with two different calcium concentration ranges relatively low concentration and relatively high concentration range figs 7 and 8 provided the alginate structure information at low calcium concentration range it can be expected that when calcium concentration continuously increases all the intermolecular binding sites will be associated by calcium ions and then intramolecular binding will occur such a transition could cause tremendous changes in the configurations of alginate chains characterized by the formation of hard granular gel reducing the sfr of gel solution instead this effect is obviously beyond the scope of current research and need further dft simulations 3 4 mechanistic insights into fouling behaviors of alginate gel based on above characterizations the following results can be confirmed as shown in fig 7 without calcium addition alginate chains tend to distribute in form of flat linear structure in the solution because it is more stable than the curved structure the calculated energy of curved structure is 532 9 kcal mol 1 higher than that of linear state observation by microscope shows no obvious formation of gel colloid in the solution for alginate chains without calcium addition this should be attributed to the repulsion among the negatively function groups in alginate chains after calcium addition calcium ions will complex ionisable groups mainly coo in alginate there are two possible complexing way intermolecular or intramolecular dft calculation showed that intermolecular other than intramolecular binding bridging was preferential when calcium ions were limited moreover for the intermolecular binding the two alginate chains bridged by a calcium atom tend to stretch in a tetrahedron structure cross to each other fig 8 rather than parallel to each other dft calculation showed that the energy of parallel state ps1 was 82 3 kcal mol 1 higher than that of crossed state ps2 continuous addition of calcium will give rise to polymer bundle formation and eventually transforms to the so called egg box structure fig 9 this structure highly stretches and simultaneously homogenizes the gel braccini and pérez 2001 meanwhile thz time domain spectrum of alginate gels with different calcium addition show different time delay suggesting that calcium addition in alginate solution will cause structural transition of alginate polymer above two advanced techniques provided detailed and important gel structure information to support the conceptual diagram of fig 9 according to dft simulation and thz tds analyses it is suggested that the chemical potential gap depicted by flory huggins theory is responsible for the fouling behaviors of alginate solution with calcium addition fig 9 as displayed in fig 9 for a virgin membrane immerged in water the chemical potential of water is identical across the membrane however this situation will change when a gel layer sticks to membrane surface actually a gel is much homogenous that there is no apparent large connected pore across it due to rich of bound water the bound water in gel layer possesses much lower chemical potential than free water in solution therefore the chemical potential of water would suffer a significant change when the water is subjected to filtration through the gel layer on membrane surface in other words dragging water from the gel layer side with low chemical potential to permeate side with high chemical potential requires an extra force to balance such a chemical potential gap on the other hand filtration through a relatively homogeneous gel layer can be regarded as the inverse process of gel layer formation from mixing pure dry polymers and water gel layer formation is actually a thermodynamic process which can be well described by flory huggins theory mönch et al 2006 therefore as an inverse process filtration through gel layer can be also described by flory huggins theory according to the thermodynamic principles the relationship between the chemical potential gap and extra pressure force δ p can be described by chen et al 2016 7 δ μ m v b δ p where v b signifies the molar volume of solvent which approximates to molar volume of the solution v for dilute solution resistance of gel layer is generally considered as the main contributor to membrane fouling which can be determined according to darcy s law as follows 8 r g r t o l δ p σ j combination of eqs 6 8 yields eq 9 9 r g δ μ m i x v b j σ r t ln 1 ϕ 2 1 n 1 ϕ 2 χ ϕ 2 2 v b j σ then the sfr of gel layer can be obtained by 10 s f r r g m g r t ln 1 ϕ 2 1 n 1 ϕ 2 χ ϕ 2 2 m g v b j σ where m g represents the accumulated mass on membrane surface simulation of eq 10 for an agar gel showed that sfr of agar gel leveled at 5 31 1018 m kg 1 lei et al 2016 indicating that gel sfr caused by chemical potential gap can be extremely high therefore eq 10 not only provided a mathematic description of mechanism of chemical potential gap but also satisfactorily explained the fouling behaviors of alginate solution with calcium addition since the cross linking of alginate in the solution is induced by calcium ions the degree of polymerization of alginate polymer should be greatly different in presence and absence of calcium therefore the dependence of sfr caused by flory huggins mechanism on the degree of polymerization was further analyzed according to eq 10 due to the χ value of alginate has not been reported and is difficult to be estimated it is hard to conduct quantitative simulation of variation of the flory huggins induced sfr with the degree of polymerization nevertheless the general profile of relations between flory huggins induced sfr and polymerization degree could be depicted fig 10 it can be seen that sfr monotonically increases with the degree of polymerization as degree of polymerization is in proportion to calcium addition for alginate solution the monotonical increase trend in fig 10 is consistent with the experimental results in fig 1b providing the direct evidence to support the feasibility of flory huggins mechanism in this study in summary the advanced technique of thz tds analyses indicated that calcium concentration changed the structure of alginate gel dft simulations suggested that initial binding of alginate chains induced by calcium ions preferentially occurred in intermolecular other than intramolecular and moreover the two alginate chains bridged by a calcium atom tended to stretch in a tetrahedron structure cross to each other other than parallel to each other these two advanced techniques provided detailed and important gel structure information which is the basis of the flory huggins mechanism underlying the alginate ca gel as all this study brings new insights into membrane fouling mechanisms and provides important implications for membrane fouling control 4 conclusions specific filtration resistance sfr of alginate solution 0 75 g l 1 monotonously increased with calcium addition at a relatively low range of calcium concentration 0 1 0 mm and sfr 2 61 1015 m kg 1 of alginate solution with 1 0 mm calcium addition was extremely high as compared with sludge suspension calcium addition didn t change the composition of functional groups elements and thermal stability of alginate but indeed caused the structural variation of alginate polymer as shown by thz tds spectra dtf calculation results showed that intermolecular binding of two alginate chains by a calcium ion preferentially occurred to form a tetrahedron structure accordingly chemical potential gap depicted by flory huggins theory was suggested to be responsible for the filtration behaviors of alginate solution caused by calcium addition at relatively low calcium concentration acknowledgements financial support of national

19848,fouling mechanisms underlying the filtration behaviors of alginate solution caused by calcium addition were investigated by terahertz time domain spectroscopy thz tds and density functional theory dft techniques filtration tests showed that specific filtration resistance sfr of alginate solution 0 75 g l 1 monotonously increased with calcium addition at a relatively low range of calcium concentration 0 1 0 mm and sfr 2 61 1015 m kg 1 of alginate solution with 1 0 mm calcium addition was extremely high as compared with sludge suspension characterizations by x ray photoelectric spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and thermogravimetric analysis tga showed that the composition of functional groups elements and thermal stability of alginate was not apparently affected by calcium concentration howbeit thz tds spectra showed that calcium addition caused structural variation of alginate polymer in solution dtf calculation results showed that initial binding of alginate chains induced by calcium ions preferentially occurred in intermolecular other than intramolecular and moreover the two alginate chains bridged by a calcium atom tend to stretch in a tetrahedron structure cross to each other other than parallel to each other according to these results chemical potential gap depicted by flory huggins theory was suggested to be responsible for the filtration behaviors of alginate solution caused by calcium addition this study provided the mechanistic insights into membrane fouling graphical abstract image keywords membrane fouling wastewater treatment calcium ion dft calculation membrane bioreactor 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology has been popularly used for treatment and reclamation of wastewater mainly owning to its outstanding performances and distinct advantages over conventional activated sludge process cas lin et al 2012 wang et al 2014 2016 shen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 however membrane fouling remains the primary limitation for the broader application of this technology yuan et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 cai et al 2017 undoubtedly membrane fouling in mbrs are caused by various foulants which can be generally classified into biofoulants and inorganic foulants liao et al 2004 lin et al 2013 chen et al 2017 tan et al 2017 it has been reported that soluble microbial products smp extracellular polymeric substances eps biopolymer clusters bpc and transparent exopolymeric particles tep were of kind of critical biofoulants affecting membrane fouling liao et al 2004 wang et al 2013 lin et al 2014 guo and chang 2017 zhao et al 2017 among various inorganic foulants divalent cations have drawn significant attention abrahamse et al 2008 in particular calcium ions appear important all the more for membrane fouling due to their universal existence in real wastewater and their complicated interactions with biofoulants van den brink et al 2009 mo et al 2011 meng et al 2015 xin et al 2016 for example it was reported that municipal wastewater subjected to treatment by mbrs had calcium concentrations within 0 5 3 mm arabi and nakhla 2008 despite the low concentration in natural water bodies associated with biofoulants calcium ions were reported to involve into several processes including gel layer formation sludge bioflocculation and biological precipitation directly related with membrane fouling wang et al 2008 van den brink et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 it is difficult to study these processes individually due to the interrelationship among these processes van den brink et al 2009 rendering effect of calcium ions on membrane fouling and its mechanisms very complicated so far extensive efforts have been devoted into investigating effect of calcium ions on membrane fouling ang and elimelech 2007 de kerchove and elimelech 2007 katsoufidou et al 2007 listiarini et al 2009 chen et al 2011 mo et al 2011 kim and dempsey 2013 wu et al 2014 mahlangu et al 2015 however most of them focused on effect of calcium ions at relatively high concentrations of calcium ion which were obviously higher than the concentrations in natural water bodies moreover the observation results regarding the effect seemed controversial some reported a decline in the filtration performance with increase in calcium ion concentration de kerchove and elimelech 2007 katsoufidou et al 2007 van den brink et al 2009 meng et al 2015 while some others found the adverse result listiarini et al 2009 chen et al 2011 kim and dempsey 2013 wu et al 2014 in addition by broadening the testing range of calcium ion concentration several studies mo et al 2011 mahlangu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 observed a unimodal pattern of filtration resistance with increase in calcium ion concentration the underlying causes of these controversial results are unclear and have not been investigated previously this research status on effect of calcium ion on membrane fouling may be attributed to three indisputable facts variety and complexity of biofoulants in mbrs different calcium ion concentration studied and lack of effective tools to explore the underlying mechanisms although biofoulants in mbrs are complex and various it is generally accepted that polysaccharides and proteins are the most abundant components in these biofoulants and this is especially for polysaccharides in most cases gao et al 2013 meng and liu 2013 hong et al 2014 however polysaccharides in mbrs are actually a group of various organic matters with different sources which brings difficulty to explore the exact fouling mechanisms due to its similar behaviors to polysaccharides during filtration alginate has been most frequently used as a model compound for polysaccharides in membrane fouling studies kim and dempsey 2013 meng et al 2015 xin et al 2016 moreover alginate is prone to form a gel through ionotropic gelation ig when associated with calcium ions excluding effects of other less important fouling processes therefore exploring the effects of calcium ions on fouling behaviors of alginate should be very conductive to reveal exact causes of above inconsistent results or puzzlements meanwhile the rapid developments in experimental technique and computational chemistry provides new approaches for membrane fouling study terahertz time domain spectroscopy thz tds is a developed technique extensively applied in detecting photoelectrical properties of crystal polymer and organic liquid lien nguyen et al 2007 due to its high sensibility to structures interactions and dynamic of molecules and molecules complexes zeitler et al 2007 hoshina et al 2014 thz spectral could provide more information than fourier transform infrared ftir spectral such as adsorption coefficients vibration rotation and refractive indices the density functional theory dft is a computational quantum mechanical modelling method used to investigate the electronic structure of many body systems yu 2014 shkir et al 2015 yu et al 2015 according to the computational results about molecular structures and binding energies dft can provide accurate prediction for the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions however to our knowledge none study has investigated membrane fouling by using these approaches this study focuses on investigating the underlying reaction mechanism of alginate and calcium ions at relatively low calcium concentration by the combinational usage of thz tds and dft tools the experimental situation was set to be that biofoulant alginate amount is abundant while calcium ions are limited much similar to the real wastewater in this situation it is possible to investigate the initial process of binding of alginate chains induced by a calcium ion which is the key of gel formation and membrane fouling the specific filtration resistances of alginate solutions with different calcium addition were firstly determined experimental characterizations including art ftir x ray photoelectric spectroscopy xps thermogravimetric analysis tga and thz tds were carried out to determine the physiochemical properties of alginate calcium complexes finally detailed dft calculations were performed and the binding energies were calculated the underlying mechanism of the filtration behavior were analyzed and discussed this hand in hand approach of both experimental determinations and theoretical calculations would provide a comprehensive insight into the effect of calcium ions on fouling properties of alginate 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation both sodium alginate sa and cacl2 used for the preparation of alginate samples were provided by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china molecular weight of sa is in range of 32000 250000 da deionized di water obtained by an eped ultrapure water system shanghai pigeon electronic technology co ltd china was applied for sample preparation in this study a series of 0 75 g l 1 alginate working solutions with ca2 concentrations of 0 without calcium addition 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 mm were prepared with the following steps 0 75 g sa powder and series amount of cacl2 were firstly added in 900 ml and 100 ml di water respectively and then magnetically stirred for 2 h until completely dissolved sa can be easily dissolved in the water when calcium ions are added an alginate gel can be obviously formed within 2 h indicating that 2 h is enough to form a gel thereafter 100 ml of the cacl2 solutions were gradually added to 900 ml of the sa solutions under continuous stirring for 2 h all the working solutions were prepared at room temperature 20 c and used within one day to prevent microgram growth it should be noted that sa was used to model smp rather than sludge mass in aerobic mbrs this study focused on gel formation process for this consideration a relatively higher sa concentration 0 75 g l was set in this study to highlight gel formation process literature studies also reported comparable sa concentrations used for membrane fouling research derradji et al 2000 van de ven et al 2008 motsa et al 2014 in this study the experimental sfr measurements and dft calculations were conducted by analyzing alginate samples in bulk solution composition and structure analysis including ftir spectra xps tga and thz tds were performed by analyzing the gel layer samples formed on membrane surface the sample type is required by these analytical techniques 2 2 evaluation of specific filtration resistance specific filtration resistance r c of alginate solution and sludge suspension samples was determined through batch filtration tests with a dead end mode all the filtration tests were carried out in a stirred cell msc300 purchased from shanghai sinap co ltd china with 300 ml effective filtration volume effective filtration area is 0 00332 m2 the stirred cell was filled with 250 ml of alginate working solution and driven by pressurized nitrogen from a gas cylinder the pressure was maintained to be 40 kpa during the filtration and the permeate weight was recorded by a digital balance polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf provided by shanghai sinap co ltd china flat sheet membrane with 0 1 μm pore size and 140 kda molecular weight cut off mwco was used in this study prior to the tests fresh membranes were pretreated using ultrasonic for 30 min and then placed in di water for 24 h to remove impurities all membranes were pre compacted with 40 kpa pressure for 20 min in order to stabilize the membrane flux measurements of sa concentration in filtrate indicated that almost all the alginate molecules can be rejected by the pvdf membrane during filtration process possibly due to the large mw and gelation of alginate molecules in a dead end batch filtration tests the relationship between total permeate volume and time can be described as 1 t v μ c s a r c 2 a m 2 δ p v μ r m δ p a m where t and v represent the time and total permeate volume at time t respectively μ is the dynamic viscosity of permeate c sa is the concentration of sa solution a m is the effective membrane area δp is the trans membrane pressure r m is the membrane resistance plotting t v versus v yields a straight line setting that k is the time to filtration ratio r c can be calculated by 2 r c 2 a m 2 δ p k μ c s a these two equations represent the standard process to experimentally obtain sfr of foulant suspensions solutions kim and dempsey 2013 zhang et al 2013 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 atr ftir analysis functional groups of alginate samples were determined by a nicolet 670 ftir spectrometer the samples were prepared by dehydrating series of alginate solutions with ca2 concentrations of 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 mm respectively with a stirred cell to form a thin layer then the prepared gel layers were dried by a vacuum freeze dryer freezone 2 5 labconco usa for 12 h and stored in a dryer before atr ftir analysis the spectral data of each sample were collected by an overhead and detachable multi reflection attenuated total reflectance accessory atr in the range of 4000 500 cm 1 in order to eliminate background interference a background spectrum was taken by the empty atr crystal and recorded in computer before scanning each sample omnic software was utilized to analyze the obtained spectrum data 2 3 2 x ray photoelectric spectroscopy xps analysis surface chemical composition of alginate samples was characterized in an escalab 250xi xps spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa by using al k x rays 1486 6 ev as the excitation source the pressure in the sample chamber was 1 10 9 mbar and the pass energy constant was 20 ev for high resolution scans for each sample a survey scan encompassing the binding energy region of 0 1200 ev was firstly obtained and the spectra of ca2p were further recorded to get accurate information about the oxidation state of the calcium 2 3 3 thermogravimetric analysis tga thermal stabilities of alginate gels were examined using a sta449 f5 thermogravimetric analyzer ta instruments netasch germany under a nitrogen atmosphere the condensed samples were placed in oxide aluminium pans and heated from room temperature to 600 c at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the residual weights of the alginate gels were recorded 2 3 4 terahertz time domain spectroscopy thz tds analysis thz spectra of alginate samples were measured using a standard thz tds apparatus with the transmission measurement mode femtosecond laser mai tai spectra physics was used to generate 100 fs pulses at a wavelength of 800 nm with average power of 700 mw and a repetition rate of 80 mhz the output was separated by a beam splitter into two parts a pump beam illuminated the thz emitter gaas crystal to produce thz pulses and a probe beam detected the pulsed thz radiation in a znte crystal via electro optical sampling signal noise ratio snr was higher than 1000 1 the used bandwidth of the spectrometer is 0 4 2 8 thz and the frequency resolution is 1 9 ghz sample thickness was approximately 0 1 mm all the measurements were conducted at room temperature and the entire thz beam pathway was purged with dry nitrogen in order to minimize the interference of water vapor 2 4 dft calculations all the quantum chemical calculations were performed using density functional theory dft method with b3lyp hybrid functional implemented in gaussian 09 program an alginate model containing 20 uronic units was firstly constructed to uncover the favorable configuration of single alginate chain a cluster model including a ca2 and two alginate chains was then constructed to explore the interactions between the alginate and calcium ion at the molecular level each alginate chain contains six uronic rings molecular geometries were optimized with the 6 31g basis set to obtain more accurate energies single point calculations on the optimized structures were performed with the larger basis set 6 31 g d p frequency calculations were performed with the 6 31g basis set to obtain zero point energies zpe and to confirm the nature of all the stationary points that have no imaginary frequency for the local minima note that the energies reported in this paper are thus the single point energies corrected for zpes 2 5 flory huggins theory flory huggins theory a mathematical theory was proposed to describe the chemical potential change in mixing process of a polymer solution or gel lay formation flory 1941 according to this theory the polymer molecules in the solution are regarded as chains of segments and each segment equals in size to a solvent molecule flory 1941 under constant temperature t and pressure δ p gibbs free energy change δ g m during the mixing process can be expressed by 3 δ g m δ h m t δ s m where δ s m signifies the combinatorial entropy of mixing and δ h m is the enthalpy change which can be given by eqs 4 and 5 respectively for the random and ideal mixing process 4 δ h m r t χ n 1 ϕ 2 5 δ s m r n 1 ln ϕ 1 n 2 ln ϕ 2 where r and χ represent the universal gas constant and the flory huggins interaction parameter respectively n 1 and n 2 are the molar number of water and polymer respectively ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the volume fraction of water and polymer respectively as ϕ 1 ϕ 2 1 the chemical potential change δ μ m of mixing can be further deduced by 6 δ μ m δ g m n 1 t p n 2 r t ln 1 ϕ 2 1 n 1 ϕ 2 χ ϕ 2 2 where n is the degree of polymerization 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of calcium ions on the filtration resistance of alginate solution fig 1 a shows the original data with t v versus v for calculating specific filtration resistance sfr of a gel solution it is clear that sfr of a gel solution can be easily obtained by batch filtration tests fig 1b illustrates the effect of calcium ions on the sfr of alginate solution it can be seen that sfr of alginate solution is remarkably affected by calcium concentration the alginate sfr continuously increases with calcium concentration increases in the range of 0 1 0 mm the tested calcium concentration range was quite low as compared with alginate concentration in this study suggesting that calcium ions are limited when they complex ionisable groups in alginate in such a relatively low calcium concentration range alginate sfr change trend with calcium concentration in this study is agreeable with literature studies de kerchove and elimelech 2007 katsoufidou et al 2007 van den brink et al 2009 meng et al 2015 moreover the alginate solution with 1 0 mm calcium ions possesses a sfr of 2 61 1015 m kg 1 which is about 13 times higher than that of pure sa solution 2 01 1014 m kg 1 meanwhile the sfr of the sludge suspension in the mbr with 10 64 g l 1 and 0 75 g l 1 mlss possess sfr of 2 11 1012 and 1 91 1012 m kg 1 respectively comparable sfr values of sludge suspension with similar mlss concentration have been reported in the literature pollice et al 2007 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 the sfr of alginate solution with 1 0 mm calcium ions was more than 1000 times higher than that of sludge suspension with the same solid concentration fig 1b and the comparison to sludge suspension presented two interesting results the monotonical increase trend of sfr of alginate solution with calcium addition and the extremely high sfr of alginate solution with calcium addition to our knowledge the underlying causes for these results have not been well investigated to date since calcium ion addition could not change the chemical element composition these interesting results should stem from the changes of chemical and physical geometrical configuration of alginate caused by calcium ion addition therefore in this study detailed characterizations of alginate solution hydrogel including art ftir xps tga and thz tds were conducted to explore the exact cause of the alginate filtration behaviors at low range of calcium concentration meanwhile detailed dft calculations were performed and the corresponding binding energies were calculated 3 2 characterization of alginate gels with different calcium addition 3 2 1 ftir spectra continuous addition of calcium ions to alginate solution could cause formation of an apparent alginate gel fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of alginate gels with different calcium additions a broad region of absorption between 3600 and 3000 cm 1 is due to the stretching of o h bond in hydroxyl functional groups treenate and monvisade 2017 the characteristic peaks at near 1593 and 1409 cm 1 are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretch vibration of coo associated with carboxylic acid salts simpson et al 2004 an absorption peak at near 1023 cm 1 is assigned to the ionic binding wong et al 2002 moreover the addition of calcium leads to a slight shift of the characteristic peaks for coo symmetric stretching of sa from 1405 cm 1 to higher wavenumbers 1408 1409 and 1411 cm 1 apparently the functional groups of the alginate gels are similar regardless of the calcium concentration this means that the functional groups of alginate are not apparently changed by the addition of calcium ions therefore above mentioned interesting results should reside in other changes 3 2 2 xps analyses fig 3 shows the xps spectra of ca 2p for alginate gels with different calcium addition as shown in fig 3 the typical ca 2p core level spectra of alginate gels can be fitted by two peaks at binding energies of around 350 6 and 347 0 ev jiao et al 2016 which are ascribed to the coexistence of two different modifications of calcium in alginate gels in addition the intensity of the ca 2p signals in fig 3c f is higher than that in fig 3a and b indicating that the amount of calcium in the alginate gels as well as the cross linking of calcium ions with coo is increased with the increase of calcium concentration it should be noted that two decomposed peaks at binding energies of around 350 6 and 347 0 ev are also observed for the alginate gel without calcium addition showing the existence of calcium in the pure sa sample however the measured intensity is weak indicating that the amount of calcium in the solution is low as sa is a linear copolymer composed of varied combinations and sequences of homopolymeric blocks and heteropolymeric block refined from brown algae or seaweeds the weak signal in fig 3a should originate essentially from the calcium residual during the extraction process nevertheless elemental composition difference is not the underlying cause for the phenomenon observed in fig 1 3 2 3 tga analyses fig 4 shows the thermogravimetric analysis tga results of the alginate gels with different calcium addition it can be seen from fig 4 that the tga curve of the samples can be divided into two phases the first phase is a low temperature region where a sharp decrease occurred at temperatures 100 c under nitrogen gas corresponding to the evaporation of water these results indicate that the water in the alginate gels mainly exists in the form of free water regardless of calcium content the second region in the range of 100 c 600 c shows an approximately constant weight residual fig 4 clearly shows that there is no significant difference in thermal stability of alginate gels with different calcium addition it was reported that the thermal stability of alginate will be changed by the addition of metal ions liu et al 2016 pan et al 2017 which may be caused by the proportion variation of free water and bound water resulted from the cross linking effect lei et al 2016 accordingly the similar profiles and variation trends of the alginate with different calcium addition shown in fig 4 suggest that tga technique is not sensitive enough to detect the structural and energy difference between alginate gels with different calcium addition and help of other techniques like thz tds and dft analyses should be sought 3 2 4 thz tds analyses fig 5 shows the terahertz time domain spectra thz tds of alginate gels with different calcium addition the green solid curve reference represents the thz pulse passing through nitrogen directly as shown in fig 5 the amplitude intensity of alginate gels is much weaker than that of nitrogen suggesting the absorption of thz wave by alginate samples in addition the signal of alginate gels has an obvious time delay as compared with the reference signal this indicates that the larger refractive index of alginate samples for thz wave than that of nitrogen for thz wave from the comparison of alginate samples with different calcium addition partial enlarged drawing in fig 5 it can be seen that the samples have similar amplitude while different time delay it would indicate that different amount of calcium addition changes the refractive index of alginate gels but not the absorbility for thz wave fig 6 shows the absorption coefficient and refraction index of alginate gels with different calcium addition in frequency range of 0 4 2 8 thz the data below 0 4 thz are not considered because of the multiple thz reflections inside the detection crystal and the sample pellets it can be seen from fig 6a that the absorption coefficient of the alginate samples increases with the increase of frequency which is caused by the scattering of thz wave moreover there is no obvious difference between the alginate samples in absorption coefficient in the frequency range of 0 4 2 8 thz further demonstrating the similar absorption capacity of the alginate samples for thz wave fig 6b shows the variation of refractive index of alginate gels with frequency of thz wave it is clear that the refractive index is changed with frequency approximately constant and the value is in the range of 1 5 2 5 the largest refractive index of alginate sample with 0 mm calcium concentration may result from its better homogeneity it can be seen that thz technology is more sensitive than ftir technique in characterization of photoelectrical properties of polymer and organic liquid these results suggests that the physical properties of alginate gels with different calcium additions are significantly different which may be the cause of the fouling phenomenon shown in fig 1b changes of physical properties should stem from physical configuration changes since calcium addition does not change the chemical composition and functional groups of alginate therefore dft simulation was then used to identify the possible physical configuration changes of alginate gels 3 3 dft simulation fig 7 shows the two optimized geometric states for a single alginate chain that includes 20 uronic units energetically curved structure is 532 9 kcal mol 1 higher than the nearly flat linear state suggesting that the curved conformation is extremely unstable in solution on one hand there are the intramolecular hydrogen bonds and steric hindrance between each two uronic rings which will decrease partly the degrees of freedom of molecular movement on the other hand the polar carboxylic groups in alginate chain must stay away from each other to retain a low energy conformation leading to an almost linear molecular structure clearly the results suggest that a single short alginate chain should be exist via a linear arrangement in other words the intramolecular coordination interactions between the alginate chain and calcium ions may be impossible to elucidate the intermolecular coordination interactions another computational model composed of two alginate chains and a calcium ion was constructed fig 8 shows the optimized geometries for two binding states if the existing solvent is ignored the calcium ion is capable of forming six coordination bonds with the oxygen containing groups of alginates including carboxyl hydroxyl and oxygen atoms of sugar ring and glycosidic bond generally the negatively charged carboxyl groups can induce the stronger coordination binding with calcium ion than the other groups dft calculations suggest that two alginate chains can be almost parallel or cross to each other in the parallel state ps1 except for the coordination bonds and intramolecular hydrogen bonds there two additional intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of terminal uronic rings of two alginate chains with the distances of 1 72 and 1 91 å respectively these two hydrogen bonds make sure that the terminal uronic rings are connected tightly which thereby induces these two chains to parallel to each other nevertheless the calculated relative energy of ps1 is 82 3 kcal mol 1 higher than the perpendicular state ps2 indicating that the ps2 is more energetically stable in ps2 two alginate chains are coordinated tightly to one calcium ion but show a remarkable cross with an angle of almost 90 stereochemically this geometry is more favorable than ps1 because it effectively disperses the negatively charged groups thereby decreasing the van der waals repulsion interactions among the alginate chains taking together in the alginate solution with low calcium concentration it is proposed that the alginate chains prefer to show a cross linking process rather than show a parallel process induced by a small amount of calcium ions owing to the high energetical and stereochemical stability actually dft simulations were performed with two different calcium concentration ranges relatively low concentration and relatively high concentration range figs 7 and 8 provided the alginate structure information at low calcium concentration range it can be expected that when calcium concentration continuously increases all the intermolecular binding sites will be associated by calcium ions and then intramolecular binding will occur such a transition could cause tremendous changes in the configurations of alginate chains characterized by the formation of hard granular gel reducing the sfr of gel solution instead this effect is obviously beyond the scope of current research and need further dft simulations 3 4 mechanistic insights into fouling behaviors of alginate gel based on above characterizations the following results can be confirmed as shown in fig 7 without calcium addition alginate chains tend to distribute in form of flat linear structure in the solution because it is more stable than the curved structure the calculated energy of curved structure is 532 9 kcal mol 1 higher than that of linear state observation by microscope shows no obvious formation of gel colloid in the solution for alginate chains without calcium addition this should be attributed to the repulsion among the negatively function groups in alginate chains after calcium addition calcium ions will complex ionisable groups mainly coo in alginate there are two possible complexing way intermolecular or intramolecular dft calculation showed that intermolecular other than intramolecular binding bridging was preferential when calcium ions were limited moreover for the intermolecular binding the two alginate chains bridged by a calcium atom tend to stretch in a tetrahedron structure cross to each other fig 8 rather than parallel to each other dft calculation showed that the energy of parallel state ps1 was 82 3 kcal mol 1 higher than that of crossed state ps2 continuous addition of calcium will give rise to polymer bundle formation and eventually transforms to the so called egg box structure fig 9 this structure highly stretches and simultaneously homogenizes the gel braccini and pérez 2001 meanwhile thz time domain spectrum of alginate gels with different calcium addition show different time delay suggesting that calcium addition in alginate solution will cause structural transition of alginate polymer above two advanced techniques provided detailed and important gel structure information to support the conceptual diagram of fig 9 according to dft simulation and thz tds analyses it is suggested that the chemical potential gap depicted by flory huggins theory is responsible for the fouling behaviors of alginate solution with calcium addition fig 9 as displayed in fig 9 for a virgin membrane immerged in water the chemical potential of water is identical across the membrane however this situation will change when a gel layer sticks to membrane surface actually a gel is much homogenous that there is no apparent large connected pore across it due to rich of bound water the bound water in gel layer possesses much lower chemical potential than free water in solution therefore the chemical potential of water would suffer a significant change when the water is subjected to filtration through the gel layer on membrane surface in other words dragging water from the gel layer side with low chemical potential to permeate side with high chemical potential requires an extra force to balance such a chemical potential gap on the other hand filtration through a relatively homogeneous gel layer can be regarded as the inverse process of gel layer formation from mixing pure dry polymers and water gel layer formation is actually a thermodynamic process which can be well described by flory huggins theory mönch et al 2006 therefore as an inverse process filtration through gel layer can be also described by flory huggins theory according to the thermodynamic principles the relationship between the chemical potential gap and extra pressure force δ p can be described by chen et al 2016 7 δ μ m v b δ p where v b signifies the molar volume of solvent which approximates to molar volume of the solution v for dilute solution resistance of gel layer is generally considered as the main contributor to membrane fouling which can be determined according to darcy s law as follows 8 r g r t o l δ p σ j combination of eqs 6 8 yields eq 9 9 r g δ μ m i x v b j σ r t ln 1 ϕ 2 1 n 1 ϕ 2 χ ϕ 2 2 v b j σ then the sfr of gel layer can be obtained by 10 s f r r g m g r t ln 1 ϕ 2 1 n 1 ϕ 2 χ ϕ 2 2 m g v b j σ where m g represents the accumulated mass on membrane surface simulation of eq 10 for an agar gel showed that sfr of agar gel leveled at 5 31 1018 m kg 1 lei et al 2016 indicating that gel sfr caused by chemical potential gap can be extremely high therefore eq 10 not only provided a mathematic description of mechanism of chemical potential gap but also satisfactorily explained the fouling behaviors of alginate solution with calcium addition since the cross linking of alginate in the solution is induced by calcium ions the degree of polymerization of alginate polymer should be greatly different in presence and absence of calcium therefore the dependence of sfr caused by flory huggins mechanism on the degree of polymerization was further analyzed according to eq 10 due to the χ value of alginate has not been reported and is difficult to be estimated it is hard to conduct quantitative simulation of variation of the flory huggins induced sfr with the degree of polymerization nevertheless the general profile of relations between flory huggins induced sfr and polymerization degree could be depicted fig 10 it can be seen that sfr monotonically increases with the degree of polymerization as degree of polymerization is in proportion to calcium addition for alginate solution the monotonical increase trend in fig 10 is consistent with the experimental results in fig 1b providing the direct evidence to support the feasibility of flory huggins mechanism in this study in summary the advanced technique of thz tds analyses indicated that calcium concentration changed the structure of alginate gel dft simulations suggested that initial binding of alginate chains induced by calcium ions preferentially occurred in intermolecular other than intramolecular and moreover the two alginate chains bridged by a calcium atom tended to stretch in a tetrahedron structure cross to each other other than parallel to each other these two advanced techniques provided detailed and important gel structure information which is the basis of the flory huggins mechanism underlying the alginate ca gel as all this study brings new insights into membrane fouling mechanisms and provides important implications for membrane fouling control 4 conclusions specific filtration resistance sfr of alginate solution 0 75 g l 1 monotonously increased with calcium addition at a relatively low range of calcium concentration 0 1 0 mm and sfr 2 61 1015 m kg 1 of alginate solution with 1 0 mm calcium addition was extremely high as compared with sludge suspension calcium addition didn t change the composition of functional groups elements and thermal stability of alginate but indeed caused the structural variation of alginate polymer as shown by thz tds spectra dtf calculation results showed that intermolecular binding of two alginate chains by a calcium ion preferentially occurred to form a tetrahedron structure accordingly chemical potential gap depicted by flory huggins theory was suggested to be responsible for the filtration behaviors of alginate solution caused by calcium addition at relatively low calcium concentration acknowledgements financial support of national

19849,advanced reduction by the extremely strong reducing species hydrated electron eaq is a promising and viable approach to eliminate a wide variety of persistent and toxic contaminants in this study we proposed a sulfite iodide uv process which offered efficient production of eaq for contaminant reduction using monochloroacetic acid mcaa as a simple eaq probe the availability of eaq was assessed and the mechanism involving the roles of s iv and iodide in the process was elucidated a pronounced synergistic effect of s iv and iodide was observed in mcaa reductive dechlorination the efficiency was much more dependent on the iodide concentration due to its higher absorptivity and quantum yield of eaq s iv played a dual role by producing eaq via photoionization of so3 2 and by reducing the reactive iodine species formed to avoid their scavenging of eaq when s iv was available cycling of iodide occurred favoring the constant eaq production the formation and transformation kinetics of sulfite radical were studied to verify the roles of s iv and iodide in the process a kinetic model of mcaa dechlorination was also developed to quantify the eaq initiated reduction efficiency highlighting the effects of s iv iodide and ph high ph favored the reduction and the process was still effective in field surface water this study underscores the importance of producing eaq efficiently and of minimizing the eaq scavenging of intermediates inherently formed and accumulated and highlights the potential of the sulfite iodide uv process to efficiently eliminate recalcitrant contaminants graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrated electron mechanism sulfite iodide uv process advanced reduction processes efficiency 1 introduction hydrated electron eaq a

application in water decontamination researchers have been in pursuit of the efficient and green generation methods for decades brautzsch et al 2016 goez et al 2014 and several eaq based processes have been developed such as pulse radiolysis ki uv photoredox catalysis photoexcitation of organic chromophores and sulfite uv arbon et al 1994 gu et al 2017 li et al 2012 park et al 2009 central to

rapidly park et al 2009 qu et al 2010 iodine chemistry has attracted much attention in contaminant removal because of the generation of many reactive species such as eaq io3 1o2 and i during activation of iodine e g i i2 and io4 saiz lopez et al 2012 iodide ion i absorbs uv light efficiently and is photolabile to release eaq via charge transfer to solvent ctts excitation of i eq 1 with

this environment friendly technology has been successfully used to eliminate various persistent pollutants e g perfluoroalkyl compounds from wastewater qu et al 2010 however the reduction efficiency is greatly inhibited by dissolved oxygen and also by the inherently accumulated reactive iodine species ris e g i3 due to their rapid scavenging of eaq park et al 2009 2011 qu et al 2010 1 recently a sulfite uv process for reductive dehalogenation has been developed based on the eaq production from photoionization of so3 2 eq 2 and efficient reductive degradation of some hocs and toxins was readily achieved li et al 2012 however the production efficiency of eaq is governed by the uv photons absorbed by so3 2 a high concentration of s iv and high ph are thus required due to the relatively low absorptivity and the protonation of so3 2 li et al 2014 2 in this study a new sulfite iodide uv process is firstly proposed to take advantage of the beneficial effects of s iv and iodide iodide absorbs uv light efficiently and has a high quantum yield of eaq sauer et al 2004 thus providing another stable and important source of eaq via eq 1 under mild conditions more importantly the electron photodetachment from the excited i via eq 1 is not influenced by ph sauer et al 2004 at the same time s iv can deplete dissolved oxygen rapidly via photoinitiated chain reactions to minimize its negative influence on reduction efficiency fischer and warneck 1996 and it may also inhibit the scavenging of eaq by ris by quickly reducing them back to iodide alfassi et al 1995 yiin and margerum 1990 hence the process promises to have efficient production and utilization of eaq and to achieve enhanced reduction efficiency at ambient conditions also the process does not require expensive metal catalysts and organic sacrificial electron donors e g phenol benzoquinone the aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism and to quantify the efficiency of the eaq initiated reduction in this sulfite iodide uv process roles of s iv and iodide were revealed and were further verified by the formation and transformation kinetics of sulfite radical so3 a simple model was constructed to quantify the reduction efficiency and effects of water quality ph and field surface water were also examined because of its relatively simple molecular structure and its versatile reactivity toward various radicals monochloroacetic acid mcaa was selected as the eaq probe compound in this study to gain insight into the availability of eaq or eaq exposure for reduction in the proposed process as described previously li et al 2012 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers shown in text s1 of the supporting information si and were used as received without further purification all solutions were prepared using 18 2 mω cm milli q water produced from a millipore system fresh stock solutions of na2so3 and ki were prepared with n2 saturated milli q water prior to each set of experiment field surface water was collected from the qiantang river hangzhou section china the samples were filtered through cellulose membrane 0 45 μm and stored at 4 c in dark the characteristics of the field surface water are summarized in table s1 2 2 experimental procedure a cylindrical photoreactor solution volume v 800 ml equipped with a low pressure mercury uv lamp 10 w ozone free gph212t5l heraeus noblelight emitting monochromatic light at λ 253 7 nm was used the photon flow i 0 amount basis 253 7 nm entering the solution was about 2 98 μe s 1 and the effective path length l was about 3 57 cm in all experiments a constant i 0 v was applied 3 73 μe l 1 s 1 unless otherwise noted the photoreactor was thermostated at 25 0 5 c throughout the solution ph 8 0 11 0 was buffered using 10 mm borate the solutions at ph 5 9 or 7 2 were adjusted with 1 0 m h2so4 but without any buffer and ph change was less than 0 1 units prior to each set of irradiation experiment the uv lamp was illuminated for at least 15 min and the solution was purged with n2 1 5 l min 1 for 20 min unless otherwise stated mcaa dechlorination in field surface water was conducted by spiking mcaa s iv and iodide into the solution which was not adjusted for ph all experiments were conducted at least in duplicate and average values sd are reported when not shown error bars are smaller than the symbols in figures details about the uv reactor and the methodology for irradiation experiments can be found elsewhere li et al 2012 2014 2 3 analytical methods a cary 300 uv

tic and total nitrogen tn were analyzed using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu the sealed samples were stored at 4 c in the dark prior to analysis within 24 h more details were provided in our previous study li et al 2012 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction efficiency in the sulfite iodide uv process monochloroacetic acid mcaa is a well established eaq probe releasing cl via eq 3 buxton et al 1988 and has been successfully used as the probe compound to investigate the reactive species and to assess the efficiency of eaq induced reduction in various systems brautzsch et al 2016 gu et al 2017 kerzig and goez 2016 li et al 2012 fig 1 shows the removal of mcaa in the sulfite iodide uv processes about 50 μm mcaa was almost completely degraded and almost complete dechlorination simultaneous release of cl was also readily achieved within 5 min in the sulfite iodide uv process under the given conditions suggesting the involvement of eaq in the process it should be noted that only less than 2 of the mcaa was degraded within 72 h by 1 0 mm s iv and 0 1 mm i at ph 9 2 and 25 c in the dark and that less than 1 underwent direct photolysis within 15 min li et al 2012 3 from fig 1 mcaa degradation follows pseudo zero order kinetics at ph 9 2 and the rate r 1 is about 12 86 μm min 1 in the sulfite iodide uv process compared with the efficiency of two typical arps i e iodide uv r 2 of 1 09 μm min 1 and sulfite uv r 3 of 3 36 μm min 1 processes about 3 fold higher efficiency was observed in the sulfite iodide uv process suggesting a significant synergistic effect of s iv and i one tailed student s t test p 0 05 3 2 effect of ph solution ph plays an important role in interconversion between h and eaq typically through eqs 4 7 buxton et al 1988 li et al 2014 fig 2 shows the effect of ph on the mcaa degradation in the sulfite iodide uv process increasing ph promoted mcaa degradation significantly but this influence became very slight when ph was higher than 9 2 as observed previously li et al 2012 because the electron photodetachment from i is not influenced by ph significantly sauer et al 2004 the such ph dependence of efficiency should be attributable to the protonation of sulfite and the resulting decrease in eaq production as well as the scavenging of eaq by the competing reactions li et al 2014 compared with the very low reduction efficiency 3 within 15 min 1 0 mm s iv in the sulfite uv process at ph around 6 li et al 2012 about 27 times higher efficiency was still obtained in the sulfite iodide uv process fig 2 also the reduction efficiency of the sulfite iodide uv process within the ph range studied was at least 2 8 times ph 5 9 fig 2 higher than that of the iodide uv process fig 1 4 5 6 7 3 3 the role of s iv fig 3 a shows that increasing the concentration of s iv enhanced mcaa degradation and fig 3b describes two distinct phases for the enhancement by s iv the degradation rate of mcaa was accelerated markedly from 1 09 μm min 1 to 9 90 μm min 1 by 0 01 mm s iv phase i and a further increase in s iv concentration caused a slower linear enhancement phase ii considering the attenuation of uv intensity in the sulfite iodide uv process from 9 to 21 text s2 the slope of about 2 40 10 3 min 1 for phase ii in fig 3b is consistent with that 3 05 10 3 min 1 reported in the sulfite uv process li et al 2012 thus s iv probably makes a direct contribution to eaq production via eq 2 in the phase ii as it does in the sulfite uv process meanwhile the depletion of s iv was about 61 within 60 min fig s1 which was much higher compared with the case in the absence of i 17 as reported previously li et al 2012 this implies a significant involvement of s iv in the process furthermore the marked enhancement of mcaa dechlorination efficiency in phase i strongly implies other roles for s iv in the process fig 4 shows simultaneous evolution of s iv and i during the degradation of mcaa rapid degradation of mcaa and a constant concentration of i were observed as long as s iv was available when s iv was exhausted degradation of mcaa was much retarded also observed in the cases with 0 01 mm and 0 03 mm s iv in fig 3a accompanied by the simultaneous depletion of i 19 within in 20 min considering the concurrent rapid consumption of s iv those results suggest that s iv probably plays a role in recycling i and in maintaining the fast degradation of mcaa 3 4 the role of iodide fig 5 a clearly shows that mcaa degradation was promoted by i and fig 5b depicts a linear dependence of the degradation rate on i concentration comparing the two linear relationships in fig 3b slope of 2 40 10 3 min 1 and fig 5b slope of 9 64 10 2 min 1 it suggests that the efficiency of the process is about 40 times normalized to molar concentration more dependent on i than on s iv so i may play a vital role in the process compared with so3 2 i absorbs uv light much more efficiently ε i 254 220 m 1 cm 1 fig s2 and has a higher quantum yield φi 254 0 29 mol e 1 at 253 7 nm sauer et al 2004 though the iodide uv process failed to show the correspondingly higher reduction efficiency fig 1 and fig s3 this may be interpreted by the rapid scavenging of eaq by ris e g eqs 8 10 which are inherently formed and accumulated park et al 2009 2011 qu et al 2010 as indicated in fig s4 for example the scavenging rate of eaq by 10 μm i3 is 3 5 105 s 1 eq 10 which is 7 times more rapid than that by 50 μm mcaa 5 104 s 1 in fact when s iv was exhausted about 19 μm i was depleted and might have been transformed into ris which competed for eaq at least an order of magnitude more strongly than mcaa fig 4 8 9 10 ris e g i i2 i2 and i3 can be reduced rapidly to i by s iv via eqs 11 19 alfassi et al 1995 kerezsi et al 2007 neta et al 1988 yiin and margerum 1990 the rapid decomposition of s iv supports its considerable involvement in the reduction of ris fig 4 and fig s1 the rapid reduction of ris by s iv would lead to very low steady state concentrations of ris fig s4 and thus the negligible scavenging of eaq text s3 this is also supported by the negligible depletion of i when s iv is available fig 4 for instance 10 μm s iv will reduce the steady state concentrations of i and i3 to less than 1 3 10 11 m and 7 4 10 16 m respectively thus it is probable that cycling of i occurs to maintain a constant concentration and i plays a role in the process by steadily producing eaq 11 12 13 14 15 i 3 so 3 2 2 i iso 3 k 15 2 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 16 i 3 hso 3 2 i h iso 3 k 16 1 5 10 7 m 1 s 1 17 i 2 so 3 2 iso 3 i

species in the process were investigated as described previously li et al 2012 fig 6 a shows the inhibitory effects of electron scavengers on the mcaa degradation in the process the complete inhibition of mcaa degradation by n2o strongly indicates the involvement of eaq and or h in the process nonetheless the facts that i the different inhibitory effects of no2 and no3 fig 6a ii the accumulation of no2 fig s5 and iii the competition kinetics between mcaa degradation and no2 depletion fig 6b well support that eaq plays a dominant role in the process actually h is formed in low yield at ph 9 2 3 in fig s6 the contributions from ris and sulfite radical so3 are also ruled out for more discussion please see text s4 fig 7 a shows that the major products namely cl acetic acid succinic acid sulfoacetic acid and dithionate s2o6 2 were produced simultaneously the good mass balances for carbon 97 103 and chlorine 92 100 indicate that cl was the only chlorine containing product further evidencing the dominant role of eaq in the reductive dechlorination of mcaa text s5 furthermore the constant concentration of i 97 100 suggests no formation of iodinated products possibly due to the rather low concentration of ris text s3 and the photolability of iodinated organics chen et al 2010 chuang et al 2016 therefore eaq is the dominant reducing species and almost fully accounts for the reductive dechlorination of mcaa via eq 3 in the process 3 6 the formation and transformation of sulfite radical sulfite radical so3 is generated stoichiometrically via eqs 2 and 11 14 so its formation kinetics can quantitatively verify these aforementioned assumptions about the roles of s iv and i in the process under anaerobic conditions it primarily participates in the parallel reactions of eqs 20a and 20b 2k 20 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 k 20a k 20b 0 61 1 or 0 8 0 2 1 fischer and warneck 1996 ichino and fessenden 2007 waygood and mcelroy 1992 thus formation kinetics of s2o6 2 were employed to quantify the formation and transformation of so3 in the process text s6 20a 20b assuming ctts excitation of i eq 1 and direct photoionization of so3 2 eq 2 to be the two dominant and independent sources of eaq the rate of eaq production can be calculated using eq 21 21 r e i 0 1 10 a l v ε s so 3 2 a φ s ε i i a φ i here r e m s 1 is the rate of eaq production a cm 1 is the decadic absorbance by the solution εs m 1 cm 1 and εi m 1 cm 1 are the molar absorption coefficients of so3 2 and i respectively and φs and φi are the effective quantum yields of so3 2 and i respectively at 254 nm εi 220 m 1 cm 1 rahn 1993 εs 18 14 m 1 cm 1 li et al 2012 φi 0 29 mol e 1 jortner et al 1964 and φs 0 116 mol e 1 li et al 2012 the formation of so3 is almost equal to that of eaq text s6 and fig s7 so the formation kinetics of s2o6 2 in n2o saturated solution can be described by eq 22 22 d s 2 o 6 2 d t r e k 20 a k 20 a k 20 b fig 7b shows that eq 22 predicts the formation of s2o6 2 well using k 20a k 20b of 0 8 1 there is slight underestimation using 0 61 1 this well supports the abovementioned hypothesis about the roles of s iv and i in the process 3 7 reductive dechlorination kinetics of mcaa in order to quantify the eaq initiated reduction efficiency of the process the dechlorination kinetics of mcaa were studied based on the assumptions about the contributions of s iv and i to the eaq production just discussed as a transient species eaq participates in various reactions e g eqs 4 7 steady state was assumed in modeling the dechlorination of mcaa and the steady state concentration of eaq was estimated using eq 23 li et al 2014 23 e aq ss r e k i s i k 3 mcaa here k i s i is the sum of the products of the scavenger concentrations and their corresponding second order rate constants with eaq the major scavengers are h2o eq 4 h eq 5 and hso3 eq 6 the scavenging of eaq by ris is negligible due to the very low steady state concentrations of ris text s3 the competition of the major products formed and intermediate radicals for eaq is negligible text s7 and the contribution of eq 7 to eaq production is also ignored text s8 the dechlorination rate of mcaa via eq 3 can be modeled using eq 24 24 r cl r e k 3 mcaa k i s i k 3 mcaa where r cl m s 1 is the dechlorination rate of mcaa because eaq is a charged species the second order rate constants between eaq and the ions were all corrected for ionic strength μ m using the brønsted bjerrum equation buxton et al 1988 when solution ph is higher than 9 2 50 μm mcaa captures nearly all the available eaq li et al 2014 and supports the pseudo zero order kinetics for mcaa degradation in the sulfite iodide uv process in fig 1 eq 24 predicts the effects of s iv and i concentrations on mcaa degradation satisfactorily as shown in figs 3b and 5b respectively 3 8 mechanistic interpretations the kinetics of mcaa dechlorination indicate the availability of eaq or eaq exposure eaq dt in the proposed process li et al 2014 these kinetics and the satisfactory agreement between the model predictions and the experimental results support the above assumptions about the roles of s iv and i in the process thus there are at least two sources of eaq including ctts excitation of i eq 1 and direct photoionization of so3 2 eq 2 besides the production of eaq via photoionization of so3 2 s iv also promptly reduces the ris formed back to i and minimizes their scavenging of eaq when s iv is absent or exhausted the scavenging of eaq by ris is estimated to be about 90 fig 1 or about 96 fig s3 based on the difference between the expected eq 24 and the actual dechlorination efficiency the consumption of s iv results from the photoionization of so3 2 and the reduction of ris with the latter being equal to the contribution of photolysis of i described in eq 21 the relative significance of the two parts is given by ε s φ s so 3 2 ε i φ i i for instance about 75 and 97 of the s iv were consumed in the reduction of ris in figs 1 and 4 respectively however high efficiency can be achieved even with a low concentration of s iv as long as it is sufficient to recycle i and a specific s iv demand of only about 0 72 mm s iv mm mcaa is required as shown in fig 4 this may interpret the synergistic effect of s iv and iodide fig 1 and the marked efficiency enhancement by s iv in phase i fig 3b meanwhile cycling of i occurs in the presence of s iv favoring steady production of eaq through ctts excitation eq 1 while both play an important role in the process i has a much greater effect normalized to concentration on the reduction efficiency attributed to its much higher absorptivity and the higher quantum yield of eaq furthermore the rate of eaq production through ctts excitation of i shows little ph dependence and the formed ris can also be reduced to i rapidly by hso3 and so2 h2o eqs 12 14 16 and 18 consequently i is recycled to maintain a constant concentration and relatively high reduction efficiency can still be achieved even under weakly acidic conditions despite the protonation of so3 2 fig 2 hence the process proposed here offers efficient production and high availability of eaq eaq exposure as shown in fig s8 the process is still effective in the field surface water at ambient conditions highlighting its potential to efficiently eliminate a wide variety of persistent and toxic contaminants abusallout and hua 2016 xie et al 2017a 2017b zahn et al 2016 4 conclusions this fundamental study proposed a new eaq based sulfite iodide uv process for advanced reduction of contaminants elucidated the mechanism and quantified the efficiency of eaq initiated reduction in the process the process offers efficient production of eaq including ctts excitation of i and direct photoionization of so3 2 while both play an important role in the process i has a much greater effect normalized to concentration on the reduction efficiency due to its much higher absorptivity and the higher quantum yield of eaq the coexisting s iv and iodide show a pronounced synergistic effect on eaq exposure under uv irradiation s iv not only produces eaq via photoionization of so3 2 but also promptly reduces the formed ris back to i and minimizes their scavenging of eaq cycling of i occurs in the presence of s iv favoring steady production of eaq the formation and transformation kinetics of so3 well verifies the roles of s iv and iodide in the process the model developed for the eaq initiated reduction efficiency predicts mcaa dechlorination satisfactorily and also supports the proposed mechanism the process shows high eaq initiated reduction efficiency due to the high eaq exposure the efficiency increases with ph and the process is still effective even under weakly acidic conditions and in field surface water the proposed process still encounters some challenges when applied to contaminant remediation the issue about residual s iv was discussed previously and sulfate formation 250 mg l 1 should not deter the possible application of the proposed process hori et al 2007 li et al 2012 oh et al 2016 considering the potential formation of iodinated products the addition of iodide is undesirable in water treatment that involves chlorine disinfection or oxidation processes criquet et al 2012 the application of iodine is regarded as relatively innocuous and shouldn t normally cause environmental problems in contaminant treatment bokare and choi 2015 lee et al 2016 merino et al 2016 vecitis et

rapidly park et al 2009 qu et al 2010 iodine chemistry has attracted much attention in contaminant removal because of the generation of many reactive species such as eaq io3 1o2 and i during activation of iodine e g i i2 and io4 saiz lopez et al 2012 iodide ion i absorbs uv light efficiently and is photolabile to release eaq via charge transfer to solvent ctts excitation of i eq 1 with high quantum yields of eaq e g 0 286 mol e 1 at 248 nm sauer et al 2004 the ki uv process was developed for efficient remediation of recalcitrant contaminants at ambient conditions vecitis et al 2009 this environment friendly technology has been successfully used to eliminate various persistent pollutants e g perfluoroalkyl compounds from wastewater qu et al 2010 however the reduction efficiency is greatly inhibited by dissolved oxygen and also by the inherently accumulated reactive iodine species ris e g i3 due to their rapid scavenging of eaq park et al 2009 2011 qu et al 2010 1 recently a sulfite uv process for reductive dehalogenation has been developed based on the eaq production from photoionization of so3 2 eq 2 and efficient reductive degradation of some hocs and toxins was readily achieved li et al 2012 however the production efficiency of eaq is governed by the uv photons absorbed by so3 2 a high concentration of s iv and high ph are thus required due to the relatively low absorptivity and the protonation of so3 2 li et al 2014 2 in this study a new sulfite iodide uv process is firstly proposed to take advantage of the beneficial effects of s iv and iodide iodide absorbs uv light efficiently and has a high quantum yield of eaq sauer et al 2004 thus providing another stable and important source of eaq via eq 1 under mild conditions more importantly the electron photodetachment from the excited i via eq 1 is not influenced by ph sauer et al 2004 at the same time s iv can deplete dissolved oxygen rapidly via photoinitiated chain reactions to minimize its negative influence on reduction efficiency fischer and warneck 1996 and it may also inhibit the scavenging of eaq by ris by quickly reducing them back to iodide alfassi et al 1995 yiin and margerum 1990 hence the process promises to have efficient production and utilization of eaq and to achieve enhanced reduction efficiency at ambient conditions also the process does not require expensive metal catalysts and organic sacrificial electron donors e g phenol benzoquinone the aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism and to quantify the efficiency of the eaq initiated reduction in this sulfite iodide uv process roles of s iv and iodide were revealed and were further verified by the formation and transformation kinetics of sulfite radical so3 a simple model was constructed to quantify the reduction efficiency and effects of water quality ph and field surface water were also examined because of its relatively simple molecular structure and its versatile reactivity toward various radicals monochloroacetic acid mcaa was selected as the eaq probe compound in this study to gain insight into the availability of eaq or eaq exposure for reduction in the proposed process as described previously li et al 2012 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers shown in text s1 of the supporting information si and were used as received without further purification all solutions were prepared using 18 2 mω cm milli q water produced from a millipore system fresh stock solutions of na2so3 and ki were prepared with n2 saturated milli q water prior to each set of experiment field surface water was collected from the qiantang river hangzhou section china the samples were filtered through cellulose membrane 0 45 μm and stored at 4 c in dark the characteristics of the field surface water are summarized in table s1 2 2 experimental procedure a cylindrical photoreactor solution volume v 800 ml equipped with a low pressure mercury uv lamp 10 w ozone free gph212t5l heraeus noblelight emitting monochromatic light at λ 253 7 nm was used the photon flow i 0 amount basis 253 7 nm entering the solution was about 2 98 μe s 1 and the effective path length l was about 3 57 cm in all experiments a constant i 0 v was applied 3 73 μe l 1 s 1 unless otherwise noted the photoreactor was thermostated at 25 0 5 c throughout the solution ph 8 0 11 0 was buffered using 10 mm borate the solutions at ph 5 9 or 7 2 were adjusted with 1 0 m h2so4 but without any buffer and ph change was less than 0 1 units prior to each set of irradiation experiment the uv lamp was illuminated for at least 15 min and the solution was purged with n2 1 5 l min 1 for 20 min unless otherwise stated mcaa dechlorination in field surface water was conducted by spiking mcaa s iv and iodide into the solution which was not adjusted for ph all experiments were conducted at least in duplicate and average values sd are reported when not shown error bars are smaller than the symbols in figures details about the uv reactor and the methodology for irradiation experiments can be found elsewhere li et al 2012 2014 2 3 analytical methods a cary 300 uv

tic and total nitrogen tn were analyzed using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu the sealed samples were stored at 4 c in the dark prior to analysis within 24 h more details were provided in our previous study li et al 2012 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction efficiency in the sulfite iodide uv process monochloroacetic acid mcaa is a well established eaq probe releasing cl via eq 3 buxton et al 1988 and has been successfully used as the probe compound to investigate the reactive species and to assess the efficiency of eaq induced reduction in various systems brautzsch et al 2016 gu et al 2017 kerzig and goez 2016 li et al 2012 fig 1 shows the removal of mcaa in the sulfite iodide uv processes about 50 μm mcaa was almost completely degraded and almost complete dechlorination simultaneous release of cl was also readily achieved within 5 min in the sulfite iodide uv process under the given conditions suggesting the involvement of eaq in the process it should be noted that only less than 2 of the mcaa was degraded within 72 h by 1 0 mm s iv and 0 1 mm i at ph 9 2 and 25 c in the dark and that less than 1 underwent direct photolysis within 15 min li et al 2012 3 from fig 1 mcaa degradation follows pseudo zero order kinetics at ph 9 2 and the rate r 1 is about 12 86 μm min 1 in the sulfite iodide uv process compared with the efficiency of two typical arps i e iodide uv r 2 of 1 09 μm min 1 and sulfite uv r 3 of 3 36 μm min 1 processes about 3 fold higher efficiency was observed in the sulfite iodide uv process suggesting a significant synergistic effect of s iv and i one tailed student s t test p 0 05 3 2 effect of ph solution ph plays an important role in interconversion between h and eaq typically through eqs 4 7 buxton et al 1988 li et al 2014 fig 2 shows the effect of ph on the mcaa degradation in the sulfite iodide uv process increasing ph promoted mcaa degradation significantly but this influence became very slight when ph was higher than 9 2 as observed previously li et al 2012 because the electron photodetachment from i is not influenced by ph significantly sauer et al 2004 the such ph dependence of efficiency should be attributable to the protonation of sulfite and the resulting decrease in eaq production as well as the scavenging of eaq by the competing reactions li et al 2014 compared with the very low reduction efficiency 3 within 15 min 1 0 mm s iv in the sulfite uv process at ph around 6 li et al 2012 about 27 times higher efficiency was still obtained in the sulfite iodide uv process fig 2 also the reduction efficiency of the sulfite iodide uv process within the ph range studied was at least 2 8 times ph 5 9 fig 2 higher than that of the iodide uv process fig 1 4 5 6 7 3 3 the role of s iv fig 3 a shows that increasing the concentration of s iv enhanced mcaa degradation and fig 3b describes two distinct phases for the enhancement by s iv the degradation rate of mcaa was accelerated markedly from 1 09 μm min 1 to 9 90 μm min 1 by 0 01 mm s iv phase i and a further increase in s iv concentration caused a slower linear enhancement phase ii considering the attenuation of uv intensity in the sulfite iodide uv process from 9 to 21 text s2 the slope of about 2 40 10 3 min 1 for phase ii in fig 3b is consistent with that 3 05 10 3 min 1 reported in the sulfite uv process li et al 2012 thus s iv probably makes a direct contribution to eaq production via eq 2 in the phase ii as it does in the sulfite uv process meanwhile the depletion of s iv was about 61 within 60 min fig s1 which was much higher compared with the case in the absence of i 17 as reported previously li et al 2012 this implies a significant involvement of s iv in the process furthermore the marked enhancement of mcaa dechlorination efficiency in phase i strongly implies other roles for s iv in the process fig 4 shows simultaneous evolution of s iv and i during the degradation of mcaa rapid degradation of mcaa and a constant concentration of i were observed as long as s iv was available when s iv was exhausted degradation of mcaa was much retarded also observed in the cases with 0 01 mm and 0 03 mm s iv in fig 3a accompanied by the simultaneous depletion of i 19 within in 20 min considering the concurrent rapid consumption of s iv those results suggest that s iv probably plays a role in recycling i and in maintaining the fast degradation of mcaa 3 4 the role of iodide fig 5 a clearly shows that mcaa degradation was promoted by i and fig 5b depicts a linear dependence of the degradation rate on i concentration comparing the two linear relationships in fig 3b slope of 2 40 10 3 min 1 and fig 5b slope of 9 64 10 2 min 1 it suggests that the efficiency of the process is about 40 times normalized to molar concentration more dependent on i than on s iv so i may play a vital role in the process compared with so3 2 i absorbs uv light much more efficiently ε i 254 220 m 1 cm 1 fig s2 and has a higher quantum yield φi 254 0 29 mol e 1 at 253 7 nm sauer et al 2004 though the iodide uv process failed to show the correspondingly higher reduction efficiency fig 1 and fig s3 this may be interpreted by the rapid scavenging of eaq by ris e g eqs 8 10 which are inherently formed and accumulated park et al 2009 2011 qu et al 2010 as indicated in fig s4 for example the scavenging rate of eaq by 10 μm i3 is 3 5 105 s 1 eq 10 which is 7 times more rapid than that by 50 μm mcaa 5 104 s 1 in fact when s iv was exhausted about 19 μm i was depleted and might have been transformed into ris which competed for eaq at least an order of magnitude more strongly than mcaa fig 4 8 9 10 ris e g i i2 i2 and i3 can be reduced rapidly to i by s iv via eqs 11 19 alfassi et al 1995 kerezsi et al 2007 neta et al 1988 yiin and margerum 1990 the rapid decomposition of s iv supports its considerable involvement in the reduction of ris fig 4 and fig s1 the rapid reduction of ris by s iv would lead to very low steady state concentrations of ris fig s4 and thus the negligible scavenging of eaq text s3 this is also supported by the negligible depletion of i when s iv is available fig 4 for instance 10 μm s iv will reduce the steady state concentrations of i and i3 to less than 1 3 10 11 m and 7 4 10 16 m respectively thus it is probable that cycling of i occurs to maintain a constant concentration and i plays a role in the process by steadily producing eaq 11 12 13 14 15 i 3 so 3 2 2 i iso 3 k 15 2 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 16 i 3 hso 3 2 i h iso 3 k 16 1 5 10 7 m 1 s 1 17 i 2 so 3 2 iso 3 i

species in the process were investigated as described previously li et al 2012 fig 6 a shows the inhibitory effects of electron scavengers on the mcaa degradation in the process the complete inhibition of mcaa degradation by n2o strongly indicates the involvement of eaq and or h in the process nonetheless the facts that i the different inhibitory effects of no2 and no3 fig 6a ii the accumulation of no2 fig s5 and iii the competition kinetics between mcaa degradation and no2 depletion fig 6b well support that eaq plays a dominant role in the process actually h is formed in low yield at ph 9 2 3 in fig s6 the contributions from ris and sulfite radical so3 are also ruled out for more discussion please see text s4 fig 7 a shows that the major products namely cl acetic acid succinic acid sulfoacetic acid and dithionate s2o6 2 were produced simultaneously the good mass balances for carbon 97 103 and chlorine 92 100 indicate that cl was the only chlorine containing product further evidencing the dominant role of eaq in the reductive dechlorination of mcaa text s5 furthermore the constant concentration of i 97 100 suggests no formation of iodinated products possibly due to the rather low concentration of ris text s3 and the photolability of iodinated organics chen et al 2010 chuang et al 2016 therefore eaq is the dominant reducing species and almost fully accounts for the reductive dechlorination of mcaa via eq 3 in the process 3 6 the formation and transformation of sulfite radical sulfite radical so3 is generated stoichiometrically via eqs 2 and 11 14 so its formation kinetics can quantitatively verify these aforementioned assumptions about the roles of s iv and i in the process under anaerobic conditions it primarily participates in the parallel reactions of eqs 20a and 20b 2k 20 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 k 20a k 20b 0 61 1 or 0 8 0 2 1 fischer and warneck 1996 ichino and fessenden 2007 waygood and mcelroy 1992 thus formation kinetics of s2o6 2 were employed to quantify the formation and transformation of so3 in the process text s6 20a 20b assuming ctts excitation of i eq 1 and direct photoionization of so3 2 eq 2 to be the two dominant and independent sources of eaq the rate of eaq production can be calculated using eq 21 21 r e i 0 1 10 a l v ε s so 3 2 a φ s ε i i a φ i here r e m s 1 is the rate of eaq production a cm 1 is the decadic absorbance by the solution εs m 1 cm 1 and εi m 1 cm 1 are the molar absorption coefficients of so3 2 and i respectively and φs and φi are the effective quantum yields of so3 2 and i respectively at 254 nm εi 220 m 1 cm 1 rahn 1993 εs 18 14 m 1 cm 1 li et al 2012 φi 0 29 mol e 1 jortner et al 1964 and φs 0 116 mol e 1 li et al 2012 the formation of so3 is almost equal to that of eaq text s6 and fig s7 so the formation kinetics of s2o6 2 in n2o saturated solution can be described by eq 22 22 d s 2 o 6 2 d t r e k 20 a k 20 a k 20 b fig 7b shows that eq 22 predicts the formation of s2o6 2 well using k 20a k 20b of 0 8 1 there is slight underestimation using 0 61 1 this well supports the abovementioned hypothesis about the roles of s iv and i in the process 3 7 reductive dechlorination kinetics of mcaa in order to quantify the eaq initiated reduction efficiency of the process the dechlorination kinetics of mcaa were studied based on the assumptions about the contributions of s iv and i to the eaq production just discussed as a transient species eaq participates in various reactions e g eqs 4 7 steady state was assumed in modeling the dechlorination of mcaa and the steady state concentration of eaq was estimated using eq 23 li et al 2014 23 e aq ss r e k i s i k 3 mcaa here k i s i is the sum of the products of the scavenger concentrations and their corresponding second order rate constants with eaq the major scavengers are h2o eq 4 h eq 5 and hso3 eq 6 the scavenging of eaq by ris is negligible due to the very low steady state concentrations of ris text s3 the competition of the major products formed and intermediate radicals for eaq is negligible text s7 and the contribution of eq 7 to eaq production is also ignored text s8 the dechlorination rate of mcaa via eq 3 can be modeled using eq 24 24 r cl r e k 3 mcaa k i s i k 3 mcaa where r cl m s 1 is the dechlorination rate of mcaa because eaq is a charged species the second order rate constants between eaq and the ions were all corrected for ionic strength μ m using the brønsted bjerrum equation buxton et al 1988 when solution ph is higher than 9 2 50 μm mcaa captures nearly all the available eaq li et al 2014 and supports the pseudo zero order kinetics for mcaa degradation in the sulfite iodide uv process in fig 1 eq 24 predicts the effects of s iv and i concentrations on mcaa degradation satisfactorily as shown in figs 3b and 5b respectively 3 8 mechanistic interpretations the kinetics of mcaa dechlorination indicate the availability of eaq or eaq exposure eaq dt in the proposed process li et al 2014 these kinetics and the satisfactory agreement between the model predictions and the experimental results support the above assumptions about the roles of s iv and i in the process thus there are at least two sources of eaq including ctts excitation of i eq 1 and direct photoionization of so3 2 eq 2 besides the production of eaq via photoionization of so3 2 s iv also promptly reduces the ris formed back to i and minimizes their scavenging of eaq when s iv is absent or exhausted the scavenging of eaq by ris is estimated to be about 90 fig 1 or about 96 fig s3 based on the difference between the expected eq 24 and the actual dechlorination efficiency the consumption of s iv results from the photoionization of so3 2 and the reduction of ris with the latter being equal to the contribution of photolysis of i described in eq 21 the relative significance of the two parts is given by ε s φ s so 3 2 ε i φ i i for instance about 75 and 97 of the s iv were consumed in the reduction of ris in figs 1 and 4 respectively however high efficiency can be achieved even with a low concentration of s iv as long as it is sufficient to recycle i and a specific s iv demand of only about 0 72 mm s iv mm mcaa is required as shown in fig 4 this may interpret the synergistic effect of s iv and iodide fig 1 and the marked efficiency enhancement by s iv in phase i fig 3b meanwhile cycling of i occurs in the presence of s iv favoring steady production of eaq through ctts excitation eq 1 while both play an important role in the process i has a much greater effect normalized to concentration on the reduction efficiency attributed to its much higher absorptivity and the higher quantum yield of eaq furthermore the rate of eaq production through ctts excitation of i shows little ph dependence and the formed ris can also be reduced to i rapidly by hso3 and so2 h2o eqs 12 14 16 and 18 consequently i is recycled to maintain a constant concentration and relatively high reduction efficiency can still be achieved even under weakly acidic conditions despite the protonation of so3 2 fig 2 hence the process proposed here offers efficient production and high availability of eaq eaq exposure as shown in fig s8 the process is still effective in the field surface water at ambient conditions highlighting its potential to efficiently eliminate a wide variety of persistent and toxic contaminants abusallout and hua 2016 xie et al 2017a 2017b zahn et al 2016 4 conclusions this fundamental study proposed a new eaq based sulfite iodide uv process for advanced reduction of contaminants elucidated the mechanism and quantified the efficiency of eaq initiated reduction in the process the process offers efficient production of eaq including ctts excitation of i and direct photoionization of so3 2 while both play an important role in the process i has a much greater effect normalized to concentration on the reduction efficiency due to its much higher absorptivity and the higher quantum yield of eaq the coexisting s iv and iodide show a pronounced synergistic effect on eaq exposure under uv irradiation s iv not only produces eaq via photoionization of so3 2 but also promptly reduces the formed ris back to i and minimizes their scavenging of eaq cycling of i occurs in the presence of s iv favoring steady production of eaq the formation and transformation kinetics of so3 well verifies the roles of s iv and iodide in the process the model developed for the eaq initiated reduction efficiency predicts mcaa dechlorination satisfactorily and also supports the proposed mechanism the process shows high eaq initiated reduction efficiency due to the high eaq exposure the efficiency increases with ph and the process is still effective even under weakly acidic conditions and in field surface water the proposed process still encounters some challenges when applied to contaminant remediation the issue about residual s iv was discussed previously and sulfate formation 250 mg l 1 should not deter the possible application of the proposed process hori et al 2007 li et al 2012 oh et al 2016 considering the potential formation of iodinated products the addition of iodide is undesirable in water treatment that involves chlorine disinfection or oxidation processes criquet et al 2012 the application of iodine is regarded as relatively innocuous and shouldn t normally cause environmental problems in contaminant treatment bokare and choi 2015 lee et al 2016 merino et al 2016 vecitis et al 2009 also the use of immobilized catalyst will possibly offer a viable solution bokare and choi 2015 regardless further study is needed to clarify the potential risk associated with the involvement
