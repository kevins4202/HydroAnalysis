10150,deep soil water is important for trees to combat droughts and thus is an important consideration for assessing sustainability of afforestation however the extent to which trees could depend on deep soil for root water uptake rwu remains poorly understood here we selected five apple orchards planted in 2008 2005 2001 1998 and 1994 named a2008 a2005 a2001 a1998 and a1994 respectively from the chinese loess plateau and measured water isotopes from tree xylem and soil to the depth up to 23 m we then used the bayesian mixing model mixsiar with dual isotopes 2h 18o to quantify the seasonal contribution ratio of each soil layer 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 m 2 5 m and 5 m to maximum rooting depth to rwu in normal years 2017 2018 and wet year 2019 results showed that with increasing orchard age rooting depth increased from 10 2 m to 23 2 m resulting in cumulative deep soil below 5 m water deficits from 74 5 mm in 9 year old orchard to 1191 8 mm in 25 year old orchard and annual deep soil water below 5 m contributed 9 39 to the total rwu over the orchard lifetime although fine roots in shallow 0 2 m soils in old orchards a1998 and a1994 only accounted for 20 of that in the entire profiles these roots contributed on average 64 of the total absorbed water in 2017 2019 relative to the normal year apple trees relied less on deep soil water in wet year our findings is of particular significance

2002 huang et al 2003 in the past decades a series of revegetation projects were conducted in china contributing 25 of the global greening during that period chen et al 2019 the green for green project which was implanted on the clp in 1999 is the largest of these projects although this project has made pronounced progress increasing vegetation coverage the revegetated trees have also altered the water cycle and disrupted the water balance that existed between soil and plants prior to revegetation feng et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 apple trees have been commonly used as an economical revegetation strategy where the conversion from cropland to apple orchards not only increase the income of local farmers but also reduces soil water erosion of the loess hills and existing gullies chen et al 2015 gao et al 2018a many studies have been conducted to assess the changes in soil water following afforestation jia et al 2017 wang et al 2011 yan et al 2015 notably recent studies li et al 2018a li et al 2019 revealed the connection between deep soil depletion and rooting depth and presented a conceptual model for the interaction between rooting depth and deep soil water depletion under limited precipitation 150 800 mm year 1 trees growing in a deep unsaturated zone develop root networks progressively deeper in order to access water in deeper soil however little focus has been placed on understanding how changes in deep soil water and rooting depth will impact rwu over the lifetime and over different precipitation years this is important for understanding how the soil water balance is affected by land use change and afforestation over the long term which is critical but poorly understood for assessing the sustainability of afforestation rwu patterns have been identified among various vegetation types wang et al 2019 wu et al 2016 as well as in mixed species settings where heterospecifics compete for water tang et al 2018 west et al 2007 previous studies with isotopes method found that plants may shift their rwu patterns under different precipitation conditions and the patterns can be species dependent liu et al 2019b nie et al 2019 however few rwu studies have included trees of varying ages located in a variety of different soil water conditions over a multi year scale rwu patterns have been assessed by measurements of water potential cook and o grady 2006 nehemy et al 2020 root distribution song et al 2020 and or chemical or isotopic tracers wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 water isotopes in particular have been widely used to trace the movement of water from the soil to the plant xylem rothfuss and javaux 2017 a critical assumption in the application of water stable isotopes 2h 18o is that no isotope fractionation occurs when plants transport water from the soil to the xylem this assumption has been convincingly verified recently with a variety of plants chen et al 2020 furthermore water isotopes can be used to quantify and partition rwu with respect to both space shallow soil deep soil groundwater etc evaristo and mcdonnell 2017 rossatto et al 2012 and time winter precipitation summer precipitation etc allen et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 relative to neutron probe method wang and wang 2018 wang et al 2015 the advantage of isotopes based method is that they can capture the seasonal water use pattern accurately associated with deep rooted plants although roots are commonly found at depths of more than 20 m on the clp li et al 2018a yan et al 2015 the depths of isotopic investigation of most studies are far less than the maximum rooting depth and are often as shallow as 3 m or less gao et al 2018b huo et al 2018 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2019 for example recent studies concerned with rwu on the loess plateau identified rooting depths of 2 m for jujube trees huo et al 2018 3 m for hippophae rhamnoides and spiraea pubescens wang et al 2019 and 5 m for robinia pseudoacacia zhao et al 2019 however the apple trees in this study have much greater rooting depths to the depth of 23 2 m in the old orchard li et al 2018b therefore in the case of apple trees shallow investigation depths will likely result in an incomplete understanding of the contributions of deep soil water to rwu furthermore as apple trees on the clp age their fine roots shift from an exponential distribution to a more uniform distribution with depth thus increasing the proportion of fine roots located in deep soils li et al 2018b whether fine root water uptake in deep soil influences rwu pattern remains unclear however a small quantity of rwu in each deep soil layer certainly has the potential to increase the amount of water available for transpiration the objective of this study is to quantify the extent to which afforested apple trees may rely on deep soil water for rwu with the increasing rooting depth in a water limited area a bayesian mixing model mixsiar coupled with dual isotopes was used to determine the seasonal rwu proportion and the contributions of shallow and deep soil water to the transpiration of apple trees of varying age under varying rooting depth and precipitation the results of this study are projected to improve our understanding of the water use and drought mitigation strategies of trees facing deep soil water deficits 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located on flat land with an average elevation of 1200 m a s l this land is located in the southeastern portion of the clp in changwu county shaanxi province 39 14 n 107 41 e fig 1 this region has a sub humid continental climate with a long term 1957 2015 mean annual temperature of 9 4 c the mean annual precipitation is 571 mm of which 55 occurs between july and september long term mean potential evapotranspiration has been estimated as 891 mm year 1 using the fao penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 of which 55 occurs from may to august the soils are predominantly silt loam textured with silt contents 0 05 0 002 mm particle diameter greater than 0 5 g g 1 soil in the tableland consists of aeolian loess deposits zhu et al 1983 and thus the horizontal variation in soil texture is minor the depth from the soil surface to the water table ranges from 50 to 80 m farmlands and apple orchards are the two main land use types in the study area these apple orchards being in different stand ages provide an opportunity to use space for time substitution to analyze the changes in rwu over the orchard lifetime pickett 1989 the blooming period of the apple trees is around mid april the swelling period is from july to august and the fruit maturing period is in october through a survey conducted with local farmers apple trees are known to bear fruit at around 4 5 years have high yield at around 13 18 years and rarely survive more than 30 years 2 2 sampling and analysis five representative apple orchards malus pumila mill with similar fertilization and pruning pattern were selected in 2017 these apple orchards were planted on previous cropland in 2008 2005 2001 1998 and 1994 named a2008 a2005 a2001 a1998 and a1994 samples were taken from 2017 to 2019 which represented the orchard ages from 9 to 25 years old the mean tree height trunk diameter and sampling dates were shown in table 1 in each orchard an in situ neutron probe cnc 503dr chaoneng china was used to determine deep soil water content using the standard method as provided in chanasyk and naeth 1996 the probe was calibrated using the oven drying method the maximum depth of water content investigation was 19 m for all the selected apple orchards table 1 on a clear and sunny day during the growing season from 2017 to 2019 soil and plant materials were collected for analysis table 1 on every sampling date one soil core was collected in 20 cm intervals to a depth of 6 m where each core was surrounded by four apple trees approximately equidistantly spaced from the coring location the collected soil was partitioned into two parts where one portion was used to determine the soil water content and the remainder placed in a polyethylene bottle sealed with parafilm and stored at 20 Âºc the soil water content was determined gravimetrically following the oven drying method the gravimetric water content was then transformed into volumetric water content using the soil bulk density values obtained by li et al 2019 in addition to soils tree tissue samples were collected from the surrounding four trees at each soil sampling location four one year old tree branch samples were collected from each of the four apple trees at midday the bark and phloem were removed and the branches were placed in glass bottles which were then wrapped with parafilm and stored at 20 Âºc until analysis information about the rooting distributions in five apple orchards in table 1 including the rooting depth and root length density was provided by measurements performed by li et al 2018b on the same tree stands in 2016 root parameters of the five apple trees in 2017 were processed with linear interpolation based on adjacent tree age using the data from li et al 2018b and the transformed root length density fraction with profile depth in 2017 was shown in fig s1 besides soil cores from 30 years old apple orchards and adjacent cropland were sampled to determine the water extraction limit for apple trees and the initial deep soil water content prior to afforestation respectively furthermore before 2017 soil cores had been collected from each of the study orchards to the maximum rooting depth in order to determine the isotope Î´2h and Î´18o values within the root zone at that time incident precipitation at the sites was gathered using a custom made collector which consisted of a funnel inserted and sealed into a cylindrical collection reservoir with a standard plastic ping pong ball placed loosely atop the opening of the funnel during rain events water builds up in the funnel causing the plastic ball to float and allow water to enter the reservoir whereas between rain events the plastic ball sits tight against the funnel opening preventing debris from entering the reservoir and minimizing evaporated water from exiting upon removal from the collectors rainwater was stored at 4 Âºc until analysis water isotopes Î´2h and Î´18o values of collected precipitation soil water and plant xylem water were determined to obtain the water contained in soil and plant xylem the samples were extracted using a li 2000 cryogenic vacuum distillation system lica china following the procedure in voltas et al 2015 soil and precipitation water isotopes values were measured with an iwa 45ep off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy oa icos water isotope analyzer lgr los gatos research usa where the measurement accuracies for Î´2h and Î´18o are 1 and 0 2 respectively however the co extraction of organic molecules is common during xylem water extraction leading to errors in Î´2h and Î´18o measurements using oa icos leen et al 2012 to avoid measurement errors from co extracted organics the xylem water isotopes values were determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms with an isoprime 100 isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime ltd uk where the measurement accuracies of Î´2h and Î´18o are 2 and 0 3 respectively there is no significant difference in the results obtained with the lgr and irms when measuring pure water the Î´2h and Î´18o values of measured water samples were determined using the following 1 Î´ r sample r stand r stand 1000 where r sample and r stand are the ratios of 2h 1h or 18o 16o in the sample and reference standard water respectively vienna standard means ocean water vsmow was used as the reference standard for this study 2 3 calculation of actual evapotranspiration transpiration and evaporation the actual root water uptake at each sampling date was calculated using the following method we derived the actual evapotranspiration aet mm in a year by the soil water balance method 2 s p aet d r where Î´s mm was calculated soil water storage difference using the measured soil water with a neutron probe to the maximum rooting depth p is the annual precipitation mm d is the deep drainage rate below the root zone mm which is obtained based on the equation developed at the same site for different rooting depth by li et al 2018a r is surface runoff which can be ignored as the study site is in a flat land daily aet aet d mm was obtained by multiplying the yearly aet by the proportion of daily potential evapotranspiration rate pet d to yearly potential evapotranspiration pet because of a well relationship between aet d and pet d wang and wang 2017 3 aet d aet pet d pet leaf area index lai in each orchard in the sampling date was measured with lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor inc usa then the actual daily evaporation e d and transpiration t d at a sampling date were obtained via daily aet d lai and beer s law ritchie 1972 and 4 e d aet d exp k lai 5 t d aet d 1 exp k lai 2 4 parameter settings in mixsiar graphical user interface groundwater in the study area is far deeper than the maximum rooting depth of the apple trees thus the soil water in the unsaturated zone is considered the only water source for rwu to determine the relative contribution of different soil layers to the apple tree rwu an r script of the bayesian model framework mixsiar stock and semmens 2013 was used to estimate the posterior distribution of each soil layer contribution soil water content and isotope variations were affected by the upper boundary precipitation and evaporation and the intensity of such impact generally decreased with increasing soil depth in this context we partitioned the root zone soil into four layers 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 m 2 5 m and 5 m to the maximum rooting depth 5 m based on the soil water content isotopes values Î´2h Î´18o variations figs s2 and s3b soil water contents and isotope values were distinctly affected by seasonal trends in precipitation and evaporation for the surface 0 0 4 m soil layers they experienced relatively little change for the 0 4 2 m soil layers and were mainly affected by large precipitation for the 2 5 m soil layers and were hardly influenced by the precipitation for soil layer deeper than 5 m the trophic discrimination factor tdf and concentration dependence between the source and mixture were set to 0 as no isotope fractionation occurred in the water during its movement from the soil to the plant xylem the run length was set to be very long and the error structure was set to be resid process the mixsiar framework adopted in this study used the gelman rubin and geweke diagnostics to check the convergence of the model using these parameters mixsiar was used to determine the contribution ratio of each soil water source to the xylem water composition in addition sourcing plant water using water isotopes is notoriously an ill posed problem and additional information such as root distribution and soil water content helps define the problem as is well known plant water uptake from a layer depends on both the root length density and the available soil water content in that layer therefore it is plausible to use the product of available water content and root length density in a layer as the prior information the available water content can be calculated as the difference between the actual measured soil water content of the layer and the extraction limited water content of that layer here we defined the extraction limit as the soil water content below which the water in that layer was no longer be accessible by orchard roots in this study the soil water content profile of the 30 years old apple orchard was used to determine the extraction limit fig 2b firstly the lowest water content from 5 to 10 m depth in the 30 years old orchard 0 16 m3 m 3 was set as the extraction limit for all soils within the 0 5 m soil depth in the study orchards this seems reasonable when considering the relatively uniform soil bulk density and texture within the top 10 m of the profile fig 2a secondly field soil profile water samplings at the study site also showed that there was little change in deep soil water content 5 m in depth for old orchards fig s3a therefore the deep soil water content of a 30 year old apple tree should reach the extraction limit thus the available soil water in each soil depth i asw i m 3 m 3 within the rooting zone of apple tree can be expressed as 6 asw i Î¸ a i 0 16 i 5 m Î¸ a i Î¸ 30 yrs i i 5 m where Î¸ a i is the real measured soil water content in the soil depth i in the apple orchard Î¸ 30 yrs i is the measured soil water content in the depth i in 30 years apple orchard then the available soil water storage asws mm from soil depth d 1 m to d 2 m can be expressed as 7 asws d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 asw i 1000 dz 2 5 data analysis several assumptions were made when using mixsiar to determine seasonal rwu deep soil water contents below 5 m were measured with the neutron probe technique and the soil water isotopes Î´2h Î´18o below 5 m were assumed to be unchanged because the seasonal precipitation rarely penetrates past this depth and the root water uptake processes can hardly alter soil water isotopes values in deep soil besides the fine roots distributions in each apple orchard were assumed to be unchanged from 2017 to 2019 for each apple orchard the accumulated deep soil water storage deficit Î´ s mm below a depth of 5 m was defined as the cumulative water storage difference in the orchard and the adjacent cropland 8 s 5 z Î¸ c i Î¸ a i 1000 dz where z is the rooting depth m in apple orchard and where Î¸ c i and Î¸ a i are soil water content m3 m 3 in cropland and apple orchard in each soil depth i in order to compare average contribution ratio from a soil layer between different years we first calculated the water uptake amount rwu at each sampling date in a year then the average contribution of a layer to rwu in a year was the ratio of sum of daily water uptake from a layer to the sum of daily actual uptake from the whole profile in that year suppose the water contribution from a layer i at date j obtained from mixsiar was x i j then the water uptake from a layer i at date j rwu i j was 9 rwu i j x i j t d j then the average ravg and standard deviation std of daily contribution of layer i to the daily actual t d in a year were 10 ravg i j 1 n rwu i j j 1 n t d j j 1 n x i j t d j j 1 n t d j 11 std i j 1 n x i j t d j ravg i 2 n j 1 n t d j 2 where n was the number of sampling dates in a year 3 results 3 1 water isotope characteristics of precipitation soil water and xylem water precipitation in 2017 2018 and 2019 during the growing season from april to october were 496 0 mm 541 0 mm and 734 9 mm respectively fig 3a c this indicated a wet year in 2019 and normal years in 2017 and 2018 based on the long term historical average value 514 5 mm the isotopic compositions of precipitation events varied greatly during the growing season with Î´2h ranged from 69 3 to 137 8 and Î´18o from 16 6 to 19 1 fig 3a c generally precipitations were enriched in large water isotopes from may to june and were depleted from september to october the local meteoric water line lmwl from the measured Î´2h and Î´18o of incident precipitation from 2017 2019 was fitted as Î´2h 6 98Î´18o 2 34 r2 0 94 n 140 fig 4 the slope and intercept of the lmwl were smaller than that of the global meteoric water line gmwl Î´2h 8Î´18o 10 craig 1961 indicating that the rainfall experienced secondary evaporation during the precipitation event water isotope values in plant xylem fluctuated dramatically throughout the growing seasons and varied depending on the antecedent precipitation isotope values fig 3d f plant xylem water isotope values were more depleted after large precipitation events in september 2017 and july 2018 this is because the larger precipitation events in the study site was always characterized by depleted isotope values fig 3a c in 2019 the strong variation of the water isotopes values of precipitation events created a wide range of isotope values in plants xylem for example the extremely enriched isotope values at the end of may created much enriched water isotope values in plants xylem in june fig 3f the oldest orchard a1994 had closest water isotopic composition to antecedent precipitation events relative to a young orchard fig 3d f the isotope values in plant xylem showed more depleted values in september 2017 and july 2018 after the large lighter precipitation events but more enriched values in xylem in may to july 2019 after large heavy precipitation events fig 3d f moreover the average Î´2h and Î´18o in plants xylem in 2019 were 50 2 and 6 1 respectively which were greater than that of 2017 and 2018 65 4 for Î´2h and 8 0 for Î´18o fig 3d f suggesting a more enriched or shallower soil water source for orchard a1994 soil water isotopes in the 0 0 4 m layer displayed a wide range of values throughout the study season as the surface soil water is readily affected by precipitation they were also more enriched because of evaporation occurring at the surface fig 4 in most cases water isotopes in shallow soils were more enriched suggesting more intense evaporation and fractionation there exceptions to the general trend were observed in september 2017 july august 2018 and september 2019 when large and depleted precipitation events caused depleted values in the shallow soil layer fig 2 fig 5 in contrast water isotopes in the deep soil layers below 2 m showed smaller variations and the values were more depleted relative to shallow layers fig 4 all apple orchards showed similar trends in vertical soil water isotope distributions where Î´2h and Î´18o values generally decreased with depth fig 5 on a dual isotope plot Î´2h vs Î´18o soil and xylem waters generally plot to the right of the lmwl indicating that the source water precipitation experienced an evaporation fractionation in the soil resulting in fractionated soil and xylem water isotope values fig 4 according to the water mixing theory rothfuss and javaux 2017 the depth at which soil water and xylem water isotope values intersect represents the mean depth of rwu in the current study most intersection depths were shallower in 2019 than in 2017 and 2018 fig 5 indicating shallower soil water sources for apple trees in 2019 3 2 seasonal variations of available soil water storage asws and the estimated rwu with mixsiar using eqs 2 and 3 we determined the asws in the soil layers 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 m 2 5 m and 5 m to the maximum rooting depth in each orchard fig 6 a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 the asws in the soil layer was mainly affected by antecedent precipitation and the tree age in 2017 asws in 0 2 m soil layer showed low values in july because of less antecedent precipitation 50 mm one month before the sampling date and high values in september because of antecedent large precipitation recharge in august 149 mm in 2018 asws in 0 2 m showed higher values in july after antecedent large precipitation 200 mm and then reduced afterward in 2019 asws in 0 2 m kept relatively stable values during may to august with a uniform precipitation recharge and higher values on sept 25 because of antecedent large precipitation recharge in september 150 mm for the 2 5 m soil layer large precipitation in 2018 and 2019 created higher asws values than in 2017 for deep soil layer below 5 m the asws values kept decreasing trends following sampling dates except young orchard a2008 and older orchard a1994 older orchards had lower deep soil water contents below 2 m especially below 5 m fig 7a with an exception that a1994 showed a soil water recovery for the soil layer 2 5 m compared to the adjacent cropland deep soil water deficit below 5 m increased from 74 5 mm in 9 year old orchard to 1191 8 mm in 25 year old orchard fig 7b the rwu from the four layers by apple trees were determined using the mixsiar model with dual isotopes fig 6 a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 there was no obvious relationship between rwu pattern and shallow soil water contents for example apple trees did not increase the contributions of shallow 0 2 m soil layer in wet sampling periods such as sept 13 2017 or july 20 2018 or higher reliance on deep soil water below 2 or 5 m on low precipitation periods such as aug 11 2018 or aug 16 2109 there seemed that apple trees did not shift their water use pattern immediately after precipitation supply or reduction for all orchards in 2017 the low precipitation from may to july resulted in an increasing rwu proportion from the deep soil layer below 2 m or 5 m even after the surface soil recharged by a high precipitation in september apple trees still used more deep soil water conversely in 2018 apple trees gradually increased or kept stable rwu proportions from shallow 0 2 m soil layer despite of the large precipitation in july 200 mm in contrast 2019 had a relatively uniform precipitation distribution over the growing season and orchard trees kept both stable and low rwu proportions from the deeper soil layer below 5 m deep soil contributed considerably to apple tree rwu fig 8 the contribution ranged from 52 to 19 from deep soil below 2 m fig 8a and 39 9 below 5 m fig 8b moreover deep soil water below 2 or 5 m showed higher contributions to rwu in normal years 2017 2018 than the wet year 2019 fig 8 this provided further evidence that deep soil water helps sustain stable rwu for apple trees in years with less precipitation 3 3 total rwu with orchard age during the growing season using eqs 2 5 orchards had greater aet than cropland especially for mid aged orchards during the growing season fig 9a2 b2 this indicated that afforestation increased the region et at the study site total rwu showed a bell shape with orchard age with the peak values in mature orchards a2005 and a2001 this was agreed with the lai distributions in orchards fig 9 compared to 2017 2018 higher precipitation in 2019 resulted into higher aet and thus higher rwu in all orchards 4 discussion 4 1 ruw patterns for apple trees compared with deep soil the shallow 0 2 m soil layer can be influenced more by the climate and tree water use they can be depleted by evaporation and transpiration and then replenished by subsequent precipitation events this is facilitated by the synchronous occurrence of high temperature and relatively frequent precipitation events in the monsoon climate as a result there is a high frequency of wet dry cycles in addition the monsoon climate is characterized mostly by small precipitation events interspersed with some large precipitation events the small precipitation events recharge topsoil layer e g 0 0 4 m and large precipitation events also recharge the remaining shallow soil layer 0 4 2 m or deeper this occurs in days or weeks creating shallow soil water contents that are frequently in a more plausible range for plants than that in deep soil because the shallow soil water is generally recharged by precipitation event water weeks ago apple trees rely on the current year precipitation regardless of their age the shallow 0 2 m soil layer as showed by mixsiar model contributed more than 60 of total water use by apple trees fig 8 this may be explained by plants tend to utilize shallow soil water due to its low transport cost rose et al 2000 moreover exchangeable oxygen and available soil water are concentrated in shallow soils schenk 2008 promoting rwu in these areas shallow soils are often unsaturated and therefore intercept and retain the majority of water and nutrients limiting their migration to deeper soils liu et al 2019a in addition to the increased difficulties in deep rwu as trees age and deep soil water depletes the elevated soil bulk density as depth increases could elevate the root penetration resistance of the soil lu et al 2019 this may further slow down deep root growth as depth increased and decrease the available deep soil water relative to roots in shallow soils thus deep soil water could not be the main water source for apple trees transpiration for extended periods of time rooting depth and potential depth of rwu progressively increased from 10 2 m in the young orchard to 23 2 m in the old orchard table 1 as a result a considerable amount 50 of the total fine root length was located in deep soils 2 m however not all deep roots are equal in absorbing water deep soil water uptake is dominated by those deep roots in wet deep soil not those in desiccated deep soil li et al 2018b in contrast deep soil with water depleted by trees is regularly replenished by precipitation in many humid areas oliveira et al 2005 rempe and dietrich 2018 allowing a greater proportion of deep roots to consistently participate in rwu 4 2 slow shift of rwu to shallow soil from deep soil although apple trees mainly relied on precipitation rwu estimates for apple trees in the current study did not show a shift for shallow soil water immediately after large precipitation fig 6 these apple trees experiencing long term low precipitation kept a continuous reliance on deep soil water in 2017 and gradually sourced more water from shallow soil water after large precipitation events in 2018 previous research on the semiarid loess area also found that jujube tree did not source more shallow soil water after large precipitation events huo et al 2018 which is in contrast to other research that trees used more shallow soil water in the wet season voltas et al 2015 yang et al 2015 some trees like quercus variabilis also needed more time to shift the water use pattern after precipitation liu et al 2019b long term drought may cause a less reversible embolism and reduced the water conductivity of the shallow root system grossiord et al 2017 this may indicate that some perennial woody trees need more time to reconstruct fine roots regrowth to extract water and shift their water source following long term changes in weather conditions 4 3 water imbalance and its potential impacts on tree water use our results showed that more deep soil water was absorbed with increasing orchard age to meet high evapotranspiration demand in orchards in the study region fig 9 thus deep soil water deficit kept increasing surprisingly the calculated orchard transpiration fig 9 seems not affected by the deep soil water deficit for a2008 to a2001 suggesting that the depletion of deep soil water did not limit orchard transpiration but served as an important water source to maintain high leaf areas and transpiration in mid aged orchards a2005 a2001 however in the old aged orchards the deep soil water mining depth is more than 20 m and available deep soil water becomes smaller and smaller due to more deletion than recharge li et al 2018b under this condition the orchard tree chose to reduce its leaf area index and the transpiration fig 9 which likely help to alleviate the deep soil water depletion and reduce the potential risk of drought induced hydraulic loss this is also common for other vegetation such as robinia pseudoacacia with a significant reduction of transpiration from 1 07 mm d 1 in 16 years old wu et al 2020 to 0 38 mm d 1 in 30 years zhang et al 2014 in a semi arid loess area the introduction of exotic vegetation on the chinese loess plateau results in excessive deep soil water reduction for example a multi year higher evapotranspiration than precipitation dried deep soil in california which may cause the widespread die off for california forest goulden and bales 2019 moreover the acclimation of plant hydraulic properties to long term drought was limited bittencourt et al 2020 thus the threat of deep soil drying on plant growth should be considered when evaluating the ecological value of afforestation on the chinese loess plateau further process based model indicated that robinia pseudoacacia plantations growing on the chinese loess plateau were more prone to a drought induced hydraulic conductance loss and mortality due to soil desiccation zhang et al 2020 more field work research is needed to evaluate the deep soil drying effect on the plant s hydraulic safety and the plant adjustment to the seasonal dryness on the chinese loess plateau 4 4 implications for economical tree management on the chinese loess plateau unlike herbaceous vegetation woody plants have much deeper root systems which is more effective in alleviating drought stress brunner et al 2015 paÃ§o et al 2009 however on the loess plateau the water demand of afforested trees is greater than annual precipitation forcing trees to extract deep soil water with little replenishment leading to widespread deep soil desiccation jia et al 2017 yan et al 2015 the current study showed that the consumed shallow soil water content could be recovered after precipitation however there was a considerable decrease in the soil water content of the root zone below 5 m depth apple trees on the clp appear to experience the effects of deep soil water depletion to a greater extent than other deep rooted tree systems for example large trees in arizona forests saw increased benefits from deep root networks this is because in addition to tap deep soil water for rwu deep roots also helped recharge shallow soil water through increased hydraulic lift dawson 1996 kerhoulas et al 2013 in contrast some deep rooted deciduous trees have been found to consistently extract large proportions of shallow soil water due in part to their relatively extensive horizontal root systems meinzer et al 1999 on the clp however the relatively high tree density and the limited precipitation in the region stimulated roots to extend to deep soils in order to fulfill their rwu requirements therefore by decreasing tree density apple trees on the clp may be able to change their rwu strategy by developing more extensive horizontal root networks this may increase their reliance on shallow rwu and ultimately improve the sustainability of deep soil water resources in addition previous studies showed that thinning can be an effective silvicultural method for increasing shallow soil water availability and reducing the risk of drought stress gebhardt et al 2014 laurent et al 2003 the depletion of deep soil water on the clp can negatively impact the growth and development of vegetation resulting in relatively small size for mature trees jiao et al 2010 therefore increases in shallow soil water will not only support soil water sustainability on the clp but will also enhance the productivity of deep rooted fruit orchards and improve food security considering that shallow soil water dominates rwu it would be beneficial to implement water saving practices such as fish scale pits rainwater collection and irrigation in order to reduce water loss and to improve shallow soil water replenishment and rwu li et al 2018c song et al 2018 drought and high temperature stresses are the two primary factors that trigger plant mortality allen et al 2010 anderegg et al 2012 and larger trees typically suffer more hydraulic stress bennett et al 2015 future climate change is predicted to create more extreme precipitation and temperature and thus intensify hydrological cycles donat et al 2016 this study indicates that apple trees on the chinese loess plateau could shift their water source between shallow or deep soil thus this exotic woody tree on the chinese loess plateau could be highly resilient to the changing environment but the effects of deep soil desiccation on tree physiological traits also need further consideration on the clp 5 conclusion large scale afforestation on the clp greatly contributes to global greening but the rwu pattern with soil desiccation evolution requires further evaluation for these woody trees this study suggests that the afforestation of apple trees on the clp significantly depleted soil water in deep strata exacerbating deep soil desiccation with tree age the resulting water shortage at root zone stimulates the fine roots to dig into deeper soil as much as more than 20 m thus deep soil below 5 m depth constitutes a steady source in orchard lifetime with an average contribution of 9 39 to orchard rwu moreover apple trees could shift their water use strategy and extracted more water from deep soil in less precipitation years this suggests that deep soil water is an indispensable water reserve for deep rooted apple tree in the water limited area the shift of rwu from deep soil to shallow soil water after large precipitation events is slow meaning once deep soil water is depleted the drought stress will not be alleviated right after a large precipitation event how to manage deep soil water is as important as managing shallow soil water and should be an important consideration in evaluating

10150,deep soil water is important for trees to combat droughts and thus is an important consideration for assessing sustainability of afforestation however the extent to which trees could depend on deep soil for root water uptake rwu remains poorly understood here we selected five apple orchards planted in 2008 2005 2001 1998 and 1994 named a2008 a2005 a2001 a1998 and a1994 respectively from the chinese loess plateau and measured water isotopes from tree xylem and soil to the depth up to 23 m we then used the bayesian mixing model mixsiar with dual isotopes 2h 18o to quantify the seasonal contribution ratio of each soil layer 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 m 2 5 m and 5 m to maximum rooting depth to rwu in normal years 2017 2018 and wet year 2019 results showed that with increasing orchard age rooting depth increased from 10 2 m to 23 2 m resulting in cumulative deep soil below 5 m water deficits from 74 5 mm in 9 year old orchard to 1191 8 mm in 25 year old orchard and annual deep soil water below 5 m contributed 9 39 to the total rwu over the orchard lifetime although fine roots in shallow 0 2 m soils in old orchards a1998 and a1994 only accounted for 20 of that in the entire profiles these roots contributed on average 64 of the total absorbed water in 2017 2019 relative to the normal year apple trees relied less on deep soil water in wet year our findings is of particular significance

2002 huang et al 2003 in the past decades a series of revegetation projects were conducted in china contributing 25 of the global greening during that period chen et al 2019 the green for green project which was implanted on the clp in 1999 is the largest of these projects although this project has made pronounced progress increasing vegetation coverage the revegetated trees have also altered the water cycle and disrupted the water balance that existed between soil and plants prior to revegetation feng et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 apple trees have been commonly used as an economical revegetation strategy where the conversion from cropland to apple orchards not only increase the income of local farmers but also reduces soil water erosion of the loess hills and existing gullies chen et al 2015 gao et al 2018a many studies have been conducted to assess the changes in soil water following afforestation jia et al 2017 wang et al 2011 yan et al 2015 notably recent studies li et al 2018a li et al 2019 revealed the connection between deep soil depletion and rooting depth and presented a conceptual model for the interaction between rooting depth and deep soil water depletion under limited precipitation 150 800 mm year 1 trees growing in a deep unsaturated zone develop root networks progressively deeper in order to access water in deeper soil however little focus has been placed on understanding how changes in deep soil water and rooting depth will impact rwu over the lifetime and over different precipitation years this is important for understanding how the soil water balance is affected by land use change and afforestation over the long term which is critical but poorly understood for assessing the sustainability of afforestation rwu patterns have been identified among various vegetation types wang et al 2019 wu et al 2016 as well as in mixed species settings where heterospecifics compete for water tang et al 2018 west et al 2007 previous studies with isotopes method found that plants may shift their rwu patterns under different precipitation conditions and the patterns can be species dependent liu et al 2019b nie et al 2019 however few rwu studies have included trees of varying ages located in a variety of different soil water conditions over a multi year scale rwu patterns have been assessed by measurements of water potential cook and o grady 2006 nehemy et al 2020 root distribution song et al 2020 and or chemical or isotopic tracers wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 water isotopes in particular have been widely used to trace the movement of water from the soil to the plant xylem rothfuss and javaux 2017 a critical assumption in the application of water stable isotopes 2h 18o is that no isotope fractionation occurs when plants transport water from the soil to the xylem this assumption has been convincingly verified recently with a variety of plants chen et al 2020 furthermore water isotopes can be used to quantify and partition rwu with respect to both space shallow soil deep soil groundwater etc evaristo and mcdonnell 2017 rossatto et al 2012 and time winter precipitation summer precipitation etc allen et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 relative to neutron probe method wang and wang 2018 wang et al 2015 the advantage of isotopes based method is that they can capture the seasonal water use pattern accurately associated with deep rooted plants although roots are commonly found at depths of more than 20 m on the clp li et al 2018a yan et al 2015 the depths of isotopic investigation of most studies are far less than the maximum rooting depth and are often as shallow as 3 m or less gao et al 2018b huo et al 2018 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2019 for example recent studies concerned with rwu on the loess plateau identified rooting depths of 2 m for jujube trees huo et al 2018 3 m for hippophae rhamnoides and spiraea pubescens wang et al 2019 and 5 m for robinia pseudoacacia zhao et al 2019 however the apple trees in this study have much greater rooting depths to the depth of 23 2 m in the old orchard li et al 2018b therefore in the case of apple trees shallow investigation depths will likely result in an incomplete understanding of the contributions of deep soil water to rwu furthermore as apple trees on the clp age their fine roots shift from an exponential distribution to a more uniform distribution with depth thus increasing the proportion of fine roots located in deep soils li et al 2018b whether fine root water uptake in deep soil influences rwu pattern remains unclear however a small quantity of rwu in each deep soil layer certainly has the potential to increase the amount of water available for transpiration the objective of this study is to quantify the extent to which afforested apple trees may rely on deep soil water for rwu with the increasing rooting depth in a water limited area a bayesian mixing model mixsiar coupled with dual isotopes was used to determine the seasonal rwu proportion and the contributions of shallow and deep soil water to the transpiration of apple trees of varying age under varying rooting depth and precipitation the results of this study are projected to improve our understanding of the water use and drought mitigation strategies of trees facing deep soil water deficits 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located on flat land with an average elevation of 1200 m a s l this land is located in the southeastern portion of the clp in changwu county shaanxi province 39 14 n 107 41 e fig 1 this region has a sub humid continental climate with a long term 1957 2015 mean annual temperature of 9 4 c the mean annual precipitation is 571 mm of which 55 occurs between july and september long term mean potential evapotranspiration has been estimated as 891 mm year 1 using the fao penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 of which 55 occurs from may to august the soils are predominantly silt loam textured with silt contents 0 05 0 002 mm particle diameter greater than 0 5 g g 1 soil in the tableland consists of aeolian loess deposits zhu et al 1983 and thus the horizontal variation in soil texture is minor the depth from the soil surface to the water table ranges from 50 to 80 m farmlands and apple orchards are the two main land use types in the study area these apple orchards being in different stand ages provide an opportunity to use space for time substitution to analyze the changes in rwu over the orchard lifetime pickett 1989 the blooming period of the apple trees is around mid april the swelling period is from july to august and the fruit maturing period is in october through a survey conducted with local farmers apple trees are known to bear fruit at around 4 5 years have high yield at around 13 18 years and rarely survive more than 30 years 2 2 sampling and analysis five representative apple orchards malus pumila mill with similar fertilization and pruning pattern were selected in 2017 these apple orchards were planted on previous cropland in 2008 2005 2001 1998 and 1994 named a2008 a2005 a2001 a1998 and a1994 samples were taken from 2017 to 2019 which represented the orchard ages from 9 to 25 years old the mean tree height trunk diameter and sampling dates were shown in table 1 in each orchard an in situ neutron probe cnc 503dr chaoneng china was used to determine deep soil water content using the standard method as provided in chanasyk and naeth 1996 the probe was calibrated using the oven drying method the maximum depth of water content investigation was 19 m for all the selected apple orchards table 1 on a clear and sunny day during the growing season from 2017 to 2019 soil and plant materials were collected for analysis table 1 on every sampling date one soil core was collected in 20 cm intervals to a depth of 6 m where each core was surrounded by four apple trees approximately equidistantly spaced from the coring location the collected soil was partitioned into two parts where one portion was used to determine the soil water content and the remainder placed in a polyethylene bottle sealed with parafilm and stored at 20 Âºc the soil water content was determined gravimetrically following the oven drying method the gravimetric water content was then transformed into volumetric water content using the soil bulk density values obtained by li et al 2019 in addition to soils tree tissue samples were collected from the surrounding four trees at each soil sampling location four one year old tree branch samples were collected from each of the four apple trees at midday the bark and phloem were removed and the branches were placed in glass bottles which were then wrapped with parafilm and stored at 20 Âºc until analysis information about the rooting distributions in five apple orchards in table 1 including the rooting depth and root length density was provided by measurements performed by li et al 2018b on the same tree stands in 2016 root parameters of the five apple trees in 2017 were processed with linear interpolation based on adjacent tree age using the data from li et al 2018b and the transformed root length density fraction with profile depth in 2017 was shown in fig s1 besides soil cores from 30 years old apple orchards and adjacent cropland were sampled to determine the water extraction limit for apple trees and the initial deep soil water content prior to afforestation respectively furthermore before 2017 soil cores had been collected from each of the study orchards to the maximum rooting depth in order to determine the isotope Î´2h and Î´18o values within the root zone at that time incident precipitation at the sites was gathered using a custom made collector which consisted of a funnel inserted and sealed into a cylindrical collection reservoir with a standard plastic ping pong ball placed loosely atop the opening of the funnel during rain events water builds up in the funnel causing the plastic ball to float and allow water to enter the reservoir whereas between rain events the plastic ball sits tight against the funnel opening preventing debris from entering the reservoir and minimizing evaporated water from exiting upon removal from the collectors rainwater was stored at 4 Âºc until analysis water isotopes Î´2h and Î´18o values of collected precipitation soil water and plant xylem water were determined to obtain the water contained in soil and plant xylem the samples were extracted using a li 2000 cryogenic vacuum distillation system lica china following the procedure in voltas et al 2015 soil and precipitation water isotopes values were measured with an iwa 45ep off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy oa icos water isotope analyzer lgr los gatos research usa where the measurement accuracies for Î´2h and Î´18o are 1 and 0 2 respectively however the co extraction of organic molecules is common during xylem water extraction leading to errors in Î´2h and Î´18o measurements using oa icos leen et al 2012 to avoid measurement errors from co extracted organics the xylem water isotopes values were determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms with an isoprime 100 isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime ltd uk where the measurement accuracies of Î´2h and Î´18o are 2 and 0 3 respectively there is no significant difference in the results obtained with the lgr and irms when measuring pure water the Î´2h and Î´18o values of measured water samples were determined using the following 1 Î´ r sample r stand r stand 1000 where r sample and r stand are the ratios of 2h 1h or 18o 16o in the sample and reference standard water respectively vienna standard means ocean water vsmow was used as the reference standard for this study 2 3 calculation of actual evapotranspiration transpiration and evaporation the actual root water uptake at each sampling date was calculated using the following method we derived the actual evapotranspiration aet mm in a year by the soil water balance method 2 s p aet d r where Î´s mm was calculated soil water storage difference using the measured soil water with a neutron probe to the maximum rooting depth p is the annual precipitation mm d is the deep drainage rate below the root zone mm which is obtained based on the equation developed at the same site for different rooting depth by li et al 2018a r is surface runoff which can be ignored as the study site is in a flat land daily aet aet d mm was obtained by multiplying the yearly aet by the proportion of daily potential evapotranspiration rate pet d to yearly potential evapotranspiration pet because of a well relationship between aet d and pet d wang and wang 2017 3 aet d aet pet d pet leaf area index lai in each orchard in the sampling date was measured with lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor inc usa then the actual daily evaporation e d and transpiration t d at a sampling date were obtained via daily aet d lai and beer s law ritchie 1972 and 4 e d aet d exp k lai 5 t d aet d 1 exp k lai 2 4 parameter settings in mixsiar graphical user interface groundwater in the study area is far deeper than the maximum rooting depth of the apple trees thus the soil water in the unsaturated zone is considered the only water source for rwu to determine the relative contribution of different soil layers to the apple tree rwu an r script of the bayesian model framework mixsiar stock and semmens 2013 was used to estimate the posterior distribution of each soil layer contribution soil water content and isotope variations were affected by the upper boundary precipitation and evaporation and the intensity of such impact generally decreased with increasing soil depth in this context we partitioned the root zone soil into four layers 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 m 2 5 m and 5 m to the maximum rooting depth 5 m based on the soil water content isotopes values Î´2h Î´18o variations figs s2 and s3b soil water contents and isotope values were distinctly affected by seasonal trends in precipitation and evaporation for the surface 0 0 4 m soil layers they experienced relatively little change for the 0 4 2 m soil layers and were mainly affected by large precipitation for the 2 5 m soil layers and were hardly influenced by the precipitation for soil layer deeper than 5 m the trophic discrimination factor tdf and concentration dependence between the source and mixture were set to 0 as no isotope fractionation occurred in the water during its movement from the soil to the plant xylem the run length was set to be very long and the error structure was set to be resid process the mixsiar framework adopted in this study used the gelman rubin and geweke diagnostics to check the convergence of the model using these parameters mixsiar was used to determine the contribution ratio of each soil water source to the xylem water composition in addition sourcing plant water using water isotopes is notoriously an ill posed problem and additional information such as root distribution and soil water content helps define the problem as is well known plant water uptake from a layer depends on both the root length density and the available soil water content in that layer therefore it is plausible to use the product of available water content and root length density in a layer as the prior information the available water content can be calculated as the difference between the actual measured soil water content of the layer and the extraction limited water content of that layer here we defined the extraction limit as the soil water content below which the water in that layer was no longer be accessible by orchard roots in this study the soil water content profile of the 30 years old apple orchard was used to determine the extraction limit fig 2b firstly the lowest water content from 5 to 10 m depth in the 30 years old orchard 0 16 m3 m 3 was set as the extraction limit for all soils within the 0 5 m soil depth in the study orchards this seems reasonable when considering the relatively uniform soil bulk density and texture within the top 10 m of the profile fig 2a secondly field soil profile water samplings at the study site also showed that there was little change in deep soil water content 5 m in depth for old orchards fig s3a therefore the deep soil water content of a 30 year old apple tree should reach the extraction limit thus the available soil water in each soil depth i asw i m 3 m 3 within the rooting zone of apple tree can be expressed as 6 asw i Î¸ a i 0 16 i 5 m Î¸ a i Î¸ 30 yrs i i 5 m where Î¸ a i is the real measured soil water content in the soil depth i in the apple orchard Î¸ 30 yrs i is the measured soil water content in the depth i in 30 years apple orchard then the available soil water storage asws mm from soil depth d 1 m to d 2 m can be expressed as 7 asws d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 asw i 1000 dz 2 5 data analysis several assumptions were made when using mixsiar to determine seasonal rwu deep soil water contents below 5 m were measured with the neutron probe technique and the soil water isotopes Î´2h Î´18o below 5 m were assumed to be unchanged because the seasonal precipitation rarely penetrates past this depth and the root water uptake processes can hardly alter soil water isotopes values in deep soil besides the fine roots distributions in each apple orchard were assumed to be unchanged from 2017 to 2019 for each apple orchard the accumulated deep soil water storage deficit Î´ s mm below a depth of 5 m was defined as the cumulative water storage difference in the orchard and the adjacent cropland 8 s 5 z Î¸ c i Î¸ a i 1000 dz where z is the rooting depth m in apple orchard and where Î¸ c i and Î¸ a i are soil water content m3 m 3 in cropland and apple orchard in each soil depth i in order to compare average contribution ratio from a soil layer between different years we first calculated the water uptake amount rwu at each sampling date in a year then the average contribution of a layer to rwu in a year was the ratio of sum of daily water uptake from a layer to the sum of daily actual uptake from the whole profile in that year suppose the water contribution from a layer i at date j obtained from mixsiar was x i j then the water uptake from a layer i at date j rwu i j was 9 rwu i j x i j t d j then the average ravg and standard deviation std of daily contribution of layer i to the daily actual t d in a year were 10 ravg i j 1 n rwu i j j 1 n t d j j 1 n x i j t d j j 1 n t d j 11 std i j 1 n x i j t d j ravg i 2 n j 1 n t d j 2 where n was the number of sampling dates in a year 3 results 3 1 water isotope characteristics of precipitation soil water and xylem water precipitation in 2017 2018 and 2019 during the growing season from april to october were 496 0 mm 541 0 mm and 734 9 mm respectively fig 3a c this indicated a wet year in 2019 and normal years in 2017 and 2018 based on the long term historical average value 514 5 mm the isotopic compositions of precipitation events varied greatly during the growing season with Î´2h ranged from 69 3 to 137 8 and Î´18o from 16 6 to 19 1 fig 3a c generally precipitations were enriched in large water isotopes from may to june and were depleted from september to october the local meteoric water line lmwl from the measured Î´2h and Î´18o of incident precipitation from 2017 2019 was fitted as Î´2h 6 98Î´18o 2 34 r2 0 94 n 140 fig 4 the slope and intercept of the lmwl were smaller than that of the global meteoric water line gmwl Î´2h 8Î´18o 10 craig 1961 indicating that the rainfall experienced secondary evaporation during the precipitation event water isotope values in plant xylem fluctuated dramatically throughout the growing seasons and varied depending on the antecedent precipitation isotope values fig 3d f plant xylem water isotope values were more depleted after large precipitation events in september 2017 and july 2018 this is because the larger precipitation events in the study site was always characterized by depleted isotope values fig 3a c in 2019 the strong variation of the water isotopes values of precipitation events created a wide range of isotope values in plants xylem for example the extremely enriched isotope values at the end of may created much enriched water isotope values in plants xylem in june fig 3f the oldest orchard a1994 had closest water isotopic composition to antecedent precipitation events relative to a young orchard fig 3d f the isotope values in plant xylem showed more depleted values in september 2017 and july 2018 after the large lighter precipitation events but more enriched values in xylem in may to july 2019 after large heavy precipitation events fig 3d f moreover the average Î´2h and Î´18o in plants xylem in 2019 were 50 2 and 6 1 respectively which were greater than that of 2017 and 2018 65 4 for Î´2h and 8 0 for Î´18o fig 3d f suggesting a more enriched or shallower soil water source for orchard a1994 soil water isotopes in the 0 0 4 m layer displayed a wide range of values throughout the study season as the surface soil water is readily affected by precipitation they were also more enriched because of evaporation occurring at the surface fig 4 in most cases water isotopes in shallow soils were more enriched suggesting more intense evaporation and fractionation there exceptions to the general trend were observed in september 2017 july august 2018 and september 2019 when large and depleted precipitation events caused depleted values in the shallow soil layer fig 2 fig 5 in contrast water isotopes in the deep soil layers below 2 m showed smaller variations and the values were more depleted relative to shallow layers fig 4 all apple orchards showed similar trends in vertical soil water isotope distributions where Î´2h and Î´18o values generally decreased with depth fig 5 on a dual isotope plot Î´2h vs Î´18o soil and xylem waters generally plot to the right of the lmwl indicating that the source water precipitation experienced an evaporation fractionation in the soil resulting in fractionated soil and xylem water isotope values fig 4 according to the water mixing theory rothfuss and javaux 2017 the depth at which soil water and xylem water isotope values intersect represents the mean depth of rwu in the current study most intersection depths were shallower in 2019 than in 2017 and 2018 fig 5 indicating shallower soil water sources for apple trees in 2019 3 2 seasonal variations of available soil water storage asws and the estimated rwu with mixsiar using eqs 2 and 3 we determined the asws in the soil layers 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 m 2 5 m and 5 m to the maximum rooting depth in each orchard fig 6 a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 the asws in the soil layer was mainly affected by antecedent precipitation and the tree age in 2017 asws in 0 2 m soil layer showed low values in july because of less antecedent precipitation 50 mm one month before the sampling date and high values in september because of antecedent large precipitation recharge in august 149 mm in 2018 asws in 0 2 m showed higher values in july after antecedent large precipitation 200 mm and then reduced afterward in 2019 asws in 0 2 m kept relatively stable values during may to august with a uniform precipitation recharge and higher values on sept 25 because of antecedent large precipitation recharge in september 150 mm for the 2 5 m soil layer large precipitation in 2018 and 2019 created higher asws values than in 2017 for deep soil layer below 5 m the asws values kept decreasing trends following sampling dates except young orchard a2008 and older orchard a1994 older orchards had lower deep soil water contents below 2 m especially below 5 m fig 7a with an exception that a1994 showed a soil water recovery for the soil layer 2 5 m compared to the adjacent cropland deep soil water deficit below 5 m increased from 74 5 mm in 9 year old orchard to 1191 8 mm in 25 year old orchard fig 7b the rwu from the four layers by apple trees were determined using the mixsiar model with dual isotopes fig 6 a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 there was no obvious relationship between rwu pattern and shallow soil water contents for example apple trees did not increase the contributions of shallow 0 2 m soil layer in wet sampling periods such as sept 13 2017 or july 20 2018 or higher reliance on deep soil water below 2 or 5 m on low precipitation periods such as aug 11 2018 or aug 16 2109 there seemed that apple trees did not shift their water use pattern immediately after precipitation supply or reduction for all orchards in 2017 the low precipitation from may to july resulted in an increasing rwu proportion from the deep soil layer below 2 m or 5 m even after the surface soil recharged by a high precipitation in september apple trees still used more deep soil water conversely in 2018 apple trees gradually increased or kept stable rwu proportions from shallow 0 2 m soil layer despite of the large precipitation in july 200 mm in contrast 2019 had a relatively uniform precipitation distribution over the growing season and orchard trees kept both stable and low rwu proportions from the deeper soil layer below 5 m deep soil contributed considerably to apple tree rwu fig 8 the contribution ranged from 52 to 19 from deep soil below 2 m fig 8a and 39 9 below 5 m fig 8b moreover deep soil water below 2 or 5 m showed higher contributions to rwu in normal years 2017 2018 than the wet year 2019 fig 8 this provided further evidence that deep soil water helps sustain stable rwu for apple trees in years with less precipitation 3 3 total rwu with orchard age during the growing season using eqs 2 5 orchards had greater aet than cropland especially for mid aged orchards during the growing season fig 9a2 b2 this indicated that afforestation increased the region et at the study site total rwu showed a bell shape with orchard age with the peak values in mature orchards a2005 and a2001 this was agreed with the lai distributions in orchards fig 9 compared to 2017 2018 higher precipitation in 2019 resulted into higher aet and thus higher rwu in all orchards 4 discussion 4 1 ruw patterns for apple trees compared with deep soil the shallow 0 2 m soil layer can be influenced more by the climate and tree water use they can be depleted by evaporation and transpiration and then replenished by subsequent precipitation events this is facilitated by the synchronous occurrence of high temperature and relatively frequent precipitation events in the monsoon climate as a result there is a high frequency of wet dry cycles in addition the monsoon climate is characterized mostly by small precipitation events interspersed with some large precipitation events the small precipitation events recharge topsoil layer e g 0 0 4 m and large precipitation events also recharge the remaining shallow soil layer 0 4 2 m or deeper this occurs in days or weeks creating shallow soil water contents that are frequently in a more plausible range for plants than that in deep soil because the shallow soil water is generally recharged by precipitation event water weeks ago apple trees rely on the current year precipitation regardless of their age the shallow 0 2 m soil layer as showed by mixsiar model contributed more than 60 of total water use by apple trees fig 8 this may be explained by plants tend to utilize shallow soil water due to its low transport cost rose et al 2000 moreover exchangeable oxygen and available soil water are concentrated in shallow soils schenk 2008 promoting rwu in these areas shallow soils are often unsaturated and therefore intercept and retain the majority of water and nutrients limiting their migration to deeper soils liu et al 2019a in addition to the increased difficulties in deep rwu as trees age and deep soil water depletes the elevated soil bulk density as depth increases could elevate the root penetration resistance of the soil lu et al 2019 this may further slow down deep root growth as depth increased and decrease the available deep soil water relative to roots in shallow soils thus deep soil water could not be the main water source for apple trees transpiration for extended periods of time rooting depth and potential depth of rwu progressively increased from 10 2 m in the young orchard to 23 2 m in the old orchard table 1 as a result a considerable amount 50 of the total fine root length was located in deep soils 2 m however not all deep roots are equal in absorbing water deep soil water uptake is dominated by those deep roots in wet deep soil not those in desiccated deep soil li et al 2018b in contrast deep soil with water depleted by trees is regularly replenished by precipitation in many humid areas oliveira et al 2005 rempe and dietrich 2018 allowing a greater proportion of deep roots to consistently participate in rwu 4 2 slow shift of rwu to shallow soil from deep soil although apple trees mainly relied on precipitation rwu estimates for apple trees in the current study did not show a shift for shallow soil water immediately after large precipitation fig 6 these apple trees experiencing long term low precipitation kept a continuous reliance on deep soil water in 2017 and gradually sourced more water from shallow soil water after large precipitation events in 2018 previous research on the semiarid loess area also found that jujube tree did not source more shallow soil water after large precipitation events huo et al 2018 which is in contrast to other research that trees used more shallow soil water in the wet season voltas et al 2015 yang et al 2015 some trees like quercus variabilis also needed more time to shift the water use pattern after precipitation liu et al 2019b long term drought may cause a less reversible embolism and reduced the water conductivity of the shallow root system grossiord et al 2017 this may indicate that some perennial woody trees need more time to reconstruct fine roots regrowth to extract water and shift their water source following long term changes in weather conditions 4 3 water imbalance and its potential impacts on tree water use our results showed that more deep soil water was absorbed with increasing orchard age to meet high evapotranspiration demand in orchards in the study region fig 9 thus deep soil water deficit kept increasing surprisingly the calculated orchard transpiration fig 9 seems not affected by the deep soil water deficit for a2008 to a2001 suggesting that the depletion of deep soil water did not limit orchard transpiration but served as an important water source to maintain high leaf areas and transpiration in mid aged orchards a2005 a2001 however in the old aged orchards the deep soil water mining depth is more than 20 m and available deep soil water becomes smaller and smaller due to more deletion than recharge li et al 2018b under this condition the orchard tree chose to reduce its leaf area index and the transpiration fig 9 which likely help to alleviate the deep soil water depletion and reduce the potential risk of drought induced hydraulic loss this is also common for other vegetation such as robinia pseudoacacia with a significant reduction of transpiration from 1 07 mm d 1 in 16 years old wu et al 2020 to 0 38 mm d 1 in 30 years zhang et al 2014 in a semi arid loess area the introduction of exotic vegetation on the chinese loess plateau results in excessive deep soil water reduction for example a multi year higher evapotranspiration than precipitation dried deep soil in california which may cause the widespread die off for california forest goulden and bales 2019 moreover the acclimation of plant hydraulic properties to long term drought was limited bittencourt et al 2020 thus the threat of deep soil drying on plant growth should be considered when evaluating the ecological value of afforestation on the chinese loess plateau further process based model indicated that robinia pseudoacacia plantations growing on the chinese loess plateau were more prone to a drought induced hydraulic conductance loss and mortality due to soil desiccation zhang et al 2020 more field work research is needed to evaluate the deep soil drying effect on the plant s hydraulic safety and the plant adjustment to the seasonal dryness on the chinese loess plateau 4 4 implications for economical tree management on the chinese loess plateau unlike herbaceous vegetation woody plants have much deeper root systems which is more effective in alleviating drought stress brunner et al 2015 paÃ§o et al 2009 however on the loess plateau the water demand of afforested trees is greater than annual precipitation forcing trees to extract deep soil water with little replenishment leading to widespread deep soil desiccation jia et al 2017 yan et al 2015 the current study showed that the consumed shallow soil water content could be recovered after precipitation however there was a considerable decrease in the soil water content of the root zone below 5 m depth apple trees on the clp appear to experience the effects of deep soil water depletion to a greater extent than other deep rooted tree systems for example large trees in arizona forests saw increased benefits from deep root networks this is because in addition to tap deep soil water for rwu deep roots also helped recharge shallow soil water through increased hydraulic lift dawson 1996 kerhoulas et al 2013 in contrast some deep rooted deciduous trees have been found to consistently extract large proportions of shallow soil water due in part to their relatively extensive horizontal root systems meinzer et al 1999 on the clp however the relatively high tree density and the limited precipitation in the region stimulated roots to extend to deep soils in order to fulfill their rwu requirements therefore by decreasing tree density apple trees on the clp may be able to change their rwu strategy by developing more extensive horizontal root networks this may increase their reliance on shallow rwu and ultimately improve the sustainability of deep soil water resources in addition previous studies showed that thinning can be an effective silvicultural method for increasing shallow soil water availability and reducing the risk of drought stress gebhardt et al 2014 laurent et al 2003 the depletion of deep soil water on the clp can negatively impact the growth and development of vegetation resulting in relatively small size for mature trees jiao et al 2010 therefore increases in shallow soil water will not only support soil water sustainability on the clp but will also enhance the productivity of deep rooted fruit orchards and improve food security considering that shallow soil water dominates rwu it would be beneficial to implement water saving practices such as fish scale pits rainwater collection and irrigation in order to reduce water loss and to improve shallow soil water replenishment and rwu li et al 2018c song et al 2018 drought and high temperature stresses are the two primary factors that trigger plant mortality allen et al 2010 anderegg et al 2012 and larger trees typically suffer more hydraulic stress bennett et al 2015 future climate change is predicted to create more extreme precipitation and temperature and thus intensify hydrological cycles donat et al 2016 this study indicates that apple trees on the chinese loess plateau could shift their water source between shallow or deep soil thus this exotic woody tree on the chinese loess plateau could be highly resilient to the changing environment but the effects of deep soil desiccation on tree physiological traits also need further consideration on the clp 5 conclusion large scale afforestation on the clp greatly contributes to global greening but the rwu pattern with soil desiccation evolution requires further evaluation for these woody trees this study suggests that the afforestation of apple trees on the clp significantly depleted soil water in deep strata exacerbating deep soil desiccation with tree age the resulting water shortage at root zone stimulates the fine roots to dig into deeper soil as much as more than 20 m thus deep soil below 5 m depth constitutes a steady source in orchard lifetime with an average contribution of 9 39 to orchard rwu moreover apple trees could shift their water use strategy and extracted more water from deep soil in less precipitation years this suggests that deep soil water is an indispensable water reserve for deep rooted apple tree in the water limited area the shift of rwu from deep soil to shallow soil water after large precipitation events is slow meaning once deep soil water is depleted the drought stress will not be alleviated right after a large precipitation event how to manage deep soil water is as important as managing shallow soil water and should be an important consideration in evaluating

10151,the contraindications of summer maize production water resource shortages and soil surface layer structural deterioration in the north china plain ncp have become increasingly prominent subsoiling has been widely studied as a key tillage conservation technique the objective of this experiment is to continue characterization of soil moisture dynamics soil water consumption and drainage under different tillage management in the present study two subsoiling depths 35 cm s35 r15 and 40 cm s40 r15 were examined and rotary tillage at 15 cm r15 was used as the control the volume moisture content of field soil was determined by time domain reflectometry the amount of water stored in the soil is calculated by the soil volumetric moisture content in the 0 130 cm soil profile cumulated the amount of water stored in the soil at sowing and harvest time was used to calculate et using the equation of water balance the field experiment results were combined with the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 to calibrate and verify rzwqm2 using experimental data for summer maize in the growth period from 2017 to 2019 the results of the field trials showed that the soil water content swc and evapotranspiration et were increased by subsoiling compared to that by r15 rzwqm2 showed promising applicability in this scenario and successfully simulated the soil water dynamics caused by rainfall distribution during the years of treatment by r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 the normalized root mean squared errors nrmse for soil water storage sws and et were 11 31 19 65 and 11 99 16 57 respectively the corrected model was used to supplement the calculations of actual transpiration at actual evaporation ae and water drainage according to the calculations of the model s35 r15 and s40 r15 treatments could effectively reduce the actual evaporation in the early growth period and maintain high transpiration in the middle and late growth periods however s40 r15 treatment also resulted in a higher water drainage rate and greater cumulative water drainage in terms of soil moisture dynamics our findings suggest 35 cm to be the optimal depth for subsoiling in the ncp

that issues related to food security such as the quality of cultivated land and limitations in agricultural water are increasing modern farm operations are becoming more intensive and mechanized and traditional tillage methods such as continuous rotary tillage and repeated rolling by heavy agricultural machinery may not cause significant negative effects on tillage in the short term however under long term cultivation the disadvantages of shallow surface soil gradually become apparent wang et al 2019 at present the surface soil in the ncp is only 16 5 cm thick zhang and li 2010 scraping and compaction due to plowing reduces water infiltration into the soil detrimentally affecting grain production sang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a subsoiling has attracted extensive attention in recent years because it is conducive to a healthier plowed layer of soil and can improve crop water use efficiency schneider et al 2017 researchers compared tillage conservation measures e g no tillage less tillage and subsoiling in the ncp and found that subsoiling could effectively break down the barrier created by the bottom of the plow and could concurrently improve the surface soil layer reducing

period lampurlanÃ©s et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the amount of water drainage is often ignored in these calculations but under heavy rainfall occurring over short periods during the summer water drainage is inevitable few previous studies have estimated water drainage at different depths of subsoiling analysis of crop water consumption through the measurement of transpiration and soil evaporation is relatively inefficient and the development of novel metrics is important for understanding water use in farmlands ma et al 2020 agricultural models are promising tools for water

swc et and grain yield under varying irrigation conditions dokoohaki et al 2016 saseendran et al 2014 improved the simulation of water stress factors in related processes making rzwqm2 more advantageous in the dynamic simulation of water in agricultural systems previous studies have confirmed that rzwqm2 simulates pesticide migration malone et al 2003 malone et al 2014 nitrogen

the majority of use cases the extended shuttleworth wallace model is incorporated when computing et improving the simulation performance and accuracy of rzwqm2 compared to that of other models bassu et al 2014 anapalli et al 2016 used a large weighing lysimeters to measure the daily et and verified the accuracy of the simulation results of et in rzwqm2 however such large and precise instruments are expensive and uncommon and measurements at large spatial and temporal scales are difficult to perform han et al 2014 the combined model is a powerful and comparatively inexpensive computational tool for analyzing specific soil and crop conditions in different regions therefore it is considered a promising research method with the potential to further define the process of farmland water consumption through modeling ding et al 2020 investigated winter wheat farmland under several different tillage conditions as a research object to simulate and predict soil water dynamics runoff and water drainage however studies utilizing different depths of subsoiling have not been reported based on current rainfall distribution data and the tenuous availability of irrigation water in the ncp the present cropping system consists of wheat maize continuous cropping irrigation can be avoided during the growth period of summer maize fang et al 2010b rzwqm2 has not been broadly applied in non irrigated systems to diversify the field test results rzwqm2 was calibrated to simulate the influence of different subsoiling depths on the dynamics of soil moisture in summer maize fields in the ncp under the rainfed agriculture scheme clarifying the effects of two subsoiling depths on evaporation and water drainage of farmland compared to those of rotary tillage could indicate the more suitable depth for subsoiling thus in the present study we sought to 1 calibrate rzwqm2 under the rainfed agriculture mode and test the simulated performance of soil water transport in summer maize fields under rotary tillage and subsoiling treatments and 2 determine the degree to which the model can expand and enhance the experimental results clarify the farmland water consumption between different tillage practices and provide theoretical guidance for determining the optimal subsoiling depth in the ncp resolving these questions could improve the applicability of rzwqm2 for summer maize in the

urea dosage was 280 kg ha 1 of which the effective n content was 46 6 an equivalent quantity of urea was applied at the jointing stage summer maize was planted in rows spaced 60 cm apart with plant spacing of 22 5 cm resulting in plant density of 7 5 104 plants ha 1 in the three year experiment summer maize was sown on june 9 2017 june 13 2018 and june 15 2019 and harvested on october 5 2017

test results the model updated to version 4 0 was used in the present study ma et al 2008 2 5 model calibration and validation there are many parameters that affect the simulated effects and performance of the model and therefore it is necessary to rate and evaluate the parameters appropriately s35 r15 treatment was used as the model for parameter calibration and the field test data for r15 and s40 r15 were used for model parameter verification during the calibration of the model data including swc 10 cm as a soil layer et and grain yield can be input the soil mechanical composition

conductivity wilting coefficient and field water holding rate table 1 the crop variety parameters were manually adjusted to optimize the phenological period yield and other growth indicators for the simulation the calibrated crop variety parameter values are shown in table 2 the reliability of the parameters and the applicability of the model were determined by the simulation results under equivalent parameters to the field trial calibration verification of nitrogen was not included in this study 2 6 model performance criteria and calculations several different model performance evaluation indicators were utilized in the current study legates and mccabe 1999 evaluation of the simulation and experimental results involved evaluation indexes such as root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 normalized rmse nrmse was concurrently applied to evaluate the calculation effect and fitting degree of the models for swc sws and et the nrmse was expressed as the ratio between the rmse and average of the observed data the model simulations were considered excellent good fair and poor based on the nrmse values of 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 respectively which were

validation results 3 1 1 soil water content fig 2 shows the change in swc for each soil layer during the summer maize growing seasons from 2017 to 2019 using a contour map for the different periods the swc for each soil profile adheres to s40 r15 s35 r15 r15 this pattern is increasingly noticeable at greater soil depths in the 25 50 days after sowing das in 2018 the swc in the 20 80 cm soil layer under r15 treatment was deficient average swc was only 14 57 compared to that under subsoiling treatments average swc values for s35 r15 and s40 r15 were 16 21 and 17 32 respectively the average swc values for r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 in the 0 30 cm soil layer in the summer maize growing season of 2019 were 17 06 17 16 and 17 31 respectively the average swc values in the 30 100 cm soil layer for these treatments were 18 72 19 44 and 20 64 respectively during the 70 105 days following sowing the swc of the surface soil 0 15 cm was only about 8 but s35 r15 and s40 r15 treatments yielded superior water conditions in deep soil a characteristic conducive to crop growth in previous studies subsoiling was shown to reduce soil bulk density in the shallow soil layer tao et al 2015 and increase soil pore connectivity zhang et al 2017 subsoiling provides a macropore preferred flow path for rainfall or irrigation water allowing the water to infiltrate the soil rapidly and increasing soil moisture in the field wu et al 2009 studies have shown that subsoiling can facilitate downward growth of crop roots leading to more developed root distribution in the deep soil layer cai et al 2014 this increased root distribution can also cause root preferential flow of water jiang et al 2018 further enhancing higher swc in the deeper soil layers these findings are consistent with the observed soil moisture data in this study 3 1 2 simulation of soil water content and soil water storage fig 3 shows the comparison between the sws of the 0 130 cm soil layer and the value predicted by the model under different treatments in this study soil moisture data for s35 r15 was used in the model and soil moisture data for r15 and s40 r15 were used to verify the model the simulation encompassed the 2017 2019 summer maize growing seasons and the numbers of measured values were n2017 10 n2018 14 and n2019 14 for 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively to calibrate the model for s35 r15 treatment although the simulated value of sws in the summer maize growing season of 2017 was slightly lower the simulated value overall corresponded to the measured value rmse 3 25 cm r2 0 72 nrmse 11 65 the simulated results of the model validation were consistent with the calibrated results and the nrmse values all increased to different degrees 13 09 and 11 31 for treatments r15 and s40 r15 respectively as shown in fig 3 the simulated values better reflected the trend of the measured values and the model better reflected the fluctuation of sws under different treatments caused by annual precipitation the model prediction results obtained in this study are similar to the simulation results obtained by yu et al 2006 the simulated effect of swc in different soil layers is shown in table 3 the simulated results of the model for the 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm soil layers were markedly superior to those of the other two layers 0 30 cm and 90 130 cm the rmse values of swc treated by r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 were 0 031 0 058 0 028 0 048 and 0 028 0 060 cm3 cm 3 respectively most nrmse values were less than 20 jiang et al 2016 also simulated the swc in different soil layers and the rmse values obtained were similar to those of the present study compared with the surface soil rzwqm2 model has a better simulation effect on swc in the deeper soil layer and the error is also relatively smaller similarly in this simulation the simulated result of swc for the 0 30 cm soil layer produced a large error as compared to the other layers and the simulated effect of swc gradually improved with the increase of soil depth this is largely due to the spatial difference of soil surface structure which leads to deviation in simulation results fang et al 2009 a study on the correlation between soil hydraulic parameters and swc simulation indicated that extending the water content range between 0 33 bar and 15 bar was an effective method to improve the simulation performance of swc shahadha et al 2019 3 2 calculation of actual evaporation and transpiration table 4 shows the simulated calculation of ae at and actual evapotranspiration aet by rzwqm2 for summer maize during the growth period it is generally believed that yield formation is closely related to the at of crops ae is typically considered to have no contribution to yield formation and reductions in ae are therefore an important water saving measure ma et al 2020 the model calculation shows that ae accounts for 30 40 of farmland aet in the early growth stage sowing july 31 for example in 2017 ae aet of r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 were 39 011 32 911 and 33 587 respectively in the middle and late growth periods of summer maize ae aet decreased to 10 20 in the fertility period for all three years the performance was ranked r15 s35 r15 s40 r15 this result indicates that subsoiling during early growth can help the soil to retain water and reduce soil water loss wang et al 2012 concluded that subsoiling reduced soil evaporation in the early growth stage of crops a finding consistent with the law calculated by the model during the growth period the at of summer maize dominated the field aet accounting for approximately 80 after the crop reached the flowering stage xu et al 2017 measured photosynthetic rates and found that subsoiling promoted photosynthesis and improved the transpiration rate of crops this finding was also consistent with the results of the model simulation in august 2018 ae performance was ranked r15 s40 r15 s35 r15 however at performed as s35 r15 s40 r15 r15 the at of s35 r15 was 16 43 and 15 20 greater than that of r15 and s40 r15 respectively similarly from september 1 to maturity in 2019 s35 r15 treatment improved 20 25 and 15 70 over that of r15 and s40 r15 respectively studies have indicated that the crop canopy intercepts a large amount of light radiation necessary for transpiration more reasonable simulations of leaf area index dynamics will be of considerable significance for optimizing simulation models of transpiration shan et al 2020 in the three time periods divided by table 4 ae aet maintained a high proportion in the early stage and a low proportion in the middle and late stage while at aet presented an opposite trend in early reproductive years from 2017 to 2019 ae values treated with r15 were on average 14 71 and 14 91 higher than those of s35 r15 and s40 r15 this shows that r15 produced more inter plant evaporation at the early stage of canopy development and increased ineffective water consumption with the advancement of the growth period the at values and ae aet values of the two subsoiling treatments were higher compared with r15 the s35 r15 appears to be superior to the s40 r15 in the two subsoiling treatments of different depths in other words the calculation results of the model suggest that subsoiling treatment can reduce evaporation and maintain a higher actual transpiration rate providing a solid physiological basis for crop yield formation 3 3 calculation of water drainage fig 4 shows the estimation of daily drainage rates and cumulative water drainage by the model during the growth periods for three different treatments the daily drainage rate is positively correlated with daily rainfall shown also in fig 1 in 2017 and 2019 the growth periods showed a trend of initial increase followed by decrease in 2017 the maximum daily drainage rates of the r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 plots were 0 17 das 66 0 38 das 65 and 1 58 das 60 mm d 1 respectively in 2019 the maximum daily drainage rates for r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 were 0 82 das 65 0 87 das 66 and 2 02 das 64 mm d 1 respectively in 2018 the growth period yielded two peaks and the cumulative water drainage of s40 r15 increased by 76 47 and 174 77 over those of r15 and s35 r15 respectively compared with r15 and s35 r15 s40 r15 treatment had the highest average cumulative drainage of 18 6 mm and 19 5 mm respectively in addition to the calculations and analysis of the model these results indicate that increasing the depth of subsoiling will increase water drainage s35 r15 treatment yielded relatively low water drainage and reduced the occurrence of drainage therefore we speculate that increased depths of subsoiling will not only increase drainage at a continuous rate but also increase fuel consumption such loss of field water is not recommended notably the cumulative water drainage under s40 r15 treatment calculated by the model was approximately twice that of s35 r15 treatment ding et al 2020 reported that the model overestimated drainage under subsoiling conditions because rzwqm2 takes into consideration the large pores generated by subsoiling however drainage was also reported to be within the acceptable range in the same study the results show that the soil infiltration capacity can be improved by subsoiling compared to that by rotary tillage the model calculated water present at the time of infiltration as rainfall in the case of artificial irrigation the average quantity from a given time period was used as input for meteorological data which was inconsistent with the actual rainfall intensity the infiltration simulation was affected by this which would directly affect the water drainage zhu and ren 2011 however the model has no calculation module for surface water storage and cannot account for the slow infiltration of soil water ding et al 2016 therefore the model must be improved to fully account for the impact of soil moisture migration 3 4 simulation of evapotranspiration fig 5 shows the simulation of et during the growth period of maize from 2017 to 2019 comparison of measured and simulated values indicated that the model was superior to et simulation across the different treatments all nrmse values were within 20 11 99 12 27 and 16 57 for treatments r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 respectively the et of the farmland in different years was s40 r15 s35 r15 r15 thus subsoiling enhanced et at may have increased following subsoiling treatments table 4 and subsoiling may have decreased the resistance to root downward growth caused by compaction during plowing improving the access of crops to deep soil water sun et al 2019b xu et al 2019 fang et al 2014 reported that following correction of the soil hydraulic parameters the model simulation of the et of crops under different soil moisture conditions was satisfactory in the 2017 growth period in our simulation for r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 treatments the model yielded over simulation of 14 56 24 08 and 2 47 respectively meanwhile the simulated values of et in the 2018 and 2019 growth periods were low s35 r15 was underestimated by 2 16 and 4 94 in the 2018 and 2019 growth periods respectively a value within 5 of the et in the entire growth period and therefore within the acceptable range in 2018 for 230 day of the year and in 2019 for 220 day of the year there re rain with high depth so there s deep percolation at these times for this reason the measured et was higher than estimated et however the simulated and measured values under s40 r15 treatment were more disparate 16 83 and 20 71 for 2017 and 2018 respectively water drainage loss was not sufficiently considered in the water balance equation used to calculate et and the measured value was relatively high nonetheless we speculation that there is sufficient adjustment space for root parameters under s40 r15 treatment because this may affect the water uptake of the roots and at loss some studies have indicated that the calculation of et should rely on various meteorological factors and crop physiological indexes such as plant height and leaf area index such that the calculation process is highly complex and nonlinear yu et al 2016 wu et al 2019 feng et al 2020 considering these factors satisfactory results were obtained in the simulation calculation and rzwqm2 serves as a promising tool for predicting et in this study the soil moisture status and water consumption of summer maize fields under rotary tillage and subsoiling treatments were tested and simulated it has been reported that two new algorithms for calculating water stress factors have been built into dssat module saseendran et al 2014 saseendran et al 2015 we hope to test and quantify the enhancement and improvement of the simulation effect of these two methods in this experimental situation in further research pest program shows good capability in the efficient calibration model similarly it is also of great significance to use the pest program built into the model to automatically optimize parameters and evaluate the model uncertainty under different farming measures fang et al 2010a 2019 both efforts will improve the simulation performance and the applicability of rzwqm2 4 conclusions in this study rzwqm2 was calibrated and verified with field data from the summer maize growing seasons from 2017 to 2019 rzwqm2 was found to better simulate the dynamic changes of swc and sws under the conditions of subsoiling and rotary tillage upon suitably calibrating the model the existing test results were expanded and supplemented and the et of the farmland was calculated and analyzed more comprehensively compared with rotary tillage subsoiling could improve soil moisture status reduce ae and maintain a higher crop transpiration rate however concurrently with these beneficial results a higher degree of water drainage occurred under s40 r15 treatment following field measurement and simulation by rzwqm2 we suggest that s35 r15 treatment as an alternative tillage method the compaction of the soil is reduced by subsoiling therefore it is not recommended to increase the depth of subsoiling as this may have a negative impact

10151,the contraindications of summer maize production water resource shortages and soil surface layer structural deterioration in the north china plain ncp have become increasingly prominent subsoiling has been widely studied as a key tillage conservation technique the objective of this experiment is to continue characterization of soil moisture dynamics soil water consumption and drainage under different tillage management in the present study two subsoiling depths 35 cm s35 r15 and 40 cm s40 r15 were examined and rotary tillage at 15 cm r15 was used as the control the volume moisture content of field soil was determined by time domain reflectometry the amount of water stored in the soil is calculated by the soil volumetric moisture content in the 0 130 cm soil profile cumulated the amount of water stored in the soil at sowing and harvest time was used to calculate et using the equation of water balance the field experiment results were combined with the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 to calibrate and verify rzwqm2 using experimental data for summer maize in the growth period from 2017 to 2019 the results of the field trials showed that the soil water content swc and evapotranspiration et were increased by subsoiling compared to that by r15 rzwqm2 showed promising applicability in this scenario and successfully simulated the soil water dynamics caused by rainfall distribution during the years of treatment by r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 the normalized root mean squared errors nrmse for soil water storage sws and et were 11 31 19 65 and 11 99 16 57 respectively the corrected model was used to supplement the calculations of actual transpiration at actual evaporation ae and water drainage according to the calculations of the model s35 r15 and s40 r15 treatments could effectively reduce the actual evaporation in the early growth period and maintain high transpiration in the middle and late growth periods however s40 r15 treatment also resulted in a higher water drainage rate and greater cumulative water drainage in terms of soil moisture dynamics our findings suggest 35 cm to be the optimal depth for subsoiling in the ncp

that issues related to food security such as the quality of cultivated land and limitations in agricultural water are increasing modern farm operations are becoming more intensive and mechanized and traditional tillage methods such as continuous rotary tillage and repeated rolling by heavy agricultural machinery may not cause significant negative effects on tillage in the short term however under long term cultivation the disadvantages of shallow surface soil gradually become apparent wang et al 2019 at present the surface soil in the ncp is only 16 5 cm thick zhang and li 2010 scraping and

period lampurlanÃ©s et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the amount of water drainage is often ignored in these calculations but under heavy rainfall occurring over short periods during the summer water drainage is inevitable few previous studies have estimated water drainage at different depths of subsoiling analysis of crop water consumption through the measurement of transpiration and soil evaporation is relatively inefficient and the development of novel metrics is important for understanding water use in farmlands ma et al 2020 agricultural models are promising tools for water

swc et and grain yield under varying irrigation conditions dokoohaki et al 2016 saseendran et al 2014 improved the simulation of water stress factors in related processes making rzwqm2 more

et al 2014 anapalli et al 2016 used a large weighing lysimeters to measure the daily et and verified the accuracy of the simulation results of et in rzwqm2 however such large and precise instruments are expensive and uncommon and measurements at large spatial and temporal scales are difficult to perform han et al 2014 the combined model is a powerful and comparatively inexpensive computational tool for analyzing specific soil and crop conditions in different regions therefore it is considered a promising research method with the potential to further define the process of farmland water consumption through modeling ding et al 2020 investigated winter wheat farmland under several different tillage conditions as a research object to simulate and predict soil water dynamics runoff and water drainage however studies utilizing different depths of subsoiling have not been reported based on current rainfall distribution data and the tenuous availability of irrigation water in the ncp the present cropping system consists of wheat maize continuous cropping irrigation can be avoided during the growth period of summer maize fang et al 2010b rzwqm2 has not been broadly applied in non irrigated systems to diversify the field test results rzwqm2 was calibrated to simulate the influence of different subsoiling depths on the dynamics of soil moisture in summer maize fields in the ncp under the rainfed agriculture scheme clarifying the effects of two subsoiling depths on evaporation and water drainage of farmland compared to those of rotary tillage could indicate the more suitable depth for subsoiling thus in the present study we sought to 1 calibrate rzwqm2 under the rainfed agriculture mode and test the simulated performance of soil water transport in summer maize fields under rotary tillage and subsoiling treatments and 2 determine the degree to which the model can expand and enhance the experimental results clarify the farmland water consumption between different tillage practices and provide theoretical guidance for determining the optimal subsoiling depth in the ncp resolving these questions could improve the applicability of rzwqm2 for summer maize in the

average rainfall of 453 7 mm the experimental plot utilized the wheat and maize cropping system commonly used in actual production in the ncp the mostly commonly used tillage method in the region is rotary tillage and continuous rotary tillage of the experimental land for 15 years has resulted in reduction of the surface layer of the soil and compaction of the bottom layer of soil due to plowing

urea dosage was 280 kg ha 1 of which the effective n content was 46 6 an equivalent quantity of urea was applied at the jointing stage summer maize was planted in rows spaced 60 cm apart with plant spacing of 22 5 cm resulting in plant density of 7 5 104 plants ha 1 in the three year experiment summer maize was sown on june 9 2017 june 13 2018 and june 15 2019 and harvested on october 5 2017

test results the model updated to version 4 0 was used in the present study ma et al 2008 2 5 model calibration and validation there are many parameters that affect the simulated effects and performance of the model and therefore it is necessary to rate and evaluate the parameters appropriately s35 r15 treatment was used as the model for parameter calibration and the field test data for r15 and s40 r15 were used for model parameter verification during the calibration of the model data including swc 10 cm as a soil layer et and grain yield can be input the soil mechanical composition was measured and input into the model prior to the beginning of the experiment the soil characteristic parameters and hydraulic parameters used in the model included bulk density saturated water conductivity wilting coefficient and field water holding rate table 1 the crop variety parameters were manually adjusted to optimize the phenological period yield and other growth indicators for the simulation the calibrated crop variety parameter values are shown in table 2 the reliability of the parameters and the applicability of the model were determined by the simulation results under equivalent parameters to the field trial calibration verification of nitrogen was not included in this study 2 6 model performance criteria and calculations several different model performance evaluation indicators were utilized in the current study legates and mccabe 1999 evaluation of the simulation and experimental results involved evaluation indexes such as root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 normalized rmse nrmse was concurrently applied to evaluate the calculation effect and fitting degree of the models for swc sws and et the nrmse was expressed as the ratio between the rmse and average of the observed data the model simulations were considered excellent good fair and poor based on the nrmse values of 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 respectively which were

validation results 3 1 1 soil water content fig 2 shows the change in swc for each soil layer during the summer maize growing seasons from 2017 to 2019 using a contour map for the different periods the swc for each soil profile adheres to s40 r15 s35 r15 r15 this pattern is increasingly noticeable at greater soil depths in the 25 50 days after sowing das in 2018 the swc in the 20 80 cm soil layer under r15 treatment was deficient average swc was only 14 57 compared to that under subsoiling treatments average swc values for s35 r15 and s40 r15 were 16 21 and 17 32 respectively the average swc values for r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 in the 0 30 cm soil layer in the summer maize growing season of 2019 were 17 06 17 16 and 17 31 respectively the average swc values in the 30 100 cm soil layer for these treatments were 18 72 19 44 and 20 64 respectively during the 70 105 days following sowing the swc of the surface soil 0 15 cm was only about 8 but s35 r15 and s40 r15 treatments yielded superior water conditions in deep soil a characteristic conducive to crop growth in previous studies subsoiling was shown to reduce soil bulk density in the shallow soil layer tao et al 2015 and increase soil pore connectivity zhang et al 2017 subsoiling provides a macropore preferred flow path for rainfall or irrigation water allowing the water to infiltrate the soil rapidly and increasing soil moisture in the field wu et al 2009 studies have shown that subsoiling can facilitate downward growth of crop roots leading to more developed root distribution in the deep soil layer cai et al 2014 this increased root distribution can also cause root preferential flow of water jiang et al 2018 further enhancing higher swc in the deeper soil layers these findings are consistent with the observed soil moisture data in this study 3 1 2 simulation of soil water content and soil water storage fig 3 shows the comparison between the sws of the 0 130 cm soil layer and the value predicted by the model under different treatments in this study soil moisture data for s35 r15 was used in the model and soil moisture data for r15 and s40 r15 were used to verify the model the simulation encompassed the 2017 2019 summer maize growing seasons and the numbers of measured values were n2017 10 n2018 14 and n2019 14 for 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively to calibrate the model for s35 r15 treatment although the simulated value of sws in the summer maize growing season of 2017 was slightly lower the simulated value overall corresponded to the measured value rmse 3 25 cm r2 0 72 nrmse 11 65 the simulated results of the model validation were consistent with the calibrated results and the nrmse values all increased to different degrees 13 09 and 11 31 for treatments r15 and s40 r15 respectively as shown in fig 3 the simulated values better reflected the trend of the measured values and the model better reflected the fluctuation of sws under different treatments caused by annual precipitation the model prediction results obtained in this study are similar to the simulation results obtained by yu et al 2006 the simulated effect of swc in different soil layers is shown in table 3 the simulated results of the model for the 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm soil layers were markedly superior to those of the other two layers 0 30 cm and 90 130 cm the rmse values of swc treated by r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 were 0 031 0 058 0 028 0 048 and 0 028 0 060 cm3 cm 3 respectively most nrmse values were less than 20 jiang et al 2016 also simulated the swc in different soil layers and the rmse values obtained were similar to those of the present study compared with the surface soil rzwqm2 model has a better simulation effect on swc in the deeper soil layer and the error is also relatively smaller similarly in this simulation the simulated result of swc for the 0 30 cm soil layer produced a large error as compared to the other layers and the simulated effect of swc gradually improved with the increase of soil depth this is largely due to the spatial difference of soil surface structure which leads to deviation in simulation results fang et al 2009 a study on the correlation between soil hydraulic parameters and swc simulation indicated that extending the water content range between 0 33 bar and 15 bar was an effective method to improve the simulation performance of swc shahadha et al 2019 3 2 calculation of actual evaporation and transpiration table 4 shows the simulated calculation of ae at and actual evapotranspiration aet by rzwqm2 for summer maize during the growth period it is generally believed that yield formation is closely related to the at of crops ae is typically considered to have no contribution to yield formation and reductions in ae are therefore an important water saving measure ma et al 2020 the model calculation shows that ae accounts for 30 40 of farmland aet in the early growth stage sowing july 31 for example in 2017 ae aet of r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 were 39 011 32 911 and 33 587 respectively in the middle and late growth periods of summer maize ae aet decreased to 10 20 in the fertility period for all three years the performance was ranked r15 s35 r15 s40 r15 this result indicates that subsoiling during early growth can help the soil to retain water and reduce soil water loss wang et al 2012 concluded that subsoiling reduced soil evaporation in the early growth stage of crops a finding consistent with the law calculated by the model during the growth period the at of summer maize dominated the field aet accounting for approximately 80 after the crop reached the flowering stage xu et al 2017 measured photosynthetic rates and found that subsoiling promoted photosynthesis and improved the transpiration rate of crops this finding was also consistent with the results of the model simulation in august 2018 ae performance was ranked r15 s40 r15 s35 r15 however at performed as s35 r15 s40 r15 r15 the at of s35 r15 was 16 43 and 15 20 greater than that of r15 and s40 r15 respectively similarly from september 1 to maturity in 2019 s35 r15 treatment improved 20 25 and 15 70 over that of r15 and s40 r15 respectively studies have indicated that the crop canopy intercepts a large amount of light radiation necessary for transpiration more reasonable simulations of leaf area index dynamics will be of considerable significance for optimizing simulation models of transpiration shan et al 2020 in the three time periods divided by table 4 ae aet maintained a high proportion in the early stage and a low proportion in the middle and late stage while at aet presented an opposite trend in early reproductive years from 2017 to 2019 ae values treated with r15 were on average 14 71 and 14 91 higher than those of s35 r15 and s40 r15 this shows that r15 produced more inter plant evaporation at the early stage of canopy development and increased ineffective water consumption with the advancement of the growth period the at values and ae aet values of the two subsoiling treatments were higher compared with r15 the s35 r15 appears to be superior to the s40 r15 in the two subsoiling treatments of different depths in other words the calculation results of the model suggest that subsoiling treatment can reduce evaporation and maintain a higher actual transpiration rate providing a solid physiological basis for crop yield formation 3 3 calculation of water drainage fig 4 shows the estimation of daily drainage rates and cumulative water drainage by the model during the growth periods for three different treatments the daily drainage rate is positively correlated with daily rainfall shown also in fig 1 in 2017 and 2019 the growth periods showed a trend of initial increase followed by decrease in 2017 the maximum daily drainage rates of the r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 plots were 0 17 das 66 0 38 das 65 and 1 58 das 60 mm d 1 respectively in 2019 the maximum daily drainage rates for r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 were 0 82 das 65 0 87 das 66 and 2 02 das 64 mm d 1 respectively in 2018 the growth period yielded two peaks and the cumulative water drainage of s40 r15 increased by 76 47 and 174 77 over those of r15 and s35 r15 respectively compared with r15 and s35 r15 s40 r15 treatment had the highest average cumulative drainage of 18 6 mm and 19 5 mm respectively in addition to the calculations and analysis of the model these results indicate that increasing the depth of subsoiling will increase water drainage s35 r15 treatment yielded relatively low water drainage and reduced the occurrence of drainage therefore we speculate that increased depths of subsoiling will not only increase drainage at a continuous rate but also increase fuel consumption such loss of field water is not recommended notably the cumulative water drainage under s40 r15 treatment calculated by the model was approximately twice that of s35 r15 treatment ding et al 2020 reported that the model overestimated drainage under subsoiling conditions because rzwqm2 takes into consideration the large pores generated by subsoiling however drainage was also reported to be within the acceptable range in the same study the results show that the soil infiltration capacity can be improved by subsoiling compared to that by rotary tillage the model calculated water present at the time of infiltration as rainfall in the case of artificial irrigation the average quantity from a given time period was used as input for meteorological data which was inconsistent with the actual rainfall intensity the infiltration simulation was affected by this which would directly affect the water drainage zhu and ren 2011 however the model has no calculation module for surface water storage and cannot account for the slow infiltration of soil water ding et al 2016 therefore the model must be improved to fully account for the impact of soil moisture migration 3 4 simulation of evapotranspiration fig 5 shows the simulation of et during the growth period of maize from 2017 to 2019 comparison of measured and simulated values indicated that the model was superior to et simulation across the different treatments all nrmse values were within 20 11 99 12 27 and 16 57 for treatments r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 respectively the et of the farmland in different years was s40 r15 s35 r15 r15 thus subsoiling enhanced et at may have increased following subsoiling treatments table 4 and subsoiling may have decreased the resistance to root downward growth caused by compaction during plowing improving the access of crops to deep soil water sun et al 2019b xu et al 2019 fang et al 2014 reported that following correction of the soil hydraulic parameters the model simulation of the et of crops under different soil moisture conditions was satisfactory in the 2017 growth period in our simulation for r15 s35 r15 and s40 r15 treatments the model yielded over simulation of 14 56 24 08 and 2 47 respectively meanwhile the simulated values of et in the 2018 and 2019 growth periods were low s35 r15 was underestimated by 2 16 and 4 94 in the 2018 and 2019 growth periods respectively a value within 5 of the et in the entire growth period and therefore within the acceptable range in 2018 for 230 day of the year and in 2019 for 220 day of the year there re rain with high depth so there s deep percolation at these times for this reason the measured et was higher than estimated et however the simulated and measured values under s40 r15 treatment were more disparate 16 83 and 20 71 for 2017 and 2018 respectively water drainage loss was not sufficiently considered in the water balance equation used to calculate et and the measured value was relatively high nonetheless we speculation that there is sufficient adjustment space for root parameters under s40 r15 treatment because this may affect the water uptake of the roots and at loss some studies have indicated that the calculation of et should rely on various meteorological factors and crop physiological indexes such as plant height and leaf area index such that the calculation process is highly complex and nonlinear yu et al 2016 wu et al 2019 feng et al 2020 considering these factors satisfactory results were obtained in the simulation calculation and rzwqm2 serves as a promising tool for predicting et in this study the soil moisture status and water consumption of summer maize fields under rotary tillage and subsoiling treatments were tested and simulated it has been reported that two new algorithms for calculating water stress factors have been built into dssat module saseendran et al 2014 saseendran et al 2015 we hope to test and quantify the enhancement and improvement of the simulation effect of these two methods in this experimental situation in further research pest program shows good capability in the efficient calibration model similarly it is also of great significance to use the pest program built into the model to automatically optimize parameters and evaluate the model uncertainty under different farming measures fang et al 2010a 2019 both efforts will improve the simulation performance and the applicability of rzwqm2 4 conclusions in this study rzwqm2 was calibrated and verified with field data from the summer maize growing seasons from 2017 to 2019 rzwqm2 was found to better simulate the dynamic changes of swc and sws under the conditions of subsoiling and rotary tillage upon suitably calibrating the model the existing test results were expanded and supplemented and the et of the farmland was calculated and analyzed more comprehensively compared with rotary tillage subsoiling could improve soil moisture status reduce ae and maintain a higher crop transpiration rate however concurrently with these beneficial results a higher degree of water drainage occurred under s40 r15 treatment following field measurement and simulation by rzwqm2 we suggest that s35 r15 treatment as an alternative tillage method the compaction of the soil is reduced by subsoiling therefore it is not recommended to increase the depth of subsoiling as this may have a negative impact

10152,water reallocation from the agricultural sector to the ecological sector is an effective way to protect and improve the ecological environment and promote sustainable development in inland river basins the concept of ecological compensation provides us with a key approach to coordinating economic development and ecological construction however most existing studies have paid insufficient attention to the ecological compensation mechanism for the cross sector transfer of water resources taking the heihe river basin in northwestern china as a case the object of this study is to evaluate farmers willingness to accept compensation wta for transferring saved irrigation water to the local ecological sector on the basis of distinguishing regions and crops and to determine whether it is reasonable to take it as the ecological compensation standard based on the pre investigation and double bounded dichotomous contingent valuation model the number of questionnaires is allocated according to the differences in the number of households in different villages and face to face interviews are conducted by random sampling the results show that the minimum farmers wta for transferring seed maize maize and seed watermelon saved irrigation water to the local ecological sector are 0 53 rmb per mÂ³ 0 24 rmb per mÂ³ and 2 09 rmb per mÂ³ respectively and they are between the shadow price of agricultural water use in typical irrigation zones and the value of water resource ecological services this indicates not only that the evaluation of farmers wta can promote the coordinated development of economy society ecology but also that differentiated ecological compensation standards are needed on the edge of the oasis in the heihe river basin if the compensation period is ten years the total cost of this ecological compensation project is approximately 469 million rmb in addition the study also reveals that the start up bid irrigation cost cultivated land area proportion of agricultural labour and compensation policies variables have a positive impact on farmers wta whereas the proportion of agricultural income and the impact of land desertification and salinization ecological wetland degradation and wind sand weather on production and life variables have a negative effect furthermore the findings indicate that cash agricultural subsidies and in kind subsidies are the most acceptable compensation modes graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecological compensation standard farmers willingness to accept compensation dbcvm desert oasis ecotone heihe river basin 1 introduction water scarcity and the competition for water between the economy and ecology are becoming more intense in inland river basins worldwide micklin 1988 for thousands of years people living in inland river basins have expanded the scale of oasis agriculture to support thriving communities by changing land use patterns and irrigation methods wei et al 2010 especially in recent decades given rapid population growth and socio economic development the consumption of oasis agricultural water has increased dramatically and diminished the water available for ecological processes ji et al 2006 cheng et al 2014 li et al 2020 this has created a challenge common to many of the inland river basins in north western china i e the tarim river basin shiyanghe river basin shule river basin and heihe river basin feng et al 2001 farmers oasis expansion behaviour especially in the desert oasis ecotone can substantially modify the catchment hydrological cycle by changing land use and irrigation methods qi and luo 2006 fraiture et al 2010 which not only has negative impacts on the economic and ecosystem development in the downstream of river basins lu et al 2015 but also leads to a series of severe ecological disasters in the local ecological environment liu et al 2018 such as land desertification and salinization wetland degradation and wind sand weather these issues have attracted the attention of the government and scholars compensatory conservation has gained wide acceptance as an effective method for protecting ecosystems and at least 56 countries had established laws or policies that require compensatory conservation in 2014 shang et al 2018 ecological compensation is an important compensatory mechanism for internalising negative environmental externalities that originated in the 1970s in america brown and lant 1999 in 1976 the german federal nature conservation act required compensatory measures to be taken to keep the essential functions of nature and of the landscape unaltered after a project may et al 2017 currently ecological compensation is frequently employed worldwide such as the north carolina ecosystem enhancement programme in america the ecological compensation proposal for mt cass wind farm of new zealand the returning farmland to forests and paddy to dryland initiatives above the miyun reservoir of china etc gao et al 2019 many scholars have studied the standards and mode of watershed ecological compensation in china and worldwide moreno sanchez et al 2012 peng et al 2018 gao et al 2019 although in theory the ecological compensation standard ecs should be set between the opportunity cost of loss and the value of ecological services provided engel et al 2008 many studies hold different viewpoints for the setting of ecs for example kosoy et al 2007 noted that it is feasible to establish a regional ecs based on farmers participation castro 2001 and kosoy et al 2007 believed that opportunity cost could be used as the minimum ecs in a river basin and giannoccaro et al 2017 xie et al 2017 feng et al 2018 and haile et al 2019 evaluated the ecs from the perspective of respondents willingness to pay wtp willingness to accept compensation wta by contrast salzman et al 2018 showed that the value of ecosystem services can serve as the basis for a reasonable ecs setting in addition some scholars such as munoz pina et al 2008 indicated that the ecs should be set according to a principle such as the pareto optimal or regional fairness munoz pina et al 2008 jin et al 2014 most of the existing literature has studied the ecological compensation mechanism ecm among the up mid and downstream sections of a river basin but less attention has been paid to the ecm between the agricultural sector and the ecological sector in inland river basins existing studies also often took family as a vital unit to evaluate wtp wta but rarely explored the farmers wta per unit of water based on the crop division at the edge of an oasis in a river basin the main reason may be that a lack of statistics on the amount of crop saved irrigation water at the micro level limits further research moreover few studies have discussed whether an ecs based on farmers wtp wta can promote the coordinated development of economy society ecology from the perspective of sustainable watershed development the difference in shadow prices between different sectors is the driving force promoting water reallocation wang et al 2015 if the ecs can restore the value of ecological water services without reducing agricultural added value the benefits of the river basin can be promoted the shadow price of ecological water can be expressed as the non market value added per unit of ecological water khan and zhao 2019a therefore to fill a gap in the literature and provide a reference for the establishment of ecs on the edge of an oasis this study attempts to evaluate how much farmers should be compensated for water reallocation from agricultural irrigation water to the local ecological sector and determine whether farmers wta is between the shadow price of agricultural water and the value of water ecological services the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in north western china the oasis in the midstream of the hrb has become an important grain and vegetable commodity production base with a long agricultural development history and the proportion of agricultural water consumption has been approximately 94 for decades however with the rapid population growth socio economic development and implementation of the ecological water diversion project zhang et al 2018 the cropland area at the edge of the oasis in 2018 increased by approximately 75 compared with 2001 zhou et al 2017 farmers behaviours driven by pursuing maximum profits such as expanding the cropland area increasing irrigation water per acre and growing water intensive crops led to the reuse of agricultural water saved by high efficiency irrigation technologies in the large scale expansion of agricultural production zhang et al 2009 2014 zhou et al 2017 this not only reduced the effectiveness of the pilot water saving society project li et al 2015 but also led to more serious ecological problems such as land desertification sandstorms ecological wetland degradation and groundwater recession at the desert oasis ecotone midstream with the implementation of the most stringent water resources management system the contradiction between the agricultural sector and the ecological sector will become more prominent the implementation opinions on improving the ecological protection compensation mechanism in zhangye city and management regulations of the hrb also take the establishment of ecm and increased ecological water use as the ultimate goals of water resource management however a relatively complete ecm has not been established in the hrb studies show that there is some potential to improve the technical efficiency of crop irrigation teci in typical irrigation zones li et al 2019b and transferring saved irrigation water tsiw to the local ecological sector is one effective way to curb the expansion of the oasis and improve the ecological environment li et al 2019a however the reduction in agricultural water use will reduce farmers welfare level and ecological compensation policies need to be established haregeweyn et al 2012 to promote the coordinated development of the economy society ecology the ecs should be between the shadow price of the agricultural sector and the value of the water resource ecological services therefore this study will estimate farmers wta to determine the ecs for tsiw to the local ecological sector on the desert oasis ecotone of the hrb based on the results of the teci li et al 2019b and determine whether farmers wta is between the shadow price of the agricultural sector and the value of water resource ecological services at present most of the existing literature on ecological compensation in the hrb is based on qualitative analysis wang et al 2013b and only a few studies use a stated preference technique such as the contingent valuation method cvm or a choice experiment ce to estimate the value of ecosystem services based on residents wtp wta for example zhang et al 2004 estimated that the average maximum wtp of households in the hrb for ecosystem service restoration was 182 38 rmb per household per year based on a double bounded dichotomous choice xu et al 2018 estimated that the residents in the midstream of the hrb had an average wtp to improve ecosystem services of 249 46 rmb per household per year based on the ce model khan and zhao 2019a and wu 2017 built a ce model and determined that the value of ecosystem services was approximately 1 108 billion rmb by calculating the wtp for improvements in the local ecosystem upstream midstream and downstream of the hrb which was approximately 593 249 and 1093 rmb per household per year respectively the factors influencing the wtp wta are also considered including start up bids feng et al 2018 farmers demographic and sociological characteristics khan and zhao 2019a cultivated land traits farmers environmental protection consciousness macdonald et al 2010 market risk luo et al 2016 etc this study will evaluate farmers wta and analyse the influencing factors based on existing studies and farmer surveys moreover although ce is the most widely indicated technique when the attributes are relevant and understandable hanley et al 2001 it is more difficult for the interviewee to understand the questions this study investigates the farmers wta for each service provision and not considering the farmers attributes therefore cvm is adopted the aim of this study is to quantify how much compensation paid to farmers will promote them to transfer agricultural irrigation water to the local ecological sector which can promote the coordinated development of local economic society and ecological construction the main objectives are to evaluate farmers wta distinguished by regions and crops and its determinants assess farmers preferences for compensation methods and determine whether it is reasonable to take this wta as a scientific reference for setting differentiated ecs for tsiw to the local ecological sector on the edge of the oasis in the hrb 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area the hrb is located in the middle part of the hexi corridor in the arid region of northwestern china geographically there are three major geomorphological units in the region from south to north they are the southern qilian mountains in the upstream region the middle hexi corridor and the northern alxa high plain in the lower reaches it covers an area of approximately 130 000 km2 the midstream and part of the upstream region of the hrb are located in zhangye city gansu province and the downstream region is located in the ejin banner inner mongolia the midstream part in zhangye city is an irrigated agriculture economic zone that consists of five counties districts ganzhou and linze in the plain irrigation zone piz minle and shandan in the mountain irrigation zone miz and gaotai in the northern desert irrigation zone ndiz due to differences in natural conditions the crop planting structure is obviously different among the irrigation zones seed maize maize and vegetables are mainly grown in the piz cotton maize wheat intercrop and seed watermelon in the ndiz and wheat potato maize and barley in the miz studies show that there is a certain space to improve the teci in typical irrigation zones the average amount of irrigation water for seed maize maize and seed watermelon are 12 108 m3 per hm2 10 816 m3 per hm2 and 6570 m3 per hm2 and the teci are 0 6553 0 6185 and 0 6518 respectively li et al 2019a 2019b measures such as rationally determining the planting scale improving water conservancy facilities rationally using well irrigation and enhancing the flexibility of river water irrigation can improve the teci in the hrb the average amount of saved water is approximately 4174 m3 per hm2 4126 m3 per hm2 and 2294 m3 per hm2 respectively li et al 2019a 2019b linze in the piz and gaotai in the ndiz are located at the edge of the oasis in the midstream of the hrb the cropland area of linze and gaotai in 2018 was 30 180 hm2 and 38 327 hm2 an increase of 72 45 and 77 27 over 2001 respectively these two counties districts are the main region experiencing deterioration in the ecological environment due to the expansion of an oasis the shadow price of agricultural water in the different irrigation zones is approximately 0 22 rmb per mÂ³ which is basically equal to the agricultural water price wang et al 2013a this indicates that water resources are in surplus relative to land resources and that the cost of ecological compensation for transferring saved agricultural water may be lower the value of water resource ecosystem services in the hrb is approximately 4 69 rmb per mÂ³ wu 2017 the difference between the shadow price of agricultural and ecological water is a key prerequisite for water reallocation the sample sites will mainly choose farmers who grow seed maize and maize in pingchuan liaoquan and yanuan towns linze county and farmers who grow seed watermelon in the town of luocheng gaotai county 2 2 dbcvm model cvm is a main stated preference method in which the interviewee is offered an amount to pay or accepts a certain good or service provision level in constructed hypothetical markets cvm is rooted in lancaster s value theory lancaster 1966 and is consistent with thurstone s random utility theory thurstone 1929 the economic theory underlying cvm assumes that the stated price yields the highest utility for the respondent the minimum wta is the appropriate measure in a situation in which a respondent is asked to voluntarily give up a good carson 2000 in this study it is assumed that there are differences in farmers preferences for market and environmental goods i e water resources a farmer s consumption of market goods q depends on disposable income y and the price p of the market goods and they are free to choose however in terms of the consumption of environmental goods water resources e farmers cannot choose freely the utility function of farmers is u q e and under the premise of fixed disposable income farmers seek to maximise utility the conditional demand function of market goods i is q i h i p e y and the indirect utility function is v p e y u h p e y e if p and e are unchanged to achieve the utility level u the minimum expenditure function of market goods can be expressed as y y p e u in fig 2 the initial status of personal consumption is at a0 and the utility is at the level represented by the u0 curve when a farmer s consumption of water resources decreases from e0 to e1 theoretically the level of utility will drop to u1 and the farmer s status will change to a1 where u 0 q e 0 u 1 q e 1 however because farmers will also enjoy the benefits from improvements in the ecological environment the actual level of utility will be at the u2 curve slightly higher than u1 and the status will change to a2 monetary compensation must be given to farmers to maintain the same level of utility u0 wta y1 y2 is the minimum compensation amount that ensures that farmers utility remains unchanged after the transfer of irrigation water among different possible cvm approaches such as single bounded dichotomous choice sbdc double bounded dichotomous choice dbdc and open ended cvm the most widely applied approach dbdc is selected hanemann et al 1991 demonstrated that the dbdc is statistically more efficient than sbdc and requires a lower level of precision to elicit the wta of the respondents especially when there are fewer observations the double bounded logistics model reduces the variance in the estimated parameters significantly and there is a consistent decline in the co variance term in comparison to the sbdc method cheng et al 2006 this immediately translates into a tighter confidence interval around the median wta the efficiency of the double bounded contingent valuation method dbcvm lies in the fact that it defines more precise boundaries for the wta in a closer neighbourhood of the wta than that allowed for by the single bounded contingent valuation method sbcvm following hanemann median wta and mean wta are estimated because the farmer s answer is in the form of yes or no this study uses the logit model for estimation and the functional formula is 1 y a b x c w Îµ where x refers to the bid value w refers to the social economic variables that affect the farmers wta Îµ is the perturbation term and a b c are parameters there are two possibilities for y namely y 1 y e s or y 0 n o when the farmer answers no y 0 2 Îµ a b x c w if f is the distribution function the probability that the farmer answers no is 3 p n o x f a b x c w therefore the probability of answering yes is 4 p y e s x 1 f a b x c w 5 Îµ obeysthelogisticdistribution namely f z 1 1 e z 6 if z a b x c w then p y e s x 1 f a b x c w 1 1 1 e a b x c w setting the probability of yes to 0 5 then the median wta and mean wta are 7 w t a m e d i a n a c w b 8 w t a m e a n 0 x m a x 1 f a b x c w d x 0 x m a x e a b x c w 1 e a b x c w d x

then based on the response to the initial question 2 is he she willing to accept a higher or lower premium follow up bid if the response to the start up bid is yes then a lower follow up bid is presented and if the response to the start up bid is no then a higher follow up bid is presented based on these two questions the following four possible outcomes for the wta exercise are obtained a wta yy accept both the start up bid and the follow up bid b wta yn accept the start up bid and rejecting the follow up bid c wta ny reject the start up bid and accepting the follow up bid d wta nn reject both the start up bid and the follow up bid a double bounded logit model was employed to analyse the sample data according to hanemann 1991 the response probabilities obtained for the double

follow up lower bid value in the case of yes to the start up bid value and bu follow up higher bid value in the case of no to the start up bid value the functional form of the double bounded log likelihood to estimate farmers wta of tsiw to the local ecological sector is 13 l n l i 1 n i i y y l n p y y i i y n l n p y n i i n y l n p n y i i n n l n p n n where i 1 n i i indicates the response category of individual respondent i 2 3 questionnaire design and farmer survey the dbcvm questionnaire consists of three main sections the first section illustrates the current situation of ecological environment deterioration and the future harm it will cause on the edge of the oasis and determines the main attributes and the value level of irrigation water for farmers the second section surveys the farmers environmental protection consciousness and the final section collects information on the respondents age educational level family size and income level in the first section building on relevant studies regional development planning documents and preliminary surveys this study divides the main attributes of irrigation water for farmers into three ecological attributes and one wta attribute the ecological attributes include saline alkali land area the number of days of sand wind weather and the total shelter belt area table 1 lists the levels and explanations of the main attributes table 2 shows the questionnaire with seed maize as an example it should be noted that compared to the opportunity cost per unit of water farmers can more clearly express the impact of transferring agricultural water through the cost benefit per unit of land therefore this study investigates the farmers wta by considering the saved water for the unit of land as a whole we also investigated farmers preference on ecological compensation modes there are two main investigated ecological compensation modes monetary compensation and non monetary compensation the modes of monetary compensation mainly includes cash agricultural subsidy pension to guarantee old farmers life education subsidy to guarantee rural children s education and small loans the non monetary compensation mainly includes in kind subsidy such as agricultural machinery fertiliser subsidies and seeds technology subsidy such as key technologies for agricultural disaster prevention and reduction stabilizing and increasing production soil testing and formula fertilisation technology and non agricultural employment mainly offered to young people to collect the data for the current study a survey was conducted in july and august 2019 and a well designed and pretested questionnaire was employed among a sample taken from the population of the typical irrigation zones at the edge of the oasis after screening and removing the incomplete questionnaires a total of 1711 questionnaires were conducted in 22 villages 4 towns and 2 counties due to the complexity of the questionnaire and the inclusion of rural and less educated people the number of questionnaires was allocated according to the differences in the number of households in different villages and face to face interviews were conducted by random sampling by providing clarification the interviewers could assist the respondents and thus reduce any problems related to understanding the questions the survey was carried out by well trained university graduates the survey questionnaire meets the requirements of a large sample of cvm the specific sample is shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 survey results 3 1 1 impact of sample characteristics on the farmers wta table 3 shows the impact of the sample characteristics on farmers wta in typical irrigation zones first the farmers who grow seed maize maize and seed watermelon are mostly between the ages of 45 and 64 and the average age is 51 52 and 53 respectively the households that are highly dependent on agricultural income are also mainly composed of people in the same age group further 91 of this age group are willing to accept ecological compensation however this proportion is lower than the proportion of farmers younger than 45 and older than 65 96 this difference might be because people over 65 cannot afford heavy agricultural labour while young labourers are generally seasonal laborers and spend most of the year working outside and only stay at home when they are busy with agriculture second although a higher education level leads to a higher proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation 90 of farmers have an education level below junior middle school suggesting that education did not lead to a significant difference between the groups third among the farmers who grow seed maize and seed watermelon households with less than 50 agricultural labour have a higher willingness to be compensated than those with more than 50 agricultural labour however this was not obvious for maize the influence of cultivated land characteristics on farmers wta is obvious in general the larger the area of cultivated land is and the worse its quality the higher the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept ecological compensation the average cultivated land area of farmers in a typical irrigation zone is approximately 1 hm2 for farmers with 0 0 67 hm2 and 0 68 1 33 hm2 of cultivated land the larger the cultivated land area is the higher the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation the proportions are 91 and 94 respectively however when the cultivated land area is higher than 1 33 hm2 the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation 93 no longer increases the reason is that most of these farmers who cultivated more than 1 33 hm2 rented the land from the others thus they considered that the ecological compensation might be paid to the landowners not the actual land users the quality of cultivated land mainly refers to characteristics such as the saline alkali level flatness ability to hold water and fertiliser etc the salinity and desertification levels of cultivated land on the edge of the oasis region are relatively high the quality of cultivated land that is used for maize and seed watermelon is relatively poor the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation is approximately 92 and 96 respectively while the quality of cultivated land grown with seed maize is relatively good therefore the effect of quality on these farmers wta is not clear since 2017 linze has implemented a comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices that is based on an agricultural water price of 30 rmb per hm2 and 0 168 rmb per mÂ³ if the actual irrigation water used for seed maize or maize exceeds 10 30 of the irrigation quota the charge for the excess irrigation water will be 1 2 times the water price if it exceeds 30 50 of the irrigation quota the charge for the excess irrigation water will be 1 5 times the water price if it exceeds 50 of the irrigation quota the charge will be 2 times the water price according to the industrial water quota of gansu province the irrigation quota for corn is 7200 mÂ³ per hm2 therefore if the amount of crop irrigation water does not exceed 7200 mÂ³ per hm2 the irrigation cost will not be higher than 1383 6 rmb per hm2 if it does not exceed 10 30 beyond the irrigation quota the irrigation cost is 1383 6 1862 25 rmb per hm2 if it does not exceed the irrigation quota by 30 50 the irrigation cost is between 1862 25 and 2253 9 rmb per hm2 if it exceeds the irrigation quota by 50 the irrigation cost will exceed 2253 9 rmb however the irrigation costs for most of the seed maize farmers are more than 2253 9 rmb per hm2 and the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation is as high as 91 3 for nearly 80 of farmers the field corn irrigation costs exceed 2253 9 rmb and as the irrigation costs increase the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation shows a clear upward trend finally although gaotai did not implement a progressive price increase system the average irrigation cost for watermelon production is 3300 rmb per hm2 and the higher the irrigation cost is the higher the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation agricultural subsidies and pensions are the main types of subsidies received by farmers in plain irrigation zones agricultural subsidies pension subsidies grassland subsidies and public welfare forest subsidies are the main types of subsidies received by farmers in northern desert irrigation zones the more satisfied farmers are with the subsidy policy the higher the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation 3 1 2 analysis of farmers environmental protection consciousness land salinization desertification groundwater recession eco environment degradation and wind sand weather are the main factors affecting farmers lives and production 75 of the farmers who grow seed maize a total of 709 respondents and maize a total of 597 respondents in the piz believe that land salinization and desertification affect their lives and production seriously or very seriously and 74 of them believe that wind sand weather affects their lives and production seriously or very seriously however 41 of them believe that the impact of groundwater recession is at an acceptable level and 50 of them believe that the impact of ecological wetland degradation on their lives and production is acceptable in the ndiz 94 of the farmers who grow seed watermelon a total of 405 respondents believe that land salinization and desertification affect their lives and production seriously or very seriously and 87 of them think that wind sand weather affects their lives and production seriously or very seriously however only 42 of them think that groundwater recession will have a serious impact on their production and lives and 37 of them think that ecological wetland degradation will have a serious impact the level of farmers environmental protection consciousness is mainly judged by their answers to the following questions 1 do you think that the reclaimed land is crowding out ecological water 2 do you think that transferring the saved irrigation water to the ecological sector can improve the ecological environment 3 do you think that returning farmland can improve the ecological environment table 4 shows that most farmers do not clearly know whether reclamation is crowding out ecological water the reason may be that the previous generation had cultivated the land and the environmental problems at that time had not yet been highlighted in addition some farmers believe that reclamation is an act of protecting land and has not crowded out ecological water however 79 of the 1711 respondents believe that returning farmland can improve the ecological environment and 65 of them think that transferring the saved irrigation water to the ecological sector can improve the ecological environment the main reason may be the long term impact of water diversion from the middle reaches to the downstream leading to changes in farmers environmental protection concepts 3 1 3 outcomes of the wta questions of tsiw table 5 illustrates the outcomes of farmers wta questions for tsiw as the start up bid increases the probability of respondents answering yes increases but as the follow up bid decreases the probability of respondents answering no increases it can be seen that farmers always expect higher compensation in the case of a start up bid of 6000 rmb per hm2 for seed maize nearly 90 131 respondents of the farmers 142 respondents are willing to accept this compensation but when the follow up bid is reduced to 4500 rmb per hm2 73 respondents of the 131 respondents 51 41 will also accept it and the probability of acceptance by the farmers remains higher than that of rejection 40 85 this result shows that 4500 rmb per hm2 may be the input output balance point for farmers 3 2 farmers wta and its determinants 3 2 1 explanatory variables according to relevant studies and farmer household surveys the explanatory variables influencing farmers wta are determined based on the following six factors feng et al 2018 khan and zhao 2019a may et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 macdonald 2010 start up bid farmers demographic and sociological characteristics cultivated land and household income traits irrigation traits compensation policies and farmers environmental protection consciousness the specific variables are shown in table 6 and the statistical descriptions are shown in table 7 factors such as irrigation water sources irrigation technology agricultural water price market risk and follow up bid are not used as the main explanatory variables in this study the reasons are as follows 1 farmers in typical irrigation zones mainly use river water for flood irrigation and the differences in irrigation water sources and irrigation technology among farmers are small 2 different towns or villages in the same county district have the same agricultural water price policy and the differences in farmers irrigation traits are mainly reflected in irrigation cost per mu 3 the prices of seed maize seed watermelon and maize are all affected by market factors and 4 the start up bid and the follow up bid value have high multiple collinearity 3 2 2 regression results for the factors influencing farmers wta the econometric software stata12 0 is used for analysis table 8 highlights the coefficients and significance of all the variables of the different models the seed maize maize and seed watermelon logistic models were significant with wald chi2 199 65 p 0 0000 0 01 wald chi2 92 35 p 0 0000 0 01 and wald chi2 72 73 p 0 0000 0 01 respectively these results indicate that the regression equation is overall significant and has strong explanatory power according to formulas 7 8 and 13 the mean and median wta of farmers growing seed maize are 5495 7 rmb per hm2 and 2193 75 rmb per hm2 respectively the mean and the median wta of farmers growing maize are 1378 05 rmb per hm2 and 977 7 rmb per hm2 respectively and the mean and the median wta of farmers growing seed watermelon are 5795 25 rmb per hm2 and 4801 05 rmb per hm2 respectively according to the survey we found that the wta of farmers planting seed maize varied greatly because the water resources were relatively abundant in areas where seed maize was planted in addition to considering the loss of irrigation costs farmers here also considered whether water transfer would cause reductions in crop yield and income this led to a large span of the bidding value of farmers wta however the benefit of seed watermelon production was higher and farmers here only considered the decrease in income due to the decrease in water quantity when considering wta maize was mostly planted on saline alkali land since this type of land has lower and more self sufficient oriented production farmers mostly considered land transfer costs and irrigation costs when considering wta therefore the difference between the mean and median wta was relatively small here thus this study suggests that the median wta is a more reasonable benchmark based on the average amount of irrigation water and the teci results the average amount of saved water for seed maize maize and seed watermelon are approximately 4174 m3 per hm2 4126 m3 per hm2 and 2294 m3 per hm2 respectively li et al 2019a 2019b therefore the ecological compensation per unit water of seed maize maize and seed watermelon is estimated to be 0 53 rmb per mÂ³ 0 24 rmb per mÂ³ and 2 09 rmb per mÂ³ respectively given that the ecss are between 0 22 and 4 69 rmb per mÂ³ ecological compensation according to these results can not only improve the optimal allocation of water resources but also achieve the sustainable development of the river basin furthermore according to the 2018 statistical yearbook of linze county and gaotai county the planting area of seed maize and maize are 12 976 hm2 and 10 338 hm2 respectively in linze county and the planting area seed watermelon is 1694 hm2 in gaotai county if the ecological compensation period is 10 years the total cost of transferring saved agricultural water is approximately 469 million rmb based on farmers wta the regression results of the main influencing factors are as follows 1 the variable lnbid is significant at a 1 significance level and the coefficient is positive in the three models which indicates that with other conditions unchanged the higher the start up bid value is the higher the willingness of farmers to accept compensation and transfer saved irrigation water to the local ecological sector haile et al 2019 2 first variable d1 is not significant in the three models its coefficient is negative in the seed maize model but positive in the maize and seed watermelon models the reason may be that the age of the respondents is mostly concentrated between 45 and 65 and the difference is small which makes age not significant for farmers wta second variable d2 is significant at the 5 and 10 significance levels in the maize and seed watermelon models respectively and its coefficient is positive in all three models these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged the higher the education level of the farmers is the higher their willingness to accept compensation and the more willing they are to transfer the saved irrigation water to the local ecological environment this finding is in line with expectations khan and zhao 2019a 2019b finally variable lnral is significant only at the 1 level in the seed watermelon model and its coefficient is positive in all three models these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged the more agricultural labour there is the higher the efficiency of irrigation water use and the higher the willingness of farmers to accept compensation 3 the variable lnnp is significant at the 10 and 5 significance levels and the coefficient is positive in the seed maize and seed watermelon models it is not significant in the maize model and the coefficient is negative the variable lnrrla is significant only at a 5 significance level in the maize model and the coefficient is negative the variable d3 is significant only at a 10 significance level in the maize model and the coefficient is positive in all three models these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged for farmers who grow seed maize and seed watermelon the larger the number of farmland plots is the larger the scale of production and the higher their willingness to accept compensation the main reason is that the implementation of the ecological compensation policy for transferring irrigation water has a more obvious impact on these farmers planting scale and agricultural income and farmers can obtain more compensation xie et al 2017 however for farmers who grow maize the higher the proportion of cultivated land area is the lower the willingness of farmers to accept compensation whereas the worse the quality of cultivated land is the higher their willingness to accept compensation the reason is that most of the maize is planted on poor quality saline alkali land considering that the transfer of irrigation water may lead to the return of farmland and reduce the agricultural income farmers will demand higher compensation moreover the variable lnrai is significant only at the 1 significance level in the seed watermelon model and the coefficient is negative in the three models these results show that the higher the proportion of agricultural income is the lower the willingness of farmers to accept compensation giannoccaro et al 2017 4 the variable lnic is significant at the 5 significance level and the coefficient is positive in the three models these results show that the higher the irrigation costs are the higher the willingness of farmers to accept compensation and the lower the amount of compensation they will accept the variable d4 is significant only at the 1 significance level in the seed maize model and the coefficient is positive in the three models 5 the variable d5 is not significant in the three models and its coefficients are positive in the seed maize and seed watermelon models but negative in the maize model the coefficients of variables d6 d8 and d9 are all negative in the three models but their significance is different the variable d6 is significant only at the 5 significance level in the seed maize model the variable d9 is significant only at the 10 significance level in the maize model and the variable d8 is significant at the 5 5 and 10 significance levels in the seed maize maize and seed watermelon models respectively however unlike variables d6 d8 and d9 variable d7 is not significant and its coefficients are positive in the three models these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged the more serious farmers think the negative effects of land salinization desertification the degradation of ecological wetlands and wind sand weather are to production and living the higher their willingness to accept compensation and the lower the amount of compensation required he et al 2018 while the more serious farmers believe that the negative effects of groundwater recession are on production and life the lower their willingness to accept compensation the reason is when the surface water was transferred to the ecological sector farmers considered groundwater to be a supplement however once groundwater declines to some extent farmers will face the threat of shrinking cultivated land which will seriously affect their production and income therefore their required compensation is relatively high in the end the variable d10 is significant at the 5 significance level in the seed maize and maize models and its coefficients are negative in all three models the variable d11 is significant at the 1 and 10 significance levels in the maize and seed watermelon models and its coefficients are all positive these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged the higher the farmers environmental protection consciousness is the higher their willingness to accept compensation 3 3 farmers selection of ecological compensation mode table 9 shows the impact of key characteristics on farmers selection of ecological compensation modes in typical irrigation zones age education level the proportion of family in the agricultural labour force and the proportion of family agricultural income are the main factors influencing farmers to choose the ecological compensation mode generally farmers preferred monetary compensation to other modes of compensation within the monetary compensation modes farmers generally accepted cash and agricultural subsidies while farmers older than 60 or with a relatively high education level generally chose pensions ultimately only a few farmers with agriculture facilities chose small loans for other compensation methods in kind subsidies were more accepted by elder farmers older than 55 while non agricultural employment opportunities were more easily accepted by farmers younger than 45 years old and those with high education as they preferred more employment opportunities similarly technology subsidies are more easily accepted by young or highly educated farmers as they are more willing to develop water saving agriculture 4 discussions water scarcity and the competition for water between the economy and the ecology are major obstacles to water resource management on the edge of the oasis in the hrb this study pointed out that the ecs setting for tsiw to the local ecological sector should distinguish not only regions but also crops moreover this study can provide a scientific reference to establish water rights trading systems by evaluating the ecological compensation per unit of water of different crops the regression results also showed that irrigation costs and farmers environmental protection consciousness have a significant influence on farmers wta therefore the major research findings and their implications on practices and future research are as follows 4 1 differentiated ecs should be made according to the crop planting structure ecm has become an increasingly popular instrument to translate external non market environmental services into financial incentives for farmers to preserve the ecosystems that provide services however lack of spatial differentiation in the targeting mechanism may lead to efficiency losses wÃ¼nscher et al 2008 in this study to ensure the fairness and efficiency of ecological compensation policy considering the practice of ecological compensation the construction of ecm in the hrb should be based on different irrigation zones natural conditions and crop planting structures zhao and wang 2010 farmers wta is actually the opportunity cost of tsiw and may be affected by the cost benefit of different crops and the agricultural water prices of typical irrigation zones on the edge of the oasis due to different natural conditions there are differences in not only the agricultural water prices but also the net income per unit of water for crops in typical irrigation zones in the midstream of the hrb according to the farmer surveys the lowest value for the farmers wta considers only the irrigation cost and the highest value for the farmers wta considers the input and output of different crops the higher the net income per unit water of crops is the higher the farmers wta therefore by distinguishing regions and crops this study has considered and excluded factors that affect farmers wta such as agricultural water prices and crop planting structure to ensure that the findings are more scientific however within the same irrigation zone it is possible that the crop planting structure would change because of substantial differences in ecss from crops therefore it is more appropriate to set up compensation methods such as agricultural subsidies as planting areas instead of land areas additionally to implement better ecological compensation besides government compensation market means such as water rights trading should also be introduced to gradually enrich the compensation modes 4 2 establishing an ecm by improving the water rights trading market financial subsidies and water rights trading are the main modes for implementing ecological compensation policies however in the long run an ecological compensation mode that relies on government financial input is not feasible in australia and the united states markets in water have opened up over several decades leonard et al 2019 compared with those countries however in china water rights are not as tradable metering is poor and plots are tiny water rights trading has mostly been by water user associations made up of several hundred farmers but this dampens the incentives that make markets effective bekchanov et al 2015 lewis and zheng 2019 at the beginning of the 21st century the hrb was committed to establishing a water rights trading market however due to the imperfect water pricing mechanism and the high cost of water rights trading its effect has not been obvious zhang 2007 this study estimates that the ecological compensation per unit water for seed maize maize and seed watermelon is 0 53 rmb per mÂ³ 0 24 rmb per mÂ³ and 2 09 rmb per mÂ³ respectively these standards are between the shadow price of agricultural water use in typical irrigation zones and the value of water resource ecological services this shows that it is reasonable to take the ecs as the transaction water price which can promote the coordinated development of the economy and ecology for towns at the edge of the oasis in the hrb furthermore the ecss evaluated in this study are between different sectors within the same irrigation zone this does not involve the transfer of water resources across different regions or river basins and the cost of water rights transactions is lower therefore to improve the implementation opinions on improving ecological protection compensation mechanism in zhangye city and management regulations of the hrb and promote the coordinated development of watershed economy society ecology the conclusions of this study can provide a scientific reference for the establishment of water rights trading systems 4 3 adjusting ecs based on comprehensive reform of agricultural water price a water price increase has been used as an effective method to guarantee national water security and maintain national food security in israel water scarcity is an increasing problem the current water pricing scheme supplies potable water to municipalities at fees above the supply costs and subsidizes water delivered to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors luckmann et al 2016 on the one hand israel has established a compensation fund to subsidize agricultural water fees on the other hand it has adopted economic incentives to strengthen agricultural water management imposing fines on users who exceed water quotas and rewarding users who do not exceed water quotas to promote water saving irrigation therefore the reasonableness of the water price has a direct influence on people s attitude decision behaviour regarding willingness to pay and motivation for water conservation mu et al 2019 in 2017 the city of zhangye started to implement a comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices the price of agricultural water is no longer fixed but depends on the amount used for irrigation the regression results show that the variable irrigation costs are significant at the 5 significance level and the coefficients are positive in the three models the main reason for this result may be that many farmers consider ecological compensation for transferring saved agricultural water as compensation for paying high irrigation costs which may lead to policy bias in the results the comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices includes not only the water price collection system but also a series of subsidy policies to encourage farmers to save irrigation water tian et al 2017 however as far as the current implementation effect is concerned its water saving effect is not ideal and even increases farmers wta therefore the ecm formulation should use watershed sustainable development as the goal comprehensively consider the impact of the comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices and set diversified ecs to realise the reallocation of water resources from the agricultural sector to the ecological sector 4 4 improving the effectiveness of ecm by enhancing farmers participation as the largest water users farmers oasis expansion behaviour and compensation willingness directly determine the level of ecological compensation costs the regression results show that more serious farmers believe that the negative effects of ecological environment deterioration are on production and living the higher their willingness to accept compensation and the lower the amount of compensation required therefore to restrict farmers expansion behaviour and promote the transfer of saved irrigation water enhancing farmers environmental protection consciousness through government policies advertisements and the establishment of water user associations among others is necessary furthermore implementing the farmer participation policy in ecological compensation is an important way to achieve sustainable watershed management he et al 2018 the existing compensation policies in the hrb lack not only public participation but also low transparency which leads to some farmers being unwilling to accept ecological compensation farmers participation should be increased during the process of setting ecs to enhance the scientificity and democracy of policies finally the farmer survey also found that factors such as age educational level family size income level and crops planting structure affect farmers selection of the ecological compensation mode therefore to promote the implementation of the ecm it is necessary to formulate diversified ecological compensation modes to meet the needs of different farmers 5 conclusions this study evaluates the farmers wta for tsiw to the local ecological sector on the edge of oasis regions in the midstream of the hrb the main findings show that farmers wta for transferring irrigation water intended for seed maize maize and seed watermelon to the local ecological sector is 0 53 rmb per mÂ³ 0 24 rmb per mÂ³ and 2 09 rmb per mÂ³ respectively which are in the range of the ecss between 0 22 and 4 69 rmb per mÂ³ wang et al 2013a wu 2017 ecological compensation according to these standards can not only help to improve the optimal allocation of water resources but also help to achieve sustainable development of the river basin moreover if the ecological compensation period is 10 years the total cost of transferring saved agricultural water will be approximately 469 million rmb in the planting area of seed maize and maize in linze county and seed watermelon in gaotai county furthermore the study reveals that the start up bid irrigation cost cultivated land area proportion of agricultural labour and compensation policies variables have a positive impact on farmers wta whereas the proportion of agricultural income and the impact of land desertification and salinization ecological wetland degradation and wind sand weather on production and life variables have a negative effect finally the findings also show that cash agricultural subsidies and in kind subsidies are the payment modes with higher acceptance by farmers whereas pensions are generally accepted by farmers over the age of 60 years education subsidies and non agricultural employment opportunities are generally accepted by farmers younger than the age of 45 years and with higher education levels in contrast technology subsidies and small loans are accepted only by farmers with facility agriculture in addition this study has some limitations for example because the total planting area of seed maize maize and seed watermelon accounts for more than 85 of the total cultivated area in the desert oasis ecotone of the hrb this study has assessed farmers wta for tsiw of these crops to the local ecological sector however if the purpose of fully transferring saved agricultural water to the ecological sector is to be achieved evaluating farmers wta of all crop types such as field vegetables and other seed crops is necessary however in fact farmers who plant other crops are relatively scattered the planting area is relatively small and the planting pattern is more complicated which makes it difficult to evaluate farmers wta therefore this study does not consider the research of farmers wta of other crops

10152,water reallocation from the agricultural sector to the ecological sector is an effective way to protect and improve the ecological environment and promote sustainable development in inland river basins the concept of ecological compensation provides us with a key approach to coordinating economic development and ecological construction however most existing studies have paid insufficient attention to the ecological compensation mechanism for the cross sector transfer of water resources taking the heihe river basin in northwestern china as a case the object of this study is to evaluate farmers willingness to accept compensation wta for transferring saved irrigation water to the local ecological sector on the basis of distinguishing regions and crops and to determine whether it is reasonable to take it as the ecological compensation standard based on the pre investigation and double bounded dichotomous contingent valuation model the number of questionnaires is allocated according to the differences in the number of households in different villages and face to face interviews are conducted by random sampling the results show that the minimum farmers wta for transferring seed maize maize and seed watermelon saved irrigation water to the local ecological sector are 0 53 rmb per mÂ³ 0 24 rmb per mÂ³ and 2 09 rmb per mÂ³ respectively and they are between the shadow price of agricultural water use in typical irrigation zones and the value of water resource ecological services this indicates not only that the evaluation of farmers wta can promote the coordinated development of economy society ecology but also that differentiated ecological compensation standards are needed on the edge of the oasis in the heihe river basin if the compensation period is ten years the total cost of this ecological compensation project is approximately 469 million rmb in addition the study also reveals that the start up bid irrigation cost cultivated land area proportion of agricultural labour and compensation policies variables have a positive impact on farmers wta whereas the proportion of agricultural income and the impact of land desertification and salinization ecological wetland degradation and wind sand weather on production and life variables have a negative effect furthermore the findings indicate that cash agricultural subsidies and in kind subsidies are the most acceptable compensation modes graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecological compensation standard farmers willingness to accept compensation dbcvm desert oasis ecotone heihe river basin 1 introduction water scarcity and the competition for water between the economy and ecology are becoming more intense in inland river basins worldwide micklin 1988 for thousands of years people living in inland river basins have expanded the scale of oasis agriculture to support thriving communities by changing land use patterns and irrigation methods wei et al 2010 especially in recent decades given rapid population growth and socio economic development the consumption of oasis agricultural water has increased dramatically and diminished the water available for ecological processes ji et al 2006 cheng et al 2014 li et al 2020 this has created a challenge common to many of the inland river basins in north western china i e the tarim river basin shiyanghe river basin shule river basin and heihe river basin feng et al 2001 farmers oasis expansion behaviour especially in the desert oasis ecotone can substantially modify the catchment hydrological cycle by changing land use and irrigation methods qi and luo 2006 fraiture et al 2010 which not only has negative impacts on the economic and ecosystem development in the downstream of river basins lu et al 2015 but also leads to a series of severe ecological disasters in the local ecological environment liu et al 2018 such as land desertification and salinization wetland degradation and wind sand weather these issues have attracted the attention of the government and scholars compensatory conservation has gained wide acceptance as an effective method for protecting ecosystems and at least 56 countries had established laws or policies that require compensatory conservation in 2014 shang et al 2018 ecological compensation is an important compensatory mechanism for internalising negative environmental externalities that originated in the 1970s in america brown and lant 1999 in 1976 the german federal nature conservation act required compensatory measures to be taken to keep the essential functions of nature and of the landscape unaltered after a project may et al 2017 currently ecological compensation is frequently employed worldwide such as the north carolina ecosystem enhancement programme in america the ecological compensation proposal for mt cass wind farm of new zealand the returning farmland to forests and paddy to dryland initiatives above the miyun reservoir of china etc gao et al 2019 many scholars have studied the standards and mode of watershed ecological compensation in china and worldwide moreno sanchez et al 2012 peng et al 2018 gao et al 2019 although in theory the ecological compensation standard ecs should be set between the opportunity cost of loss and the value of ecological services provided engel et al 2008 many studies hold different viewpoints for the setting of ecs for example kosoy et al 2007 noted that it is feasible to establish a regional ecs based on farmers participation castro 2001 and kosoy et al 2007 believed that opportunity cost could be used as the minimum ecs in a river basin and giannoccaro et al 2017 xie et al 2017 feng et al 2018 and haile et al 2019 evaluated the ecs from the perspective of respondents willingness to pay wtp willingness to accept compensation wta by contrast salzman et al 2018 showed that the value of ecosystem services can serve as the basis for a reasonable ecs setting in addition some scholars such as munoz pina et al 2008 indicated that the ecs should be set according to a principle such as the pareto optimal or regional fairness munoz pina et al 2008 jin et al 2014 most of the existing literature has studied the ecological compensation mechanism ecm among the up mid and downstream sections of a river basin but less attention has been paid to the ecm between the agricultural sector and the ecological sector in inland river basins existing studies also often took family as a vital unit to evaluate wtp wta but rarely explored the farmers wta per unit of water based on the crop division at the edge of an oasis in a river basin the main reason may be that a lack of statistics on the amount of crop saved irrigation water at the micro level limits further research moreover few studies have discussed whether an ecs based on farmers wtp wta can promote the coordinated development of economy society ecology from the perspective of sustainable watershed development the difference in shadow prices between different sectors is the driving force promoting water reallocation wang et al 2015 if the ecs can restore the value of ecological water services without reducing agricultural added value the benefits of the river basin can be promoted the shadow price of ecological water can be expressed as the non market value added per unit of ecological water khan and zhao 2019a therefore to fill a gap in the literature and provide a reference for the establishment of ecs on the edge of an oasis this study attempts to evaluate how much farmers should be compensated for water reallocation from agricultural irrigation water to the local ecological sector and determine whether farmers wta is between the shadow price of agricultural water and the value of water ecological services the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in north western china the oasis in the midstream of the hrb has become an important grain and vegetable commodity production base with a long agricultural development history and the proportion of agricultural water consumption has been approximately 94 for decades however with the rapid population growth socio economic development and implementation of the ecological water diversion project zhang et al 2018 the cropland area at the edge of the oasis in 2018 increased by approximately 75 compared with 2001 zhou et al 2017 farmers behaviours driven by pursuing maximum profits such as expanding the cropland area increasing irrigation water per acre and growing water intensive crops led to the reuse of agricultural water saved by high efficiency irrigation technologies in the large scale expansion of agricultural production zhang et al 2009 2014 zhou et al 2017 this not only reduced the effectiveness of the pilot water saving society project li et al 2015 but also led to more serious ecological problems such as land desertification sandstorms ecological wetland degradation and groundwater recession at the desert oasis ecotone midstream with the implementation of the most stringent water resources management system the contradiction between the agricultural sector and the ecological sector will become more prominent the implementation opinions on improving the ecological protection compensation mechanism in zhangye city and management regulations of the hrb also take the establishment of ecm and increased ecological water use as the ultimate goals of water resource management however a relatively complete ecm has not been established in the hrb studies show that there is some potential to improve the technical efficiency of crop irrigation teci in typical irrigation zones li et al 2019b and transferring saved irrigation water tsiw to the local ecological sector is one effective way to curb the expansion of the oasis and improve the ecological environment li et al 2019a however the reduction in agricultural water use will reduce farmers welfare level and ecological compensation policies need to be established haregeweyn et al 2012 to promote the coordinated development of the economy society ecology the ecs should be between the shadow price of the agricultural sector and the value of the water resource ecological services therefore this study will estimate farmers wta to determine the ecs for tsiw to the local ecological sector on the desert oasis ecotone of the hrb based on the results of the teci li et al 2019b and determine whether farmers wta is between the shadow price of the agricultural sector and the value of water resource ecological services at present most of the existing literature on ecological compensation in the hrb is based on qualitative analysis wang et al 2013b and only a few studies use a stated preference technique such as the contingent valuation method cvm or a choice experiment ce to estimate the value of ecosystem services based on residents wtp wta for example zhang et al 2004 estimated that the average maximum wtp of households in the hrb for ecosystem service restoration was 182 38 rmb per household per year based on a double bounded dichotomous choice xu et al 2018 estimated that the residents in the midstream of the hrb had an average wtp to improve ecosystem services of 249 46 rmb per household per year based on the ce model khan and zhao 2019a and wu 2017 built a ce model and determined that the value of ecosystem services was approximately 1 108 billion rmb by calculating the wtp for improvements in the local ecosystem upstream midstream and downstream of the hrb which was approximately 593 249 and 1093 rmb per household per year respectively the factors influencing the wtp wta are also considered including start up bids feng et al 2018 farmers demographic and sociological characteristics khan and zhao 2019a cultivated land traits farmers environmental protection consciousness macdonald et al 2010 market risk luo et al 2016 etc this study will evaluate farmers wta and analyse the influencing factors based on existing studies and farmer surveys moreover although ce is the most widely indicated technique when the attributes are relevant and understandable hanley et al 2001 it is more difficult for the interviewee to understand the questions this study investigates the farmers wta for each service provision and not considering the farmers attributes therefore cvm is adopted the aim of this study is to quantify how much compensation paid to farmers will promote them to transfer agricultural irrigation water to the local ecological sector which can promote the coordinated development of local economic society and ecological construction the main objectives are to evaluate farmers wta distinguished by regions and crops and its determinants assess farmers preferences for compensation methods and determine whether it is reasonable to take this wta as a scientific reference for setting differentiated ecs for tsiw to the local ecological sector on the edge of the oasis in the hrb 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area the hrb is located in the middle part of the hexi corridor in the arid region of northwestern china geographically there are three major geomorphological units in the region from south to north they are the southern qilian mountains in the upstream region the middle hexi corridor and the northern alxa high plain in the lower reaches it covers an area of approximately 130 000 km2 the midstream and part of the upstream region of the hrb are located in zhangye city gansu province and the downstream region is located in the ejin banner inner mongolia the midstream part in zhangye city is an irrigated agriculture economic zone that consists of five counties districts ganzhou and linze in the plain irrigation zone piz minle and shandan in the mountain irrigation zone miz and gaotai in the northern desert irrigation zone ndiz due to differences in natural conditions the crop planting structure is obviously different among the irrigation zones seed maize maize and vegetables are mainly grown in the piz cotton maize wheat intercrop and seed watermelon in the ndiz and wheat potato maize and barley in the miz studies show that there is a certain space to improve the teci in typical irrigation zones the average amount of irrigation water for seed maize maize and seed watermelon are 12 108 m3 per hm2 10 816 m3 per hm2 and 6570 m3 per hm2 and the teci are 0 6553 0 6185 and 0 6518 respectively li et al 2019a 2019b measures such as rationally determining the planting scale improving water conservancy facilities rationally using well irrigation and enhancing the flexibility of river water irrigation can improve the teci in the hrb the average amount of saved water is approximately 4174 m3 per hm2 4126 m3 per hm2 and 2294 m3 per hm2 respectively li et al 2019a 2019b linze in the piz and gaotai in the ndiz are located at the edge of the oasis in the midstream of the hrb the cropland area of linze and gaotai in 2018 was 30 180 hm2 and 38 327 hm2 an increase of 72 45 and 77 27 over 2001 respectively these two counties districts are the main region experiencing deterioration in the ecological environment due to the expansion of an oasis the shadow price of agricultural water in the different irrigation zones is approximately 0 22 rmb per mÂ³ which is basically equal to the agricultural water price wang et al 2013a this indicates that water resources are in surplus relative to land resources and that the cost of ecological compensation for transferring saved agricultural water may be lower the value of water resource ecosystem services in the hrb is approximately 4 69 rmb per mÂ³ wu 2017 the difference between the shadow price of agricultural and ecological water is a key prerequisite for water reallocation the sample sites will mainly choose farmers who grow seed maize and maize in pingchuan liaoquan and yanuan towns linze county and farmers who grow seed watermelon in the town of luocheng gaotai county 2 2 dbcvm model cvm is a main stated preference method in which the interviewee is offered an amount to pay or accepts a certain good or service provision level in constructed hypothetical markets cvm is rooted in lancaster s value theory lancaster 1966 and is consistent with thurstone s random utility theory thurstone 1929 the economic theory underlying cvm assumes that the stated price yields the highest utility for the respondent the minimum wta is the appropriate measure in a situation in which a respondent is asked to voluntarily give up a good carson 2000 in this study it is assumed that there are differences in farmers preferences for market and environmental goods i e water resources a farmer s consumption of market goods q depends on disposable income y and the price p of the market goods and they are free to choose however in terms of the consumption of environmental goods water resources e farmers cannot choose freely the utility function of farmers is u q e and under the premise of fixed disposable income farmers seek to maximise utility the conditional demand function of market goods i is q i h i p e y and the indirect utility function is v p e y u h p e y e if p and e are unchanged to achieve the utility level u the minimum expenditure function of market goods can be expressed as y y p e u in fig 2 the initial status of personal consumption is at a0 and the utility is at the level represented by the u0 curve when a farmer s consumption of water resources decreases from e0 to e1 theoretically the level of utility will drop to u1 and the farmer s status will change to a1 where u 0 q e 0 u 1 q e 1 however because farmers will also enjoy the benefits from improvements in the ecological environment the actual level of utility will be at the u2 curve slightly higher than u1 and the status will change to a2 monetary compensation must be given to farmers to maintain the same level of utility u0 wta y1 y2 is the minimum compensation amount that ensures that farmers utility remains unchanged after the transfer of irrigation water among different possible cvm approaches such as single bounded dichotomous choice sbdc double bounded dichotomous choice dbdc and open ended cvm the most widely applied approach dbdc is selected hanemann et al 1991 demonstrated that the dbdc is statistically more efficient than sbdc and requires a lower level of precision to elicit the wta of the respondents especially when there are fewer observations the double bounded logistics model reduces the variance in the estimated parameters significantly and there is a consistent decline in the co variance term in comparison to the sbdc method cheng et al 2006 this immediately translates into a tighter confidence interval around the median wta the efficiency of the double bounded contingent valuation method dbcvm lies in the fact that it defines more precise boundaries for the wta in a closer neighbourhood of the wta than that allowed for by the single bounded contingent valuation method sbcvm following hanemann median wta and mean wta are estimated because the farmer s answer is in the form of yes or no this study uses the logit model for estimation and the functional formula is 1 y a b x c w Îµ where x refers to the bid value w refers to the social economic variables that affect the farmers wta Îµ is the perturbation term and a b c are parameters there are two possibilities for y namely y 1 y e s or y 0 n o when the farmer answers no y 0 2 Îµ a b x c w if f is the distribution function the probability that the farmer answers no

then based on the response to the initial question 2 is he she willing to accept a higher or lower premium follow up bid if the response to the start up bid is yes then a lower follow up bid is presented and if the response to the start up bid is no then a higher follow up bid is presented based on these two questions the following four possible outcomes for the wta exercise are obtained a

response category of individual respondent i 2 3 questionnaire design and farmer survey the dbcvm questionnaire consists of three main sections the first section illustrates the current situation of ecological environment deterioration and the future harm it will cause on the edge of the oasis and determines the main attributes and the value level of irrigation water for farmers the second section surveys the farmers environmental protection consciousness and the final section collects information on the respondents age educational level family size and income level in the first section building on relevant studies regional development planning documents and preliminary surveys this study divides the main attributes of irrigation water for farmers into three ecological attributes and one wta attribute the ecological attributes include saline alkali land area the number of days of sand wind weather and the total shelter belt area table 1 lists the levels and explanations of the main attributes table 2 shows the questionnaire with seed maize as an example it should be noted that compared to the opportunity cost per unit of water farmers can more clearly express the impact of transferring agricultural water through the cost benefit per unit of land therefore this study investigates the farmers wta by considering the saved water for the unit of land as a whole we also investigated farmers preference on ecological compensation modes there are two main investigated ecological compensation modes monetary compensation and non monetary compensation the modes of monetary compensation mainly includes cash agricultural subsidy pension to guarantee old farmers life education subsidy to guarantee rural children s education and small loans the non monetary compensation mainly includes in kind subsidy such as agricultural machinery fertiliser subsidies and seeds technology subsidy such as key technologies for agricultural disaster prevention and reduction stabilizing and increasing production soil testing and formula fertilisation technology and non agricultural employment mainly offered to young people to collect the data for the current study a survey was conducted in july and august 2019 and a well designed and pretested questionnaire was employed among a sample taken from the population of the typical irrigation zones at the edge of the oasis after screening and removing the incomplete questionnaires a total of 1711 questionnaires were conducted in 22 villages 4 towns and 2 counties due to the complexity of the questionnaire and the inclusion of rural and less educated people the number of questionnaires was allocated according to the differences in the number of households in different villages and face to face interviews were conducted by random sampling by providing clarification the interviewers could assist the respondents and thus reduce any problems related to understanding the questions the survey was carried out by well trained university graduates the survey questionnaire meets the requirements of a large sample of cvm the specific sample is shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 survey results 3 1 1 impact of sample characteristics on the farmers wta table 3 shows the impact of the sample characteristics on farmers wta in typical irrigation zones first the farmers who grow seed maize maize and seed watermelon are mostly between the ages of 45 and 64 and the average age is 51 52 and 53 respectively the households that are highly dependent on agricultural income are also mainly composed of people in the same age group further 91 of this age group are willing to accept ecological compensation however this proportion is lower than the proportion of farmers younger than 45 and older than 65 96 this difference might be because people over 65 cannot afford heavy agricultural labour while young labourers are generally seasonal laborers and spend most of the year working outside and only stay at home when they are busy with agriculture second although a higher education level leads to a higher proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation 90 of farmers have an education level below junior middle school suggesting that education did not lead to a significant difference between the groups third among the farmers who grow seed maize and seed watermelon households with less than 50 agricultural labour have a higher willingness to be compensated than those with more than 50 agricultural labour however this was not obvious for maize the influence of cultivated land characteristics on farmers wta is obvious in general the larger the area of cultivated land is and the worse its quality the higher the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept ecological compensation the average cultivated land area of farmers in a typical irrigation zone is approximately 1 hm2 for farmers with 0 0 67 hm2 and 0 68 1 33 hm2 of cultivated land the larger the cultivated land area is the higher the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation the proportions are 91 and 94 respectively however when the cultivated land area is higher than 1 33 hm2 the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation 93 no longer increases the reason is that most of these farmers who cultivated more than 1 33 hm2 rented the land from the others thus they considered that the ecological compensation might be paid to the landowners not the actual land users the quality of cultivated land mainly refers to characteristics such as the saline alkali level flatness ability to hold water and fertiliser etc the salinity and desertification levels of cultivated land on the edge of the oasis region are relatively high the quality of cultivated land that is used for maize and seed watermelon is relatively poor the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation is approximately 92 and 96 respectively while the quality of cultivated land grown with seed maize is relatively good therefore the effect of quality on these farmers wta is not clear since 2017 linze has implemented a comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices that is based on an agricultural water price of 30 rmb per hm2 and 0 168 rmb per mÂ³ if the actual irrigation water used for seed maize or maize exceeds 10 30 of the irrigation quota the charge for the excess irrigation water will be 1 2 times the water price if it exceeds 30 50 of the irrigation quota the charge for the excess irrigation water will be 1 5 times the water price if it exceeds 50 of the irrigation quota the charge will be 2 times the water price according to the industrial water quota of gansu province the irrigation quota for corn is 7200 mÂ³ per hm2 therefore if the amount of crop irrigation water does not exceed 7200 mÂ³ per hm2 the irrigation cost will not be higher than 1383 6 rmb per hm2 if it does not exceed 10 30 beyond the irrigation quota the irrigation cost is 1383 6 1862 25 rmb per hm2 if it does not exceed the irrigation quota by 30 50 the irrigation cost is between 1862 25 and 2253 9 rmb per hm2 if it exceeds the irrigation quota by 50 the irrigation cost will exceed 2253 9 rmb however the irrigation costs for most of the seed maize farmers are more than 2253 9 rmb per hm2 and the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation is as high as 91 3 for nearly 80 of farmers the field corn irrigation costs exceed 2253 9 rmb and as the irrigation costs increase the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation shows a clear upward trend finally although gaotai did not implement a progressive price increase system the average irrigation cost for watermelon production is 3300 rmb per hm2 and the higher the irrigation cost is the higher the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation agricultural subsidies and pensions are the main types of subsidies received by farmers in plain irrigation zones agricultural subsidies pension subsidies grassland subsidies and public welfare forest subsidies are the main types of subsidies received by farmers in northern desert irrigation zones the more satisfied farmers are with the subsidy policy the higher the proportion of farmers who are willing to accept compensation 3 1 2 analysis of farmers environmental protection consciousness land salinization desertification groundwater recession eco environment degradation and wind sand weather are the main factors affecting farmers lives and production 75 of the farmers who grow seed maize a total of 709 respondents and maize a total of 597 respondents in the piz believe that land salinization and desertification affect their lives and production seriously or very seriously and 74 of them believe that wind sand weather affects their lives and production seriously or very seriously however 41 of them believe that the impact of groundwater recession is at an acceptable level and 50 of them believe that the impact of ecological wetland degradation on their lives and production is acceptable in the ndiz 94 of the farmers who grow seed watermelon a total of 405 respondents believe that land salinization and desertification affect their lives and production seriously or very seriously and 87 of them think that wind sand weather affects their lives and production seriously or very seriously however only 42 of them think that groundwater recession will have a serious impact on their production and lives and 37 of them think that ecological wetland degradation will have a serious impact the level of farmers environmental protection consciousness is mainly judged by their answers to the following questions 1 do you think that the reclaimed land is crowding out ecological water 2 do you think that transferring the saved irrigation water to the ecological sector can improve the ecological environment 3 do you think that returning farmland can improve the ecological environment table 4 shows that most farmers do not clearly know whether reclamation is crowding out ecological water the reason may be that the previous generation had cultivated the land and the environmental problems at that time had not yet been highlighted in addition some farmers believe that reclamation is an act of protecting land and has not crowded out ecological water however 79 of the 1711 respondents believe that returning farmland can improve the ecological environment and 65 of them think that transferring the saved irrigation water to the ecological sector can improve the ecological environment the main reason may be the long term impact of water diversion from the middle reaches to the downstream leading to changes in farmers environmental protection concepts 3 1 3 outcomes of the wta questions of tsiw table 5 illustrates the outcomes of farmers wta questions for tsiw as the start up bid increases the probability of respondents answering yes increases but as the follow up bid decreases the probability of respondents answering no increases it can be seen that farmers always expect higher compensation in the case of a start up bid of 6000 rmb per hm2 for seed maize nearly 90 131 respondents of the farmers 142 respondents are willing to accept this compensation but when the follow up bid is reduced to 4500 rmb per hm2 73 respondents of the 131 respondents 51 41 will also accept it and the probability of acceptance by the farmers remains higher than that of rejection 40 85 this result shows that 4500 rmb per hm2 may be the input output balance point for farmers 3 2 farmers wta and its determinants 3 2 1 explanatory variables according to relevant studies and farmer household surveys the explanatory variables influencing farmers wta are determined based on the following six factors feng et al 2018 khan and zhao 2019a may et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 macdonald 2010 start up bid farmers demographic and sociological characteristics cultivated land and household income traits irrigation traits compensation policies and farmers environmental protection consciousness the specific variables are shown in table 6 and the statistical descriptions are shown in table 7 factors such as irrigation water sources irrigation technology agricultural water price market risk and follow up bid are not used as the main explanatory variables in this study the reasons are as follows 1 farmers in typical irrigation zones mainly use river water for flood irrigation and the differences in irrigation water sources and irrigation technology among farmers are small 2 different towns or villages in the same county district have the same agricultural water price policy and the differences in farmers irrigation traits are mainly reflected in irrigation cost per mu 3 the prices of seed maize seed watermelon and maize are all affected by market factors and 4 the start up bid and the follow up bid value have high multiple collinearity 3 2 2 regression results for the factors influencing farmers wta the econometric software stata12 0 is used for analysis table 8 highlights the coefficients and significance of all the variables of the different models the seed maize maize and seed watermelon logistic models were significant with wald chi2 199 65 p 0 0000 0 01 wald chi2 92 35 p 0 0000 0 01 and wald chi2 72 73 p 0 0000 0 01 respectively these results indicate that the regression equation is overall significant and has strong explanatory power according to formulas 7 8 and 13 the mean and median wta of farmers growing seed maize are 5495 7 rmb per hm2 and 2193 75 rmb per hm2 respectively the mean and the median wta of farmers growing maize are 1378 05 rmb per hm2 and 977 7 rmb per hm2 respectively and the mean and the median wta of farmers growing seed watermelon are 5795 25 rmb per hm2 and 4801 05 rmb per hm2 respectively according to the survey we found that the wta of farmers planting seed maize varied greatly because the water resources were relatively abundant in areas where seed maize was planted in addition to considering the loss of irrigation costs farmers here also considered whether water transfer would cause reductions in crop yield and income this led to a large span of the bidding value of farmers wta however the benefit of seed watermelon production was higher and farmers here only considered the decrease in income due to the decrease in water quantity when considering wta maize was mostly planted on saline alkali land since this type of land has lower and more self sufficient oriented production farmers mostly considered land transfer costs and irrigation costs when considering wta therefore the difference between the mean and median wta was relatively small here thus this study suggests that the median wta is a more reasonable benchmark based on the average amount of irrigation water and the teci results the average amount of saved water for seed maize maize and seed watermelon are approximately 4174 m3 per hm2 4126 m3 per hm2 and 2294 m3 per hm2 respectively li et al 2019a 2019b therefore the ecological compensation per unit water of seed maize maize and seed watermelon is estimated to be 0 53 rmb per mÂ³ 0 24 rmb per mÂ³ and 2 09 rmb per mÂ³ respectively given that the ecss are between 0 22 and 4 69 rmb per mÂ³ ecological compensation according to these results can not only improve the optimal allocation of water resources but also achieve the sustainable development of the river basin furthermore according to the 2018 statistical yearbook of linze county and gaotai county the planting area of seed maize and maize are 12 976 hm2 and 10 338 hm2 respectively in linze county and the planting area seed watermelon is 1694 hm2 in gaotai county if the ecological compensation period is 10 years the total cost of transferring saved agricultural water is approximately 469 million rmb based on farmers wta the regression results of the main influencing factors are as follows 1 the variable lnbid is significant at a 1 significance level and the coefficient is positive in the three models which indicates that with other conditions unchanged the higher the start up bid value is the higher the willingness of farmers to accept compensation and transfer saved irrigation water to the local ecological sector haile et al 2019 2 first variable d1 is not significant in the three models its coefficient is negative in the seed maize model but positive in the maize and seed watermelon models the reason may be that the age of the respondents is mostly concentrated between 45 and 65 and the difference is small which makes age not significant for farmers wta second variable d2 is significant at the 5 and 10 significance levels in the maize and seed watermelon models respectively and its coefficient is positive in all three models these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged the higher the education level of the farmers is the higher their willingness to accept compensation and the more willing they are to transfer the saved irrigation water to the local ecological environment this finding is in line with expectations khan and zhao 2019a 2019b finally variable lnral is significant only at the 1 level in the seed watermelon model and its coefficient is positive in all three models these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged the more agricultural labour there is the higher the efficiency of irrigation water use and the higher the willingness of farmers to accept compensation 3 the variable lnnp is significant at the 10 and 5 significance levels and the coefficient is positive in the seed maize and seed watermelon models it is not significant in the maize model and the coefficient is negative the variable lnrrla is significant only at a 5 significance level in the maize model and the coefficient is negative the variable d3 is significant only at a 10 significance level in the maize model and the coefficient is positive in all three models these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged for farmers who grow seed maize and seed watermelon the larger the number of farmland plots is the larger the scale of production and the higher their willingness to accept compensation the main reason is that the implementation of the ecological compensation policy for transferring irrigation water has a more obvious impact on these farmers planting scale and agricultural income and farmers can obtain more compensation xie et al 2017 however for farmers who grow maize the higher the proportion of cultivated land area is the lower the willingness of farmers to accept compensation whereas the worse the quality of cultivated land is the higher their willingness to accept compensation the reason is that most of the maize is planted on poor quality saline alkali land considering that the transfer of irrigation water may lead to the return of farmland and reduce the agricultural income farmers will demand higher compensation moreover the variable lnrai is significant only at the 1 significance level in the seed watermelon model and the coefficient is negative in the three models these results show that the higher the proportion of agricultural income is the lower the willingness of farmers to accept compensation giannoccaro et al 2017 4 the variable lnic is significant at the 5 significance level and the coefficient is positive in the three models these results show that the higher the irrigation costs are the higher the willingness of farmers to accept compensation and the lower the amount of compensation they will accept the variable d4 is significant only at the 1 significance level in the seed maize model and the coefficient is positive in the three models 5 the variable d5 is not significant in the three models and its coefficients are positive in the seed maize and seed watermelon models but negative in the maize model the coefficients of variables d6 d8 and d9 are all negative in the three models but their significance is different the variable d6 is significant only at the 5 significance level in the seed maize model the variable d9 is significant only at the 10 significance level in the maize model and the variable d8 is significant at the 5 5 and 10 significance levels in the seed maize maize and seed watermelon models respectively however unlike variables d6 d8 and d9 variable d7 is not significant and its coefficients are positive in the three models these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged the more serious farmers think the negative effects of land salinization desertification the degradation of ecological wetlands and wind sand weather are to production and living the higher their willingness to accept compensation and the lower the amount of compensation required he et al 2018 while the more serious farmers believe that the negative effects of groundwater recession are on production and life the lower their willingness to accept compensation the reason is when the surface water was transferred to the ecological sector farmers considered groundwater to be a supplement however once groundwater declines to some extent farmers will face the threat of shrinking cultivated land which will seriously affect their production and income therefore their required compensation is relatively high in the end the variable d10 is significant at the 5 significance level in the seed maize and maize models and its coefficients are negative in all three models the variable d11 is significant at the 1 and 10 significance levels in the maize and seed watermelon models and its coefficients are all positive these results indicate that with other conditions unchanged the higher the farmers environmental protection consciousness is the higher their willingness to accept compensation 3 3 farmers selection of ecological compensation mode table 9 shows the impact of key characteristics on farmers selection of ecological compensation modes in typical irrigation zones age education level the proportion of family in the agricultural labour force and the proportion of family agricultural income are the main factors influencing farmers to choose the ecological compensation mode generally farmers preferred monetary compensation to other modes of compensation within the monetary compensation modes farmers generally accepted cash and agricultural subsidies while farmers older than 60 or with a relatively high education level generally chose pensions ultimately only a few farmers with agriculture facilities chose small loans for other compensation methods in kind subsidies were more accepted by elder farmers older than 55 while non agricultural employment opportunities were more easily accepted by farmers younger than 45 years old and those with high education as they preferred more employment opportunities similarly technology subsidies are more easily accepted by young or highly educated farmers as they are more willing to develop water saving agriculture 4 discussions water scarcity and the competition for water between the economy and the ecology are major obstacles to water resource management on the edge of the oasis in the hrb this study pointed out that the ecs setting for tsiw to the local ecological sector should distinguish not only regions but also crops moreover this study can provide a scientific reference to establish water rights trading systems by evaluating the ecological compensation per unit of water of different crops the regression results also showed that irrigation costs and farmers environmental protection consciousness have a significant influence on farmers wta therefore the major research findings and their implications on practices and future research are as follows 4 1 differentiated ecs should be made according to the crop planting structure ecm has become an increasingly popular instrument to translate external non market environmental services into financial incentives for farmers to preserve the ecosystems that provide services however lack of spatial differentiation in the targeting mechanism may lead to efficiency losses wÃ¼nscher et al 2008 in this study to ensure the fairness and efficiency of ecological compensation policy considering the practice of ecological compensation the construction of ecm in the hrb should be based on different irrigation zones natural conditions and crop planting structures zhao and wang 2010 farmers wta is actually the opportunity cost of tsiw and may be affected by the cost benefit of different crops and the agricultural water prices of typical irrigation zones on the edge of the oasis due to different natural conditions there are differences in not only the agricultural water prices but also the net income per unit of water for crops in typical irrigation zones in the midstream of the hrb according to the farmer surveys the lowest value for the farmers wta considers only the irrigation cost and the highest value for the farmers wta considers the input and output of different crops the higher the net income per unit water of crops is the higher the farmers wta therefore by distinguishing regions and crops this study has considered and excluded factors that affect farmers wta such as agricultural water prices and crop planting structure to ensure that the findings are more scientific however within the same irrigation zone it is possible that the crop planting structure would change because of substantial differences in ecss from crops therefore it is more appropriate to set up compensation methods such as agricultural subsidies as planting areas instead of land areas additionally to implement better ecological compensation besides government compensation market means such as water rights trading should also be introduced to gradually enrich the compensation modes 4 2 establishing an ecm by improving the water rights trading market financial subsidies and water rights trading are the main modes for implementing ecological compensation policies however in the long run an ecological compensation mode that relies on government financial input is not feasible in australia and the united states markets in water have opened up over several decades leonard et al 2019 compared with those countries however in china water rights are not as tradable metering is poor and plots are tiny water rights trading has mostly been by water user associations made up of several hundred farmers but this dampens the incentives that make markets effective bekchanov et al 2015 lewis and zheng 2019 at the beginning of the 21st century the hrb was committed to establishing a water rights trading market however due to the imperfect water pricing mechanism and the high cost of water rights trading its effect has not been obvious zhang 2007 this study estimates that the ecological compensation per unit water for seed maize maize and seed watermelon is 0 53 rmb per mÂ³ 0 24 rmb per mÂ³ and 2 09 rmb per mÂ³ respectively these standards are between the shadow price of agricultural water use in typical irrigation zones and the value of water resource ecological services this shows that it is reasonable to take the ecs as the transaction water price which can promote the coordinated development of the economy and ecology for towns at the edge of the oasis in the hrb furthermore the ecss evaluated in this study are between different sectors within the same irrigation zone this does not involve the transfer of water resources across different regions or river basins and the cost of water rights transactions is lower therefore to improve the implementation opinions on improving ecological protection compensation mechanism in zhangye city and management regulations of the hrb and promote the coordinated development of watershed economy society ecology the conclusions of this study can provide a scientific reference for the establishment of water rights trading systems 4 3 adjusting ecs based on comprehensive reform of agricultural water price a water price increase has been used as an effective method to guarantee national water security and maintain national food security in israel water scarcity is an increasing problem the current water pricing scheme supplies potable water to municipalities at fees above the supply costs and subsidizes water delivered to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors luckmann et al 2016 on the one hand israel has established a compensation fund to subsidize agricultural water fees on the other hand it has adopted economic incentives to strengthen agricultural water management imposing fines on users who exceed water quotas and rewarding users who do not exceed water quotas to promote water saving irrigation therefore the reasonableness of the water price has a direct influence on people s attitude decision behaviour regarding willingness to pay and motivation for water conservation mu et al 2019 in 2017 the city of zhangye started to implement a comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices the price of agricultural water is no longer fixed but depends on the amount used for irrigation the regression results show that the variable irrigation costs are significant at the 5 significance level and the coefficients are positive in the three models the main reason for this result may be that many farmers consider ecological compensation for transferring saved agricultural water as compensation for paying high irrigation costs which may lead to policy bias in the results the comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices includes not only the water price collection system but also a series of subsidy policies to encourage farmers to save irrigation water tian et al 2017 however as far as the current implementation effect is concerned its water saving effect is not ideal and even increases farmers wta therefore the ecm formulation should use watershed sustainable development as the goal comprehensively consider the impact of the comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices and set diversified ecs to realise the reallocation of water resources from the agricultural sector to the ecological sector 4 4 improving the effectiveness of ecm by enhancing farmers participation as the largest water users farmers oasis expansion behaviour and compensation willingness directly determine the level of ecological compensation costs the regression results show that more serious farmers believe that the negative effects of ecological environment deterioration are on production and living the higher their willingness to accept compensation and the lower the amount of compensation required therefore to restrict farmers expansion behaviour and promote the transfer of saved irrigation water enhancing farmers environmental protection consciousness through government policies advertisements and the establishment of water user associations among others is necessary furthermore implementing the farmer participation policy in ecological compensation is an important way to achieve sustainable watershed management he et al 2018 the existing compensation policies in the hrb lack not only public participation but also low transparency which leads to some farmers being unwilling to accept ecological compensation farmers participation should be increased during the process of setting ecs to enhance the scientificity and democracy of policies finally the farmer survey also found that factors such as age educational level family size income level and crops planting structure affect farmers selection of the ecological compensation mode therefore to promote the implementation of the ecm it is necessary to formulate diversified ecological compensation modes to meet the needs of different farmers 5 conclusions this study evaluates the farmers wta for tsiw to the local ecological sector on the edge of oasis regions in the midstream of the hrb the main findings show that farmers wta for transferring irrigation water intended for seed maize maize and seed watermelon to the local ecological sector is 0 53 rmb per mÂ³ 0 24 rmb per mÂ³ and 2 09 rmb per mÂ³ respectively which are in the range of the ecss between 0 22 and 4 69 rmb per mÂ³ wang et al 2013a wu 2017 ecological compensation according to these standards can not only help to improve the optimal allocation of water resources but also help to achieve sustainable development of the river basin moreover if the ecological compensation period is 10 years the total cost of transferring saved agricultural water will be approximately 469 million rmb in the planting area of seed maize and maize in linze county and seed watermelon in gaotai county furthermore the study reveals that the start up bid irrigation cost cultivated land area proportion of agricultural labour and compensation policies variables have a positive impact on farmers wta whereas the proportion of agricultural income and the impact of land desertification and salinization ecological wetland degradation and wind sand weather on production and life variables have a negative effect finally the findings also show that cash agricultural subsidies and in kind subsidies are the payment modes with higher acceptance by farmers whereas pensions are generally accepted by farmers over the age of 60 years education subsidies and non agricultural employment opportunities are generally accepted by farmers younger than the age of 45 years and with higher education levels in contrast technology subsidies and small loans are accepted only by farmers with facility agriculture in addition this study has some limitations for example because the total planting area of seed maize maize and seed watermelon accounts for more than 85 of the total cultivated area in the desert oasis ecotone of the hrb this study has assessed farmers wta for tsiw of these crops to the local ecological sector however if the purpose of fully transferring saved agricultural water to the ecological sector is to be achieved evaluating farmers wta of all crop types such as field vegetables and other seed crops is necessary however in fact farmers who plant other crops are relatively scattered the planting area is relatively small and the planting pattern is more complicated which makes it difficult to evaluate farmers wta therefore this study does not consider the research of farmers wta of other crops

10153,spatial structural variations in ridge furrow unit size and its ratio can result in the drastic fluctuation of soil hydrothermal status and thereby affect water use and yield formation in dryland crops previous studies were little focused on the responses of dryland wheat productivity to the structural changes in ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm system and its mechanism in semiarid eastern african plateau eap a two year field experiment was conducted in juja a semiarid area in kenya from 2015 to 2016 there were seven treatments of ridge furrow width and ratios in randomized block design as follows 1 40 cm ridge width and 20 cm furrow width r4f2 the same below 2 r3f2 3 r2f2 4 r3f4 5 r2f4 6 r3f6 and 7 r2f6 and conventional flat planting without mulching as control ck the results showed that r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 r3f4 and r2f4 treatments significantly improved soil water storage and temperature across two growing seasons compared with ck p 0 05 among all the treatments r3f2 and r2f2 obviously achieved the highest plant height leaf area aboveground biomass agb grain yield and water use efficiency wue p 0 05 also r2f2 had the highest economic benefits in all treatments the optimal ridge furrow ratio appeared to be 1 32 1 38 1 28 1 31 1 39 1 49 1 37 1 45 and 1 46 1 56 for wheat yield agb wuey wueb and harvest index hi respectively in addition wheat yield agb wue and hi tended to decrease linearly with the increased ridge furrow unit size in conclusion ridge furrow ratio of 1 1 5 r2f2 to r3f2 in combination with the minimum ridge furrow unit size proved to be the optimum rfm system for the best dryland wheat productivity in accordance to regional soil and climate characteristics in semiarid eap and other similar areas of the world keywords ridge furrow ratio ridge furrow size plastic mulching wheat productivity eastern african plateau 1 introduction agricultural development is highly dependent on rainfall and has long been an important economic sector for many countries in sub saharan africa ssa lipper et al 2014 however crop productivity of african smallholders is severely affected by climate change with the features of the raised temperature and the frequent and intensified droughts and floods mÃ¼ller et al 2011 waha et al 2013 in this context rainwater harvesting rwh practices with reducing surface runoff have resulted in more efficient use of rainwater for the local crop growth and yield stabilization particularly in dry areas fox and rockstrÃ¶m 2000 kahinda et al 2010 in recent years rwh technologies are widely practiced in eastern african plateau eap ngigi et al 2005 haregeweyn et al 2010 pachpute et al 2009 and southern africa mupangwa et al 2006 welderufael et al 2013 where rainwater is collected in contour bunds and terraces for direct uptake by crops or stored in tanks ponds and reservoirs for supplementary irrigation however the adoption of rwh practices by smallholder farmers in ssa is limited due to high initial investment and labor intensive ngigi et al 2005 moreover the local rwh is not aimed directly at improving water use efficiency fox and rockstrÃ¶m 2000 and might lead to severe soil erosion vohland and barry 2009 in semiarid ssa crop transpiration is reported to account for less than one third of rainfall 50 75 of rainfall were lost by evaporation and surface runoff fox and rockstrÃ¶m 2000 therefore improving runoff harvesting and crop transpiration as well as reducing soil evaporation will inevitably be considered the efficient soil and water managements for advancing agricultural production in ssa ridge furrow with plastic mulching rfm greatly collected and retained rainwater through the alternative ridges and furrows and effectively reduced soil evaporation by plastic mulching gan et al 2013 mo et al 2017 previous studies demonstrated that rfm system had a substantial potential to improve crop yield water use efficiency wue and economic benefits in asia li et al 2004 sharma et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 ruidisch et al 2013 north america diazperez and batal 2002 europe munoz et al 2015 and eap wang et al 2016 mo et al 2017 luo et al 2020a 2020b in rfm system the plastic mulched ridges are used for collecting rainfall and mulched or unmulched furrows serve as the zones for storing rainwater and planting of crops therefore the ridge and furrow size width and its mutual ratio would be effective on the use of light and heavy rainfall and is the key for successful implementation of rfm in different climatic zones in the temperate semiarid areas of northwest china numerous studies found that ridge width had significant effects on soil hydrothermal status and crop productivity and the optimum ridge width associated with the highest crop yield was 45 cm in potato tian et al 2003 32 38 cm in oats wang et al 2015a 35 36 cm in alfalfa wang et al 2015b and 60 cm in winter wheat ren et al 2016 liu et al 2020 these studies suggested that the optimum ridge width tended to be middle and narrow because wider ridge reduced planting area that led to a negative effect on crop yield wang et al 2015b liu et al 2020 a wide furrow width of 60 cm was used in these studies mentioned above which made against soil moisture transfer from ridge side to middle ground of furrow especially in the light rains in this case the little water collection in the rhizospheric soil generally resulted in drought stress effect on crop growth welde and gebremariam 2016 previous studies also showed that crops grown in ridge sides are more likely to promote the photosynthesis root growth and grain yields those that grown away from the ridges ding et al 2006 f c li et al 2013 r li et al 2013 qu et al 2014 some other studies kept ridge and furrow within a same unit size ridge furrow and found that crop yield and wue were improved with increasing ridge furrow ratio such as 40 70 55 55 and 70 40 cm in maize li et al 2017 and 20 40 30 30 and 40 20 cm in wheat field li et al 2019 the optimum ridge furrow ratio is critically important to improve rainwater use efficiency and eventually increase crop productivity in semiarid areas gan et al 2013 previous researches focused little on the effects of integrated approaches of ridge furrow ratio and its unit size on the soil hydro thermal status crop growth and yield formation in addition it is so far unclear what is the optimum ridge furrow ratio and unit size for crop water use and productivity in tropical semiarid of eap where agricultural production is mostly constrained by the low and erratic rainfall wheat triticum aestivum l is the second important staple crop in most areas of eap doss et al 2003 in this study field experiment with local dryland wheat was conducted under various ridge furrow ratios and its unit sizes in a semiarid area of kenya the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to investigate the effects of different ridge furrow ratios and unit sizes on soil moisture soil temperature wheat growth yield formation wue and economic benefits 2 to provide experimental evidence for the optimum rfm system in accordance to regional soil and climate types in semiarid eap 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a field trial over two short rainy seasons from 2015 to 2016 was carried out in the experimental farm of jomo kenyatta university of agriculture and technology jkuat 01 05 s 37 00 e altitude 1530 m located at a semiarid climate region in the southwest of kenya with an average annual temperature of 19 8 c annual precipitation of 675 8 mm and potential evaporation 1650 5 mm average from 2009 to 2017 the annual rainfall is bimodal with long rains march july and short rains october december luo et al 2020b the climate is warmer and more rainfall occasionally takes place in the short rainy season relative to the long rainy season the distributions of precipitation and air temperature in the test years and the average for nine years 2009 2017 are shown in figs 1 and 2 soil

nitrogen 6 97 mg kg 1 available phosphorus ph of 6 36 and bulk density of 1 45 g cm 3 at the soil depth of 0 30 cm luo et al 2020b 2 2 experimental design and field management there were seven ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rfm treatments ridge and furrow width were 1 40 and 20 cm r4f2 2 30 and 20 cm r3f2 3 20 and 20 cm r2f2 4 30 and 40 cm r3f4 5 20 and 40 cm r2f4 6 30 and 60 cm r3f6 and 7 20 and 60 cm r2f6 therefore the ridge furrow ratios ridge furrow were 2 1 5 1 0 75 0 5 0 5 and 0 33 and the ridge furrow unit size ridge furrow were 60 50 40 70 60 90 and 80 cm respectively table 1 all rfm treatments were laid at the same ridge height at 15 cm a conventional flat planting without mulching was used as control ck a schematic diagram of different treatments is presented in fig 3 we used a completely randomized block design with three replicates based on the local practices the plots were also fertilized at low rates of 40 kg n ha 1 as urea 20 kg p2o5 ha 1 as triple superphosphate and 20 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulphate respectively all fertilizers were broadcast applied before planting except that nitrogen was fertilized twice 50 at sowing and another 50 at jointing stage respectively after fertilizer application the field was conventionally ploughed at pre sowing period in the first year and was divided into three blocks 24 plots in all and each plot area was 25 m2 5 5 m the ridges and furrows in all plots were manually established in 2015 and repaired in 2016 the local wheat cultivar njoro was seeded at a rate of 200 kg ha 1 with two rows in 20 cm furrows three rows in 40 cm furrows and four rows in 60 cm furrows on 19 november 2015 and 5 november 2016 respectively at maturity stage all plants were harvested manually on 9 february 2016 and 28 january 2017 after harvesting the residual plastic film was manually cleared in all of the plots the weeds were removed on the ridges and furrows according to farmer s practice throughout growing season and fallow period effective control of aphids and rust was performed by spraying imidacloprid and diniconazole separately at the booting stage of wheat 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 precipitation and temperature daily mean air temperature and rainfall data were measured by a meteorological station that was built next to the experimental field in january 2009 across two growing seasons soil temperature st was measured with a rc 5 instrument elitech co ltd jiangsu china at the soil depth of 10 cm st was determined from the average value for five days at wheat sowing jointing heading filling and maturing stages 2 3 2 plant height leaf area and yield components ten individual plants were randomly sampled at physiological maturity stage in each plot plant height leaf area and spike length were measured and recorded separately the samples were oven dried at 105 c for 1 h and 60 c for 48 h and separated into stems leaves and reproductive organs afterwards spike weight grain weight per spike grain number per spike and 1000 grain weight were measured and recorded in detail 2 3 3 soil water content and storage soil samples were taken at 0 140 cm depth in 20 cm intervals and determined soil gravimetric water content swc by oven drying 10 g moist soil at 105 c for 24 h before plot preparation three randomly 140 cm deep profile pits were excavated in the experimental site besides undisturbed soil core 100 cm3 from soil depth of 0 140 cm was collected to determine soil bulk density according to finn et al 2015 therefore volumetric soil water storage sws defined as wang et al 2016 mo et al 2016 sws mm swc Ïb g cm 3 sd mm where Ïb is soil bulk density 1 45 g cm 3 and sd is referred to as the given soil depth 2 3 4 grain yield and water use efficiency wheat plants within one square meter were harvested at maturing stages in each plot to measure grain yield total above ground biomass agb and spike number crop growth was completely dependent on precipitation without irrigation and runoff was prevented by ridges around each plot rock stratum commonly occurs below 140 cm at experimental site which prevents water drainage to the deeper layer therefore evapotranspiration et mm was calculated as according to the following formula et r Î´sws where r is total rainfall during the wheat growing season Î´sws mm is obtained by calculating the difference between the sws at the beginning and the end of growing season finally the water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 for grain yield wuey and above ground biomass wueb were computed using the following formulas luo et al 2020b wuey y et wueb b et where y is grain yield and b is above ground biomass respectively 2 3 5 economic benefits the major inputs were sum labor and cost of seeds plastic film fertilizer and agro chemicals total labor input used for field work consisted of plot preparation rfm making field managements sowing and harvesting according to the local currency 100 kenyan shillings ksh was equivalent to 1 us dollar us the labor input was valued at 4 us per day 8 h according to local wage standards the prices of all applied material inputs plastic film seeds fertilizers and pesticides were determined by local market price at that time the inputs of rfm making and plastic film material varied with the ridge furrow ratios the output refers to the value of the wheat grain and hay biomass the output price was identified based on farm gate price as 0 6 and 0 03 us per kilogram for wheat grain and stover respectively finally the net income was estimated using the difference between outputs and inputs and the benefit cost ratio was calculated by dividing output by the input 2 4 statistical analysis the effect of ridge furrow ratio treatment on soil water soil temperature wheat yield wue plant height leaf area yield components and economic benefits were evaluated by one way analysis of variance anova for two years the statistical differences among grouped means were assessed using the post hoc tukey s hsd test after homogeneity of variances for multiple comparisons at p 0 05 statistical analyses were carried out using the spss

significantly increased grain weight and grain number per spike as well as the spike number whereas the spike weight and thousand grain weight did not change relative to ck in both years in general r4f2 r3f2 and r2f2 had the highest levels of all the yield components r3f4 and r2f4 achieved somewhat lower yield components while the lowest yield components were observed in r3f6 r2f6 and ck 3 5 wheat grain yield biomass and wue ridge furrow ratio was significant for et wheat grain yield aboveground biomass wue and hi in both years p 0 001 table 3 et for r3f6 and r2f6 treatments did not differ significantly compared with that for ck but for other ridge furrow ratios was significantly lower than ck all ridge furrow ratio treatments significantly increased grain yield aboveground biomass and wue compared with ck in both years the highest grain yield agb wuey and wueb were produced by r2f2 in 2015 and 2016 and increased by 83 8 and 90 3 65 and 64 5 103 4 and 115 4 and 82 6 and 86 3 compared with ck respectively however the optimal range for grain yield and agb were produced by r3f2 and r2f2 in 2015 and by r3f2 r2f2 and r3f4 in 2016 and for wuey and wueb were achieved under r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 and r3f4 in 2015 and under r3f2 r2f2 and r3f4 in 2016 there was no significant difference in the optimal range of ridge furrow ratio hi under r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 r3f4 and r2f4 did not show difference but significantly increased than that under ck wheat grain yield agb wuey wueb and hi had significant polynomial correlation with ridge furrow ratio i e ridge width furrow width p 0 001 fig 6a e and significantly declined linearly as ridge furrow unit i e ridge width furrow width p 0 001 fig 6f j grain yield agb wuey wueb and hi increased at first and then started to decrease with the growth of ridge furrow ratio in both years fig 6a e the ridge furrow ratios associated with the highest grain yield agb wuey wueb and hi in 2015 and 2016 were 1 38 and 1 32 1 31 and 1 28 1 49 and 1 39 1 45 and 1 37 and 1 56 and 1 46 respectively the optimum ridge furrow ratio for grain yield agb wuey wueb was between r3f2 and r2f2 while grain yield agb wuey wueb and hi decreased linearly with the increase of ridge furrow unit in both years and the maximum value was at 40 cm i e r2f2 fig 6f j 3 6 economic benefits ridge furrow ratio treatment had significant effects on net return and the ratio

higher than ck while in terms of weeds control were decreased by 54 3 31 4 and 8 6 compared with ck the material input from plastic mulching was 680 3 664 638 7 610 9 587 1 546 1 524 9 and 382 dollars per hectare under r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 r3f4 r2f4 r3f6 r2f6 and ck respectively the total input and output decreased in the sequence of r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 r3f4 r2f4 r3f6 r2f6 and ck consequently r2f2 had the greatest net income and the ratio of output to input in both years compared with ck r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 r3f4 r2f4 and r3f6 harvested significantly higher net economic income in both years the ratio of output to input for r2f2 and r3f4 was significantly greater than ck but that for r4f2 was lower than ck in 2016 3 7 the relationships of the wheat agronomical traits with soil water storage and temperature under different ridge furrow ratios a principal component analysis pca was performed to investigate the relationships of main agronomical traits grain yield aboveground biomass wue and hi along with economic benefits and soil water storage and temperature fig 7 the first two pca axes accounted for 93 2 and 3 5 in 2015 fig 7a and for 89 1 and 9 4 in 2016 fig 7b of the variation by wheat agronomical traits and soil hydrothermal status when ridge furrow ratios were considered grain yield biomass wue sws hi and ni appeared on the right of the horizontal axis while sws and et nearly equidistant from both the horizontal and vertical axes were placed on the left side of the horizontal axis in two years fig 7 the treatments are classified into five groups r3f2 and r2f2 were clearly associated with the highest levels of yield biomass wue and ni soil temperature had positive responses to r4f2 r3f6 and r2f6 showed higher positive effects on sws and et than ck did wheat yield agb and wue significantly increased linearly with sws p 0 001 fig 8a d and hi increased linearly with both soil water storage and temperature p 0 001 fig 8e j grain yield r2 0 461 agb r2 0 413 wuey r2 0 427 and wueb r2 0 373 were significantly related to soil temperature by a polynomial function for both years respectively p 0 001 fig 8f i the peak yield agb wuey wueb were observed at the soil temperature of 26 88 26 58 27 47 and 27 17 c respectively fig 8f i 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture and temperature under different ridge furrow ratios rfm system could significantly increase soil moisture in semiarid eap principally because it is beneficial to collect rainwater and reduces soil surface evaporation luo et al 2020b in this study rfm treatments especially in higher ridge furrow ratios significantly increased sws at 0 140 cm compared with traditional flat planting ck the positive effects were intensified with the increases of ridge furrow ratio which was consistent with previous studies in semiarid northwest china in winter wheat ren et al 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 maize li et al 2017 oats wang et al 2015a and alfalfa field wang et al 2015b zhang et al 2019 explained that the increased coverage ratio by plastic film result in greater efficiency in collecting rainwater and preventing evaporation as well as enhancing water infiltration especially in frequent rain period on the other hand the higher ridge furrow ratio generally associated with relatively narrow furrow width in this study which took more advantage of light rainfall infiltration into soil profile and eventually improved soil water conservation wang et al 2015a we found that the light rainfall 6 mm events account for 33 3 and 58 1 of the total rainfall in wheat growing period in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 2 this demonstrated that greater ridge furrow ratios would be more efficient to collect rainwater in semiarid eap and other similar areas where the light rains are frequent plastic film mulching can impede water gas exchange between soil and atmosphere reduce heat loss increase the absorption of solar radiation and thus improve soil hydrothermal regime zhang et al 2019 luo et al 2020b rfm treatments resulted in greater soil surface temperature than ck across the whole growing period which was in line with previous study reported by mo et al 2017 in semiarid eap furthermore we found the improved thermal effects had been weakening gradually with decreasing ridge furrow ratio soil heat flow typically transmit from the mulched ridge to uncovered furrow zone in rfm system li et al 2017 liu et al 2020 higher ridge furrow ratio potentially achieved the most thermal transmission to the furrows than the lower ratio a study in semiarid region of china demonstrated that ridge widths 30 45 and 60 cm with 60 cm furrow suggested that ridge width had no significant effects on soil surface temperature at furrow bottoms wang et al 2015b we also found lower ridge furrow ratios r3f6 and r2f6 that were generally associated with wide furrows of 60 cm showed no significant difference in soil temperature compared to ck in eap 4 2 wheat growth biomass accumulation and yield formation under different ridge furrow ratios rfm system especially in higher ridge furrow ratios modified soil hydrothermal status to promote wheat growth and development which resulted in considerable improvement in plant height leaf area agb and yield components fig 5 tables 2 and 3 fast and stable seedling emergence establishment is crucial for dryland wheat growth biomass accumulation and yield formation li et al 2004 2016 in the temperate semiarid areas of china the favorable soil hydrothermal conditions created by rfm promoted crop seedling germination and establishment during the early spring li et al 2019 in our study the rainfall concentrated mostly in the early period of wheat growing fig 1 the positive effects on soil water storage by plastic mulching in higher ridge furrow ratios were no different with lower ones at jointing stage but significantly increased at heading and maturing stages fig 4a c therefore higher ridge furrow ratio treatments can serve as improved strategies adapted to wheat growth biomass accumulation and yield formation at the key water demand period in the semiarid eap this phenomenon mainly explained that the increased wheat plant height leaf area agb and yield components were observed in the treatments of higher ridge furrow ratio in this area 4 3 wheat grain yield et and wue under different ridge furrow ratios improving wue is achieved by increasing crop yield and reducing et that comprises soil evaporation and plant transpiration zhao et al 2014 li et al 2016 mo et al 2016 in this study the results indicated that most rfm treatments significantly increased grain yield but decreased et compared to ck and consequently led to an increase in wue this is in agreement with previous research in semiarid kenya mo et al 2016 rfm system induced a significantly higher et in a semi humid region of china as reported by li et al 2019 who explained that the reserved soil water by plastic mulching was insufficient to meet the increased crop transpiration however some studies in china found that rfm did not significantly inï¬uence et li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the reason for this was that plastic mulching decreased soil evaporation but increased the crop transpiration simultaneously zhao et al 2014 suggested that a drier growing season tended to raise et in ck than rfm but the opposite trend occurred in a relatively wetter growing season in this study most of rainfall was received at pre sowing and the early stage of wheat growth fig 1 this enabled rainwater to penetrate deep into soil profile plastic mulching would reduce surface evaporation and supply the water loss caused by wheat transpiration during the whole growing season the results showed that rfm treatment significantly increased wheat yield and wue in comparison with ck which was consistent with previous studies zhao et al 2014 mo et al 2016 li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 this was mainly because plastic mulching enhanced crop transpiration due to improved soil hydrothermal condition fig 4 leading to increase crop growth fig 5 biomass accumulation table 3 and yield components table 2 on the other hand luo et al 2020a revealed that the mechanisms of yield improvement in the rfm system were closely linked with the promoted reproductive allocation of wheat at individual level in eap the data also indicated that with the increase of ridge furrow ratio wheat yield and wue reached a maximum at r2f2 and then decreased but et continued to rise the reason for this was that higher ridge furrow ratio was generally associated with the larger plastic mulched area which was more effective in collecting rainwater especially to light rains increasing soil water and temperature on the other hand r4f2 reduced planting area compared with r2f2 which possibly caused a negative effect on crop grain yield wang et al 2015b liu et al 2020 in this study the highest yield agb wuey and wueb were observed at the average soil temperature of 26 88 26 58 27 47 and 27 17 c fig 8f i in the temperate semiarid northwestern china drought and temperature were the principal limiting factors on crop growth particularly in the early spring the rfm system could serve as an effective option to improve soil water and temperature status at the seedling stage liu et al 2020 on the other hand wheat kernel weight can be much reduced when root was heat stressed at 30 c wang et al 2007 the average soil temperature under r4f2 treatment was getting really close to 30 c at the maturing stage in 2015 fig 4g which might inhibit root growth reduce the photosynthates allocation to shoots and accelerate plant senescence by heat stress wang et al 2007 numerous studies showed that the medium ridge width produced the highest crop yield and wue in dense crops in semiarid of china wang et al 2015a 2015b ren et al 2016 liu et al 2020 in present study the highest wheat yield and wue were observed in r2f2 treatment this phenomenon mainly resulted from the combined effect of the optimum soil hydrothermal status and planting areas 4 4 economic benefits economic benefit is an important socio economic factor in determining household livelihoods and adoption of dryland farming practices by smallholder farmers in ssa luo et al 2020b the inputs in terms of rfm making and plastic material for mulching were raised with ridge furrow ratio increasing table 4 because of the increased coverage area and difficulty in operating rfm configuration however the labor input involved in controlling field weeds gradually declined due to the increased plastic mulched ratio the net profit and the ratio of output to input firstly increased and then decreased with the increase of ridge furrow ratio however r2f2 treatments achieved the highest economic benefits which was mainly associated with the increased wheat yield and biomass in two years table 4 4 5 optimum ridge furrow ratio and unit size in rfm system an optimum ridge furrow ratio and size is a crucial measure to improve the rainwater harvesting efficiency and soil hydrothermal condition for crop growth and yield formation thereby increase crop productivity and wue in semiarid africa in the present study the optimum ridge furrow ratio was 1 32 1 38 1 28 1 31 1 39 1 49 1 37 1 45 and 1 46 1 56 for wheat grain yield agb wuey wueb and hi and basically lied between r2f2 and r3f2 fig 6 on the basis of the integrated evaluation by using pca the result showed that r2f2 and r3f2 obviously improved soil hydrothermal condition grain yield biomass wue and hi than other ridge furrow ratios and ck fig 7 wheat growth and yield formation are largely limited by the plating area and soil heat stress if the ridge furrow ratio is smaller than the optimum range wheat growth would be hampered by the enhanced soil evaporation and inefficient utilization of rainwater when the ratio became larger than the optimum range in the semiarid areas of kenya on the other hand wheat yield biomass wue and hi decreased linearly with the increase of ridge furrow unit size in this study fig 6 larger unit size was related to the increase of furrow width which made rainwater harder to reach middle region of furrows especially in case of light rains this inefficient rainwater harvest and distribution might initiate drought stress against wheat growth and development and thereby decrease grain yield and wue plastic mulching profoundly influences soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization nutrient availability and microbial metabolism through soil water and temperature regulation luo et al 2020b mo et al 2020 which indicates that the effects of ridge furrow ratio and unit size on wheat productivity driven by soil chemical and biological process should be conducted in future 5 conclusions this study presented an optimized ridge furrow mulching system in improving soil hydrothermal conditions wheat growth and yield formation under the regional climate and soil types in semiarid eap taken together the r3f2 and r2f2 treatments significantly improved soil water storage and temperature and harvested the highest plant height leaf area agb yield wue yield components and economic benefits in comparison with other ridge furrow ratios and ck however the optimum ridge furrow ratio was 1 32 1 38 1 28 1 31 1 39 1 49 1 37 1 45 and 1 46 1 56 for wheat yield agb wuey wueb and hi in addition wheat yield agb wue and hi decreased linearly with the increase of ridge furrow unit size therefore it is concluded that the ridge furrow ratio of 1 1 5 in combination with minimum ridge furrow unit size was the optimum rfm system to promote dryland wheat productivity and rainwater use in tropical semiarid areas of eap declaration of competing interest

10153,spatial structural variations in ridge furrow unit size and its ratio can result in the drastic fluctuation of soil hydrothermal status and thereby affect water use and yield formation in dryland crops previous studies were little focused on the responses of dryland wheat productivity to the structural changes in ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm system and its mechanism in semiarid eastern african plateau eap a two year field experiment was conducted in juja a semiarid area in kenya from 2015 to 2016 there were seven treatments of ridge furrow width and ratios in randomized block design as follows 1 40 cm ridge width and 20 cm furrow width r4f2 the same below 2 r3f2 3 r2f2 4 r3f4 5 r2f4 6 r3f6 and 7 r2f6 and conventional flat planting without mulching as control ck the results showed that r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 r3f4 and r2f4 treatments significantly improved soil water storage and temperature across two growing seasons compared with ck p 0 05 among all the treatments r3f2 and r2f2 obviously achieved the highest plant height leaf area aboveground biomass agb grain yield and water use efficiency wue p 0 05 also r2f2 had the highest economic benefits in all treatments the optimal ridge furrow ratio appeared to be 1 32 1 38 1 28 1 31 1 39 1 49 1 37 1 45 and 1 46 1 56 for wheat yield agb wuey wueb and harvest index hi respectively in addition wheat yield agb wue and hi tended to decrease linearly with the increased ridge furrow unit size in conclusion ridge furrow ratio of 1 1 5 r2f2 to r3f2 in combination with the minimum ridge furrow unit size proved to be the optimum rfm system for the best dryland wheat productivity in accordance to regional soil and climate characteristics in semiarid eap and other similar areas of the world keywords ridge furrow ratio ridge furrow size plastic mulching wheat productivity eastern african plateau 1 introduction agricultural development is highly dependent on rainfall and has long been an important economic sector for many countries in sub saharan africa ssa lipper et al 2014 however crop productivity of african smallholders is severely affected by climate change with the features of the raised temperature and the frequent and intensified droughts and floods mÃ¼ller et al 2011 waha et al 2013 in this context rainwater harvesting rwh practices with reducing surface runoff have resulted in more efficient use of rainwater for the local crop growth and yield stabilization particularly in dry areas fox and rockstrÃ¶m 2000 kahinda et al 2010 in recent years rwh technologies are widely practiced in eastern african plateau eap ngigi et al 2005 haregeweyn et al 2010 pachpute et al 2009 and southern africa mupangwa et al 2006 welderufael et al 2013 where rainwater is collected in contour bunds and terraces for direct uptake by crops or stored in tanks ponds and reservoirs for supplementary irrigation however the adoption of rwh practices by smallholder farmers in ssa is limited due to high initial investment and labor intensive ngigi et al 2005 moreover the local rwh is not aimed directly at improving water use efficiency fox and rockstrÃ¶m 2000 and might lead to severe soil erosion vohland and barry 2009 in semiarid ssa crop transpiration is reported to account for less than one third of rainfall 50 75 of rainfall were lost by evaporation and surface runoff fox and rockstrÃ¶m 2000 therefore improving runoff harvesting and crop transpiration as well as reducing soil evaporation will inevitably be considered the efficient soil and water managements for advancing agricultural production in ssa ridge furrow with plastic mulching rfm greatly collected and retained rainwater through the alternative ridges and furrows and effectively reduced soil evaporation by plastic mulching gan et al 2013 mo et al 2017 previous studies demonstrated that rfm system had a substantial potential to improve crop yield water use efficiency wue and economic benefits in asia li et al 2004 sharma et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 ruidisch et al 2013 north america diazperez and batal 2002 europe munoz et al 2015 and eap wang et al 2016 mo et al 2017 luo et al 2020a 2020b in rfm system the plastic mulched ridges are used for collecting rainfall and mulched or unmulched furrows serve as the zones for storing rainwater and planting of crops therefore the ridge and furrow size width and its mutual ratio would be effective on the use of light and heavy rainfall and is the key for successful implementation of rfm in different climatic zones in the temperate semiarid areas of northwest china numerous studies found that ridge width had significant effects on soil hydrothermal status and crop productivity and the optimum ridge width associated with the highest crop yield was 45 cm in potato tian et al 2003 32 38 cm in oats wang et al 2015a 35 36 cm in alfalfa wang et al 2015b and 60 cm in winter wheat ren et al 2016 liu et al 2020 these studies suggested that the optimum ridge width tended to be middle and narrow because wider ridge reduced planting area that led to a negative effect on crop yield wang et al 2015b liu et al 2020 a wide furrow width of 60 cm was used in these studies mentioned above which made against soil moisture transfer from ridge side to middle ground of furrow especially in the light rains in this case the little water collection in the rhizospheric soil generally resulted in drought stress effect on crop growth welde and gebremariam 2016 previous studies also showed that crops grown in ridge sides are more likely to promote the photosynthesis root growth and grain yields those that grown away from the ridges ding et al 2006 f c li et al 2013 r li et al 2013 qu et al 2014 some other studies kept ridge and furrow within a same unit size ridge furrow and found that crop yield and wue were improved with increasing ridge furrow ratio such as 40 70 55 55 and 70 40 cm in maize li et al 2017 and 20 40 30 30 and 40 20 cm in wheat field li et al 2019 the optimum ridge furrow ratio is critically important to improve rainwater use efficiency and eventually increase crop productivity in semiarid areas gan et al 2013 previous researches focused little on the effects of integrated approaches of ridge furrow ratio and its unit size on the soil hydro thermal status crop growth and yield formation in addition it is so far unclear what is the optimum ridge furrow ratio and unit size for crop water use and productivity in tropical semiarid of eap where agricultural production is mostly constrained by the low and erratic rainfall wheat triticum aestivum l is the second important staple crop in most areas of eap doss et al 2003 in this study field experiment with local dryland wheat was conducted under various ridge furrow ratios and its unit sizes in a semiarid area of kenya the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to investigate the effects of different ridge furrow ratios and unit sizes on soil moisture soil temperature wheat growth yield formation wue and economic benefits 2 to provide experimental evidence for the optimum rfm system in accordance to regional soil and climate types in semiarid eap 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a field trial over two short rainy seasons from 2015 to 2016 was carried out in the experimental farm of jomo kenyatta university of agriculture and technology jkuat 01 05 s 37 00 e

furrow with plastic film mulching rfm treatments ridge and furrow width were 1 40 and 20 cm r4f2 2 30 and 20 cm r3f2 3 20 and 20 cm r2f2 4 30 and 40 cm r3f4 5 20 and 40 cm r2f4 6 30 and 60 cm r3f6 and 7 20 and 60 cm r2f6 therefore the ridge furrow ratios ridge furrow were 2 1 5 1 0 75 0 5 0 5 and 0 33 and the ridge furrow unit size ridge furrow were 60 50 40 70 60 90 and 80 cm respectively table 1 all rfm treatments were laid at the same ridge height at 15 cm a conventional flat planting without mulching was used as control ck a schematic diagram of different treatments is presented in fig 3 we used a completely randomized block design with three replicates based on the local practices the plots were also fertilized at low rates of 40 kg n ha 1 as urea 20 kg p2o5 ha 1 as triple superphosphate and 20 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulphate respectively all fertilizers were broadcast applied before planting except that nitrogen was fertilized twice 50 at sowing and another 50 at jointing stage respectively after fertilizer application the field was conventionally ploughed at pre sowing period in the first year and was divided into three blocks 24 plots in all and each plot area was 25 m2 5 5 m the ridges and furrows in all plots were manually established in 2015 and repaired in 2016 the local wheat cultivar njoro was seeded at a rate of 200 kg ha 1 with two rows in 20 cm furrows three rows in 40 cm furrows and four rows in 60 cm furrows on 19 november 2015 and 5 november 2016 respectively at maturity stage all plants were harvested manually on 9 february 2016 and 28 january 2017 after harvesting the residual plastic film was manually cleared in all of the plots the weeds were removed on the ridges and furrows according to farmer s practice throughout growing season and fallow period effective control of aphids and rust was performed by spraying imidacloprid and diniconazole separately at the booting stage of wheat 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 precipitation and temperature daily mean air temperature and rainfall data were measured by a meteorological station that was built next to the experimental field in january 2009 across two growing seasons soil temperature st was measured with a rc 5 instrument elitech co ltd jiangsu china at the soil depth of 10 cm st was determined from the average value for five days at wheat sowing jointing heading filling and maturing stages 2 3 2 plant height leaf area and yield components ten individual plants were randomly sampled at physiological maturity stage in each plot plant height leaf area and spike length were measured and recorded separately the samples were oven dried at 105 c for 1 h and 60 c for 48 h and separated into stems leaves and reproductive organs afterwards spike weight grain weight per spike grain number per spike and 1000 grain weight were measured and recorded in detail 2 3 3 soil water content and storage soil samples were taken at 0 140 cm depth in 20 cm intervals and determined soil gravimetric water content swc by oven drying 10 g moist soil at 105 c for 24 h before plot preparation three randomly 140 cm deep profile pits were excavated in the experimental site besides undisturbed soil core 100 cm3 from soil depth of 0 140 cm was collected to determine soil bulk density according to finn et al 2015 therefore volumetric soil water storage sws defined as wang et al 2016 mo et al 2016 sws mm swc Ïb g cm 3 sd mm where Ïb is soil bulk density 1 45 g cm 3 and sd is referred to as the given soil depth 2 3 4 grain yield and water use efficiency wheat plants within one square meter were harvested at maturing stages in each plot to measure grain yield total above ground biomass agb and spike number crop growth was completely dependent on precipitation without irrigation and runoff was prevented by ridges around each plot rock stratum commonly occurs below 140 cm at experimental site which prevents water drainage to the deeper layer therefore evapotranspiration et mm was calculated as according to the following formula et r Î´sws where r is total rainfall during the wheat growing season Î´sws mm is obtained by calculating the difference between the sws at the beginning and the end of growing season finally the water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 for grain yield wuey and above ground biomass wueb were computed using the following formulas luo et al 2020b wuey y et wueb b et where y is grain yield and b is above ground biomass respectively 2 3 5 economic benefits the major inputs were sum labor and cost of seeds plastic film fertilizer and agro chemicals total labor input used for field work consisted of plot preparation rfm making field managements sowing and harvesting according to the local currency 100 kenyan shillings ksh was equivalent to 1 us dollar us the labor input was valued at 4 us per day 8 h according to local wage standards the prices of all applied material inputs plastic film seeds fertilizers and pesticides were determined by local market price at that time the inputs of rfm making and plastic film material varied with the ridge furrow ratios the output refers to the value of the wheat grain and hay biomass the output price was identified based on farm gate price as 0 6 and 0 03 us per kilogram for wheat grain and stover respectively finally the net income was estimated using the difference between outputs and inputs and the benefit cost ratio was calculated by dividing output by the input 2 4 statistical analysis the effect of ridge furrow ratio treatment on soil water soil temperature wheat yield wue plant height leaf area yield components and economic benefits were evaluated by one way analysis of variance anova for two years the statistical differences among grouped means were assessed using the post hoc tukey s hsd test after homogeneity of variances for multiple comparisons at p 0 05 statistical analyses were carried out using the spss

significantly increased grain weight and grain number per spike as well as the spike number whereas the spike weight and thousand grain weight did not change relative to ck in both years in general r4f2 r3f2 and r2f2 had the highest levels of all the yield components r3f4 and r2f4 achieved somewhat lower yield components while the lowest yield components were observed in r3f6 r2f6 and ck 3 5 wheat grain yield biomass and wue ridge furrow ratio was significant for et wheat grain yield aboveground biomass wue and hi in both years p 0 001 table 3 et for r3f6 and r2f6 treatments did not differ significantly compared with that for ck but for other ridge furrow ratios was significantly lower than ck all ridge furrow ratio treatments significantly increased grain yield aboveground biomass and wue compared with ck in both years the highest grain yield agb wuey and wueb were produced by r2f2 in 2015 and 2016 and increased by 83 8 and 90 3 65 and 64 5 103 4 and 115 4 and 82 6 and

growth of ridge furrow ratio in both years fig 6a e the ridge furrow ratios associated with the highest grain yield agb wuey wueb and hi in 2015 and 2016 were 1 38 and 1 32 1 31 and 1 28 1 49 and 1 39 1 45 and 1 37 and 1 56 and 1 46 respectively the optimum ridge furrow ratio for grain yield agb wuey wueb was between r3f2 and r2f2 while grain yield agb wuey wueb and hi decreased linearly with the

per hectare under r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 r3f4 r2f4 r3f6 r2f6 and ck respectively the total input and output decreased in the sequence of r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 r3f4 r2f4 r3f6 r2f6 and ck consequently r2f2 had the greatest net income and the ratio of output to input in both years compared with ck r4f2 r3f2 r2f2 r3f4 r2f4 and r3f6 harvested significantly higher net economic income in both years the ratio of

427 and wueb r2 0 373 were significantly related to soil temperature by a polynomial function for both years respectively p 0 001 fig 8f i the peak yield agb wuey wueb were observed at the soil temperature of 26 88 26 58 27 47 and 27 17 c respectively fig 8f i 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture and temperature under different ridge furrow ratios rfm system could significantly increase soil moisture in semiarid eap principally because it is beneficial to collect rainwater and reduces soil surface evaporation luo et al 2020b in this study rfm treatments especially in higher ridge furrow ratios significantly increased sws at 0 140 cm compared with traditional flat planting ck the positive effects were intensified with the increases of ridge furrow ratio which was consistent with previous studies in semiarid northwest china in winter wheat ren et al 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 maize li et al 2017 oats wang et al 2015a and alfalfa field wang et al 2015b zhang et al 2019 explained that the increased coverage ratio by plastic film result in greater efficiency in collecting rainwater and preventing evaporation as well as enhancing water infiltration especially in frequent rain period on the other hand the higher ridge furrow ratio generally associated with relatively narrow furrow width in this study which took more advantage of light rainfall infiltration into soil profile and eventually improved soil water conservation wang et al 2015a we found that the light rainfall 6 mm events account for 33 3 and 58 1 of the total rainfall in wheat growing period in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 2 this demonstrated that greater ridge furrow ratios would be more efficient to collect rainwater in semiarid eap and other similar areas where the light rains are frequent plastic film mulching can impede water gas exchange between soil and atmosphere reduce heat loss increase the absorption of solar radiation and thus improve soil hydrothermal regime zhang et al 2019 luo et al 2020b rfm treatments resulted in greater soil surface temperature than ck across the whole growing period which was in line with previous study reported by mo et al 2017 in semiarid eap furthermore we found the improved thermal effects had been weakening gradually with decreasing ridge furrow ratio soil heat flow typically transmit from the mulched ridge to uncovered furrow zone in rfm system li et al 2017 liu et al 2020 higher ridge furrow ratio potentially achieved the most thermal transmission to the furrows than the lower ratio a study in semiarid region of china demonstrated that ridge widths 30 45 and 60 cm with 60 cm furrow suggested that ridge width had no significant effects on soil surface temperature at furrow bottoms wang et al 2015b we also found lower ridge furrow ratios r3f6 and r2f6 that were generally associated with wide furrows of 60 cm showed no significant difference in soil temperature compared to ck in eap 4 2 wheat growth biomass accumulation and yield formation under different ridge furrow ratios rfm system especially in higher ridge furrow ratios modified soil hydrothermal status to promote wheat growth and development which resulted in considerable improvement in plant height leaf area agb and yield components fig 5 tables 2 and 3 fast and stable seedling emergence establishment is crucial for dryland wheat growth biomass accumulation and yield formation li et al 2004 2016 in the temperate semiarid areas of china the favorable soil hydrothermal conditions created by rfm promoted crop seedling germination and establishment during the early spring li et al 2019 in our study the rainfall concentrated mostly in the early period of wheat growing fig 1 the positive effects on soil water storage by plastic mulching in higher ridge furrow ratios were no different with lower ones at jointing stage but significantly increased at heading and maturing stages fig 4a c therefore higher ridge furrow ratio treatments can serve as improved strategies adapted to wheat growth biomass accumulation and yield formation at the key water demand period in the semiarid eap this phenomenon mainly explained that the increased wheat plant height leaf area agb and yield components were observed in the treatments of higher ridge furrow ratio in this area 4 3 wheat grain yield et and wue under different ridge furrow ratios improving wue is achieved by increasing crop yield and reducing et that comprises soil evaporation and plant transpiration zhao et al 2014 li et al 2016 mo et al 2016 in this study the results indicated that most rfm treatments significantly increased grain yield but decreased et compared to ck and consequently led to an increase in wue this is in agreement with previous research in semiarid kenya mo et al 2016 rfm system induced a significantly higher et in a semi humid region of china as reported by li et al 2019 who explained that the reserved soil water by plastic mulching was insufficient to meet the increased crop transpiration however some studies in china found that rfm did not significantly inï¬uence et li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the reason for this was that plastic mulching decreased soil evaporation but increased the crop transpiration simultaneously zhao et al 2014 suggested that a drier growing season tended to raise et in ck than rfm but the opposite trend occurred in a relatively wetter growing season in this study most of rainfall was received at pre sowing and the early stage of wheat growth fig 1 this enabled rainwater to penetrate deep into soil profile plastic mulching would reduce surface evaporation and supply the water loss caused by wheat transpiration during the whole growing season the results showed that rfm treatment significantly increased wheat yield and wue in comparison with ck which was consistent with previous studies zhao et al 2014 mo et al 2016 li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 this was mainly because plastic mulching enhanced crop transpiration due to improved soil hydrothermal condition fig 4 leading to increase crop growth fig 5 biomass accumulation table 3 and yield components table 2 on the other hand luo et al 2020a revealed that the mechanisms of yield improvement in the rfm system were closely linked with the promoted reproductive allocation of wheat at individual level in eap the data also indicated that with the increase of ridge furrow ratio wheat yield and wue reached a maximum at r2f2 and then decreased but et continued to rise the reason for this was that higher ridge furrow ratio was generally associated with the larger plastic mulched area which was more effective in collecting rainwater especially to light rains increasing soil water and temperature on the other hand r4f2 reduced planting area compared with r2f2 which possibly caused a negative effect on crop grain yield wang et al 2015b liu et al 2020 in this study the highest yield agb wuey and wueb were observed at the average soil temperature of 26 88 26 58 27 47 and 27 17 c fig 8f i in the temperate semiarid northwestern china drought and temperature were the principal limiting factors on crop growth particularly in the early spring the rfm system could serve as an effective option to improve soil water and temperature status at the seedling stage liu et al 2020 on the other hand wheat kernel weight can be much reduced when root was heat stressed at 30 c wang et al 2007 the average soil temperature under r4f2 treatment was getting really close to 30 c at the maturing stage in 2015 fig 4g which might inhibit root growth reduce the photosynthates allocation to shoots and accelerate plant senescence by heat stress wang et al 2007 numerous studies showed that the medium ridge width produced the highest crop yield and wue in dense crops in semiarid of china wang et al 2015a 2015b ren et al 2016 liu et al 2020 in present study the highest wheat yield and wue were observed in r2f2 treatment this phenomenon mainly resulted from the combined effect of the optimum soil hydrothermal status and planting areas 4 4 economic benefits economic benefit is an important socio economic factor in determining household livelihoods and adoption of dryland farming practices by smallholder farmers in ssa luo et al 2020b the inputs in terms of rfm making and plastic material for mulching were raised with ridge furrow ratio increasing table 4 because of the increased coverage area and difficulty in operating rfm configuration however the labor input involved in controlling field weeds gradually declined due to the increased plastic mulched ratio the net profit and the ratio of output to input firstly increased and then decreased with the increase of ridge furrow ratio however r2f2 treatments achieved the highest economic benefits which was mainly associated with the increased wheat yield and biomass in two years table 4 4 5 optimum ridge furrow ratio and unit size in rfm system an optimum ridge furrow ratio and size is a crucial measure to improve the rainwater harvesting efficiency and soil hydrothermal condition for crop growth and yield formation thereby increase crop productivity and wue in semiarid africa in the present study the optimum ridge furrow ratio was 1 32 1 38 1 28 1 31 1 39 1 49 1 37 1 45 and 1 46 1 56 for wheat grain yield agb wuey wueb and hi and basically lied between r2f2 and r3f2 fig 6 on the basis of the integrated evaluation by using pca the result showed that r2f2 and r3f2 obviously improved soil hydrothermal condition grain yield biomass wue and hi than other ridge furrow ratios and ck fig 7 wheat growth and yield formation are largely limited by the plating area and soil heat stress if the ridge furrow ratio is smaller than the optimum range wheat growth would be hampered by the enhanced soil evaporation and inefficient utilization of rainwater when the ratio became larger than the optimum range in the semiarid areas of kenya on the other hand wheat yield biomass wue and hi decreased linearly with the increase of ridge furrow unit size in this study fig 6 larger unit size was related to the increase of furrow width which made rainwater harder to reach middle region of furrows especially in case of light rains this inefficient rainwater harvest and distribution might initiate drought stress against wheat growth and development and thereby decrease grain yield and wue plastic mulching profoundly influences soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization nutrient availability and microbial metabolism through soil water and temperature regulation luo et al 2020b mo et al 2020 which indicates that the effects of ridge furrow ratio and unit size on wheat productivity driven by soil chemical and biological process should be conducted in future 5 conclusions this study presented an optimized ridge furrow mulching system in improving soil hydrothermal conditions wheat growth and yield formation under the regional climate and soil types in semiarid eap taken together the r3f2 and r2f2 treatments significantly improved soil water storage and temperature and harvested the highest plant height leaf area agb yield wue yield components and economic benefits in comparison with other ridge furrow ratios and ck however the optimum ridge furrow ratio was 1 32 1 38 1 28 1 31 1 39 1 49 1 37 1 45 and 1 46 1 56 for wheat yield agb wuey wueb and hi in addition wheat yield agb wue and hi decreased linearly with the increase of ridge furrow unit size therefore it is concluded that the ridge furrow ratio of 1 1 5 in combination with minimum ridge furrow unit size was the optimum rfm system to promote dryland wheat productivity and rainwater use in tropical semiarid areas of eap declaration of competing interest

10154,plantations as a form of vegetation restoration play a critical role in the recent greening of the earth however the sustainability of the restored vegetation under precipitation changes has rarely been estimated largely because of a lack of knowledge about the related plant water adaptation in the current study six tree species including evergreen and deciduous were selected from a typical karst forest types in southwest china a hotspot of earth greening root water uptake depth and hydraulic related traits of stem and leaf were studied our results showed that in the wet season the evergreen species mainly rely on soil water sources from a depth of 0 30 cm 49 74 while the deciduous use deeper layers of 30 70 cm in depth 47 58 in the dry season the deciduous species shed their leaves while the evergreens utilized soil water at a depth of 0 10 cm with an average absorption of 66 96 the evergreen species exhibit higher xylem cavitation resistance reflect by p 50 and leaf turgor maintenance capacity reflect by Ï tlp than the deciduous the significant correlations between plant water uptake depth and water potential and hydraulic traits and water uptake depth indicate the different water adaptation strategies of evergreen and deciduous in detail evergreen species that rely on shallower water sources exhibit a larger diurnal range of leaf water potential more xylem cavitation resistant and leaf turgor maintenance capacity in contrast deciduous species with deeper water uptake show narrower diurnal range of leaf water potential with lower drought resistance of stem and leaves our results highlight the probable divergent response such as growth restriction and hydraulic failure of evergreen and deciduous plantation tree species to the changing precipitation patterns under climate change keywords plant water source karst ecosystems stable isotope leaf water potential xylem vulnerability curve 1 introduction the current earth greening trend has been going on for the past three decades zhu et al 2016 forzieri et al 2020 studies reveal that afforestation and reforestation play critical roles in global leaf area index greening piao et al 2015 brandt et al 2018 forzieri et al 2020 the sustainability of the restored vegetation has been of interest but has not been estimated under the new global precipitation patterns malhi et al 2008 aguirre et al 2019 konapala et al 2020 largely because of a lack of information on related plant water adaptation strategies thus wider understanding of plant water adaptation strategies in vegetation conservation area is urgently needed for future sustainable development as an important part of plant water adaptation strategies root water uptake depth is controlled by the plant itself zhu et al 2016 it is generally accepted that evergreen tree species use deeper water sources e g groundwater compared to deciduous trees in the same habitat hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2012 liu et al 2017 but other researcher also finds that there is no different depth of water uptake between deciduous and evergreen species ellsworth and sternberg 2015 donovan et al 2000 further reports that the deciduous quercus laevis has greater access to soil water than evergreen quercus incana species the different plant water uptake depth is associated with leaf water potential for their water use strategies the species with shallower water uptake depth usually exhibited the larger diurnal ranges of leaf water potentials for their transpiration ding et al 2020 besides some trees use shallow soil water when this water is abundant and switch to deeper depths as upper soil layers dry nippert and knapp 2007 dai et al 2015 liu et al 2018 generally speaking any water acquisition strategy is the combined result of long term environmental selection for natural plant species and species specific adaptation while forest type species e g subtropical karst are moved from the thin stony soil habitat of natural forests and planted in the relatively thick soil habitat at the foot of a hillslope in natural habitats species use deep roots to access water in high weathered bedrock layers bonacci et al 2008 schwinning 2010 tokumoto et al 2014 nie et al 2017 however there are few studies of the water sources being accessed by forest species after a habitat change plant water adaptation are quite complex and refer not only to water acquisition strategies but also the embolism resistance capacity especially under water limited conditions matheny et al 2017 cao and goodale 2018 vulnerability to embolism is a key physiological trait determining the limits of drought tolerance across tree species choat et al 2012 besides leaf drought tolerance capacity plays a determinant role in maintaining stomatal conductance hydraulic conductance gas exchange when drought occur during the growing season markesteijn et al 2011 bartlett et al 2012 to avoid embolism of xylem plant species activate specific drought resistance mechanisms including tolerance and avoidance amanda et al 2020 these two mechanisms are associated with both evergreen and deciduous species generally evergreens show a greater xylem cavitation resistance lower leaf turgor loss point water potential and higher bulk modulus of elasticity while the deciduous species reduce water use in the dry season by shedding more leaves and relatively vulnerable for drought stress choat et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 looking at one method of drought resistance or root water uptake depth is not enough to understand plant water adaptation for example plant water use status will be aggravated by less negative hydraulic values coupled with limited water sources and coexisting species find relief by extracting water from deep and relative stable sources however there are few comprehensive studies of hydraulic resistant capacity and water acquisition this limits a deeper understanding of adaptations of reforestation especially in the south china karst region where ecological restoration produced regional greening greater than that observed worldwide as one of the world s largest exposed carbonate rock areas in the world yuan et al 1994 the subtropical karst region of southwestern china once suffered from rocky desertification several remote sensing based studies showed that trends in both leaf area index and carbon stocks have been considerably altered in conservation areas in this region the main ecological conservation projects was to recovered deforested areas by naturally reforesting croplands this project resulted in the largest karst area of tree cover in the globe delang and zhen 2015 brandt et al 2018 tong et al 2020 the forest species are from natural forests and most of them are planted at the foot of hillslopes and depressions where the soil is relatively thick with sufficient soil water in the near surface layer however compared to other studies on natural vegetation zhu and cao 2009 hasselquist et al 2010 cao et al 2014 sanchez costa et al 2015 these forest community types are under investigated the lack of understanding of the adaptation and sustainability of these forest community types will affect the implementation of the next comprehensive treatment of rocky desertification based on the above analysis the current study observed plant water sources and hydraulic traits of six tree species in a typical karst plantation with different leaf phenology which was all selected from those growing in the karst region of southwestern china we hypothesized that 1 the forest community type species have different water uptake depth and resistance to xylem cavitation and leaf dehydration with evergreen and deciduous species 2 the forest species which utilized shallower water uptake depths had stem and leaves with higher drought resistance than those that used water from deeper layers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description and target

foot of the slope and in the depression the area was used as cropland and the soil is relatively thick our study site at the foot of the slope is relatively thick with a depth of 70 cm underneath the soil is a dolomite weathered bedrock zone the upper layer soil at 0 50 cm is well drained while the lower layers are sticky with a low soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s fu et al 2015a a high weathered bedrock layer is at the 70 90 cm where subsurface runoff occurs along the soil rock interface and recharges the high weathered bedrock moisture fu et al 2015a the region has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation of 1389 1 mm and an annual temperature of 18 5 the wet season lasts from late april to the end of september and provides 60 of total annual

produce farmland then reforested for conservation purposes jiang et al 2014 moore et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the afforestation plantation contain a diversity of indigenous tree species that are mostly from thin soil habitats but grow quite well in the relatively thick and fertile soil habitat of the study region we studied six mature forest community types delavaya toxocarpa quercus glauca swida wilsoniana albizia julibrissin zenia insignis juglans regia in five 10 20 m sample plots between november 2017 august 2018 the community types were single species dominated except for the mixture of a julibrissin and z insignis in one plot table 1 all the plantations were planted in 2007 with the density of 1250 trees per hectare the selection criteria for the trees in the forest plantations were as follows first the trees were native species and could be cultivated in the karst region of southwest china second they were distinctive and unique species yet representative of its life form evergreen or deciduous 2 2 sampling and stable isotope analysis rainwater samples were routinely collected for each rain event above 5 mm from august 2017 to august 2018 the collection equipment was designed based on the new device for monthly rainfall sampling for the global network of isotopes in precipitation agency 2002 the rainwater samples were stored in cap vials wrapped in parafilm and stored in a freezer until the analysis of stable isotopes temporal distribution of rainfall data and other meteorological data were collected at a meteorological station located in the middle of the same small catchment xylem and soil samples were taken on november 11 and december 4 2017 to represent the dry season and june 30 and july 22 2018 to represent the wet season we selected five individuals per species for analysis shoots ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 cm in diameter and 3 5 cm in length were collected at mid day from stems more than 2 years old the outer bark and phloem of the shoots were removed to obtain the xylem sample soil samples were obtained in five sample plots from seven depth intervals 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 70 70 90 cm with an auger and three replicates were collected at each layer because of the high weathered bedrock layer occurring between 70 and 90 cm the soil samples only reached a depth of 70 cm a subsample of the soil samples were stored at 20 c for isotopic analysis whereas the remainder of the samples were sealed for measurement of gravimetric soil water content swc obtained by oven drying for one day swc was measured by an oven drying method and water was extracted from xylem and soil using a cryogenic vacuum distillation approach ehleringer et al 2000 li et al 2007 the isotopic composition of xylem and soil water samples were

can mix organic materials e g methanol and ethanol that may affect the spectroscopy and lead to erroneous stable isotope values when analyzing with iris schultz et al 2011 liu et al 2013 in order to remove the pollution of methanol and ethanol the spectral analysis software of los gatos los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa was used to correct the plant water data since methanol

resulted in more negative xylem isotope values schultz et al 2011 according to previous study results Î´18o values of soil water are greatly affected by soil carbonate which means that isotopic exchange reactions with carbonates and water can occur at ambient temperatures but that does not occur in Î´d values meiÃner et al 2014 oerter et al 2014 orlowski et al 2016 since there is a large quantity of carbonates fu et al 2016b in the soil of our study site we only introduced the results obtained by the analyzes of Î´d values 2 3 leaf water potential predawn and midday water potentials

respectively n 4 one to three year old 40 50 cm long 6 10 mm in branches were cut at predawn two branches were taken from 5 trees per for each of six species i e 30 trees these tree parts were immediately wrapped in plastic bags and transported to the laboratory where they were progressively dehydrated under room conditions for one hour to one day to reach the range of water potentials that met the constructing requirement of vcs before water potential measurements with a pressure chamber pms instruments co corvallis or usa were taken three to five leaves were covered for at least one hour to allow for equilibrium between the leaf and xylem water potential when the difference between the measurements of at least two leaves were no more than 0 5 mpa the average of the measurements was regarded as the mean xylem water potential the branch was then sampled to assess its loss of hydraulic conductivity plc for angiosperm species potential cutting artifacts were eliminated by rehydrating branches in progressively shortening stints underwater which released the xylem tension before sampling the xylem segment of interest i e the 3 cm long segment in which plc is measured torresruiz et al 2013 wheeler et al 2013 stem segments were connected to a hydraulic conductivity apparatus and an elevated water reservoir was introduced to generate a gravity induced hydrostatic pressure 10 kpa which drove the flushing solution 10 mm kcl solution through the segments one end of the segment was placed in this solution while the other was connected a pipette for measuring the water flow rate through the segment measurement of continuous mass variation at 2 min intervals was performed three times to determine the mean flow rate through the branch segment to calculate maximal hydraulic conductivity k smax segments were flushed with the same solution at 150 kpa for approximately 20 min to remove embolism lastly the segments were connected to the balance system and flushed again to measure the maximum flow rate under the pressure gradient of 10 kpa sergent et al 2020 the process was applied repeatedly until more than 90 of the sapwood s specific conductivity k s

potential at turgor loss point Ï tlp was estimated according to the method pioneered by schulte and hinckley 1985 2 6 data analysis under the guidance of the isotopic mass conservation theory this study adopted the iso source model phillips and gregg 2003 to calculate the percent contribution of water sources for tree species the soil water in two adjacent layers with similar isotopic values

sampling times were conducted after the june 30 july 22 and august 17 2018 rainfalls the rainwater isotope values varied widely across months since the beginning of august 2017 the isotope values have gradually enriched and reached a peak in december 2017 rainwater isotope values were not monitored during january and february of 2018 at the beginning of the wet season the isotope values of rainwater samples were relatively low specifically the Î´d values varied between 21 54 and 62 01 within one month before the first two sampling periods but remained between 34 26 and 88 33 within 15 days before the next two sampling periods 3 2 soil water content isotopic variation and plant water source identification soil water content swc was relatively high 30 during the four sampling periods but it varied significantly as the seasons changed p 0 05 the average swc in the wet season was 41 38 higher than that recorded in the dry season 37 61 also swc showed different variations in the soil profile it had a large fluctuation at the 0 30 cm soil layer especially in the wet season which increased with soil depth while at the 30 90 cm soil layer swc stayed relatively stable fig 2 the Î´d values of plants followed seasonal variations in the dry season the Î´d values of four species z insignis and j regia had fallen leaves remained relatively negative ranging from 59 12 to 47 27 and became less negative in the wet season fig 3 as for soil profile water isotope composition converged at the top and bottom layers which is similar to recent rainfall values in the middle layer the Î´d values were depleted in the dry season and enriched in the wet season which is consistent with the previous rainfall Î´d direct inference asbjornsen et al 2007 showed that the Î´d values of four plant species matched those of soil water at a depth of 0 10 cm in the dry season fig 3a and b in the wet season the Î´d values of six species matched those of soil water at a depth of 10 50 cm and 70 90 cm fig 3c and d according to the iso source model the four forest species utilized soil water at a depth of 0 10 cm with an average absorption of 66 96 in the dry season fig 4a and b however in the wet

mpa in both in the dry and wet season table 2 but Ï pd in both the wet and dry season showed significant differences similarly to the midday water potential evergreen species showed a significant decrease in diurnal water potential ranges the water potential difference ofÏ pd and Ï md from the dry season to wet season while there is a significant increase in deciduous species table 2 in the wet season the diurnal ranges of water potential had a significant negative correlation with stem water Î´d values fig 5 the soil water Î´d during the same time period showed higher diurnal ranges of water potential within species indicating a reliance on soil water from shallow layers 3 4 plant hydraulic traits and those linkages with water uptake xylem embolism vulnerability curves differed among the six species with p 50 ranging from 1 25 mpa to 0 5 mpa fig 6 evergreen species exhibited more negative p 50 than the deciduous except for the z insignis there were significant linear relationships between p 50 and Î´d values of xylem water fig 7 in the wet season evergreen species with more negative p 50 tended to utilize the shallow soil water layer the deciduous species had an inverse water use status the leaf osmotic potential Ï tlp of evergreen species was significantly different from the deciduous species fig 8 in the wet season the evergreen species were more negative and showed a larger diurnal range of water potential than the deciduous species which was consistent with the relationship between xylem p 50 and Î´d values 4 discussion all the potential water sources from the topsoil to high weathered bedrock were sampled separately for analysis the isotope composition at a depth of 70 90 cm and 0 10 cm layers were similar both are different from the middle layers based on the rainfall isotopic values the water from these two layers was simultaneously replenished by the recent precipitation the water from the middle layers reflected values from the most recent rain event or a mixture of rain events these results were different from findings in other regions which suggest that rainfall supplied water to all the soil layers simultaneously zunzunegui et al 2018 liu et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the 70 90 cm layer was a highly weathered bedrock occurring in surface carbonate rocks between heavy clay soil and hard bedrock according to previous studies subsurface flow occurs mainly along the soil rock interface and is dominated by preferential flow in our study area fu et al 2015b as a result water was recharged by the uphill preferential flow and its Î´d values are close to the isotope values of the recent rainfall and the soil water at a depth of 0 10 cm this pattern Î´d values of soil water were consistent in the top and bottom layers was consistent in other years fig s1 we could merge potential sources when Î´d values of two adjacent layers were similar chen et al 2015 but it was difficult to adjust the water sources when the similar Î´d values were in non adjacent layers previous studies have also found that Î´d and Î´18o values of water at shallow and deep soil depths are similar for one of their sampling dates jake and guy 1997 heidi et al 2007 isotope technology could not be used to find further answers other factors such as soil texture and root traits need to be considered when exploring deep water uptake phillips and gregg 2003 our study area has thick and viscous soil between the top and bottom soil profile layers both the clay content and soil bulk density increased with the soil depth and went up to 40 4 and 1 55 at a soil depth of 50 70 cm near the high weathered bedrock fu et al 2016a the vertical recharge of rainfall was could not pass through the clay to infiltrate into the next layer yang et al 2019 also the roots had difficultly penetrating the high weathered bedrock in the 50 70 cm layer for absorption of available soil water du et al 2019 proposed that most of the fine roots in our study area were concentrated in the surface soil layer 0 10 cm in karst ecosystems which accounted for more than 57 of root biomass and decreased with increasing soil depth we also excavated the tree roots of q glauca evergreen species and z insignis deciduous species support by fig s2 and found that they had all horizontal extensions moreover the iso source model results showed that although the bottom layers could supply 18 9 of the water supply the forests mainly took water from a soil depth of 0 70 cm although the forests absorbed water mainly from the soil there are clear distinctions in water uptake depth among evergreen and deciduous species the evergreen species mainly relied on soil water from a depth of 0 30 cm while the deciduous species used water from deeper layers at a depth of 30 70 cm our result that evergreen species used shallower water sources in our study is different from hasselquist et al 2010 and bruno et al 2020 but consistent with donovan et al 2000 the distinction of water uptake depth was related to leaf water potential between evergreen and deciduous species we found a negative correlation between the diurnal ranges of water potential and water uptake depth indicating that species with shallower layers water sources exhibited large diurnal ranges of leaf water potential in the wet season our study is more clearly to demonstrate the relationship of water uptake depth and water potential than previous studies drake and franks 2003 hasselquist et al 2010 ellsworth and sternberg 2015 and consistent with the recent finding in southwest china natural forest ding et al 2020 on the other hand the different water uptake depth of evergreen and deciduous species was further related to their divergent hydraulic traits torresruiz et al 2013 the hydraulic traits of stem and leaf were comparable in the six plantations but were showed a different between the evergreen and deciduous species our study showed that a significant correlation exists between xylem cavitation resistance and leaf turgor maintenance capacity for all forest types except z insignis fig s3 indicating a correlated evolution in drought tolerance between stems and leaves which has been suggested in other studies markesteijn et al 2011 fu et al 2012 the evergreens had significant lower stem p 50 and leaf Ï tlp than the deciduous trees except z insignis which was consistent with the findings in other studies in seasonally dry tropical forests choat et al 2005 fu et al 2012 fan et al 2018 bruno et al 2020 z insignis exhibited a more negative p 50 than other two deciduous species which may be related to larger tree heights table 1 piermattei et al 2020 the difference between the stem and leaf hydraulic traits of the two groups is related to their xylem cavitation and leaf turgor maintenance capacity which are important for physiologically functionality at low water availability kozlowski and pallardy 2002 fu et al 2012 the correlations between xylem p 50 and water uptake depth fig 7 indicates plant water adaptation strategies this is supported by a correlation between leaf Ï tlp and the diurnal ranges of water potential fig 8 unlike deciduous species in the wet season evergreen species tend to absorb soil water from shallower layers and exhibit larger diurnal ranges of water potential and more drought resistance capacity while previous studies reported plants with more resistant to xylem cavitation showed isohydric water relations with greater stomatal control over transpiration rate and relatively deeper water sources which is different from our findings drake and franks 2003 torresruiz et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 reported that midday leaf water potential could only represent the leaf water status rather midday stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of subtropical deciduous and evergreen broadleaf tree furthermore liu et al 2012 found that the high diurnal span of water potential values can indicate high tolerance to severe water stress and a rather strong ability to recover during the night hence evergreen species had poor leaf water use status with a shallow soil layer water source associated with the relatively negative leaf turgor maintenance capacity and xylem cavitation resistance in the wet season deciduous species with less negative xylem p 50 and leaf Ï tlp avoided hydraulic risk by absorbing water from deeper layers with a narrow diurnal range of water potential in the dry season evergreen species coped with drought conditions by having high xylem cavitation resistance and high leaf turgor maintenance capacity while deciduous species survive by shedding leaves hence the co occurrence of evergreen and deciduous species regulate their water use strategies to adapt with their water uptake depth and hydraulic traits the plant water adaptations of evergreen and deciduous species may be influenced by changes in precipitation patterns with the increasing temperatures precipitation patterns change seasonally and become more variable konapala et al 2020 which could lead to the increase in the frequency duration and or severity of drought and heat stress especially in the growing season allen et al 2010 fan and thomas 2013 besides soil moisture has declined significantly in 8 of the southwestern china probably due to forest management strategies tong et al 2020 hence once the soil water availability decreases particularly in the wet season different forest community types may be under limited in their growth and survive the tree growth rate of evergreen species may slow due to the reduction in shallow soil water sources yang et al 2017 high xylem cavitation resistance and leaf turgor maintenance capacity will to some extent make them tolerant of dry conditions while deciduous trees may face more hydraulic risk of xylem cavitation and leaf turgor loss 5 conclusions this study highlighted the plant water adaptation strategies of reforestation plantations with different leaf phenology and root water uptake depth with coordinated hydraulic traits the forest species are chosen from natural forests occurring in thin soil habitats and planted in relatively thick soil habitat at the foot of hillslopes in the wet season the evergreen species mainly relied on soil water from a depth of 0 30 cm while deciduous trees used water from a depth of 30 70 cm while in the dry season the deciduous species shed their leaves and evergreens used water from a depth of the 0 10 cm the evergreen species exhibited more negative xylem p 50 and leaf Ï tlp than deciduous two significant correlations between plant water uptake depth and water potential and hydraulic traits and water uptake depth indicate that evergreen and deciduous forests have different water adaptation strategies evergreen species that relied on shallower water sources exhibited a larger diurnal range of leaf water potential and more xylem cavitation resistance and leaf turgor maintenance capacity in contrast deciduous trees with deeper water uptake showed narrower diurnal ranges of leaf water potential but less stem and leaf drought tolerance results imply that under changing precipitation patterns the growth rate of evergreen species may be limited while the deciduous trees may face more hydraulic risk to the xylem cavitation and greater leaf turgor loss declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

10154,plantations as a form of vegetation restoration play a critical role in the recent greening of the earth however the sustainability of the restored vegetation under precipitation changes has rarely been estimated largely because of a lack of knowledge about the related plant water adaptation in the current study six tree species including evergreen and deciduous were selected from a typical karst forest types in southwest china a hotspot of earth greening root water uptake depth and hydraulic related traits of stem and leaf were studied our results showed that in the wet season the evergreen species mainly rely on soil water sources from a depth of 0 30 cm 49 74 while the deciduous use deeper layers of 30 70 cm in depth 47 58 in the dry season the deciduous species shed their leaves while the evergreens utilized soil water at a depth of 0 10 cm with an average absorption of 66 96 the evergreen species exhibit higher xylem cavitation resistance reflect by p 50 and leaf turgor maintenance capacity reflect by Ï tlp than the deciduous the significant correlations between plant water uptake depth and water potential and hydraulic traits and water uptake depth indicate the different water adaptation strategies of evergreen and deciduous in detail evergreen species that rely on shallower water sources exhibit a larger diurnal range of leaf water potential more xylem cavitation resistant and leaf turgor maintenance capacity in contrast deciduous species with deeper water uptake show narrower diurnal range of leaf water potential with lower drought resistance of stem and leaves our results highlight the probable divergent response such as growth restriction and hydraulic failure of evergreen and deciduous plantation tree species to the changing precipitation patterns under climate change keywords plant water source karst ecosystems stable isotope leaf water potential xylem vulnerability curve 1 introduction the current earth greening trend has been going on for the past three decades zhu et al 2016 forzieri et al 2020 studies reveal that afforestation and reforestation play critical roles in global leaf area index greening piao et al 2015 brandt et al 2018 forzieri et al 2020 the sustainability of the restored vegetation has been of interest but has not been estimated under the new global precipitation patterns malhi et al 2008 aguirre et al 2019 konapala et al 2020 largely because of a lack of information on related plant water adaptation strategies thus wider understanding of plant water adaptation strategies in vegetation conservation area is urgently needed for future sustainable development as an important part of plant water adaptation strategies root water uptake depth is controlled by the plant itself zhu et al 2016 it is generally accepted that evergreen tree species use deeper water sources e g groundwater compared to deciduous trees in the same habitat hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2012 liu et al 2017 but other researcher also finds that there is no different depth of water uptake between deciduous and evergreen species ellsworth and sternberg 2015 donovan et al 2000 further reports that the deciduous quercus laevis has greater access to soil water than evergreen quercus incana species the different plant water uptake depth is associated with leaf water potential for their water use strategies the species with shallower water uptake depth usually exhibited the larger diurnal ranges of leaf water potentials for their transpiration ding et al 2020 besides some trees use shallow soil water when this water is abundant and switch to deeper depths as upper soil layers dry nippert and knapp 2007 dai et al 2015 liu et al 2018 generally speaking any water acquisition strategy is the combined result of long term environmental selection for natural plant species and species specific adaptation while forest type species e g subtropical karst are moved from the thin stony soil habitat of natural forests and planted in the relatively thick soil habitat at the foot of a hillslope in natural habitats species use deep roots to access water in high weathered bedrock layers bonacci et al 2008 schwinning 2010 tokumoto et al 2014 nie et al 2017 however there are few studies of the water sources being accessed by forest species after a habitat change plant water adaptation are quite complex and refer not only to water acquisition strategies but also the embolism resistance capacity especially under water limited conditions matheny et al 2017 cao and goodale 2018 vulnerability to embolism is a key physiological trait determining the limits of drought tolerance across tree species choat et al 2012 besides leaf drought tolerance capacity plays a determinant role in maintaining stomatal conductance hydraulic conductance gas exchange when drought occur during the growing season markesteijn et al 2011 bartlett et al 2012 to avoid embolism of xylem plant species activate specific drought resistance mechanisms including tolerance and avoidance amanda et al 2020 these two mechanisms are associated with both evergreen and deciduous species generally evergreens show a greater xylem cavitation resistance lower leaf turgor loss point water potential and higher bulk modulus of elasticity while the deciduous species reduce water use in the dry season by shedding more leaves and relatively vulnerable for drought stress choat et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 looking at one method of drought resistance or root water uptake depth is not enough to understand plant water adaptation for example plant water use status will be aggravated by less negative hydraulic values coupled with limited water sources and coexisting species find relief by extracting water from deep and relative stable sources however there are few comprehensive studies of hydraulic resistant capacity and water acquisition this limits a deeper understanding of adaptations of reforestation especially in the south china karst region where ecological restoration produced regional greening greater than that observed worldwide as one of the world s largest exposed carbonate rock areas in the world yuan et al 1994 the subtropical karst region of southwestern china once suffered from rocky desertification several remote sensing based studies showed that trends in both leaf area index and carbon stocks have been considerably altered in conservation areas in this region the main ecological conservation projects was to recovered deforested areas by naturally reforesting croplands this project resulted in the largest karst area of tree cover in the globe delang and zhen 2015 brandt et al 2018 tong et al 2020 the forest species are from natural forests and most of them are planted at the foot of hillslopes and depressions where the soil is relatively thick with sufficient soil water in the near surface layer however compared to other studies on natural vegetation zhu and cao 2009 hasselquist et al 2010 cao et al 2014 sanchez costa et al 2015 these forest community types are under investigated the lack of understanding of the adaptation and sustainability of these forest community types will affect the implementation of the next comprehensive treatment of rocky desertification based on the above analysis the current study observed plant water sources and hydraulic traits of six tree species in a typical karst plantation with different leaf phenology which was all selected from those growing in the karst region of southwestern china we hypothesized that 1 the forest community type species have different water uptake depth and resistance to xylem cavitation and leaf dehydration with evergreen and deciduous species 2 the forest species which utilized shallower water uptake depths had stem and leaves with higher drought resistance than those that used water from deeper layers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description and target species the study site is located in a small catchment area 1 14 km2 in the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems of the chinese academy of sciences 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e which is situated in the northwest of guangxi province china along the slope of the catchment the soil is mainly thin with a depth of 10 30 cm ding et al 2018 however at the foot of the slope and in the depression the area was used as cropland and the soil is relatively thick our study site at the foot of the slope is relatively thick with a depth of 70 cm underneath the soil is a dolomite weathered bedrock zone the upper layer soil at 0 50 cm is well drained while the lower layers are sticky with a low soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s fu et al 2015a a high weathered bedrock layer is at the 70 90 cm where subsurface runoff occurs along the soil rock interface and recharges the high weathered bedrock moisture fu et al 2015a the region has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation of 1389 1 mm and an annual temperature of 18 5 the wet season lasts from late april to the end of september and provides 60 of total annual rainfall nie et al 2012 the pronounced 6 months dry season in winter spring provide 20 30 of the annual rainfall the area has undergone dramatic land use changes the area was first deforested to produce farmland then reforested for conservation purposes jiang et al 2014 moore et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the afforestation plantation contain a diversity of indigenous tree species that are mostly from thin soil habitats but grow quite well in the relatively thick and fertile soil habitat of the study region we studied six mature forest community types delavaya toxocarpa quercus glauca swida wilsoniana albizia julibrissin zenia insignis juglans regia in five 10 20 m sample plots between november 2017 august 2018 the community types were single species dominated except for the mixture of a julibrissin and z insignis in one plot table 1 all the plantations were planted in 2007 with the density of 1250 trees per hectare the selection criteria for the trees in the forest plantations were as follows first the trees were native species and could be cultivated in the karst region of southwest china second they were distinctive and unique species yet representative of its life form evergreen or deciduous 2 2 sampling and stable isotope analysis rainwater samples were routinely collected for each rain event above 5 mm from august 2017 to august 2018 the collection equipment was designed based on the new device for monthly rainfall sampling for the global network of isotopes in precipitation agency 2002 the rainwater samples were stored in cap vials wrapped in parafilm and stored in a freezer until the analysis of stable isotopes temporal distribution of rainfall data and other meteorological data were collected at a meteorological station located in the middle of the same small catchment xylem and soil samples were taken on november 11 and december 4 2017 to represent the dry season and june 30 and july 22 2018 to represent the wet season we selected five individuals per species for analysis shoots ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 cm in diameter and 3 5 cm in length were collected at mid day from stems more than 2 years old the outer bark and phloem of the shoots were removed to obtain the xylem sample soil samples were obtained in five sample plots from seven depth intervals 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 70 70 90 cm with an auger and three replicates were collected at each layer because of the high weathered bedrock layer occurring between 70 and 90 cm the soil samples only reached a depth of 70 cm a subsample of the soil samples were stored at 20 c for isotopic analysis whereas the remainder of the samples were sealed for measurement of gravimetric soil water content swc obtained by oven drying for one day swc was measured by an oven drying method and water was extracted from xylem and soil using a cryogenic vacuum distillation approach ehleringer et al 2000 li et al 2007 the isotopic composition of xylem and soil water samples were measured with liquid water isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy iris dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view ca usa at the key laboratory for agro ecological processes in subtropical region chinese academy of sciences the isotope composition is reported in Î´ notation relative to v smow as 1 Î´d o 18 r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the ratio d h or 18o 16o of a measured sample and a standard sample respectively the standard deviation for repeat measurements was 1 for Î´d and 0 2 for Î´18o extracting water from plant xylem using cryogenic vacuum distillation can mix organic materials e g methanol and ethanol that may affect the spectroscopy and lead to erroneous stable isotope values when analyzing with iris schultz et al 2011 liu et al 2013 in order to remove the pollution of methanol and ethanol the spectral analysis software of los gatos los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa was used to correct the plant water data since methanol contamination was only found in the water of the selected plant stem the error correction formula for methanol contamination established through experiments is as follows 2 Î´Î´d 0 218 2 27 exp 0

caused by methanol nb is the narrow band contamination which is outputted by the lwia spectral contamination identifier lwia sci software the corrections that were added to the original isotope values resulted in more negative xylem isotope values schultz et al 2011 according to previous study results Î´18o values of soil water are greatly affected by soil carbonate which means that isotopic exchange reactions with carbonates and water can occur at ambient temperatures but that does not occur in Î´d values meiÃner et al 2014 oerter et al 2014 orlowski et al 2016 since there is a large quantity of carbonates fu et al 2016b in the soil of our study site we only introduced the results obtained by the analyzes of Î´d values 2 3 leaf water potential predawn and midday water potentials Ï pd and Ï md respectively of leaves were measured in the dry and wet seasons simultaneously with isotope sampling with a pressure chamber pms instruments co corvallis or usa samples n 5 per species were collected from branches that were fully exposed to the sun 2 3 of the way up of the canopy at least 2 m above ground and for predawn water potential between 4 00 6 00 h and midday measurements were subsequently conducted between 12 00 and 14 00 h on the same day 2 4 xylem vulnerability curve xylem vulnerability curves vcs were determined by the bench dehydration method sperry 1986 the maximum vessel length for each species were 14 5 cm 25 1 cm 20 4 cm 23 1 cm 28 6 cm 22 5 cm for delavaya toxocarpa quercus glauca swida wilsoniana albizia julibrissin zenia insignis and juglans regia respectively n 4 one to three year old 40 50 cm long 6 10 mm in branches were cut at predawn two branches were taken from 5 trees per for each of six species i e 30 trees these tree parts were immediately wrapped in plastic bags and transported to the laboratory where they were progressively dehydrated under room conditions for one hour to one day to reach the range of water potentials that met the constructing requirement of vcs before water potential measurements with a pressure chamber pms instruments co corvallis or usa were taken three to five leaves were covered for at least one hour to allow for equilibrium between the leaf and xylem water potential when the difference between the measurements of at least two leaves were no more than 0 5 mpa the average of the measurements was regarded as the mean xylem water potential the branch was then sampled to assess its loss of hydraulic conductivity plc for angiosperm species potential cutting artifacts were eliminated by rehydrating branches in progressively shortening stints underwater which released the xylem tension before sampling the xylem segment of interest i e the 3 cm long segment in which plc is measured torresruiz et al 2013 wheeler et al 2013 stem segments were connected to a hydraulic conductivity apparatus and an elevated water reservoir was introduced to generate a gravity induced hydrostatic pressure 10 kpa which drove the flushing solution 10 mm kcl solution through the segments one end of the segment was placed in this solution while the other was connected a pipette for measuring the water flow rate through the segment measurement of continuous mass variation at 2 min intervals was performed three times to determine the mean flow rate through the branch segment to calculate maximal hydraulic conductivity k smax segments were flushed with the same solution at 150 kpa for approximately 20 min to remove embolism lastly the segments were connected to the balance system and flushed again to measure the maximum flow rate under the pressure gradient of 10 kpa sergent et al 2020 the process was applied repeatedly until more than 90 of the sapwood s specific conductivity k s was lost the percentage loss of k s plc was calculated as follows plc 100 k max k s k max the vulnerability curve was fitted with the following equation pammenter and van 1998 4 plc 100 1 exp a p b where p is the xylem water potential and the parameters a and b are the maximum slope of the curve and xylem water potential at 50 loss of stem hydraulic conductivity p 50 respectively 2 5 leaf pressure volume p v curve parameters leaves or leafy twigs were sampled from each of three individuals for each species early in the morning in the laboratory the branch ends were recut under water and rehydrated for 2 4 h until leaf water potential exceeded 0 05 mpa leaf weight and water potential were measured periodically during the slow desiccation of the sample measuring ceased when water potential stopped decreasing or began increasing after balanced pressure weight measurements were finished leaves were oven dried for 72 h at 70 to determine the dry weight finally leaf water potential at turgor loss point Ï tlp was estimated according to the method pioneered by schulte and hinckley 1985 2 6 data analysis under the guidance of the isotopic mass conservation theory this study adopted the iso source model phillips and gregg 2003 to calculate the percent contribution of water sources for tree species the soil water in two adjacent layers with similar isotopic values were merged into the same water uptake depth the equations for calculating the contribution ratio were expressed as eqs 5 and 6 5 Î´ x c 1 Î´ s 1 c 2 Î´ s 2 c 3 Î´ s 3 c 4 Î´ s 4 c 5 Î´ s 5 6 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 1 where Î´x is the Î´d value in the xylem water the subscripts s1 s5 represent the water source from 0 to 10 10 to 30 30 to 50 50 to 70 and 70 to 90 cm respectively while c1 c5 refer to the proportion of s1 s5 for total xylem water absorption statistical analysis was performed with spss 13 0 software spss chicago il usa one way anova was used to detect the differences in water potential and hydraulic traits among the six species and their seasonal differences with the least significant difference lsd multiple comparisons at a significance level of p 0 05 moreover pearson correlation was used to conduct the correlation analysis between isotopic values and water potential and the figures were plotted with origin software version 9 0 3 results 3 1 distribution and isotopic values of precipitation precipitation was approximately 1210 mm from august 2017 to august 2018 while the distribution of rainfall was temporally uneven fig 1 ranging from 9 4 mm february 2017 to 176 mm june 2018 per month although there happened were two main rain events 5 mm before november 11 no rain records were collected in the 9 days preceding december 4 fig 1 the other two sampling times were conducted after the june 30 july 22 and august 17 2018 rainfalls the rainwater isotope values varied widely across months since the beginning of august 2017 the isotope values have gradually enriched and reached a peak in december 2017 rainwater isotope values were not monitored during january and february of 2018 at the beginning of the wet season the isotope values of rainwater samples were relatively low specifically the Î´d values varied between 21 54 and 62 01 within one month before the first two sampling periods but remained between 34 26 and 88 33 within 15 days before the next two sampling periods 3 2 soil water content isotopic variation and plant water source identification soil water content swc was relatively high 30 during the four sampling periods but it varied significantly as the seasons changed p 0 05 the average swc in the wet season was 41 38 higher than that recorded in the dry season 37 61 also swc showed different variations in the soil profile it had a large fluctuation at the 0 30 cm soil layer especially in the wet season which increased with soil depth while at the 30 90 cm soil layer swc stayed relatively stable fig 2 the Î´d values of plants followed seasonal variations in the dry season the Î´d values of four species z insignis and j regia had fallen leaves remained relatively negative ranging from 59 12 to 47 27 and became less negative in the wet season fig 3 as for soil profile water isotope composition converged at the top and bottom layers which is similar to recent rainfall values in the middle layer the Î´d values were depleted in the dry season and enriched in the wet season which is consistent with the previous rainfall Î´d direct inference asbjornsen et al 2007 showed that the Î´d values of four plant species matched those of soil water at a depth of 0 10 cm in the dry season fig 3a and b in the wet season the Î´d values of six species matched those of soil water at a depth of 10 50 cm and 70 90 cm fig 3c and d according to the iso source model the four forest species utilized soil water at a depth of 0 10 cm with an average absorption of 66 96 in the dry season fig 4a and b however in the wet season the water sources of the six tree species varied slightly evergreen species mainly absorbed water from a soil depth of 0 10 cm 40 55 d toxocarpa or 10 30 cm 22 8 q glauca and s wilsoniana fig 4c and d but deciduous species predominantly extracted water from at a depth of 30 50 cm 24 35 and 50 70 cm 23 23 all the species are more likely to use the high weathered bedrock layers water 70 90

mpa in both in the dry and wet season table 2 but Ï pd in both the wet and dry season showed significant differences similarly to the midday water potential evergreen species showed a significant decrease in diurnal water potential ranges the water potential difference ofÏ pd and Ï md from the dry season to wet season while there is a significant increase in deciduous species table 2 in the wet season the diurnal ranges of water potential had a significant negative correlation with stem water Î´d values fig 5 the soil water Î´d during the same time period showed higher diurnal ranges of water potential within species indicating a reliance on soil water from shallow layers 3 4 plant hydraulic traits and those linkages with water uptake xylem embolism vulnerability curves differed among the six species with p 50 ranging from 1 25 mpa to 0 5 mpa fig 6 evergreen species exhibited more negative p 50 than the deciduous except for the z insignis there were significant linear relationships between p 50 and Î´d values of xylem water fig 7 in the wet season evergreen species with more negative p 50 tended to utilize the shallow soil water layer the deciduous species had an inverse water use status the leaf osmotic potential Ï tlp of evergreen species was significantly different from the deciduous species fig 8 in the wet season the evergreen species were more negative and showed a larger diurnal range of water potential than the deciduous species which was consistent with the relationship between xylem p 50 and Î´d values 4 discussion all the potential water sources from the topsoil to high weathered bedrock were sampled separately for analysis the isotope composition at a depth of 70 90 cm and 0 10 cm layers were similar both are different from the middle layers based on the rainfall isotopic values the water from these two layers was simultaneously replenished by the recent precipitation the water from the middle layers reflected values from the most recent rain event or a mixture of rain events these results were different from findings in other regions which suggest that rainfall supplied water to all the soil layers simultaneously zunzunegui et al 2018 liu et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the 70 90 cm layer was a highly weathered bedrock occurring in surface carbonate rocks between heavy clay soil and hard bedrock according to previous studies subsurface flow occurs mainly along the soil rock interface and is dominated by preferential flow in our study area fu et al 2015b as a result water was recharged by the uphill preferential flow and its Î´d values are close to the isotope values of the recent rainfall and the soil water at a depth of 0 10 cm this pattern Î´d values of soil water were consistent in the top and bottom layers was consistent in other years fig s1 we could merge potential sources when Î´d values of two adjacent layers were similar chen et al 2015 but it was difficult to adjust the water sources when the similar Î´d values were in non adjacent layers previous studies have also found that Î´d and Î´18o values of water at shallow and deep soil depths are similar for one of their sampling dates jake and guy 1997 heidi et al 2007 isotope technology could not be used to find further answers other factors such as soil texture and root traits need to be considered when exploring deep water uptake phillips and gregg 2003 our study area has thick and viscous soil between the top and bottom soil profile layers both the clay content and soil bulk density increased with the soil depth and went up to 40 4 and 1 55 at a soil depth of 50 70 cm near the high weathered bedrock fu et al 2016a the vertical recharge of rainfall was could not pass through the clay to infiltrate into the next layer yang et al 2019 also the roots had difficultly penetrating the high weathered bedrock in the 50 70 cm layer for absorption of available soil water du et al 2019 proposed that most of the fine roots in our study area were concentrated in the surface soil layer 0 10 cm in karst ecosystems which accounted for more than 57 of root biomass and decreased with increasing soil depth we also excavated the tree roots of q glauca evergreen species and z insignis deciduous species support by fig s2 and found that they had all horizontal extensions moreover the iso source model results showed that although the bottom layers could supply 18 9 of the water supply the forests mainly took water from a soil depth of 0 70 cm although the forests absorbed water mainly from the soil there are clear distinctions in water uptake depth among evergreen and deciduous species the evergreen species mainly relied on soil water from a depth of 0 30 cm while the deciduous species used water from deeper layers at a depth of 30 70 cm our result that evergreen species used shallower water sources in our study is different from hasselquist et al 2010 and bruno et al 2020 but consistent with donovan et al 2000 the distinction of water uptake depth was related to leaf water potential between evergreen and deciduous species we found a negative correlation between the diurnal ranges of water potential and water uptake depth indicating that species with shallower layers water sources exhibited large diurnal ranges of leaf water potential in the wet season our study is more clearly to demonstrate the relationship of water uptake depth and water potential than previous studies drake and franks 2003 hasselquist et al 2010 ellsworth and sternberg 2015 and consistent with the recent finding in southwest china natural forest ding et al 2020 on the other hand the different water uptake depth of evergreen and deciduous species was further related to their divergent hydraulic traits torresruiz et al 2013 the hydraulic traits of stem and leaf were comparable in the six plantations but were showed a different between the evergreen and deciduous species our study showed that a significant correlation exists between xylem cavitation resistance and leaf turgor maintenance capacity for all forest types except z insignis fig s3 indicating a correlated evolution in drought tolerance between stems and leaves which has been suggested in other studies markesteijn et al 2011 fu et al 2012 the evergreens had significant lower stem p 50 and leaf Ï tlp than the deciduous trees except z insignis which was consistent with the findings in other studies in seasonally dry tropical forests choat et al 2005 fu et al 2012 fan et al 2018 bruno et al 2020 z insignis exhibited a more negative p 50 than other two deciduous species which may be related to larger tree heights table 1 piermattei et al 2020 the difference between the stem and leaf hydraulic traits of the two groups is related to their xylem cavitation and leaf turgor maintenance capacity which are important for physiologically functionality at low water availability kozlowski and pallardy 2002 fu et al 2012 the correlations between xylem p 50 and water uptake depth fig 7 indicates plant water adaptation strategies this is supported by a correlation between leaf Ï tlp and the diurnal ranges of water potential fig 8 unlike deciduous species in the wet season evergreen species tend to absorb soil water from shallower layers and exhibit larger diurnal ranges of water potential and more drought resistance capacity while previous studies reported plants with more resistant to xylem cavitation showed isohydric water relations with greater stomatal control over transpiration rate and relatively deeper water sources which is different from our findings drake and franks 2003 torresruiz et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 reported that midday leaf water potential could only represent the leaf water status rather midday stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of subtropical deciduous and evergreen broadleaf tree furthermore liu et al 2012 found that the high diurnal span of water potential values can indicate high tolerance to severe water stress and a rather strong ability to recover during the night hence evergreen species had poor leaf water use status with a shallow soil layer water source associated with the relatively negative leaf turgor maintenance capacity and xylem cavitation resistance in the wet season deciduous species with less negative xylem p 50 and leaf Ï tlp avoided hydraulic risk by absorbing water from deeper layers with a narrow diurnal range of water potential in the dry season evergreen species coped with drought conditions by having high xylem cavitation resistance and high leaf turgor maintenance capacity while deciduous species survive by shedding leaves hence the co occurrence of evergreen and deciduous species regulate their water use strategies to adapt with their water uptake depth and hydraulic traits the plant water adaptations of evergreen and deciduous species may be influenced by changes in precipitation patterns with the increasing temperatures precipitation patterns change seasonally and become more variable konapala et al 2020 which could lead to the increase in the frequency duration and or severity of drought and heat stress especially in the growing season allen et al 2010 fan and thomas 2013 besides soil moisture has declined significantly in 8 of the southwestern china probably due to forest management strategies tong et al 2020 hence once the soil water availability decreases particularly in the wet season different forest community types may be under limited in their growth and survive the tree growth rate of evergreen species may slow due to the reduction in shallow soil water sources yang et al 2017 high xylem cavitation resistance and leaf turgor maintenance capacity will to some extent make them tolerant of dry conditions while deciduous trees may face more hydraulic risk of xylem cavitation and leaf turgor loss 5 conclusions this study highlighted the plant water adaptation strategies of reforestation plantations with different leaf phenology and root water uptake depth with coordinated hydraulic traits the forest species are chosen from natural forests occurring in thin soil habitats and planted in relatively thick soil habitat at the foot of hillslopes in the wet season the evergreen species mainly relied on soil water from a depth of 0 30 cm while deciduous trees used water from a depth of 30 70 cm while in the dry season the deciduous species shed their leaves and evergreens used water from a depth of the 0 10 cm the evergreen species exhibited more negative xylem p 50 and leaf Ï tlp than deciduous two significant correlations between plant water uptake depth and water potential and hydraulic traits and water uptake depth indicate that evergreen and deciduous forests have different water adaptation strategies evergreen species that relied on shallower water sources exhibited a larger diurnal range of leaf water potential and more xylem cavitation resistance and leaf turgor maintenance capacity in contrast deciduous trees with deeper water uptake showed narrower diurnal ranges of leaf water potential but less stem and leaf drought tolerance results imply that under changing precipitation patterns the growth rate of evergreen species may be limited while the deciduous trees may face more hydraulic risk to the xylem cavitation and greater leaf turgor loss declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work
