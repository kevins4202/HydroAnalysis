4860,sociohydrology has advanced understandings of water related phenomena by conceptualizing changes in hydrological flows and risks as the result of the interplay between water and society however social power and the heterogeneity of human societies which are crucial to unravel the feedback mechanisms underlying human water systems have not been sufficiently considered in response this paper proposes an interdisciplinary approach that draws on political ecology perspectives to combine sociohydrological insights with analyses of social power and of the ways in which different social groups distinctively interact with water systems we draw on empirical evidence of cape town s water insecurity before and during the prolonged drought 2015 2017 that escalated into a severe water crisis also known as day zero the study integrates times series of reservoir storage and water consumption with 40 interviews and focus group discussions to firstly retrace the historical legacy of colonial rules apartheid and more recently neoliberal policies within this human water system we show how cape town s political legacy has encouraged unsustainable levels of water consumption amongst the white elite and tolerated chronic water insecurity amongst black informal dwellers this uneven geography of water insecurity is also discernible in the unequal experiences of drought and water resilience trajectories of diverse social groups across cape town we conclude that accounting for social power and inequalities can advance sociohydrology by identifying those mechanisms within society that determine what water is secured and what human water interactions and dynamics will be sustained over time furthermore by engaging with social power sociohydrology can play a significant role in informing policies that reduce inequalities in water access and unsustainable water use keywords unequal water insecurity social inequalities political ecology legacy droughts sociohydrology social power 1 introduction the challenge of defining and addressing water insecurity it is 5 pm on the 5th of february 2018 in langa a coloured township in cape town south africa kayla is about to rinse off her hair but not a single drop of water comes out of the shower head she had finished the limited amount of water that her large family was allowed to consume on that day about 350 l per residential unit 1 1 a residential unit in cape town s urban areas does not necessarily correspond to a family or a household the residential unit or unit is the physical structure shared by a group of individuals that use communal basic services i e water and electricity in less privileged areas such as townships and informal settlements one residential unit can hose more than one family up to 8 15 people mcgaffin 2018 russell 1998 see section 3 for further information per day at the same time in bishop court about 14 km south west from langa the du plessis family is watering the garden with water from the borehole they had recently drilled 2 2 all names and surnames used in the paper are fictitious in order to preserve the interviewees anonymity as per ethical requirements both families were experiencing a prolonged and severe drought which resulted in a major water crisis that shocked the entire city known as cape town s day zero yet their experiences of water crisis differ more than anecdotal these experiences truly embody the different conditions of water access among cape town residents during the drought what is more their stories exemplify one of the questions behind this paper which seeks to understand how and why different societal groups endure varying levels of water insecurity whilst experiencing the same drought droughts and water insecurity overwhelmingly affect some societal groups more than others douglass and miller 2018 loftus 2015 sultana 2018 unesco and unesco i wssm 2019 zwarteveen et al 2017 along these lines the world economic and social survey declared that poor and marginalized groups are likely to experience the worst impacts of future water shortages unesco and unesco i wssm 2019 this becomes even more alarming in light of the increasing severity and frequency of future drought events van lanen et al 2013 trenberth et al 2014 leng et al 2015 guerreiro et al 2018 schiermeier 2018 mishra and singh 2010 it is estimated that in the next decade about 700 million people are at risk of displacement due to water shortages hameeteman 2013 nature 2019 political ecologists have long argued that the distribution of water related risks is uneven since it is shaped by socio political structures and dynamics related amongst others to class religion gender and ethnicity loftus and mcdonald 2001 bakker 2003 kooy and bakker 2008 storm 2009 sultana 2009 2011 swyngedouw 1997 1999 zwarteveen et al 2017 mawani 2019 lutz ley et al 2020 this scholarship invited to understand water as animated by the everyday negotiations contestations and conciliations that take place between different actors anand 2011 truelove 2011 2016 loftus 2012 pihljak et al 2019 wilson et al 2019 in other words water flows are continuously reshaped by unequal power relationships inherent to human societies nevertheless politics remains all too often partial or under elaborated both in scientific and policy contexts mawani 2019 wilson et al 2019 lutz ley et al 2020 this also applies to contemporary policies and scientific discussions on water insecurity which tend to neglect or inadequately account for the role that power imbalances play in shaping water systems and hydrological extremes loftus 2015 zeitoun et al 2016 to illustrate grey and sadoff 2007 define water security as the availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health livelihood ecosystems and production coupled with an acceptable level of water related risks to people environment and economies following this logic water insecurity becomes merely the consequence of hydro climatological conditions e g availability of acceptable quantity of water rather than the outcome of particular social relations that can be transformed or addressed loftus 2015 sociohydrology has shed new light on water related phenomena by conceptualizing changes in hydrological flows as the result of the interplay between water and society ertsen et al 2014 viglione et al 2014 montanari 2015 troy et al 2015 schifman et al 2017 di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b yet these attempts of capturing human behaviour have mostly concealed socio political processes and context specificities that characterize every society evers et al 2017 wesselink et al 2017 in turn we posit that sociohydrological analyses of human water systems undertheorize the influence of social power on hydrological flows this we argue is problematic for several reasons first it conceals the political economic and social relations that make some societal groups significantly more able to control and alter the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources secondly every social group has different capacities and resources to recover from and adapt to extreme hydrological events fothergill et al 1999 wisner et al 2004 adger 2003 to illustrate a drought will engender different resilience trajectories that cannot be generalized nor merged as a common societal response in turn each trajectory will diversely affect or interact with water systems by glossing over the power structures that define society there is a risk to promote water policies that are inadequate to address water related challenges wheater and gober 2015 or perpetuate social and environmental injustices ikeme 2003 zwarteveen and boelens 2014 loftus 2015 thus it is key to acknowledge the existence of plural and at times conflicting interests within societies as well as their implications for human water systems in response this paper considers water insecurity and hydrological extremes as phenomena engendered by the complex interactions within society and between society and hydrological flows to analyse this interplay the article engages sociohydrological perspectives with political ecology we draw on empirical work on the cape town s 2015 2017 drought to examine how different societal groups distinctively interact and coevolve with the human water system to do so we combined about 40 semi structured interviews and focus group discussions undertaken between may 2019 and march 2020 in cape town annex a supplementary material with secondary data from recent literature and the city of cape town s data portal the semi structured interviews offered participants the opportunity to explore issues they perceive as important longhurst 2003 through focus group discussions a group of selected individuals explored particular issues that are compelling for their specific social group secor 2010 the interviewees selected belong to diverse societal groups and socio economic sectors to represent different convergent and divergent societal interests unequal degree and forms of power and diverse experiences of water security across cape town the questions mostly concern the everyday water use as well as the domestic experiences and copying strategies during the drought annex b supplementary material this in depth qualitative analysis is combined and triangulated with quantitative data that set out the sociohydrological examinations of this study i e time series of rainfall annually averaged reservoir storage per inhabitant human population and annually averaged daily water consumption as a proof of concept annex c supplementary material combines the methods with most of the primary and secondary data used to elaborate the main argumentations specifically we examine cape town s domestic water access and water consumption both before and during the drought in doing so we question the extent to which water insecurity can be solely blamed on the latest drought which was indeed very rare and severe wolski 2018 the paper exposes the relation between water insecurity and urban development under colonial rules apartheid and more recently neoliberal policies while retracing the hydrological and political legacy of the city we expose the power relations that produce uneven levels of water security in cape town thereby enriching examinations of the current sociohydrological drought and its uneven impacts finally the paper delineates the different drought resilience trajectories of cape town s diverse urban areas which represent multiple and distinctive human feedbacks to the local water system based on this work we conclude that societal differences or power imbalances are more effective in explaining human interactions with water systems relative to the average societal response this is where the political ecology s contribution to sociohydrology lies our argument insinuates that power which often manifests in economic cultural and political advantages determines the way in which certain societal groups are better placed to influence water systems at the detriment of sociohydrological inequalities and unsustainable water use 2 water in security engaging sociohydrology with political ecology water insecurity is concerned with challenges related to water resources availability and the multiple trade offs between growing urban demands social justice concerns and environmental needs bakker 2012 un water 2013 wheater and gober 2015 prevailing scientific approaches that tackle water insecurity tend to simplify socio economic patterns and or disregard human responses that influence water availability and use bakker 2012 zeitoun et al 2016 however functional for scientific purposes these simplifications can perpetuate inequality and or result in unintended consequences for both environment and society srinivasan 2015 di baldassarre et al 2019 tiwale et al 2018 in the context of human drought interactions unintended consequences are sociohydrological phenomena like supply demand cycles and reservoir effects the supply demand cycle kallis 2010 describes instances where water supply infrastructure enables urban industrial and agricultural expansions which in turn increases water demand and thus pressure on the available water resources as a result this phenomenon gradually off sets the benefits that were initially foreseen and makes the societal system more susceptible to water insecurity when droughts occur another sociohydrological phenomenon often associated with water supply expansion projects is known as the reservoir effect di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b it occurs when reservoirs simultaneously secure water availability and increase the community s dependence on water infrastructure resulting in higher vulnerability to and impacts from future droughts or water shortages similar unintended consequences of water infrastructure have also been described by scholars as fixes that backfire gohari et al 2013 the study of these phenomena is central to sociohydrology scholarship which argues that water and human systems change interdependently and co evolve over time sivapalan et al 2014 ertsen et al 2014 viglione et al 2014 montanari 2015 troy et al 2015 schifman et al 2017 di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b hence sociohydrological studies do not only connect the hydrological and social processes that produce extreme or undesirable conditions but also explicitly account for the temporal dimension of this interaction srinivasan et al 2017 the time dimension explains phenomena like water insecurity as legacy of the past as well as the result of continuous feedbacks between hydrological technical and social systems di baldassarre et al 2019 srinivasan et al 2017 srinivasan 2015 using a similar hypothesis srinivasan 2015 analysed the urban water systems of chennai india and showed how changes in past decisions would result in different feedbacks on chennai s sociohydrological system and consequently in different levels of water insecurity in this case different sociohydrological trajectories are contingent upon government s decisions on water infrastructure and water tariffs changes in the initial level of water storage high or low and in the type of water tariffs flat or volumetric influenced the households ability to access water and water secure themselves to date sociohydrology has advanced understanding of the multiple ways in which humans have influenced the occurrence and impacts of hydrological extremes yet with few exceptions e g srinivasan 2015 garcia et al 2016 2019 this scholarship does not explicitly consider the power relations that define society and the agency of different societal groups and individuals wesselink et al 2017 evers et al 2017 sanderson 2018 has recently highlighted how different individuals or societal groups have more or less power to negotiate their access to water depending on their position within society to illustrate when lilongwe the capital of malawi experienced water shortages field engineers and water utility managers have often faced political pressures to concentrate water supply in high income residential areas commercial districts and city centre thereby leaving lower income neighbourhoods poorly served alda vidal et al 2018 furthermore sociohydrological interpretations of society do not purposely account for the rationale of societal interventions or driving mechanisms of human water system dynamics evers et al 2017 for instance economic growth or industrialization are not seen as the result of prevailing policies put forward by and in the interest of the most powerful societal groups overlooking power imbalances and heterogeneity within society sociohydrology risks ignoring some of the factors that engender water insecurity this might also lead to technical solutions that are likely to reproduce existing inequalities and leave some societal groups more vulnerable and water insecure than others ikeme 2003 tiwale et al 2018 mawani 2019 wilson et al 2019 to better understand the interactions between human and water systems we draw on political ecology s perspectives on water access and distribution which in our view are able to deepen sociohydrological interpretation of society as sociohydrology political ecology is concerned with examinations of water and society relations but focuses on society and its relationships with the environment perreault et al 2015 political ecology s studies on water analyse how power determines which actors have control over and decide upon water resources development infrastructure and water distribution swyngedouw 1997 1999 ekers and loftus 2008 zwarteveen et al 2017 rusca et al 2018 loftus et al 2019 wilson et al 2019 other studies also seek to understand the socio political processes such as decision making policy making ideological or governance shifts which cause social inequalities and environmental degradation pelling 1999 leff 2015 loftus 2015 perreault et al 2015 along these lines past critical studies have examined the relationship between flood and drought and processes of governance and uneven development pelling 1999 bankoff 2003 verchick 2012 douglass and miller 2018 williamson 2018 pelling 1999 for instance showed how different experiences of flood in urban guyana were mostly a consequence of the global liberalization and privatization policies which privileged economic growth at the expense of societal and environmental justice pelling 1999 on a similar note mustafa 2005 and collins 2010 illustrate how the distribution of uneven vulnerabilities to hydrological extremes strongly relates to existing power imbalances and societal inequalities for them it is often a process of marginalization and or dispossession vs facilitation and or accumulation that cause uneven experiences of the same hazard through these analyses which reveal that water and society coevolve in a political space political ecology sheds light on the politics that ignite and or reshape human water interactions more precisely these examinations expose the actors and processes that bring about distinct human feedbacks to water systems hence as we show in the empirical analysis below coupling sociohydrology with political ecology enables more comprehensive understandings of the temporal and spatial dimensions of water insecurity and the politics thereof on the one hand sociohydrology enables the analysis of the interplays between social technical and hydrological processes that over time have engendered cape town water insecurity on the other hand political ecology sheds light on the political processes that have engendered unequal human water system dynamics and produced uneven geographies of water insecurity importantly our study describes cape town water insecurity before and during the 2015 17 drought in order to understand to what extent the production of water insecurity relates to the occurrence of drought conditions 3 the legacy of cape town human water system the legacy of cape town s human water system is one of segregation inequality and uneven water access reflected in unsustainable consumption practices amongst the city elite and chronic water insecurity experienced by informal dwellers in this section we discuss how the historical development of the city from colonial times to apartheid and the more recent neoliberal reforms promoted an economic growth model that produced an uneven water system and privileged some societal groups at the expense of social and environmental justice in particular we show that throughout the different regimes and governance shifts that characterise cape town s history policies have continued to privilege large scale investments in and for the development of the white areas last we show how these developments inevitably intersect with sociohydrological processes which have been described as supply demand cycles and reservoir effects e g di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b during colonial times 1652 1948 the city was an international trading post welcoming mostly dutch and british merchants to extract the colony s riches and export them to europe cape town s infrastructure did benefit from the prosperity of the colony but public works and urban development were concentrated in the city centre where the properties of elite merchants were located miraftab 2012 amid apartheid 1948 1994 cape town became an explicitly race based segregated city with black and coloured people isolated in townships and white elite controlling the central areas also in those days government investments in infrastructure and services mostly benefited the white elite mcdonald 2012 in terms of water access this meant that the elite received high quality and highly subsidised water services through in house connections while black areas were poorly serviced by rudimentary water infrastructure such as yard taps or public standpipes smith and hanson 2003 with the end of apartheid 1994 today cape town underwent significant structural changes to meet global demands lemanski 2007 in fact the post apartheid landscape was marked by the rise of neoliberal ideals and restructuring lemanski 2007 miraftab 2007 mcdonald 2012 the neoliberal ideology assumes that competitive and unregulated markets i e free from state interference as well as commercialisation or privatisation of services are the most effective mechanisms to achieve economic growth and deliver services brenner and theodore 2002 in cape town the neoliberal shift materialized in policies aimed at attracting transnational capital and fostering economic growth mcdonald 2012 in turn cape town s central districts became the target of massive private investments and new developments which were also encouraged by the high consumption lifestyle of the city s elite lemanski 2007 miraftab 2007 mcdonald 2012 to explain it in miraftab s 2007 p 620 words the downtown real estate became what land was for the colonizers modern gold mines over time these policies created a multi layered system that tolerates world class services in privileged areas and substandard services in unsafe and crumbling spaces mcdonald 2012 today cape town s metropolitan area includes over 40 towns with approximately 4 million inhabitants the city gradually became a popular tourist destination and an attraction for international businesses and investors meanwhile on the outskirts informal settlements and desperate poverty continues to sprawl lemanski 2007 mcdonald and smith 2004 mcdonald 2012 cape town s socio economic index fig 1 a indicates that both the city elite and the upper middle class mostly live in the western city suburbs enjoying very good socioeconomic conditions coct 2014 in comparison the lower middle class has a lower socio economic index good or average and cannot benefit from the same privileges i e having more than one car large gardens or swimming pools poor areas remain largely concentrated in the south east of the city which registers the highest population density coct 2014 low income areas can be further distinguished between formal townships and informal settlements depending on their income level type of housing and access to basic services during apartheid townships were reserved for non white people namely asian black and coloured and were mostly concentrated in the eastern periphery of the city mcdonald 2012 today these neighbourhoods continue to be overcrowded and maintain the same racial composition they have an average or needy socio economic index and usually access to basic services such as water sewage and electricity yet it is quite common for more than one household to share the same unit in order to split rent and utilities among 8 to 15 people coct 2014 in terms of water access this implies that despite having access to basic services many households in townships might not reach the minimum of 25 l per person per day promised by national water policies peters and oldfield 2005 informal settlements are characterised by households living in informal dwellings and overcrowded conditions 3 3 about 25 of cape town s population lives in informal dwellings in fact the metropolitan area counts about 320 000 informal residential units mcgaffin 2018 according to the socio economic index these areas include the most disadvantaged households where residents lack adequate basic services and suffer from high unemployment rates and rampant crime informal dwellers do not usually have piped water in their premises and access water through common standpipes coct 2014 the average daily water consumption per household within informal settlements is 40 l per unit per day where each unit can often host 8 to 15 persons this striking contrast across urban spaces led lemanski 2007 to describe cape town as a polarized city the spatial and social polarization is visibly reflected in its water supply system both in terms of access and consumption as we discuss later in this section in fact depending on the suburb and therefore on the socio economic status households can have piped water inside their premises piped water within or further than 200 m from their house fig 1b most of the time people that have no water within their premises have lower levels of access to safe water currie et al 2017 however even with piped water in their premises the large households in the townships struggle to have enough water for basic needs peters and oldfield 2005 consequently we could argue that the socio political processes which shaped cape town s urban space from colonial to post apartheid eras whilst discriminating water access also engendered different levels of water insecurity across the city since apartheid cape town authorities have privileged the expansion of water supply through large infrastructure as water management strategy mcdonald 2012 as a result capetonians today depend almost entirely on the western cape water supply system a raw water storage system of six major dams that constitute more than 95 of the total system capacity 900 106 m3 coct 2018 yet this strategy mostly benefitted those capetonians who could afford and were able to use more water on the contrary the government investments in large dams and reservoirs were not able to improve water access or the consumption amongst the most disadvantaged groups mcdonald 2012 jaglin 2008 smith 2001 the reason for this failure is the fact that local authorities did not directly address urban inequalities mcdonald and smith 2004 lemanski 2007 miraftab 2007 mcdonald 2012 mcfarlane 2018 in fact despite progressive policies to ensure universal access to water and basic services 4 4 in the years 2000 the national department of water affairs introduced a free basic water policy which guarantees to every household a basic supply of 6000 l of free potable water every month within 200 m of a person s home peters and oldfield 2005 townships and informal dwellers did not improve their precarious living conditions nor their access to water services smith 2001 jaglin 2008 mcdonald 2012 fig 2 a shows that with the completion of cape town water supply system reservoir storage increased significantly at the end of the 1970s reaching an average water supply of over 1200 l per capita per day securing water resources contributed to enable population growth in cape town fig 2b yet this also allowed the most privileged capetonians to reach unsustainable levels of daily water consumption fig 2c this increased the pressure on the available water resources currie et al 2017 koopman and de buys 2017 coct 2018 and led to a severe water crisis when a prolonged drought eventually occurred in the period 2015 2017 fig 2d whilst the reduced per capita reservoir capacity can be interpreted as a manifestation of a supply demand cycle kallis 2010 di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b garcia et al 2020 relate capetonians increased vulnerability to water shortages to a reservoir effect due to heavy reliance on large water infrastructure which attenuated hydrological variability intended effect but also delayed response to the 2015 17 drought unintended consequence these sociohydrological explanations shed light on the inefficiencies of water supply management policies yet they do make allowance for society s heterogeneity and the highly unequal levels of water consumption in cape town metropolitan area fig 2c through this case study we show how an engagement with political ecology and in particular accounting for social inequalities can advance conceptualisations of the supply demand cycle and reservoir effect this integrated understanding acknowledges the diverse human interactions with water systems in addition it also recognizes the driving mechanisms underlying human water systems which in cape town case very much relate to the high consumption lifestyle of the city s white elite as disclosed by our qualitative analysis most of the water from the cape town water supply system was supplied to sustain the ridiculous ssim 02 high standards of living of the city elite and upper middle classes whilst the latter could maintain high levels of water use inhabitants of informal dwellings at the urban fringes did not have running water in their premises viljoen 2016 coct 2018 data on water consumption for residential properties in 2015 5 5 data were retrieved from the city of cape town data portal coct 2020 and reveal the daily water consumption across cape town different neighbourhoods in 2015 the unit of measurement is litres per capita per day reveal a starkly uneven picture across different suburbs fig 2c we found that the elite living in constantia or bishop court for instance consumed between 774 and 8560 l per capita per day whilst claremont an upper middle class neighbourhood averaged about 462 l per capita per day on the contrary the lower middle class neighbourhood and the township averaged between 350 and 90 l per capita per day lastly in informal settlements like philippi water consumption approximates to 10 l per capita per day viljoen 2016 coct 2020 overall whilst informal settlements were using about 4 of the total water available the upper and middle class accounted for the 70 per cent of domestic water consumption robins 2019 to further validate our findings we refer to mcdonald s 2012 analysis which reveals that already a decade ago more than half of the city s water about 400 million litres per day was supplied to the more affluent suburbs with 35 going to their gardens and another 10 million litres per day to the 68 000 swimming pools in the city based on this unequal consumption we can assume that the supply demand cycle and the reservoir effect in cape town have not been generated by all societal groups in the same extent to use robins 2019 p 14 words our work suggests that it was mostly the upper classes with their washing machines flush toilets lawns and swimming pools who were the problem political ecologists have often described the unsustainable water consumption from the city s upper classes as a form of accumulation achieved by concentrating water resources in the hands of the city elite while dispossessing both the environment and the marginalized population swyngedouw 2005 harvey 2006 bakker 2007 ahlers 2010 in this light the uneven consumption of water in cape town both reflects and results from the uneven development of the city accordingly our study reveals another story of accumulation by dispossession with the city elite increasingly adopting unsustainable water consumption practices and the rest of the population suffering from chronic water insecurity on the one hand sociohydrology has explained how the complex system of dams and water reservoirs while making water available might have also enabled unsustainable water consumption on the other hand through a political ecology analysis this work has identified and exposed the political interests that have generated and perpetuated unequal level of water consumption across cape town metropolitan area these powerful interests we found are crucial in leading those political processes that have produced uneven geographies of water insecurities in light of these findings it becomes clear that by disregarding the political dimension we risk preserving those political forces which engender unsustainable sociohydrological changes to the detriment of the environment and marginalized societal groups in the next section we aim to understand if the legacy of the city has important implications in the way the 2015 17 drought was perceived and experienced we first explain what happened in the cape town metropolitan area when after the drought onset the six major dams were about to run dry then we explore whether and how the uneven geography of water access and uneven consumption echoes with different experiences of drought across the city 4 whose day zero during the cape town water crisis 4 1 towards the crisis most literature defines cape town s 2015 2017 drought as the rarest and most severe since last century conradie 2018 otto et al 2018 wolski 2018 others consider it the longest that the western cape has ever experienced botai et al 2017 the bottom panel of fig 2 shows that the region received less water than it was used to for three consecutive years with a substantial drop in precipitation in the period 2015 2017 botai et al 2017 conradie 2018 winter 2018 wolski 2018 the precipitation deficit caused a sharp reduction of the available water otto et al 2018 and toward the end of the meteorological drought the water level of the six major dams supplying the city reached 22 8 of their storage capacity which translated to 12 3 of usable water botai et al 2017 this prolonged and severe meteorological drought induced an extreme hydrological drought its impacts were so dire mostly because of the high water demand that some of the city s neighbourhoods had become accustomed to koopman and de buys 2017 in other words the unsustainable consumption of water especially in upper and middle class suburbs exacerbated the negative effects of the hydrological drought as well as the perceptions and experiences of the drought across the city when cape town s major dams reached the dangerous threshold of 22 of the storage level on january 2018 water authorities intensified their control on water allocation raised the price of water and imposed restrictions on water consumption levels in a few cases city officers also installed water metering devices to further limit domestic consumption besides this the city of cape town implemented an extensive and unrelenting communication campaign which spread fear and anxiety amongst inhabitants walton 2018 the so called day zero campaign 6 6 the day zero campaign is a communication strategy adopted by cape town s authorities to prevent the occurrence of water shortages across the city day zero would herald the start of level 7 water restrictions when municipal water supplies would largely be switched off and residents would have to queue for their daily ration of water making the city of cape town the first major city in the world to potentially run out of water see also coct 2018 shifted the burden of accountability from the city to the citizens who suddenly became responsible for drastically reducing their consumption and avoid day zero the mayor patricia de lille warned the citizens that if they would not change their behaviour the chance of reaching day zero on april 2018 will be very likely in deklerk 2018 as of january 2018 all cape town residents except the informal dwellers were to consume a maximum of 50 l per person per day coct 2018 by then the water crisis had already shaken the city and reached worldwide attention most of this attention was due to the fact that the drought seemingly affected a large middle class population for the first time in history ssim 02 in the next section we examine the geography of water insecurity in cape town after the drought onset by witness of interviewees and through secondary data we hereby retrace which factors produced the different experiences of water insecurity across the metropolitan area during the latest drought 4 2 perception of domestic water insecurities day zero was unevenly experienced amongst cape town citizens millington and scheba 2020 according to the local authorities interviewed it was the upper and middle class who were heavily hit by the water crisis ssig 01 international media and local authorities emphasise that the crisis affected the upper and middle class population whose lifestyle came under serious threat baker 2018 ssim 02 upper and middle classes were indeed the primary target of the city of cape town during the day zero campaign it was mostly in these suburbs where the municipality performed its relentless day zero campaign using various media communication tools including radio messages door to door outreach and informative boards only then people became aware of their wasteful practices and implemented water saving strategies in order to comply with the city s restrictions apparently before the drought water never represented a problem for those capetonians people did not care ssingo 03 and they would just leave the tap open ssics 02 the day zero campaign foresaw restrictions in water use up to 50 l per person per day or 350 l per unit per day everywhere in the city except in the informal settlements in addition to that water authorities decided to impose increased tariffs and fines for illicit usages when the water tariff was increased those who were used to consume higher amounts of water had to drastically reduce their water use ssig 01 very large consumers 35 kilolitres went from paying about 70 rands per kilolitre to 900 rands per kilolitre or else more than 30 000 rands each water bill coct 2018 in a few households the city officers installed water metering devices to control and stop unsustainable water uses these devices record the water consumed in each unit and stop water provision once the maximum permitted amount of water i e 350 l per unit per day is reached overall these day zero measures prevented the upper and middle class from maintaining their previous consumption standards specifically most of the wealthier families could not water their gardens fill up their swimming pools wash their cars or bath and shower as regularly as they did before the drought however the idea that the upper and middle classes were most affected by the drought is most probably based on their perceptions and reactions to the crisis rather than on actual experiences of water insecurity 4 3 domestic water insecurities and everyday coping strategies in practice during the drought the city s upper and middle class never remained without water and never suffered any drastic shortage ssics 01 moreover to overcome the city s restrictions upper and middle class households adopted a number of coping strategies ssingo 01 our qualitative analysis reveals that most of those families bought bottled water purchased rainwater tanks and or used spring water collected outside the town ssim 01 if wealthier and located close to an aquifer some upper and middle class households drilled a borehole to replace or integrate municipal water supply with groundwater for which no restrictions were applied in sum those who had the financial resources to do so went off the grid i e using water sources alternative to the water provided by the city quickly bypassing restrictions and overcoming shortages as a result most of these households were able to alleviate their burden and overcome the fear of becoming like them i e the informal settlement dwellers ssim 03 this aptly illustrates how the social and economic advantages provided upper and middle class residents with room to manoeuvre to cope with emerging water insecurity furthermore the development of alternative water sources increased their resilience to future droughts and or municipal water shortages we thus contend that a privileged socio economic status allowed the upper classes to improve their level of water security and to become more water secure than they were before the crisis and ultimately to exert more pressure on the local water system as wwf 2020 recently revealed most of the reduction of water uses achieved by capetonians came as a result of the residents aggressively pursuing alternative water sources and most notably groundwater only in the newland upmarket suburb their census found out that more than 100 wells were not included in the government database and that 50 of those boreholes have been drilled between 2017 and 2019 wwf 2020 the experience of drought in the townships was markedly different here most of the dwellings only have access to basic water services since 2000 the free basic water policy has ensured the first 6000 l of water per month yet as this amount was to be shared among a large number of dwellers occupying a housing unit the water available was often insufficient in general before the drought water was never free but the price was very very little fgdctc 01 when the water crisis escalated one of the first decisions of the city was to suspend the free basic water policy and increase the water tariff which was not always affordable for townships residents as a matter of fact the new tariff was a shock fgdctc 02 some of us is not privileged to have money every day to go buy water and then you need to manage your washing water for your toilet or to clean the yard and everything so it was a lot of strain on us also some of us do not work there is no income every day to go buy water and you need to travel to go buy water is not that you can just walk around the corner and go buy some water fgdctc 01 along with the increase in tariff cape town s water authorities also intensified the installation of water metering devices to restrict the water usages and avoid unpaid bills in the townships these devices were peculiarly labelled weapons of mass destruction by dwellers as they perceived them as a tool to drastically cut their water consumption fgdctc 02 in principle formal townships were subject to the same water restrictions as the upper and middle class a maximum of 50 l per persons per day and 350 l per unit per day respectively however these restrictions were calculated on average residential units of 6 7 people per unit whilst township units often host about 8 to 15 as mentioned in section 3 therefore in practice townships households were often restricted to much less than 50 l per person per day coping with water use restrictions and increased water tariff was challenging in the townships and those dwellers which could not afford alternative water sources all too often ran out of water some users in delft declared to have experienced a water shortage for two to four days in a row fgdctc 01 some women were forced to stop the daily housecleaning because the water metering device interrupted the provision in the middle of the morning hence they could not wash their clothes clean the house nor cook the family meals fgdctc 01 this also explains why kayla the women we commenced the paper with had to stop showering in the middle of the night when the water stopped ssictc 01 rokaya from delft recounts she had to stop watering her vegetable garden which provided her with some food fgdctc 01 the same occurred to many of the people living in the cape flats who saw their vegetable gardens and livelihood slowly disappear ssingo 05 what is striking here is the contrast between the upper or middle classes and the townships in experiencing the drought in fact whilst the former could not meet their high standards of water consumption townships dwellers could not even satisfy their basic needs additionally the townships experienced severe water shortages which forced them to harsher conditions compared to the wealthier suburbs ssingo 01 in this situation people in the townships tried to use less water prioritized water uses by taking fewer showers and recycled water fgdctc 01 on days in which water was cut abruptly women got up as early as 4am to make best use of the water available only a few families with strong networks and local ties managed to get additional water from corrupt water operators fgdctc 02 the others had to survive water shortages on their own in fact from the city or the government there was very little information targeting this social group who was left with little or no assistance ssingo 02 alongside the crisis management strategy of the government that favoured middle class and upper class residents the harsher experience of the drought in townships was determined by residents socio economic status townships dwellers had limited resources to implement coping strategies such as rainwater tanks or boreholes at household level for some even bottled water was too expensive furthermore also the composition of the household and the number of people living in each unit shaped their experience of drought finally drilling a borehole or finding a fresh water spring is nearly impossible as these neighbourhoods are too densely populated without access to alternative supplies townships residents had to solely rely on the water provided by the city and it was really bad ssictc 01 in contrast with the resilience trajectories of the upper classes we have observed that the inhabitants of these lower class neighbourhoods have seemingly reduced their level of water security relative to before the drought in a short amount of time they lost their free basic water service they have had to cope with the increased tariff and in some cases the water metering devices reduced the maximum amount of water they could use on a daily basis informal settlements were largely overlooked by the day zero campaign for some authorities their use of water was already so little that they should be resilient enough to face the crisis they claimed that the drought barely affected residents of informal settlements because they always lived with very little water ssig 01 ssig 02 indeed activist in the area confirmed that water shortage in these areas is chronic there every day is a day zero ssim 03 yet the approach taken by local authorities shows how historical inequalities are dangerously mobilised to justify a crisis management strategy that overlooked the most vulnerable and in turn exacerbated existing inequalities 4 4 resilience trajectories of cape town s urban areas our findings reveal that whilst the general perception of city government and international media was that the middle and upper class were the most affected by the crisis water insecurity experienced in the townships and informal areas was more intense in terms of both duration severity and outcomes local authorities discursively framed day zero as a middle class crisis ssig 01 ssig 02 even though those suburbs rarely experienced real water shortages after an initial shock due to water restrictions many were able to implement coping strategies and ensure a greater amount of water for their household in the end what middle and upper class actually experienced was the imposed limitation from their ordinary unsustainable water consumption by contrast townships dwellers could not afford alternative water sources and often remained without any water for their basic needs meanwhile the informal settlements chronic conditions of water insecurity persisted ssim 02 accordingly the question that arises is to what extent can this uneven geography of water be attributed to the physical water scarcity of the latest drought our analysis of cape town day zero suggests that the different experiences of drought reproduce the same power structures and inequalities that existed long before day zero overtime the legacy of colonization segregation and neoliberalisation of cape town urban spaces has engendered the way the latest drought manifested itself and was unevenly experienced across the city these sociohydrological processes produced uneven geographies of water insecurities characterised by disadvantaged and water insecure black spaces and water secure white spaces where unsustainable water use is the norm these same dynamics are reflected in the resilience trajectories of different societal groups building upon our qualitative investigation we developed fig 3 to further illustrate this point the analysis of capetonians water access and consumption revealed that different societal groups city elite upper middle class lower middle class townships and informal dwellers already experienced unequal conditions of water security before the onset of the drought furthermore we observed that the occurrence of the 2015 17 drought mostly accelerated a pre existing water crisis and exacerbated the level of water in security of every capetonian yet according to our investigation the wealthier households upper class and upper middle class managed to enhance water security by going off the grid and ensuring their access to alternative water sources at the same time the most disadvantaged communities ended up worsening or remaining in their initial conditions thus we argue that the drought engendered different resilience trajectories that cannot be generalized nor merged as a common societal response as they express distinctive human water systems interactions together these resilience trajectories illustrate the politics at play in human water systems and retrace diverse human interactions with hydrology 5 conclusions and future implications we commenced this paper by asking what made the water insecurity levels of kayla and the du plessis family so different considering that they were experiencing the same drought to answer this question we have developed an interdisciplinary approach that places sociohydrological insights into engagement with political ecology perspectives drawing on sociohydrology we shed light on the socio technical and hydrological processes that over time shape the status of water resources and their often unsustainable uses through a political ecology lens we teased out the political drivers and consequences of these sociohydrological phenomena our qualitative analysis before the drought onset has revealed that the wealthier cape town suburbs had reached unsustainable levels of water consumption and in turn engendered different impacts on the local water resources relative to the lower classes in addition the analysis of diverse experiences of drought shed light on unequal resilience trajectories across cape town social groups we showed why these different trajectories matter and should not be homogenised or concealed into a common societal response as a first attempt to integrate sociohydrology with political ecology this paper shows the potential of advancing understanding of water insecurity and hydrological extremes however the qualitative analysis performed does not allow to quantify the extent to which the politics we describe has contributed to reshape cape town s water systems and eventually to transform the drought into the day zero crisis the main reason for this limitation is the unavailability of reliable and complete data on water consumption across cape town neighbourhoods yet we believe that our approach can inspire and inform a new generation of sociohydrologists in quantifying and or capturing the ways in which different political forces can engender and reshape water in security in the mid term new interdisciplinary case studies can reveal other mechanisms underlying human water systems interactions those case studies with access to reliable data and information should also aim at quantifying the diverse impacts that distinctive human feedbacks engender on water systems in the long term we believe that the insights gained from these examinations would encourage the development of new system dynamics models accounting for social power and inequalities that reshape human water systems overall our critical analysis served to define water insecurity as a complex phenomenon engendered by sociohydrological processes and the underlying political transformations in the struggle for control over wealth land and water by challenging depoliticised notions of water security we aim at persuading sociohydrologists and policy makers to account for the political factors that produce and exacerbate uneven geographies of water insecurity in turn we argue that the relevance of this political understanding hinges on the fact that power imbalances are the driving mechanisms that determine what water is secured and what human water interactions and dynamics will be sustained over time on these grounds we posit that water insecurity cannot be addressed solely by augmenting physical availability of water technical solutions like water supply expansion projects or demand management strategies are not sufficient in our view the first step should be acknowledging and addressing the powerful interest that hamper a more sustainable and equitable distribution of the available water across society cape town newspapers are again warning that the city has reached a water consumption level of 700 ml day similar to where it had been before the crisis and this figure seems to increase on a weekly basis ngqakamba 2019 without a systemic change of the political and economic system and the consumption practices of some societal groups cape town could experience

4860,sociohydrology has advanced understandings of water related phenomena by conceptualizing changes in hydrological flows and risks as the result of the interplay between water and society however social power and the heterogeneity of human societies which are crucial to unravel the feedback mechanisms underlying human water systems have not been sufficiently considered in response this paper proposes an interdisciplinary approach that draws on political ecology perspectives to combine sociohydrological insights with analyses of social power and of the ways in which different social groups distinctively interact with water systems we draw on empirical evidence of cape town s water insecurity before and during the prolonged drought 2015 2017 that escalated into a severe water crisis also known as day zero the study integrates times series of reservoir storage and water consumption with 40 interviews and focus group discussions to firstly retrace the historical legacy of colonial rules apartheid and more recently neoliberal policies within this human water system we show how cape town s political legacy has encouraged unsustainable levels of water consumption amongst the white elite and tolerated chronic water insecurity amongst black informal dwellers this uneven geography of water insecurity is also discernible in the unequal experiences of drought and water resilience trajectories of diverse social groups across cape town we conclude that accounting for social power and inequalities can advance sociohydrology by identifying those mechanisms within society that determine what water is secured and what human water interactions and dynamics will be sustained over time furthermore by engaging with social power sociohydrology can play a significant role in informing policies that reduce inequalities in water access and unsustainable water use keywords unequal water insecurity social inequalities political ecology legacy droughts sociohydrology social power 1 introduction the challenge of defining and addressing water insecurity it is 5 pm on the 5th of february 2018 in langa a coloured township in cape town south africa kayla is about to rinse off her hair but not a single drop of water comes out of the shower head she had finished the limited amount of water that her large family was allowed to consume on that day about 350 l per residential unit 1 1 a residential unit in cape town s urban areas does not necessarily correspond to a family or a household the residential unit or unit is the physical structure shared by a group of individuals that use communal basic services i e water and electricity in less privileged areas such as townships and informal settlements one residential unit can hose more than one family up to 8 15 people mcgaffin 2018 russell 1998 see section 3 for further information per day at the same time in bishop court about 14 km south west from langa the du plessis family is watering the garden with water from the borehole they had recently drilled 2 2 all names and surnames used in the paper are fictitious in order to preserve the interviewees anonymity as per ethical requirements both families were experiencing a prolonged and severe drought which resulted in a major water crisis that shocked the entire city known as cape town s day zero yet their experiences of water crisis differ more than anecdotal these experiences truly embody the different conditions of water access among cape town residents during the drought what is more their stories exemplify one of the questions behind this paper which seeks to understand how and why different societal groups endure varying levels of water insecurity whilst experiencing the same drought droughts and water insecurity overwhelmingly affect some societal groups more than others douglass and miller 2018 loftus 2015 sultana 2018 unesco and unesco i wssm 2019 zwarteveen et al 2017 along these lines the world economic and social survey declared that poor and marginalized groups are likely to experience the worst impacts of future water shortages unesco and unesco i wssm 2019 this becomes even more alarming in light of the increasing severity and frequency of future drought events van lanen et al 2013 trenberth et al 2014 leng et al 2015 guerreiro et al 2018 schiermeier 2018 mishra and singh 2010 it is estimated that in the next decade about 700 million people are at risk of displacement due to water shortages hameeteman 2013 nature 2019 political ecologists have long argued that the distribution of water related risks is uneven since it is shaped by socio political structures and dynamics related amongst others to class religion gender and ethnicity loftus and mcdonald 2001 bakker 2003 kooy and bakker 2008 storm 2009 sultana 2009 2011 swyngedouw 1997 1999 zwarteveen et al 2017 mawani 2019 lutz ley et al 2020 this scholarship invited to understand water as animated by the everyday negotiations contestations and conciliations that take place between different actors anand 2011 truelove 2011 2016 loftus 2012 pihljak et al 2019 wilson et al 2019 in other words water flows are continuously reshaped by unequal power relationships inherent to human societies nevertheless politics remains all too often partial or under elaborated both in scientific and policy contexts mawani 2019 wilson et al 2019 lutz ley et al 2020 this also applies to contemporary policies and scientific discussions on water insecurity which tend to neglect or inadequately account for the role that power imbalances play in shaping water systems and hydrological extremes loftus 2015 zeitoun et al 2016 to illustrate grey and sadoff 2007 define water security as the availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health livelihood ecosystems and production coupled with an acceptable level of water related risks to people environment and economies following this logic water insecurity becomes merely the consequence of hydro climatological conditions e g availability of acceptable quantity of water rather than the outcome of particular social relations that can be transformed or addressed loftus 2015 sociohydrology has shed new light on water related phenomena by conceptualizing changes in hydrological flows as the result of the interplay between water and society ertsen et al 2014 viglione et al 2014 montanari 2015 troy et al 2015 schifman et al 2017 di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b yet these attempts of capturing human behaviour have mostly concealed socio political processes and context specificities that characterize every society evers et al 2017 wesselink et al 2017 in turn we posit that sociohydrological analyses of human water systems undertheorize the influence of social power on hydrological flows this we argue is problematic for several reasons first it conceals the political economic and social relations that make some societal groups significantly more able to control and alter the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources secondly every social group has different capacities and resources to recover from and adapt to extreme hydrological events fothergill et al 1999 wisner et al 2004 adger 2003 to illustrate a drought will engender different resilience trajectories that cannot be generalized nor merged as a common societal response in turn each trajectory will diversely affect or interact with water systems by glossing over the power structures that define society there is a risk to promote water policies that are inadequate to address water related challenges wheater and gober 2015 or perpetuate social and environmental injustices ikeme 2003 zwarteveen and boelens 2014 loftus 2015 thus it is key to acknowledge the existence of plural and at times conflicting interests within societies as well as their implications for human water systems in response this paper considers water insecurity and hydrological extremes as phenomena engendered by the complex interactions within society and between society and hydrological flows to analyse this interplay the article engages sociohydrological perspectives with political ecology we draw on empirical work on the cape town s 2015 2017 drought to examine how different societal groups distinctively interact and coevolve with the human water system to do so we combined about 40 semi structured interviews and focus group discussions undertaken between may 2019 and march 2020 in cape town annex a supplementary material with secondary data from recent literature and the city of cape town s data portal the semi structured interviews offered participants the opportunity to explore issues they perceive as important longhurst 2003 through focus group discussions a group of selected individuals explored particular issues that are compelling for their specific social group secor 2010 the interviewees selected belong to diverse societal groups and socio economic sectors to represent different convergent and divergent societal interests unequal degree and forms of power and diverse experiences of water security across cape town the questions mostly concern the everyday water use as well as the domestic experiences and copying strategies during the drought annex b supplementary material this in depth qualitative analysis is combined and triangulated with quantitative data that set out the sociohydrological examinations of this study i e time series of rainfall annually averaged reservoir storage per inhabitant human population and annually averaged daily water consumption as a proof of concept annex c supplementary material combines the methods with most of the primary and secondary data used to elaborate the main argumentations specifically we examine cape town s domestic water access and water consumption both before and during the drought in doing so we question the extent to which water insecurity can be solely blamed on the latest drought which was indeed very rare and severe wolski 2018 the paper exposes the relation between water insecurity and urban development under colonial rules apartheid and more recently neoliberal policies while retracing the hydrological and political legacy of the city we expose the power relations that produce uneven levels of water security in cape town thereby enriching examinations of the current sociohydrological drought and its uneven impacts finally the paper delineates the different drought resilience trajectories of cape town s diverse urban areas which represent multiple and distinctive human feedbacks to the local water system based on this work we conclude that societal differences or power imbalances are more effective in explaining human interactions with water systems relative to the average societal response this is where the political ecology s contribution to sociohydrology lies our argument insinuates that power which often manifests in economic cultural and political advantages determines the way in which certain societal groups are better placed to influence water systems at the detriment of sociohydrological inequalities and unsustainable water use 2 water in security engaging sociohydrology with political ecology water insecurity is concerned with challenges related to water resources availability and the multiple trade offs between growing urban demands social justice concerns and environmental needs bakker 2012 un water 2013 wheater and gober 2015 prevailing scientific approaches that tackle water insecurity tend to simplify socio economic patterns and or disregard human responses that influence water availability and use bakker 2012 zeitoun et al 2016 however functional for scientific purposes these simplifications can perpetuate inequality and or result in unintended consequences for both environment and society srinivasan 2015 di baldassarre et al 2019 tiwale et al 2018 in the context of human drought interactions unintended consequences are sociohydrological phenomena like supply demand cycles and reservoir effects the supply demand cycle kallis 2010 describes instances where water supply infrastructure enables urban industrial and agricultural expansions which in turn increases water demand and thus pressure on the available water resources as a result this phenomenon gradually off sets the benefits that were initially foreseen and makes the societal system more susceptible to water insecurity when droughts occur another sociohydrological phenomenon often associated with water supply expansion projects is known as the reservoir effect di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b it occurs when reservoirs simultaneously secure water availability and increase the community s dependence on water infrastructure resulting in higher vulnerability to and impacts from future droughts or water shortages similar unintended consequences of water infrastructure have also been described by scholars as fixes that backfire gohari et al 2013 the study of these phenomena is central to sociohydrology scholarship which argues that water and human systems change interdependently and co evolve over time sivapalan et al 2014 ertsen et al 2014 viglione et al 2014 montanari 2015 troy et al 2015 schifman et al 2017 di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b hence sociohydrological studies do not only connect the hydrological and social processes that produce extreme or undesirable conditions but also explicitly account for the temporal dimension of this interaction srinivasan et al 2017 the time dimension explains phenomena like water insecurity as legacy of the past as well as the result of continuous feedbacks between hydrological technical and social systems di baldassarre et al 2019 srinivasan et al 2017 srinivasan 2015 using a similar hypothesis srinivasan 2015 analysed the urban water systems of chennai india and showed how changes in past decisions would result in different feedbacks on chennai s sociohydrological system and consequently in different levels of water insecurity in this case different sociohydrological trajectories are contingent upon government s decisions on water infrastructure and water tariffs changes in the initial level of water storage high or low and in the type of water tariffs flat or volumetric influenced the households ability to access water and water secure themselves to date sociohydrology has advanced understanding of the multiple ways in which humans have influenced the occurrence and impacts of hydrological extremes yet with few exceptions e g srinivasan 2015 garcia et al 2016 2019 this scholarship does not explicitly consider the power relations that define society and the agency of different societal groups and individuals wesselink et al 2017 evers et al 2017 sanderson 2018 has recently highlighted how different individuals or societal groups have more or less power to negotiate their access to water depending on their position within society to illustrate when lilongwe the capital of malawi experienced water shortages field engineers and water utility managers have often faced political pressures to concentrate water supply in high income residential areas commercial districts and city centre thereby leaving lower income neighbourhoods poorly served alda vidal et al 2018 furthermore sociohydrological interpretations of society do not purposely account for the rationale of societal interventions or driving mechanisms of human water system dynamics evers et al 2017 for instance economic growth or industrialization are not seen as the result of prevailing policies put forward by and in the interest of the most powerful societal groups overlooking power imbalances and heterogeneity within society sociohydrology risks ignoring some of the factors that engender water insecurity this might also lead to technical solutions that are likely to reproduce existing inequalities and leave some societal groups more vulnerable and water insecure than others ikeme 2003 tiwale et al 2018 mawani 2019 wilson et al 2019 to better understand the interactions between human and water systems we draw on political ecology s perspectives on water access and distribution which in our view are able to deepen sociohydrological interpretation of society as sociohydrology political ecology is concerned with examinations of water and society relations but focuses on society and its relationships with the environment perreault et al 2015 political ecology s studies on water analyse how power determines which actors have control over and decide upon water resources development infrastructure and water distribution swyngedouw 1997 1999 ekers and loftus 2008 zwarteveen et al 2017 rusca et al 2018 loftus et al 2019 wilson et al 2019 other studies also seek to understand the socio political processes such as decision making policy making ideological or governance shifts which cause social inequalities and environmental degradation pelling 1999 leff 2015 loftus 2015 perreault et al 2015 along these lines past critical studies have examined the relationship between flood and drought and processes of governance and uneven development pelling 1999 bankoff 2003 verchick 2012 douglass and miller 2018 williamson 2018 pelling 1999 for instance showed how different experiences of flood in urban guyana were mostly a consequence of the global liberalization and privatization policies which privileged economic growth at the expense of societal and environmental justice pelling 1999 on a similar note mustafa 2005 and collins 2010 illustrate how the distribution of uneven vulnerabilities to hydrological extremes strongly relates to existing power imbalances and societal inequalities for them it is often a process of marginalization and or dispossession vs facilitation and or accumulation that cause uneven experiences of the same hazard through these analyses which reveal that water and society coevolve in a political space political ecology sheds light on the politics that ignite and or reshape human water interactions more precisely these examinations expose the actors and processes that bring about distinct human feedbacks to water systems hence as we show in the empirical analysis below coupling sociohydrology with political ecology enables more comprehensive understandings of the temporal and spatial dimensions of water insecurity and the politics thereof on the one hand sociohydrology enables the analysis of the interplays between social technical and hydrological processes that over time have engendered cape town water insecurity on the other hand political ecology sheds light on the political processes that have engendered unequal human water system dynamics and produced uneven geographies of water insecurity importantly our study describes cape town water insecurity before and during the 2015 17 drought in order to understand to what extent the production of water insecurity relates to the occurrence of drought conditions 3 the legacy of cape town human water system the legacy of cape town s human water system is one of segregation inequality and uneven water access reflected in unsustainable consumption practices amongst the city elite and chronic water insecurity experienced by informal dwellers in this section we discuss how the historical development of the city from colonial times to apartheid and the more recent neoliberal reforms promoted an economic growth model that produced an uneven water system and privileged some societal groups at the expense of social and environmental justice in particular we show that throughout the different regimes and governance shifts that characterise cape town s history policies have continued to privilege large scale investments in and for the development of the white areas last we show how these developments inevitably intersect with sociohydrological processes which have been described as supply demand cycles and reservoir effects e g di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b during colonial times 1652 1948 the city was an international trading post welcoming mostly dutch and british merchants to extract the colony s riches and export them to europe cape town s infrastructure did benefit from the prosperity of the colony but public works and urban development were concentrated in the city centre where the properties of elite merchants were located miraftab 2012 amid apartheid 1948 1994 cape town became an explicitly race based segregated city with black and coloured people isolated in townships and white elite controlling the central areas also in those days government investments in infrastructure and services mostly benefited the white elite mcdonald 2012 in terms of water access this meant that the elite received high quality and highly subsidised water services through in house connections while black areas were poorly serviced by rudimentary water infrastructure such as yard taps or public standpipes smith and hanson 2003 with the end of apartheid 1994 today cape town underwent significant structural changes to meet global demands lemanski 2007 in fact the post apartheid landscape was marked by the rise of neoliberal ideals and restructuring lemanski 2007 miraftab 2007 mcdonald 2012 the neoliberal ideology assumes that competitive and unregulated markets i e free from state interference as well as commercialisation or privatisation of services are the most effective mechanisms to achieve economic growth and deliver services brenner and theodore 2002 in cape town the neoliberal shift materialized in policies aimed at attracting transnational capital and fostering economic growth mcdonald 2012 in turn cape town s central districts became the target of massive private investments and new developments which were also encouraged by the high consumption lifestyle of the city s elite lemanski 2007 miraftab 2007 mcdonald 2012 to explain it in miraftab s 2007 p 620 words the downtown real estate became what land was for the colonizers modern gold mines over time these policies created a multi layered system that tolerates world class services in privileged areas and substandard services in unsafe and crumbling spaces mcdonald 2012 today cape town s metropolitan area includes over 40 towns with approximately 4 million inhabitants the city gradually became a popular tourist destination and an attraction for international businesses and investors meanwhile on the outskirts informal settlements and desperate poverty continues to sprawl lemanski 2007 mcdonald and smith 2004 mcdonald 2012 cape town s socio economic index fig 1 a indicates that both the city elite and the upper middle class mostly live in the western city suburbs enjoying very good socioeconomic conditions coct 2014 in comparison the lower middle class has a lower socio economic index good or average and cannot benefit from the same privileges i e having more than one car large gardens or swimming pools poor areas remain largely concentrated in the south east of the city which registers the highest population density coct 2014 low income areas can be further distinguished between formal townships and informal settlements depending on their income level type of housing and access to basic services during apartheid townships were reserved for non white people namely asian black and coloured and were mostly concentrated in the eastern periphery of the city mcdonald 2012 today these neighbourhoods continue to be overcrowded and maintain the same racial composition they have an average or needy socio economic index and usually access to basic services such as water sewage and electricity yet it is quite common for more than one household to share the same unit in order to split rent and utilities among 8 to 15 people coct 2014 in terms of water access this implies that despite having access to basic services many households in townships might not reach the minimum of 25 l per person per day promised by national water policies peters and oldfield 2005 informal settlements are characterised by households living in informal dwellings and overcrowded conditions 3 3 about 25 of cape town s population lives in informal dwellings in fact the metropolitan area counts about 320 000 informal residential units mcgaffin 2018 according to the socio economic index these areas include the most disadvantaged households where residents lack adequate basic services and suffer from high unemployment rates and rampant crime informal dwellers do not usually have piped water in their premises and access water through common standpipes coct 2014 the average daily water consumption per household within informal settlements is 40 l per unit per day where each unit can often host 8 to 15 persons this striking contrast across urban spaces led lemanski 2007 to describe cape town as a polarized city the spatial and social polarization is visibly reflected in its water supply system both in terms of access and consumption as we discuss later in this section in fact depending on the suburb and therefore on the socio economic status households can have piped water inside their premises piped water within or further than 200 m from their house fig 1b most of the time people that have no water within their premises have lower levels of access to safe water currie et al 2017 however even with piped water in their premises the large households in the townships struggle to have enough water for basic needs peters and oldfield 2005 consequently we could argue that the socio political processes which shaped cape town s urban space from colonial to post apartheid eras whilst discriminating water access also engendered different levels of water insecurity across the city since apartheid cape town authorities have privileged the expansion of water supply through large infrastructure as water management strategy mcdonald 2012 as a result capetonians today depend almost entirely on the western cape water supply system a raw water storage system of six major dams that constitute more than 95 of the total system capacity 900 106 m3 coct 2018 yet this strategy mostly benefitted those capetonians who could afford and were able to use more water on the contrary the government investments in large dams and reservoirs were not able to improve water access or the consumption amongst the most disadvantaged groups mcdonald 2012 jaglin 2008 smith 2001 the reason for this failure is the fact that local authorities did not directly address urban inequalities mcdonald and smith 2004 lemanski 2007 miraftab 2007 mcdonald 2012 mcfarlane 2018 in fact despite progressive policies to ensure universal access to water and basic services 4 4 in the years 2000 the national department of water affairs introduced a free basic water policy which guarantees to every household a basic supply of 6000 l of free potable water every month within 200 m of a person s home peters and oldfield 2005 townships and informal dwellers did not improve their precarious living conditions nor their access to water services smith 2001 jaglin 2008 mcdonald 2012 fig 2 a shows that with the completion of cape town water supply system reservoir storage increased significantly at the end of the 1970s reaching an average water supply of over 1200 l per capita per day securing water resources contributed to enable population growth in cape town fig 2b yet this also allowed the most privileged capetonians to reach unsustainable levels of daily water consumption fig 2c this increased the pressure on the available water resources currie et al 2017 koopman and de buys 2017 coct 2018 and led to a severe water crisis when a prolonged drought eventually occurred in the period 2015 2017 fig 2d whilst the reduced per capita reservoir capacity can be interpreted as a manifestation of a supply demand cycle kallis 2010 di baldassarre et al 2018a 2018b garcia et al 2020 relate capetonians increased vulnerability to water shortages to a reservoir effect due to heavy reliance on large water infrastructure which attenuated hydrological variability intended effect but also delayed response to the 2015 17 drought unintended consequence these sociohydrological explanations shed light on the inefficiencies of water supply management policies yet they do make allowance for society s heterogeneity and the highly unequal levels of water consumption in cape town metropolitan area fig 2c through this case study we show how an engagement with political ecology and in particular accounting for social inequalities can advance conceptualisations of the supply demand cycle and reservoir effect this integrated understanding acknowledges the diverse human interactions with water systems in addition it also recognizes the driving mechanisms underlying human water systems which in cape town case very much relate to the high consumption lifestyle of the city s white elite as disclosed by our qualitative analysis most of the water from the cape town water supply system was supplied to sustain the ridiculous ssim 02 high standards of living of the city elite and upper middle classes whilst the latter could maintain high levels of water use inhabitants of informal dwellings at the urban fringes did not have running water in their premises viljoen 2016 coct 2018 data on water consumption for residential properties in 2015 5 5 data were retrieved from the city of cape town data portal coct 2020 and reveal the daily water consumption across cape town different neighbourhoods in 2015 the unit of measurement is litres per capita per day reveal a starkly uneven picture across different suburbs fig 2c we found that the elite living in constantia or bishop court for instance consumed between 774 and 8560 l per capita per day whilst claremont an upper middle class neighbourhood averaged about 462 l per capita per day on the contrary the lower middle class neighbourhood and the township averaged between 350 and 90 l per capita per day lastly in informal settlements like philippi water consumption approximates to 10 l per capita per day viljoen 2016 coct 2020 overall whilst informal settlements were using about 4 of the total water available the upper and middle class accounted for the 70 per cent of domestic water consumption robins 2019 to further validate our findings we refer to mcdonald s 2012 analysis which reveals that already a decade ago more than half of the city s water about 400 million litres per day was supplied to the more affluent suburbs with 35 going to their gardens and another 10 million litres per day to the 68 000 swimming pools in the city based on this unequal consumption we can assume that the supply demand cycle and the reservoir effect in cape town have not been generated by all societal groups in the same extent to use robins 2019 p 14 words our work suggests that it was mostly the upper classes with their washing machines flush toilets lawns and swimming pools who were the problem political ecologists have often described the unsustainable water consumption from the city s upper classes as a form of accumulation achieved by concentrating water resources in the hands of the city elite while dispossessing both the environment and the marginalized population swyngedouw 2005 harvey 2006 bakker 2007 ahlers 2010 in this light the uneven consumption of water in cape town both reflects and results from the uneven development of the city accordingly our study reveals another story of accumulation by dispossession with the city elite increasingly adopting unsustainable water consumption practices and the rest of the population suffering from chronic water insecurity on the one hand sociohydrology has explained how the complex system of dams and water reservoirs while making water available might have also enabled unsustainable water consumption on the other hand through a political ecology analysis this work has identified and exposed the political interests that have generated and perpetuated unequal level of water consumption across cape town metropolitan area these powerful interests we found are crucial in leading those political processes that have produced uneven geographies of water insecurities in light of these findings it becomes clear that by disregarding the political dimension we risk preserving those political forces which engender unsustainable sociohydrological changes to the detriment of the environment and marginalized societal groups in the next section we aim to understand if the legacy of the city has important implications in the way the 2015 17 drought was perceived and experienced we first explain what happened in the cape town metropolitan area when after the drought onset the six major dams were about to run dry then we explore whether and how the uneven geography of water access and uneven consumption echoes with different experiences of drought across the city 4 whose day zero during the cape town water crisis 4 1 towards the crisis most literature defines cape town s 2015 2017 drought as the rarest and most severe since last century conradie 2018 otto et al 2018 wolski 2018 others consider it the longest that the western cape has ever experienced botai et al 2017 the bottom panel of fig 2 shows that the region received less water than it was used to for three consecutive years with a substantial drop in precipitation in the period 2015 2017 botai et al 2017 conradie 2018 winter 2018 wolski 2018 the precipitation deficit caused a sharp reduction of the available water otto et al 2018 and toward the end of the meteorological drought the water level of the six major dams supplying the city reached 22 8 of their storage capacity which translated to 12 3 of usable water botai et al 2017 this prolonged and severe meteorological drought induced an extreme hydrological drought its impacts were so dire mostly because of the high water demand that some of the city s neighbourhoods had become accustomed to koopman and de buys 2017 in other words the unsustainable consumption of water especially in upper and middle class suburbs exacerbated the negative effects of the hydrological drought as well as the perceptions and experiences of the drought across the city when cape town s major dams reached the dangerous threshold of 22 of the storage level on january 2018 water authorities intensified their control on water allocation raised the price of water and imposed restrictions on water consumption levels in a few cases city officers also installed water metering devices to further limit domestic consumption besides this the city of cape town implemented an extensive and unrelenting communication campaign which spread fear and anxiety amongst inhabitants walton 2018 the so called day zero campaign 6 6 the day zero campaign is a communication strategy adopted by cape town s authorities to prevent the occurrence of water shortages across the city day zero would herald the start of level 7 water restrictions when municipal water supplies would largely be switched off and residents would have to queue for their daily ration of water making the city of cape town the first major city in the world to potentially run out of water see also coct 2018 shifted the burden of accountability from the city to the citizens who suddenly became responsible for drastically reducing their consumption and avoid day zero the mayor patricia de lille warned the citizens that if they would not change their behaviour the chance of reaching day zero on april 2018 will be very likely in deklerk 2018 as of january 2018 all cape town residents except the informal dwellers were to consume a maximum of 50 l per person per day coct 2018 by then the water crisis had already shaken the city and reached worldwide attention most of this attention was due to the fact that the drought seemingly affected a large middle class population for the first time in history ssim 02 in the next section we examine the geography of water insecurity in cape town after the drought onset by witness of interviewees and through secondary data we hereby retrace which factors produced the different experiences of water insecurity across the metropolitan area during the latest drought 4 2 perception of domestic water insecurities day zero was unevenly experienced amongst cape town citizens millington and scheba 2020 according to the local authorities interviewed it was the upper and middle class who were heavily hit by the water crisis ssig 01 international media and local authorities emphasise that the crisis affected the upper and middle class population whose lifestyle came under serious threat baker 2018 ssim 02 upper and middle classes were indeed the primary target of the city of cape town during the day zero campaign it was mostly in these suburbs where the municipality performed its relentless day zero campaign using various media communication tools including radio messages door to door outreach and informative boards only then people became aware of their wasteful practices and implemented water saving strategies in order to comply with the city s restrictions apparently before the drought water never represented a problem for those capetonians people did not care ssingo 03 and they would just leave the tap open ssics 02 the day zero campaign foresaw restrictions in water use up to 50 l per person per day or 350 l per unit per day everywhere in the city except in the informal settlements in addition to that water authorities decided to impose increased tariffs and fines for illicit usages when the water tariff was increased those who were used to consume higher amounts of water had to drastically reduce their water use ssig 01 very large consumers 35 kilolitres went from paying about 70 rands per kilolitre to 900 rands per kilolitre or else more than 30 000 rands each water bill coct 2018 in a few households the city officers installed water metering devices to control and stop unsustainable water uses these devices record the water consumed in each unit and stop water provision once the maximum permitted amount of water i e 350 l per unit per day is reached overall these day zero measures prevented the upper and middle class from maintaining their previous consumption standards specifically most of the wealthier families could not water their gardens fill up their swimming pools wash their cars or bath and shower as regularly as they did before the drought however the idea that the upper and middle classes were most affected by the drought is most probably based on their perceptions and reactions to the crisis rather than on actual experiences of water insecurity 4 3 domestic water insecurities and everyday coping strategies in practice during the drought the city s upper and middle class never remained without water and never suffered any drastic shortage ssics 01 moreover to overcome the city s restrictions upper and middle class households adopted a number of coping strategies ssingo 01 our qualitative analysis reveals that most of those families bought bottled water purchased rainwater tanks and or used spring water collected outside the town ssim 01 if wealthier and located close to an aquifer some upper and middle class households drilled a borehole to replace or integrate municipal water supply with groundwater for which no restrictions were applied in sum those who had the financial resources to do so went off the grid i e using water sources alternative to the water provided by the city quickly bypassing restrictions and overcoming shortages as a result most of these households were able to alleviate their burden and overcome the fear of becoming like them i e the informal settlement dwellers ssim 03 this aptly illustrates how the social and economic advantages provided upper and middle class residents with room to manoeuvre to cope with emerging water insecurity furthermore the development of alternative water sources increased their resilience to future droughts and or municipal water shortages we thus contend that a privileged socio economic status allowed the upper classes to improve their level of water security and to become more water secure than they were before the crisis and ultimately to exert more pressure on the local water system as wwf 2020 recently revealed most of the reduction of water uses achieved by capetonians came as a result of the residents aggressively pursuing alternative water sources and most notably groundwater only in the newland upmarket suburb their census found out that more than 100 wells were not included in the government database and that 50 of those boreholes have been drilled between 2017 and 2019 wwf 2020 the experience of drought in the townships was markedly different here most of the dwellings only have access to basic water services since 2000 the free basic water policy has ensured the first 6000 l of water per month yet as this amount was to be shared among a large number of dwellers occupying a housing unit the water available was often insufficient in general before the drought water was never free but the price was very very little fgdctc 01 when the water crisis escalated one of the first decisions of the city was to suspend the free basic water policy and increase the water tariff which was not always affordable for townships residents as a matter of fact the new tariff was a shock fgdctc 02 some of us is not privileged to have money every day to go buy water and then you need to manage your washing water for your toilet or to clean the yard and everything so it was a lot of strain on us also some of us do not work there is no income every day to go buy water and you need to travel to go buy water is not that you can just walk around the corner and go buy some water fgdctc 01 along with the increase in tariff cape town s water authorities also intensified the installation of water metering devices to restrict the water usages and avoid unpaid bills in the townships these devices were peculiarly labelled weapons of mass destruction by dwellers as they perceived them as a tool to drastically cut their water consumption fgdctc 02 in principle formal townships were subject to the same water restrictions as the upper and middle class a maximum of 50 l per persons per day and 350 l per unit per day respectively however these restrictions were calculated on average residential units of 6 7 people per unit whilst township units often host about 8 to 15 as mentioned in section 3 therefore in practice townships households were often restricted to much less than 50 l per person per day coping with water use restrictions and increased water tariff was challenging in the townships and those dwellers which could not afford alternative water sources all too often ran out of water some users in delft declared to have experienced a water shortage for two to four days in a row fgdctc 01 some women were forced to stop the daily housecleaning because the water metering device interrupted the provision in the middle of the morning hence they could not wash their clothes clean the house nor cook the family meals fgdctc 01 this also explains why kayla the women we commenced the paper with had to stop showering in the middle of the night when the water stopped ssictc 01 rokaya from delft recounts she had to stop watering her vegetable garden which provided her with some food fgdctc 01 the same occurred to many of the people living in the cape flats who saw their vegetable gardens and livelihood slowly disappear ssingo 05 what is striking here is the contrast between the upper or middle classes and the townships in experiencing the drought in fact whilst the former could not meet their high standards of water consumption townships dwellers could not even satisfy their basic needs additionally the townships experienced severe water shortages which forced them to harsher conditions compared to the wealthier suburbs ssingo 01 in this situation people in the townships tried to use less water prioritized water uses by taking fewer showers and recycled water fgdctc 01 on days in which water was cut abruptly women got up as early as 4am to make best use of the water available only a few families with strong networks and local ties managed to get additional water from corrupt water operators fgdctc 02 the others had to survive water shortages on their own in fact from the city or the government there was very little information targeting this social group who was left with little or no assistance ssingo 02 alongside the crisis management strategy of the government that favoured middle class and upper class residents the harsher experience of the drought in townships was determined by residents socio economic status townships dwellers had limited resources to implement coping strategies such as rainwater tanks or boreholes at household level for some even bottled water was too expensive furthermore also the composition of the household and the number of people living in each unit shaped their experience of drought finally drilling a borehole or finding a fresh water spring is nearly impossible as these neighbourhoods are too densely populated without access to alternative supplies townships residents had to solely rely on the water provided by the city and it was really bad ssictc 01 in contrast with the resilience trajectories of the upper classes we have observed that the inhabitants of these lower class neighbourhoods have seemingly reduced their level of water security relative to before the drought in a short amount of time they lost their free basic water service they have had to cope with the increased tariff and in some cases the water metering devices reduced the maximum amount of water they could use on a daily basis informal settlements were largely overlooked by the day zero campaign for some authorities their use of water was already so little that they should be resilient enough to face the crisis they claimed that the drought barely affected residents of informal settlements because they always lived with very little water ssig 01 ssig 02 indeed activist in the area confirmed that water shortage in these areas is chronic there every day is a day zero ssim 03 yet the approach taken by local authorities shows how historical inequalities are dangerously mobilised to justify a crisis management strategy that overlooked the most vulnerable and in turn exacerbated existing inequalities 4 4 resilience trajectories of cape town s urban areas our findings reveal that whilst the general perception of city government and international media was that the middle and upper class were the most affected by the crisis water insecurity experienced in the townships and informal areas was more intense in terms of both duration severity and outcomes local authorities discursively framed day zero as a middle class crisis ssig 01 ssig 02 even though those suburbs rarely experienced real water shortages after an initial shock due to water restrictions many were able to implement coping strategies and ensure a greater amount of water for their household in the end what middle and upper class actually experienced was the imposed limitation from their ordinary unsustainable water consumption by contrast townships dwellers could not afford alternative water sources and often remained without any water for their basic needs meanwhile the informal settlements chronic conditions of water insecurity persisted ssim 02 accordingly the question that arises is to what extent can this uneven geography of water be attributed to the physical water scarcity of the latest drought our analysis of cape town day zero suggests that the different experiences of drought reproduce the same power structures and inequalities that existed long before day zero overtime the legacy of colonization segregation and neoliberalisation of cape town urban spaces has engendered the way the latest drought manifested itself and was unevenly experienced across the city these sociohydrological processes produced uneven geographies of water insecurities characterised by disadvantaged and water insecure black spaces and water secure white spaces where unsustainable water use is the norm these same dynamics are reflected in the resilience trajectories of different societal groups building upon our qualitative investigation we developed fig 3 to further illustrate this point the analysis of capetonians water access and consumption revealed that different societal groups city elite upper middle class lower middle class townships and informal dwellers already experienced unequal conditions of water security before the onset of the drought furthermore we observed that the occurrence of the 2015 17 drought mostly accelerated a pre existing water crisis and exacerbated the level of water in security of every capetonian yet according to our investigation the wealthier households upper class and upper middle class managed to enhance water security by going off the grid and ensuring their access to alternative water sources at the same time the most disadvantaged communities ended up worsening or remaining in their initial conditions thus we argue that the drought engendered different resilience trajectories that cannot be generalized nor merged as a common societal response as they express distinctive human water systems interactions together these resilience trajectories illustrate the politics at play in human water systems and retrace diverse human interactions with hydrology 5 conclusions and future implications we commenced this paper by asking what made the water insecurity levels of kayla and the du plessis family so different considering that they were experiencing the same drought to answer this question we have developed an interdisciplinary approach that places sociohydrological insights into engagement with political ecology perspectives drawing on sociohydrology we shed light on the socio technical and hydrological processes that over time shape the status of water resources and their often unsustainable uses through a political ecology lens we teased out the political drivers and consequences of these sociohydrological phenomena our qualitative analysis before the drought onset has revealed that the wealthier cape town suburbs had reached unsustainable levels of water consumption and in turn engendered different impacts on the local water resources relative to the lower classes in addition the analysis of diverse experiences of drought shed light on unequal resilience trajectories across cape town social groups we showed why these different trajectories matter and should not be homogenised or concealed into a common societal response as a first attempt to integrate sociohydrology with political ecology this paper shows the potential of advancing understanding of water insecurity and hydrological extremes however the qualitative analysis performed does not allow to quantify the extent to which the politics we describe has contributed to reshape cape town s water systems and eventually to transform the drought into the day zero crisis the main reason for this limitation is the unavailability of reliable and complete data on water consumption across cape town neighbourhoods yet we believe that our approach can inspire and inform a new generation of sociohydrologists in quantifying and or capturing the ways in which different political forces can engender and reshape water in security in the mid term new interdisciplinary case studies can reveal other mechanisms underlying human water systems interactions those case studies with access to reliable data and information should also aim at quantifying the diverse impacts that distinctive human feedbacks engender on water systems in the long term we believe that the insights gained from these examinations would encourage the development of new system dynamics models accounting for social power and inequalities that reshape human water systems overall our critical analysis served to define water insecurity as a complex phenomenon engendered by sociohydrological processes and the underlying political transformations in the struggle for control over wealth land and water by challenging depoliticised notions of water security we aim at persuading sociohydrologists and policy makers to account for the political factors that produce and exacerbate uneven geographies of water insecurity in turn we argue that the relevance of this political understanding hinges on the fact that power imbalances are the driving mechanisms that determine what water is secured and what human water interactions and dynamics will be sustained over time on these grounds we posit that water insecurity cannot be addressed solely by augmenting physical availability of water technical solutions like water supply expansion projects or demand management strategies are not sufficient in our view the first step should be acknowledging and addressing the powerful interest that hamper a more sustainable and equitable distribution of the available water across society cape town newspapers are again warning that the city has reached a water consumption level of 700 ml day similar to where it had been before the crisis and this figure seems to increase on a weekly basis ngqakamba 2019 without a systemic change of the political and economic system and the consumption practices of some societal groups cape town could experience another crisis in case of future droughts and the most marginalized groups including the environment will continue to bear the brunt declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research has received funding by the

4861,the leaf area index lai is a key variable for representing vegetation state and it is closely related to simulating carbon and water exchanges between land and the overlying atmosphere in land surface and terrestrial ecosystem models model simulations are still limited in their representation of vegetation phenological processes and capturing the resulting lai seasonality therefore this study demonstrated how lai assimilation into the model improved carbon and water fluxes in different ecosystems over east asia we assimilated lai derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data for seven years 2004 2010 over east asia into the community land model version 4 5 with a biogeochemistry module clm4 5 bgc by employing the ensemble adjustment kalman filter method results showed that lai assimilation remarkably improved estimated gross primary production gpp in particular the root mean square error decreased from 97 12 to 48 63 gc m2 month across the region for june august additionally while evapotranspiration et was less sensitive to lai than gpp the et components of ground evaporation canopy evaporation and canopy transpiration significantly changed after assimilation the analysis of plant available soil water showed that lai assimilation has unique effects on soil moisture depending on the soil layer climate and ecosystems in general the improvement in ecological prediction skill by lai assimilation was particularly evident in temperate needleleaf forests where lai was overestimated most distinctly this study improves our understanding of the role of lai assimilation in eco hydrological processes in different ecosystems with clm4 5 bgc which allows for the improvement of model forecasting and more accurate simulation

phenological cycle dynamics determine the growing season length and represent key controls on the water energy and carbon fluxes in the terrestrial ecosystem gutierrez et al 1988 kafaki et al 2009 richardson et al 2012 carbon is exchanged between terrestrial ecosystems and the overlying atmosphere through photosynthesis and respiration processes absorbed through root hairs water then escapes from plant pores in the form of vapor on leaves by transpiration therefore changes in the leaf area index lai can lead to changes in evapotranspiration et which controls the soil moisture content additionally vegetation growth with taller canopy height and more abundant leaves becomes possible when sufficient soil moisture is available wang and qu 2009 liu et al 2016 suggested that the relationship between soil moisture and lai may vary according to different types of soil thus the lai plays a significant role in predicting the hydrologic and carbon cycles of ecosystem models many studies using land surface models lsms have addressed vegetation phenology modeling at both the global and regional scales duarte et al 2017 hudiburg et al 2013 kim and wang 2005 kim et al 2015 lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2013 seo and kim 2019 zeng et al 2008 while most studies have attempted to reduce discrepancies between the modeled lai and observed lai through parameter adjustment or physical or chemical equation modifications studies on capturing the observed lai are still limited such discrepancies result in the misinterpretation of terrestrial carbon water and energy exchanges such as gross primary production gpp net ecosystem exchange nee et net primary production and crop yield he et al 2017 duarte et al 2017 compared the results of the community land model clm version 4 5 clm4 5 to observations based on the wind river ameriflux site in the state of washington usa they found that the default parameters of specific leaf area and stomatal conductance contributed to overestimated et and underestimated gpp after calibrating the parameters they improved the clm simulations of evaporation respiration and gpp which reasonably agreed with the flux tower data zhang et al 2016 conducted clm4 5 with carbon and nitrogen components clm4 5 cn in china flux tower sites they found that excessive fire burning which was based on the clm4 5 fire module caused an unreasonably low lai at the changbaishan forest site resulting in underestimated vegetation carbon and nee the uncertainty of model prediction can be addressed by integrating models with observational data with different sources of climate data and models data assimilation processes have been developed to improve the model forecast by initializing lsm variables and constraining the physical parameterization for example he et al 2017 adopted lai assimilation in wheat models and assessed the improvement of wheat yield estimation niu et al 2014 applied data assimilation in various fields such as emerging infectious disease fisheries fire and the terrestrial carbon cycle to demonstrate how data assimilation can influence ecological predictions recently kumar et al 2019 assimilated remotely sensed lai into the noah mp lsm over the continental united states suggesting that the lai assimilation has beneficial effects on the simulation of water fluxes such as soil moisture snow depth terrestrial water storage and carbon fluxes such as gpp and nee in particular the most prominent improvements were shown over the agricultural areas where assimilation improved the vegetation seasonality impacted by cropping schedules viskari et al 2015 assimilated tower measured lai and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived lai into the ecosystem demography model version 2 and found that a higher frequency of tower measured lai than that of modis lai caused the tower measured lai to have a greater impact on the state variable they found that lai assimilation could improve the prediction of the evolution of plant leaf phenology in particular data assimilation contributed to reproducing the season start date which mostly corresponded to bud bursts in spring ling et al 2019a compared the performances of clm version 4 with carbon and nitrogen cycles clm4 cn with four sequential assimilation algorithms the kernel filter particle filter ensemble kalman filter enkf and ensemble adjust kalman filter eakf they concluded that the eafk algorithm was the best choice for assimilating lai and demonstrates robust performance in clm4 cn in addition ling et al 2019b showed that lai assimilation reduced the bias in estimating lai in clm4 cn and improved the global gpp and et estimation especially in the low latitude where the lai was overestimated systematically however few studies provide a detailed explanation of how lai assimilation affects et components and how it affects soil moisture in this study we aimed to demonstrate how the data assimilation of lai in clm version 4 5 with the biogeochemistry module clm4 5 bgc played a role in eco hydrological processes and thus in predicting carbon and water flux in different ecosystems at both local and regional levels in east asia we utilized the clm4 5 bgc with and without assimilating the modis derived lai data and used the eakf method based on the monte carlo method which is widely accepted in the field because of its demonstrated optimal performance and simplicity we evaluated the performance of lai assimilation and examined gpp et and et components including canopy transpiration canopy evaporation and ground evaporation according to dominant plant functional types pfts to quantify the lai assimilation on the soil moisture we compared plant accessible soil water pasw and the fraction of effective roots along the soil layers 2 methods and data 2 1 community land model the clm version 4 5 is a land model of the national center for atmospheric research community earth system model it simulates water energy and carbon nitrogen exchange between the terrestrial land and atmosphere of each computational grid each grid cell is composed of multiple land units such as lakes urban areas glaciers cropland and vegetated land the last of which has a number of columns in each column a variety of pfts e g needleleaf evergreen tree broadleaf evergreen tree deciduous tree shrub grass crop and bare ground represent the characteristics of vegetation heterogeneity furthermore pfts that comprise one column have their own vegetation characteristics e g lai stem area index and canopy height each cycle is simulated at different sub grid levels e g land unit column and pft for example the lai and carbon cycle are simulated at the pft level in contrast soil water and energy are defined in the columns in a default clm with a satellite phenology module the daily vegetation characteristics i e lai and vegetation phenology are represented by linearly interpolating the monthly values from satellite data on the other hand when the bgc module which is used in this study is active i e clm4 5 bgc the vegetation characteristics and phenological variation of lai can be predicted under the given atmospheric forcing and thus the carbon and nitrogen fluxes can be predicted in clm4 5 bgc carbon is accumulated from the photosynthesis process and is quantified as gpp which is allocated for a variety of processes including the support of maintenance respiration for live tissue the replenishment of the internal carbon pool and the growth new plant tissue therefore gpp is positively associated with leaf size the carbon content in the leaf cs leaf gc m 2 is directly linked to the computed lai the lai m2 m 2 of each vegetation was predicted using the following equation 1 lai sla 0 exp m cs leaf 1 m where sla 0 is the specific leaf area at the canopy top m2 g 1c and m is the linear slope coefficient which are both dependent upon pfts thornton and zimmermann 2007 notably the processes of photosynthesis respiration allocation and fire burning are not only affected by lai but are also the determining factors for representing lai in the model furthermore the lai is directly associated with the water and energy fluxes i e et and latent heat flux respectively as well as carbon fluxes i e photosynthesis on the land surface in clm4 5 et the sum of canopy evaporation canopy transpiration and ground evaporation is estimated using the resistance model for the leaf stomata resistance the ball berry conductance model sellers et al 1996 is employed as follows 2 1 r s g s m a n c s p atm h s b β t where r s is the leaf stomata resistance s m2 μmol 1 g s is the leaf stomatal conductance μmol s 1 m 2 a n is net photosynthesis μmol co2 m 2 s 1 c s is the co2 partial pressure pa p atm is the atmospheric pressure pa m is the plant functional type dependent parameter h s is the leaf surface humidity pa pa 1 b is the minimum stomatal conductance μmol s 1 m 2 and β t is a function of soil water stress then the leaf stomata conductance is multiplied by lai to estimate the canopy conductance which leads lai directly influencing canopy transpiration and thus et note that et and latent heat flux cannot exceed the available water and the net radiation for the belowground process the clm includes multiple soil layers where vertical soil moisture flux is estimated by infiltration runoff gradient diffusion and canopy transpiration by root zeng and decker 2009 the soil water was simulated based on the mass conservation equation and richard s equation these equations have been adapted to solve numerically by dividing the soil column into multiple layers the volumetric soil water in each layer is based on the following numerical equation 3 δ z i θ liq i t q out i q in i e i where θ liq i is the volumetric soil water m3 m 3 in the i th layer at time t δ z i is the i th layer thickness mm q in i is the influx of water across the interface of the i th layer q out i is the outflux of water across the interface of the i th layer mm s 1 and e i is the i th layer averaged soil moisture sink term mm s 1 e i is the water flux in the soil by transpiration mm s 1 and is calculated as in eq 4 4 e i r e i c t where r e i is the effective root fraction based on pfts in the i th layer and ct is the canopy transpiration mm s 1 the details of clm4 5 bgc are presented in oleson et al 2013 while the above equations explain several details of predicting lai and soil moisture in the model which are closely related to this study 2 2 ensemble adjustment kalman filter the eakf method anderson 2001 anderson and anderson 1999 is often referred to as the deterministic scheme of enkf without considering the adjoints or backward integration zubrow et al 2008 while the traditional enkf uses the perturbed observation the eakf prevents the perturbed observation from being used instead the background error covariance is used to represent the probability density function pdf of the observation in addition it is effective and outperforms the traditional enkf in some cases ling et al 2019a shen et al 2016 in particular ling et al 2019a demonstrated that eakf showed better performance for lai data assimilation than other algorithms such as kernel filter particle filter and enkf with clm4 cn the prior distribution is assumed to be gaussian with the sample mean x f and variance p f of the forecast ensemble state vector and the pdf of the observation error is also assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and covariance r shen et al 2016 the updated covariance p a and the state vector mean x a of the analysis state vector was calculated using bayes theorem and the formula for the convolution of two gaussians is given as follows 5 p a p f 1 h t r 1 h 1 6 x a p a p f 1 x f h t r 1 y where the superscripts f and a represent the forecast and updated ensemble member respectively h is the linear function for simplicity that is y h x and h t is the transpose of h then the posterior i e updated estimate can be expressed as 7 x a a t x f x f x a where a is also the linear operator that is used to update the prior ensemble member anderson 2001 for details on the eakf algorithm refer to anderson 2001 and shen et al 2016 2 3 modis products modis data provide land characteristics data including terra surface reflectance land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi they have been used to improve our understanding of global dynamics and processes on land and contribute to validating eco hydrological models or adjusting parameters in the model hall et al 1995 wang and pinker 2009 in this study the modis derived products of 8 day global terrestrial lai mcd15a2 gpp mod17a2 and et mod16a2 from 2004 to 2010 were used the modis lai algorithm is based on modis red and near red surface reflectance information and the empirical relationship between ndvi and lai knyazikhin et al 1998 vegetation type sun sensor geometry and theoretical estimates of uncertainties by spectral bands in this study we upscaled the original data of lai 1 km resolution gpp 1 km resolution and et 500 m resolution to 0 5 data to overcome quality issues such as the sun being blocked by clouds zhang et al 2014 these upscaled lai data were used for data assimilation and the gpp and et data were used to evaluate the model performance 2 4 global land surface satellite glass lai in addition to modis lai this study used the glass lai product xiao et al 2014 to evaluate the performance of data assimilation the glass lai was generated at a global scale using the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and modis surface reflectance data the general regression neural networks were trained using the fused time series lai for different ecosystems according to xiao et al 2016 the glass lai represented more effective temporal smoothness than did the first version of the geoland2 geov1 and modis lai products while the global consistency of all these products was generally good the spatial and temporal resolution of the original glass lai products is 0 05 and 8 days respectively we upscaled the original data to 0 5 data to match the spatial resolution of this study 2 5 study area this study focused on east asia between 64 e 174 e and 0 65 n with a spatial resolution of 0 5 longitude 0 5 latitude fig 1 this area includes widely distributed high altitude mountain ranges as well as coastal areas moreover several different climate types are observed in this area including boreal temperate and tropical regions over the study area the seasonal mean temperatures from the cru ncep reanalysis data 2004 2010 were 13 28 21 41 14 42 and 4 28 c in spring march april may summer june july august fall september october november and winter december january february respectively the means of seasonal precipitation from cru ncep reanalysis data 2004 2010 were 76 97 139 89 118 55 and 76 13 mm month in spring summer fall and winter respectively this region includes bare grounds of 20 6 of the area and different pfts of needleleaf evergreen broadleaf evergreen deciduous shrub grass and crop which occupy 15 8 4 9 16 1 11 3 18 6 and 12 5 of the area respectively and are based on the modis land cover datasets lawrence and chase 2007 grassland cropland and needleleaf forests account for most of eastern china and india at high latitudes three types of vegetation are dominant needleleaf evergreen grass and deciduous moreover broadleaf evergreen forests are dominant in tropical regions furthermore we examined water and carbon fluxes in detail by selecting the five sites based on the grid data within our regional simulations fig 1 and table 1 five sites were chosen for different pfts within different climates temperate grassland tgr temperate needleleaf evergreen forest tne boreal needleleaf evergreen forest bne boreal deciduous forest bde and tropical broadleaf evergreen forest rbe while the winter air condition is dry in tgr bne and bde the bne winter climate is relatively wet based on the koppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 the bne site which is located at the highest latitudes among the studied sites has a cold summer climate unlike the other sites 2 6 experimental design in this study the eakf method was employed to reduce the model error with observed lai as eakf was shown to perform effectively ling et al 2019a shen et al 2016 the offline simulations with clm4 5 bgc were run with 40 ensemble meteorological forcings with 6 h time intervals which were generated with the atmospheric model community atmospheric model cam developed by raeder et al 2012 to represent model uncertainties and preserve the model covariance evensen 1994 previous studies ling et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2014 utilized these 40 ensemble forcings for data assimilation studies by considering both computational cost and assimilation performance the model was integrated from 2004 to 2010 as remotely sensed observations and ensemble meteorological data were available for the period as shown in fig 2 experiments of free run fr and data assimilation da were performed with a spatial resolution of 0 5 longitude 0 5 latitude with the 40 ensemble meteorological forcings before conducting these experiments the spin up simulation was run for 200 years cycling 20 year long cru ncep reanalysis forcings from 1981 to 2000 for the initialization of land states in da after the 40 ensemble simulations were performed for 8 days the simulated results of lai were saved and the data were combined with modis lai using the eakf assimilation process these revised lai data were updated and then the simulations were performed for the next 8 days this process was repeated from the integration period 2004 to 2010 it is also noted that the carbon and nitrogen contents of the vegetation were updated accordingly eq 1 when the revised lai data were updated the ensemble averages of the clm4 5 bgc simulations with and without data assimilation were compared to demonstrate the improved model performance with data assimilation in simulated gpp and et to evaluate the model performance comparisons between simulations and modis derived gpp and et products were carried out by assessing the root mean square error rmse of monthly average values furthermore we analyzed the pasw and soil moisture at a depth of up to 1 m of soil to investigate the impact of lai assimilation on soil moisture 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation with lai to evaluate the model performance we compared the lai of fr and da with the modis lai fig 3 while most of the modis lai did not exceed 5 m2 m2 in summer fr showed that most of the lai was higher than that of modis in our study the lai in fr was overestimated in the tropical region and eastern china on the contrary the lai was underestimated in the boreal region where the needleleaf evergreen tree was dominant moreover the clm has more discrepancy with the observations in summer than in other seasons such limits in clm are consistent with the results of previous studies ling et al 2019a 2019b in that by comparing the simulated lai of clm4 cn and version 2 of the copernicus 1 km fapar product they found that the lai was systematically overestimated worldwide especially at low latitudes and in eastern china upon further investigation of seasonal changes the discrepancy between lai with and without data assimilation was remarkable during the growing seasons e g july in the northern hemisphere the performance of da was also evaluated using the glass lai in the growing season june august fig 4 while lai of fr was highly overestimated in the temporal region such as eastern china and tropical regions the lai was underestimated in boreal needleleaf evergreen forests while this result was consistent with the comparison with modis products fig 3 the lai in the da run was slightly lower than the glass lai overall this may be attributed to the fact that modis lai profiles exhibit more fluctuation than the glass lai and therefore the mean of glass lai is slightly higher than that of modis in general xiao et al 2014 nevertheless the rmse between the simulated lai to glass lai was 1 8 m2 m2 in da which was significantly reduced in comparison to that in fr 3 1 m2 m2 indicating the improved performance with da using modis lai focusing on the five locations with different dominant climate and pft types fig 1 we found that the correlation and the monthly rmse values between the simulated lai and modis lai were improved in all locations fig 5 and table 2 in addition the discrepancies between the modeled and glass lais were reduced after the assimilation at five sites and this result agreed with the regional results in particular the correlation 0 07 in fr and 0 52 in da in rbe was highly improved in the tropics where rbe exists high temperatures and precipitation in all seasons allowed active vegetation even in winter in fr however the seasonal variability of lai was present in modis lai although it was not as intense as that in other temperate and boreal locations while this may be attributed to the limit of the model in simulating net carbon assimilation seasonality and its allocation to leaves it is also noteworthy that glass lai shows a lower seasonality than modis lai the rmse improved mostly in tne 4 06 m2 m2 in fr and 0 75 m2 m2 in da where the overestimation of lai was most marked in this location vegetation growth and its seasonality were overestimated in another evergreen location i e bne lai showed underestimated seasonal variation compared with both modis and glass lais considering the opposite behavior in tne and bne which have hot and cold summers respectively one can suggest that the model sensitivity of net carbon assimilation to the temperature in the needleleaf evergreen forests could be improved such limitations were overcome in this study by data assimilation 3 2 regional gpp and et to understand the impact of lai assimilation we compared the seasonal spatial distribution of gpp and et in the fr da and modis data figs 6 7 and 8 tables 3 and 4 as expected simulated gpp in da outperformed that in fr showing some discrepancy in comparison to that in modis overall gpp was most improved in summer with monthly rmses compared with modis at 97 12 and 48 63 gc m2 month in fr and da respectively table 3 in fig 6 the rmse of monthly gpp in eastern china and the indochina peninsula within the temperate or sub tropical zone showed a relatively high value 200 gc m2 month in fr after the observed lai was assimilated the rmse of gpp decreased to approximately 100 gc m2 month in da lai data assimilation could help improve the prediction of gpp interacting with modeled lai which had a large discrepancy with observation we also note that the spatial variations of the rmses follow the discrepancy of lai in fig 3 the relative difference of gpp between fr and modis fig 7a showed that gpp was overestimated in the tropical and temporal regions and underestimated in the boreal region which is similar to the error pattern of lai the relative difference of gpp between da and modis fig 7b showed that gpp decreased in most of the study area after assimilating modis lai however gpp increased in the boreal region which is consistent with previous studies demarty et al 2007 ramos et al 2018 demarty et al 2007 applied lai assimilation to the orchidee dynamic global vegetation model globally they found that gpp could increase with assimilation in boreal regions where the modis lai is generally higher than that of simulations without data assimilation in ecosystem models gpp has a strong correlation with lai he et al 2013 suggested that the values of modis gpp were lower than those of gpp from flux tower datasets in temperate sites such as qianyanzhou forest site qyz and dinghushan forest site dhs which are within our study area on the other hand zhang et al 2016 showed that the modeled gpp in clm4 5 cn was overestimated in qyz and dhs as our simulated gpp of da existed between the gpp of fr and modis fig 7 lai assimilation was effective in reducing the uncertainties of the model results especially in temperate regions where the discrepancy between modeled gpp and modis gpp was markedly noticeable simulated et unlike gpp was not significantly affected by the assimilation of lai as shown in table 4 the rmses of monthly et in fr and da were not significantly different fig 8 while the rmse of gpp reduced by approximately 50 with lai assimilation in summer that of et was reduced by less than 10 which will be further examined in the following section furthermore it is noticeable that the spatial patterns of the rmses in et fig 8 are distinct from those in gpp fig 6 this might be attributed to the fact that the magnitude of et was not greatly influenced by lai rather than the climatic conditions while lai is directly related to gpp et i e the sum of canopy evaporation canopy transpiration and ground evaporation is in part related to lai via canopy evaporation and transpiration in addition a discrepancy between the ensemble atmospheric forcings used in this study and the atmospheric conditions used for modis et should be noted the modis et product is based on the penman monteith equation with a reanalysis of meteorological data driven by the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications and remote sensing data albedo land cover lai and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation over most agricultural regions such as india indochina peninsula and northeastern china both gpp and et were generally overestimated in fr and da and rarely improved via data assimilation figs 1 and 7 this is consistent with the findings of jiang and ryu 2016 demonstrating that the values of modis gpp and et were lower than flux tower observations and significantly underestimated in cropland and shrubland additionally jang et al 2013 showed that modis has large biases in croplands over east asia 3 3 gpp et and et partition in different ecosystems we focused on the five locations with different vegetation types as mentioned in section 2 4 fig 9 gpp estimations were greatly improved in all five locations the seasonal variability of gpp in fr was reasonably simulated but the maximum gpp was limitedly captured the discrepancy of the gpp between the model and modis was reduced after the data assimilation process was applied the rmses of gpp were reduced by 73 79 gc m2 month on average while gpp increased after lai assimilation in tgr tne bde and rbe gpp with data assimilation because lai was reduced in bne this result agrees with the results at a regional scale we found that the performance of et improved less than that of gpp which is mentioned in ling et al 2019b but this was not examined in detail fig 10 and table 5 the rmses of et were reduced in tgr tne and bde however rmses slightly increased in bne and rbe after assimilation in most locations the difference in errors of et with and without data assimilation was relatively small compared with that of gpp focusing on the partitioning of et including canopy transpiration canopy evaporation and ground evaporation we demonstrate below how et does not change significantly with lai assimilation in tgr and tne the lower lai caused a decrease in canopy transpiration and canopy evaporation whereas the ground evaporation increased in the da simulation such changes can be explained as follows due to the change in lai and thus leaf size photosynthesis may also fluctuate which could lead to changes in transpiration park et al 2020 in addition a decrease in lai leads to a decrease in the amount of canopy intercepted water which is positively related to canopy evaporation in contrast such a decrease in canopy transpiration and evaporation can increase not only soil moisture but also ground evaporation such an increase in ground evaporation can compensate for the increase in canopy transpiration and canopy evaporation in other words the impact of lai assimilation on et can be offset because of the opposite water flux trend which is particularly the case when the model does not consider the land atmosphere interaction while et did not change considerably throughout the lai assimilation the changes in et partitioning were considerable implying that the soil moisture anomalies could be affected on the other hand we found that et and its components in sites such as rbe did not change significantly in contrast to tgr and tne one can tell that because the lai was high and the average wind speed in rbe was relatively low less than 1 m s2 et partitioning was insensitive to lai previous studies showed that canopy transpiration or et did not significantly change above a certain lai value wang et al 2019 netzer et al 2009 humid conditions in rbe makes the water availability not a limiting factor for transpiration and thus the high canopy conductance which is proportional to lai would lead to high et and thus high lai however in rbe which is a radiation limited region nemani et al 2003 most of the solar radiation could be intercepted by vegetation with high lai and thus et was limited with available energy therefore we found that lai assimilation rarely influenced the total amount of et the data assimilation of lai tends to be more effective in lower lais than in higher lais in other words the lai is not a major controlling factor to et under high lai values furthermore davarzani et al 2014 showed that a decrease in wind speed caused a reduction in the equilibrium et under wind speed of 2 m s et may not change despite the changes in lai as low wind speed leads to equilibrium evaporation in addition the ground evaporation was significantly lower than canopy evaporation and transpiration in rbe because the high lai prevents light transmission and the amount of soil evaporation on the other hand in dry winter and cold summer regions such as bne with lower lai more solar radiation could reach the ground than in rbe therefore lai is the main controlling factor to the ratio of ground evaporation to total et in bne than in wet regions such as rbe 3 4 soil moisture in different ecosystems to quantify the impact of data assimilation on soil moisture we analyzed pasw which is defined by the vertical integral of soil moisture weighted by the plant root fraction at a depth of 0 1 m xu et al 2019 this indicator represents the potential quantity of the accessible soil moisture for plants to absorb from the root therefore it may be used as a drought index related to vegetation productivity kam et al 2014 changes in pasw after lai assimilation fig 11 were strongly related to lai changes fig 5 in tgr tne and bde the mean pasw increased by 0 013 m3 m3 and the variance decreased by 0 0002 m6 m6 on average after the assimilation table 6 the simulated lai in fr tended to be overestimated in these sites and hence transpiration decreased and pasw increased on average after lai assimilation additionally the kurtosis of pasw increased by 0 196 on average at these sites meaning that the distribution of pasw of da was also narrower than that of fr the lai assimilation caused the variation in lai to decrease in turn causing the variation in pasw to decrease as expected the change in pasw in bne was the opposite of this in the bne where the lai was originally underestimated the transpiration significantly increased after lai assimilation which caused a decrease in the average pasw and an increase in the variation of the pasw fig 12 shows the averages and differences in soil moisture between fr and da at 0 1 m soil depth demonstrating that different vegetation types have different characteristics related to accessible soil water in tgr and tne the soil moisture changes are concentrated within the upper soil layer in contrast the differences in bne and bde were evenly distributed across all layers the changes in soil moisture for each layer are closely related to the effective root for each pft fig 13 shows the root fraction which is not time varying and the simulated ensemble average of the annual effective root fraction of da as the effective root fraction in fr is similar to that in da we found that the distributions of the effective root fraction in bne and bde were quite different from those of the effective root fraction in tgr tne and rbe the root fractions of the five sites were intensively distributed from 0 1 to 0 3 m whereas the effective root fractions of tgr tne and rbe were nearly identical and evenly distributed from 0 1 to 1 m in bne and bde the soil moisture is known to be absorbed by each layer root eq 4 therefore the difference in soil moisture was remarkable where the effective root fraction was high however for the tropical site i e rbe the soil moisture and pasw were not affected as much as the other sites this may have been due to excessive precipitation during all seasons compared with that in other sites demonstrating that soil moisture in tropical climates has low sensitivity with respect to lai regardless of the root fraction 4 conclusions in this study we carried out two numerical simulations with the clm4 5 bgc over east asia with and without assimilating the lai with the eakf in the fr without the assimilation the lai was overestimated in the tropical and temporal regions and underestimated in the boreal needleleaf forest which in turn led to similar error patterns in gpp such model discrepancy was improved with assimilation as the gpp trend was strongly associated with the lai trend in addition the rmse of gpp was reduced by nearly half in summer after assimilation however et was not as affected as gpp for example the rmse of et was reduced by less than 10 in summer furthermore the analysis of five locations with different climate and pfts tgr tne bne bde and rbe showed that while the overall et was not greatly affected et components i e canopy evaporation canopy transpiration and ground evaporation were strongly affected by lai assimilation et components varied greatly due to lai assimilation which led to changes in the soil moisture soil moisture analysis showed that the overestimated lai amplified the variability of soil moisture and decreased the average soil moisture distributions of pasw in temperate and boreal tree sites where the lai was overestimated were narrower the mean pasw increased and the variation in pasw decreased with lai assimilation in addition the difference in soil moisture between fr and da depends on the distribution of the effective root fraction while the effective root fractions of temperate sites are highly distributed between 0 1 m and 0 3 m depth those of boreal sites are evenly distributed leading to a difference in soil moisture it is shown that et was less sensitive to leaf size than gpp in clm4 5 bgc as we designed the simulation with offline mode the changes in et did not feed back to the water cycle such as precipitation therefore lai data assimilation did not cause significant changes in et particularly in regions with high lais if the atmospheric model i e cam was coupled with clm the changes in et could affect the precipitation which has an impact on the feedback loop of the water cycle thus it is expected that the overall change in et may have been amplified in other words lai assimilation may have a greater impact on et in the coupled mode than in the standalone mode as in this study however it should be noted that more uncertainty is likely to occur with the coupled model when capturing the observed lai than with the offline lsm soil moisture is controlled by transpiration infiltration runoff and interaction with groundwater therefore the upper boundary conditions of the infiltration flux and transpiration are critical for predicting soil moisture in addition the extent to which they affect soil moisture in each layer is different albergel et al 2017 suggested that lai assimilation was more pronounced in soil layers that contain a higher fraction of root and soil moisture in the topsoil layer was more affected by surface soil moisture assimilation therefore further studies should be conducted with the assimilation of both observed lai and surface soil moisture to improve soil moisture predictability credit authorship contribution statement hocheol seo methodology software visualization investigation writing original draft yeonjoo kim conceptualization methodology

4861,the leaf area index lai is a key variable for representing vegetation state and it is closely related to simulating carbon and water exchanges between land and the overlying atmosphere in land surface and terrestrial ecosystem models model simulations are still limited in their representation of vegetation phenological processes and capturing the resulting lai seasonality therefore this study demonstrated how lai assimilation into the model improved carbon and water fluxes in different ecosystems over east asia we assimilated lai derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data for seven years 2004 2010 over east asia into the community land model version 4 5 with a biogeochemistry module clm4 5 bgc by employing the ensemble adjustment kalman filter method results showed that lai assimilation remarkably improved estimated gross primary production gpp in particular the root mean square error decreased from 97 12 to 48 63 gc m2 month across the region for june august additionally while evapotranspiration et was less sensitive to lai than gpp the et components of ground evaporation canopy evaporation and canopy transpiration significantly changed after assimilation the analysis of plant available soil water showed that lai assimilation has unique effects on soil moisture depending on the soil layer climate and ecosystems in general the improvement in ecological prediction skill by lai assimilation was particularly evident in temperate needleleaf forests where lai was overestimated most distinctly this study improves our understanding of the role of lai assimilation in eco hydrological processes in different ecosystems with clm4 5 bgc which allows for the improvement of model forecasting and more accurate simulation

phenological cycle dynamics determine the growing season length and represent key controls on the water energy and carbon fluxes in the terrestrial ecosystem gutierrez et al 1988 kafaki et al 2009 richardson et al 2012 carbon is exchanged between terrestrial ecosystems and the overlying atmosphere through photosynthesis and respiration processes absorbed through root hairs water then escapes from plant pores in the form of vapor on leaves by transpiration therefore changes in the leaf area index lai can lead to changes in evapotranspiration et which controls the soil moisture content additionally vegetation growth with taller canopy height and more abundant leaves becomes possible when sufficient soil moisture is available wang and qu 2009 liu et al 2016 suggested that the relationship between soil moisture and lai may vary according to different types of soil thus the lai plays a significant role in predicting the hydrologic and carbon cycles of ecosystem models many studies using land surface models lsms have addressed vegetation phenology modeling at both the global and regional scales duarte et al 2017 hudiburg et al 2013 kim and wang 2005 kim et al 2015 lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2013 seo and kim 2019 zeng et al 2008 while most studies have attempted to reduce discrepancies between the modeled lai and observed lai through parameter adjustment or physical or chemical equation modifications studies on capturing the observed lai are still limited such discrepancies result in the misinterpretation of terrestrial carbon water and energy exchanges such as gross primary production gpp net ecosystem exchange nee et net primary production and crop yield he et al 2017 duarte et al 2017 compared the results of the community land model clm version 4 5 clm4 5 to observations based on the wind river ameriflux site in the state of washington usa they found that the default parameters of specific leaf area and stomatal conductance contributed to overestimated et and underestimated gpp after calibrating the parameters they improved the clm simulations of evaporation respiration and gpp which reasonably agreed with the flux tower data zhang et al 2016 conducted clm4 5 with carbon and nitrogen components clm4 5 cn in china flux tower sites they found that excessive fire burning which was based on the clm4 5 fire module caused an unreasonably low lai at the changbaishan forest site resulting in underestimated vegetation carbon and nee the uncertainty of model prediction can be addressed by integrating models with observational data with different sources of climate data and models data assimilation processes have been developed to improve the model forecast by initializing lsm variables and constraining the physical parameterization for example he et al 2017 adopted lai assimilation in wheat models and assessed the improvement of wheat yield estimation niu et al 2014 applied data assimilation in various fields such as emerging infectious disease fisheries fire and the terrestrial carbon cycle to demonstrate how data assimilation can influence ecological predictions recently kumar et al 2019 assimilated remotely sensed lai into the noah mp lsm over the continental united states suggesting that the lai assimilation has beneficial effects on the simulation of water fluxes such as soil moisture snow depth terrestrial water storage and carbon fluxes such as gpp and nee in particular the most prominent improvements were shown over the agricultural areas where assimilation improved the vegetation seasonality impacted by cropping schedules viskari et al 2015 assimilated tower measured lai and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived lai into the ecosystem demography model version 2 and found that a higher frequency of tower measured lai than that of modis lai caused the tower measured lai to have a greater impact on the state variable they found that lai assimilation could improve the prediction of the evolution of plant leaf phenology in particular data assimilation contributed to reproducing the season start date which mostly corresponded to bud bursts in spring ling et al 2019a compared the performances of clm version 4 with carbon and nitrogen cycles clm4 cn with four sequential assimilation algorithms the kernel filter particle filter ensemble kalman filter enkf and ensemble adjust kalman filter eakf they concluded that the eafk algorithm was the best choice for assimilating lai and demonstrates robust performance in clm4 cn in addition ling et al 2019b showed that lai assimilation reduced the bias in estimating lai in clm4 cn and improved the global gpp and et estimation especially in the low latitude where the lai was overestimated systematically however few studies provide a detailed explanation of how lai assimilation affects et components and how it affects soil moisture in this study we aimed to demonstrate how the data assimilation of lai in clm version 4 5 with the biogeochemistry module clm4 5 bgc played a role in eco hydrological processes and thus in predicting carbon and water flux in different ecosystems at both local and regional levels in east asia we utilized the clm4 5 bgc with and without assimilating the modis derived lai data and used the eakf method based on the monte carlo method which is widely accepted in the field because of its demonstrated optimal performance and simplicity we evaluated the performance of lai assimilation and examined gpp et and et components including canopy transpiration canopy evaporation and ground evaporation according to dominant plant functional types pfts to quantify the lai assimilation on the soil moisture we compared plant accessible soil water pasw and the fraction of effective roots along the soil layers 2 methods and data 2 1 community land model the clm version 4 5 is a land model of the national center for atmospheric research community earth system model it simulates water energy and carbon nitrogen exchange between the terrestrial land and atmosphere of each computational grid each grid cell is composed of multiple land units such as lakes urban areas glaciers cropland and vegetated land the last of which has a number of columns in each column a variety of pfts e g needleleaf evergreen tree broadleaf evergreen tree deciduous tree shrub grass crop and bare ground represent the characteristics of vegetation heterogeneity furthermore pfts that comprise one column have their own vegetation characteristics e g lai stem area index and canopy height each cycle is simulated at different sub grid levels e g land unit column and pft for example the lai and carbon cycle are simulated at the pft level in contrast soil water and energy are defined in the columns in a default clm with a satellite phenology module the daily vegetation characteristics i e lai and vegetation phenology are represented by linearly interpolating the monthly values from satellite data on the other hand when the bgc module which is used in this study is active i e clm4 5 bgc the vegetation characteristics and phenological variation of lai can be predicted under the given atmospheric forcing and thus the carbon and nitrogen fluxes can be predicted in clm4 5 bgc carbon is accumulated from the photosynthesis process and is quantified as gpp which is allocated for a variety of processes including the support of maintenance respiration for live tissue the replenishment of the internal carbon pool and the growth new plant tissue therefore gpp is positively associated with leaf size the carbon content in the leaf cs leaf gc m 2 is directly linked to the computed lai the lai m2 m 2 of each vegetation was predicted using the following equation 1 lai sla 0 exp m cs leaf 1 m where sla 0 is the specific leaf area at the canopy top m2 g 1c and m is the linear slope coefficient which are both dependent upon pfts thornton and zimmermann 2007 notably the processes of photosynthesis respiration allocation and fire burning are not only affected by lai but are also the determining factors for representing lai in the model furthermore the lai is directly associated with the water and energy fluxes i e et and latent heat flux respectively as well as carbon fluxes i e photosynthesis on the land surface in clm4 5 et the sum of canopy evaporation canopy transpiration and ground evaporation is estimated using the resistance model for the leaf stomata resistance the ball berry conductance model sellers et al 1996 is employed as follows 2 1 r s g s m a n c s p atm h s b β t where r s is the leaf stomata resistance s m2 μmol 1 g s is the leaf stomatal conductance μmol s 1 m 2 a n is net photosynthesis μmol co2 m

conductance μmol s 1 m 2 and β t is a function of soil water stress then the leaf stomata conductance is multiplied by lai to estimate the canopy conductance which leads lai directly influencing canopy transpiration and thus et note that et and latent heat flux cannot exceed the available water and the net radiation for the belowground process the clm includes multiple soil layers where vertical soil moisture flux is estimated by infiltration runoff gradient diffusion and canopy transpiration by root zeng and decker 2009 the soil water was simulated based on the mass conservation equation and richard s equation these equations have been adapted to solve numerically by dividing the soil column into multiple layers the volumetric soil water in each layer is based on the following numerical equation 3 δ z i θ liq i t q out i q in i e i where θ liq i is the volumetric soil water m3 m 3 in the i th layer at time t δ z i is the i th layer thickness mm q in i is the influx of water across the interface of the i th layer q out i is the outflux of water across the interface of the i th layer mm s 1 and e i is the i th layer averaged soil moisture sink term mm s 1 e i is the water flux in the soil by transpiration mm s 1 and is calculated as in eq 4 4 e i r e i c t where r e i is the effective root fraction based on pfts in the i th layer and ct is the canopy transpiration mm s 1 the details of clm4 5 bgc are presented in oleson et al 2013 while the above equations explain several details of predicting lai and soil moisture in the model which are closely related to this study 2 2 ensemble adjustment kalman filter the eakf method anderson 2001 anderson and anderson 1999 is often referred to as the deterministic scheme of enkf without considering the adjoints or backward integration zubrow et al 2008 while the traditional enkf uses the perturbed observation the eakf prevents the perturbed observation from being used instead the background error covariance is used to represent the probability density function pdf of the observation in addition it is effective and outperforms the traditional enkf in some cases ling et al 2019a shen et al 2016 in particular ling et al 2019a demonstrated that eakf showed better performance for lai data assimilation than other algorithms such as kernel filter particle filter and enkf with clm4 cn the prior distribution is assumed to be gaussian with the sample mean x f and variance p f of the forecast ensemble state vector and the pdf of the observation error is also assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and covariance r shen et al 2016 the updated covariance p a and the state vector mean x a of the analysis state vector was calculated using bayes theorem and the formula for the convolution of two gaussians is given as follows 5 p a p f 1 h t r 1 h 1 6 x a p a p f 1 x f h t r 1 y where the superscripts f and a represent the forecast and updated ensemble member respectively h is the linear function for simplicity that is y h x and h t is the transpose of h then the posterior i e updated estimate can be expressed as 7 x a a t x f x f x a where a is also the linear operator that is used to update the prior ensemble member anderson 2001 for details on the eakf algorithm refer to anderson 2001 and shen et al 2016 2 3 modis products modis data provide land characteristics data including terra surface reflectance land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi they have been used to improve our understanding of global dynamics and processes on land and contribute to validating eco hydrological models or adjusting parameters in the model hall et al 1995 wang and pinker 2009 in this study the modis derived products of 8 day global terrestrial lai mcd15a2 gpp mod17a2 and et mod16a2 from 2004 to 2010 were used the modis lai algorithm is based on modis red and near red surface reflectance information and the empirical relationship between ndvi and lai knyazikhin et al 1998 vegetation type sun sensor geometry and theoretical estimates of uncertainties by spectral bands in this study we upscaled the original data of lai 1 km resolution gpp 1 km resolution and et 500 m resolution to 0 5 data to overcome quality issues such as the sun being blocked by clouds zhang et al 2014 these upscaled lai data were used for data assimilation and the gpp and et data were used to evaluate the model performance 2 4 global land surface satellite glass lai in addition to modis lai this study used the glass lai product xiao et al 2014 to evaluate the performance of data assimilation the glass lai was generated at a global scale using the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and modis surface reflectance data the general regression neural networks were trained using the fused time series lai for different ecosystems according to xiao et al 2016 the glass lai represented more effective temporal smoothness than did the first version of the geoland2 geov1 and modis lai products while the global consistency of all these products was generally good the spatial and temporal resolution of the original glass lai products is 0 05 and 8 days respectively we upscaled the original data to 0 5 data to match the spatial resolution of this study 2 5 study area this study focused on east asia between 64 e 174 e and 0 65 n with a spatial resolution of 0 5 longitude 0 5 latitude fig 1 this area includes widely distributed high altitude mountain ranges as well as coastal areas moreover several different climate types are observed in this area including boreal temperate and tropical regions over the study area the seasonal mean temperatures from the cru ncep reanalysis data 2004 2010 were 13 28 21 41 14 42 and 4 28 c in spring march april may summer june july august fall september october november and winter december january february respectively the means of seasonal precipitation from cru ncep reanalysis data 2004 2010 were 76 97 139 89 118 55 and 76 13 mm month in spring summer fall and winter respectively this region includes bare grounds of 20 6 of the area and different pfts of needleleaf evergreen broadleaf evergreen deciduous shrub grass and crop which occupy 15 8 4 9 16 1 11 3 18 6 and 12 5 of the area respectively and are based on the modis land cover datasets lawrence and chase 2007 grassland cropland and needleleaf forests account for most of eastern china and india at high latitudes three types of vegetation are dominant needleleaf evergreen grass and deciduous moreover broadleaf evergreen forests are dominant in tropical regions furthermore we examined water and carbon fluxes in detail by selecting the five sites based on the grid data within our regional simulations fig 1 and table 1 five sites were chosen for different pfts within different climates temperate grassland tgr temperate needleleaf evergreen forest tne boreal needleleaf evergreen forest bne boreal deciduous forest bde and tropical broadleaf evergreen forest rbe while the winter air condition is dry in tgr bne and bde the bne winter climate is relatively wet based on the koppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 the bne site which is located at the highest latitudes among the studied sites has a cold summer climate unlike the other sites 2 6 experimental design in this study the eakf method was employed to reduce the model error with observed lai as eakf was shown to perform effectively ling et al 2019a shen et al 2016 the offline simulations with clm4 5 bgc were run with 40 ensemble meteorological forcings with 6 h time intervals which were generated with the atmospheric model community atmospheric model cam developed by raeder et al 2012 to represent model uncertainties and preserve the model covariance evensen 1994 previous studies ling et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2014 utilized these 40 ensemble forcings for data assimilation studies by considering both computational cost and assimilation performance the model was integrated from 2004 to 2010 as remotely sensed observations and ensemble meteorological data were available for the period as shown in fig 2 experiments of free run fr and data assimilation da were performed with a spatial resolution of 0 5 longitude 0 5 latitude with the 40 ensemble meteorological forcings before conducting these experiments the spin up simulation was run for 200 years cycling 20 year long cru ncep reanalysis forcings from 1981 to 2000 for the initialization of land states in da after the 40 ensemble simulations were performed for 8 days the simulated results of lai were saved and the data were combined with modis lai using the eakf assimilation process these revised lai data were updated and then the simulations were performed for the next 8 days this process was repeated from the integration period 2004 to 2010 it is also noted that the carbon and nitrogen contents of the vegetation were updated accordingly eq 1 when the revised lai data were updated the ensemble averages of the clm4 5 bgc simulations with and without data assimilation were compared to demonstrate the improved model performance with data assimilation in simulated gpp and et to evaluate the model performance comparisons between simulations and modis derived gpp and et products were carried out by assessing the root mean square error rmse of monthly average values furthermore we analyzed the pasw and soil moisture at a depth of up to 1 m of soil to investigate the impact of lai assimilation on soil moisture 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation with lai to evaluate the model performance we compared the lai of fr and da with the modis lai fig 3 while most of the modis lai did not exceed 5 m2 m2 in summer fr showed that most of the lai was higher than that of modis in our study the lai in fr was overestimated in the tropical region and eastern china on the contrary the lai was underestimated in the boreal region where the needleleaf evergreen tree was dominant moreover the clm has more discrepancy with the observations in summer than in other seasons such limits in clm are consistent with the results of previous studies ling et al 2019a 2019b in that by comparing the simulated lai of clm4 cn and version 2 of the copernicus 1 km fapar product they found that the lai was systematically overestimated worldwide especially at low latitudes and in eastern china upon further investigation of seasonal changes the discrepancy between lai with and without data assimilation was remarkable during the growing seasons e g july in the northern hemisphere the performance of da was also evaluated using the glass lai in the growing season june august fig 4 while lai of fr was highly overestimated in the temporal region such as eastern china and tropical regions the lai was underestimated in boreal needleleaf evergreen forests while this result was consistent with the comparison with modis products fig 3 the lai in the da run was slightly lower than the glass lai overall this may be attributed to the fact that modis lai profiles exhibit more fluctuation than the glass lai and therefore the mean of glass lai is slightly higher than that of modis in general xiao et al 2014 nevertheless the rmse between the simulated lai to glass lai was 1 8 m2 m2 in da which was significantly reduced in comparison to that in fr 3 1 m2 m2 indicating the improved performance with da using modis lai focusing on the five locations with different dominant climate and pft types fig 1 we found that the correlation and the monthly rmse values between the simulated lai and modis lai were improved in all locations fig 5 and table 2 in addition the discrepancies between the modeled and glass lais were reduced after the assimilation at five sites and this result agreed with the regional results in particular the correlation 0 07 in fr and 0 52 in da in rbe was highly improved in the tropics where rbe exists high temperatures and precipitation in all seasons allowed active vegetation even in winter in fr however the seasonal variability of lai was present in modis lai although it was not as intense as that in other temperate and boreal locations while this may be attributed to the limit of the model in simulating net carbon assimilation seasonality and its allocation to leaves it is also noteworthy that glass lai shows a lower seasonality than modis lai the rmse improved mostly in tne 4 06 m2 m2 in fr and 0 75 m2 m2 in da where the overestimation of lai was most marked in this location vegetation growth and its seasonality were overestimated in another evergreen location i e bne lai showed underestimated seasonal variation compared with both modis and glass lais considering the opposite behavior in tne and bne which have hot and cold summers respectively one can suggest that the model sensitivity of net carbon assimilation to the temperature in the needleleaf evergreen forests could be improved such limitations were overcome in this study by data assimilation 3 2 regional gpp and et to understand the impact of lai assimilation we compared the seasonal spatial distribution of gpp and et in the fr da and modis data figs 6 7 and 8 tables 3 and 4 as expected simulated gpp in da outperformed that in fr showing some discrepancy in comparison to that in modis overall gpp was most improved in summer with monthly rmses compared with modis at 97 12 and 48 63 gc m2 month in fr and da respectively table 3 in fig 6 the rmse of monthly gpp in eastern china and the indochina peninsula within the temperate or sub tropical zone showed a relatively high value 200 gc m2 month in fr after the observed lai was assimilated the rmse of gpp decreased to approximately 100 gc m2 month in da lai data assimilation could help improve the prediction of gpp interacting with modeled lai which had a large discrepancy with observation we also note that the spatial variations of the rmses follow the discrepancy of lai in fig 3 the relative difference of gpp between fr and modis fig 7a showed that gpp was overestimated in the tropical and temporal regions and underestimated in the boreal region which is similar to the error pattern of lai the relative difference of gpp between da and modis fig 7b showed that gpp decreased in most of the study area after assimilating modis lai however gpp increased in the boreal region which is consistent with previous studies demarty et al 2007 ramos et al 2018 demarty et al 2007 applied lai assimilation to the orchidee dynamic global vegetation model globally they found that gpp could increase with assimilation in boreal regions where the modis lai is generally higher than that of simulations without data assimilation in ecosystem models gpp has a strong correlation with lai he et al 2013 suggested that the values of modis gpp were lower than those of gpp from flux tower datasets in temperate sites such as qianyanzhou forest site qyz and dinghushan forest site dhs which are within our study area on the other hand zhang et al 2016 showed that the modeled gpp in clm4 5 cn was overestimated in qyz and dhs as our simulated gpp of da existed between the gpp of fr and modis fig 7 lai assimilation was effective in reducing the uncertainties of the model results especially in temperate regions where the discrepancy between modeled gpp and modis gpp was markedly noticeable simulated et unlike gpp was not significantly affected by the assimilation of lai as shown in table 4 the rmses of monthly et in fr and da were not significantly different fig 8 while the rmse of gpp reduced by approximately 50 with lai assimilation in summer that of et was reduced by less than 10 which will be further examined in the following section furthermore it is noticeable that the spatial patterns of the rmses in et fig 8 are distinct from those in gpp fig 6 this might be attributed to the fact that the magnitude of et was not greatly influenced by lai rather than the climatic conditions while lai is directly related to gpp et i e the sum of canopy evaporation canopy transpiration and ground evaporation is in part related to lai via canopy evaporation and transpiration in addition a discrepancy between the ensemble atmospheric forcings used in this study and the atmospheric conditions used for modis et should be noted the modis et product is based on the penman monteith equation with a reanalysis of meteorological data driven by the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications and remote sensing data albedo land cover lai and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation over most agricultural regions such as india indochina peninsula and northeastern china both gpp and et were generally overestimated in fr and da and rarely improved via data assimilation figs 1 and 7 this is consistent with the findings of jiang and ryu 2016 demonstrating that the values of modis gpp and et were lower than flux tower observations and significantly underestimated in cropland and shrubland additionally jang et al 2013 showed that modis has large biases in croplands over east asia 3 3 gpp et and et partition in different ecosystems we focused on the five locations with different vegetation types as mentioned in section 2 4 fig 9 gpp estimations were greatly improved in all five locations the seasonal variability of gpp in fr was reasonably simulated but the maximum gpp was limitedly captured the discrepancy of the gpp between the model and modis was reduced after the data assimilation process was applied the rmses of gpp were reduced by 73 79 gc m2 month on average while gpp increased after lai assimilation in tgr tne bde and rbe gpp with data assimilation because lai was reduced in bne this result agrees with the results at a regional scale we found that the performance of et improved less than that of gpp which is mentioned in ling et al 2019b but this was not examined in detail fig 10 and table 5 the rmses of et were reduced in tgr tne and bde however rmses slightly increased in bne and rbe after assimilation in most locations the difference in errors of et with and without data assimilation was relatively small compared with that of gpp focusing on the partitioning of et including canopy transpiration canopy evaporation and ground evaporation we demonstrate below how et does not change significantly with lai assimilation in tgr and tne the lower lai caused a decrease in canopy transpiration and canopy evaporation whereas the ground evaporation increased in the da simulation such changes can be explained as follows due to the change in lai and thus leaf size photosynthesis may also fluctuate which could lead to changes in transpiration park et al 2020 in addition a decrease in lai leads to a decrease in the amount of canopy intercepted water which is positively related to canopy evaporation in contrast such a decrease in canopy transpiration and evaporation can increase not only soil moisture but also ground evaporation such an increase in ground evaporation can compensate for the increase in canopy transpiration and canopy evaporation in other words the impact of lai assimilation on et can be offset because of the opposite water flux trend which is particularly the case when the model does not consider the land atmosphere interaction while et did not change considerably throughout the lai assimilation the changes in et partitioning were considerable implying that the soil moisture anomalies could be affected on the other hand we found that et and its components in sites such as rbe did not change significantly in contrast to tgr and tne one can tell that because the lai was high and the average wind speed in rbe was relatively low less than 1 m s2 et partitioning was insensitive to lai previous studies showed that canopy transpiration or et did not significantly change above a certain lai value wang et al 2019 netzer et al 2009 humid conditions in rbe makes the water availability not a limiting factor for transpiration and thus the high canopy conductance which is proportional to lai would lead to high et and thus high lai however in rbe which is a radiation limited region nemani et al 2003 most of the solar radiation could be intercepted by vegetation with high lai and thus et was limited with available energy therefore we found that lai assimilation rarely influenced the total amount of et the data assimilation of lai tends to be more effective in lower lais than in higher lais in other words the lai is not a major controlling factor to et under high lai values furthermore davarzani et al 2014 showed that a decrease in wind speed caused a reduction in the equilibrium et under wind speed of 2 m s et may not change despite the changes in lai as low wind speed leads to equilibrium evaporation in addition the ground evaporation was significantly lower than canopy evaporation and transpiration in rbe because the high lai prevents light transmission and the amount of soil evaporation on the other hand in dry winter and cold summer regions such as bne with lower lai more solar radiation could reach the ground than in rbe therefore lai is the main controlling factor to the ratio of ground evaporation to total et in bne than in wet regions such as rbe 3 4 soil moisture in different ecosystems to quantify the impact of data assimilation on soil moisture we analyzed pasw which is defined by the vertical integral of soil moisture weighted by the plant root fraction at a depth of 0 1 m xu et al 2019 this indicator represents the potential quantity of the accessible soil moisture for plants to absorb from the root therefore it may be used as a drought index related to vegetation productivity kam et al 2014 changes in pasw after lai assimilation fig 11 were strongly related to lai changes fig 5 in tgr tne and bde the mean pasw increased by 0 013 m3 m3 and the variance decreased by 0 0002 m6 m6 on average after the assimilation table 6 the simulated lai in fr tended to be overestimated in these sites and hence transpiration decreased and pasw increased on average after lai assimilation additionally the kurtosis of pasw increased by 0 196 on average at these sites meaning that the distribution of pasw of da was also narrower than that of fr the lai assimilation caused the variation in lai to decrease in turn causing the variation in pasw to decrease as expected the change in pasw in bne was the opposite of this in the bne where the lai was originally underestimated the transpiration significantly increased after lai assimilation which caused a decrease in the average pasw and an increase in the variation of the pasw fig 12 shows the averages and differences in soil moisture between fr and da at 0 1 m soil depth demonstrating that different vegetation types have different characteristics related to accessible soil water in tgr and tne the soil moisture changes are concentrated within the upper soil layer in contrast the differences in bne and bde were evenly distributed across all layers the changes in soil moisture for each layer are closely related to the effective root for each pft fig 13 shows the root fraction which is not time varying and the simulated ensemble average of the annual effective root fraction of da as the effective root fraction in fr is similar to that in da we found that the distributions of the effective root fraction in bne and bde were quite different from those of the effective root fraction in tgr tne and rbe the root fractions of the five sites were intensively distributed from 0 1 to 0 3 m whereas the effective root fractions of tgr tne and rbe were nearly identical and evenly distributed from 0 1 to 1 m in bne and bde the soil moisture is known to be absorbed by each layer root eq 4 therefore the difference in soil moisture was remarkable where the effective root fraction was high however for the tropical site i e rbe the soil moisture and pasw were not affected as much as the other sites this may have been due to excessive precipitation during all seasons compared with that in other sites demonstrating that soil moisture in tropical climates has low sensitivity with respect to lai regardless of the root fraction 4 conclusions in this study we carried out two numerical simulations with the clm4 5 bgc over east asia with and without assimilating the lai with the eakf in the fr without the assimilation the lai was overestimated in the tropical and temporal regions and underestimated in the boreal needleleaf forest which in turn led to similar error patterns in gpp such model discrepancy was improved with assimilation as the gpp trend was strongly associated with the lai trend in addition the rmse of gpp was reduced by nearly half in summer after assimilation however et was not as affected as gpp for example the rmse of et was reduced by less than 10 in summer furthermore the analysis of five locations with different climate and pfts tgr tne bne bde and rbe showed that while the overall et was not greatly affected et components i e canopy evaporation canopy transpiration and ground evaporation were strongly affected by lai assimilation et components varied greatly due to lai assimilation which led to changes in the soil moisture soil moisture analysis showed that the overestimated lai amplified the variability of soil moisture and decreased the average soil moisture distributions of pasw in temperate and boreal tree sites where the lai was overestimated were narrower the mean pasw increased and the variation in pasw decreased with lai assimilation in addition the difference in soil moisture between fr and da depends on the distribution of the effective root fraction while the effective root fractions of temperate sites are highly distributed between 0 1 m and 0 3 m depth those of boreal sites are evenly distributed leading to a difference in soil moisture it is shown that et was less sensitive to leaf size than gpp in clm4 5 bgc as we designed the simulation with offline mode the changes in et did not feed back to the water cycle such as precipitation therefore lai data assimilation did not cause significant changes in et particularly in regions with high lais if the atmospheric model i e cam was coupled with clm the changes in et could affect the precipitation which has an impact on the feedback loop of the water cycle thus it is expected that the overall change in et may have been amplified in other words lai assimilation may have a greater impact on et in the coupled mode than in the standalone mode as in this study however it should be noted that more uncertainty is likely to occur with the coupled model when capturing the observed lai than with the offline lsm soil moisture is controlled by transpiration infiltration runoff and interaction with groundwater therefore the upper boundary conditions of the infiltration flux and transpiration are critical for predicting soil moisture in addition the extent to which they affect soil moisture in each layer is different albergel et al 2017 suggested that lai assimilation was more pronounced in soil layers that contain a higher fraction of root and soil moisture in the topsoil layer was more affected by surface soil moisture assimilation therefore further studies should be conducted with the assimilation of both observed lai and surface soil moisture to improve soil moisture predictability credit authorship contribution statement hocheol seo methodology software visualization investigation writing original draft yeonjoo kim conceptualization methodology

4862,groundwater contaminant source identification is normally a prerequisite for contaminant remediation this study proposes a new two stage surrogate assisted markov chain monte carlo mcmc based bayesian framework to identify contaminant source parameters for groundwater polluted by dense nonaqueous phase liquid in the framework an adaptive update feedback process is proposed to construct a locally accurate surrogate model over posterior distributions to replace the time consuming multiphase flow model to increase the efficiency of the mcmc simulation a multiobjective feasibility enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm mofepso is adopted to generate the initial guess of the contamination source parameters the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework are confirmed via a synthetic study the contaminant source parameters generated by the proposed approach are compared with those computed by the one stage surrogate assisted mcmc based bayesian approach the results demonstrate that the root mean squared error rmse between true value of parameters and maximum a posteriori density values map obtained by the proposed method decreased by 71 3 compared with those obtained by one stage surrogate based framework to further assess the efficiency of mofepso the same inversion problem is solved with random values as the initial guesses of the unknown parameters during mcmc simulation the other conditions are the same as the proposed framework the results indicate that adopting mofepso improves the efficiency of mcmc simulation therefore the proposed approach can accurately and effectively identify the contaminant source parameters with achieving about 148 times of speed up compared to the simulation based mcmc simulation keywords groundwater contamination sources inversion bayesian two stage surrogate model multiobjective optimization 1 introduction dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl contaminated groundwater is among the most urgent water pollution problems worldwide kueper and mcwhorter 1991 ji et al 2003 jiang and na 2020 after entering an aquifer dnapls can displace groundwater and continue to infiltrate and accumulate toward the water resistant floor and they may become a long term continuous contamination source slough et al 1999 ouyang et al 2017a groundwater pollution source information is an important prerequisite for designing in situ or ectopic remediation schemes for groundwater dnapl contaminated sites datta et al 2009 west and kueper 2012 kang et al 2018 li et al 2020 however groundwater contamination exhibits characteristics of concealment and hysteresis making it difficult to directly obtain contamination source parameters such as the release history intensity and location sun et al 2006 yan et al 2019 therefore effectively identifying contamination source parameters for dnapl contaminated site remediation is particularly significant as it can help project personnel propose more targeted remediation strategies to improve the remediation efficiency and reduce remediation costs identifying parameters of contaminant sources demands an inversion problem to be solved traditional optimization based inversion approaches e g least squares regression and linear programing nonlinear optimization with the embedding technique and heuristic global search methods have been employed in groundwater contamination source identification gorelick et al 1983 mahar and datta 1997 2001 mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 zhang et al 2015 however the inverse problems are always regarded as ill posed in that the solution may exhibit nonexistence or nonuniqueness zhang et al 2015 moreover the uncertainty in inverse results cannot be completely characterized by optimization based approaches ma and zabaras 2009 zhang et al 2015 as alternative methods bayesian inversion approaches have the capacity to address such uncertainty zhang et al 2015 yan et al 2019 in the bayesian method the unknown parameters are regarded as random variables whose posterior distributions can be appraised with markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation haario et al 2006 thus this approach has become increasingly universal for representing uncertainties in hydrologic models vrugt et al 2008 smith and marshall 2008 yustres et al 2012 zeng et al 2012 laloy et al 2013 wang and jin 2013 zhang et al 2015 yan et al 2019 in bayesian parameter estimation based on mcmc simulation simulation models must be repetitively computed to assess the likelihood for cpu demanding flow and contaminant transport problems the computational cost may be prohibitive zhang et al 2015 to overcome this disadvantage employing a surrogate model to replace the original computation intensive simulation model is one promising approach zeng et al 2018 yan et al 2019 for example zeng et al 2012 employed a surrogate to reduce the computational burden of mcmc to accelerate contamination source parameter identification zhang et al 2015 used a genetic algorithm to generate the initial value of the parameters to be identified with the surrogate model to enhance the efficiency of mcmc in the process of contaminant source parameter identification the current methods for establishing surrogate models are based mostly on prior distribution and the surrogate model accuracy in the posterior region may not be high siade et al 2020 thus the results of surrogate assisted mcmc algorithms may deviate from the true characteristics of the groundwater contamination sources due to the prediction error of the surrogate leading to the meaningless of the inverse results a sufficiently accurate surrogate must be constructed to eliminate surrogate introduced bias zhao et al 2020 or the original model can be used to correct the surrogate model in a two stage manner zeng et al 2012 laloy et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 because of the high computational cost a globally precise substitution for a high dimensional original model is difficult to construct except when the model nonlinearity is sufficiently low to allow for linear approximation li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 moreover additional original model calculations are needed and still entail a high computational cost for the two stage approach zhang et al 2016 however as the posterior distribution usually accounts for only a small proportion of the prior distribution it is computationally feasible to establish a locally precise surrogate over the posterior distribution zhang et al 2016 li and marzouk 2014 attempted to obtain a distribution close to the posterior distribution by minimizing cross entropy and constructed a locally precise surrogate model over this distribution zhang et al 2016 formulated an efficient method in which surrogate models are adaptively established over the posterior distribution of the model parameters by integrating a gaussian process surrogate and mcmc method these studies have demonstrated the great potential of constructing a locally precise surrogate model over the posterior distribution for mcmc based bayesian inferences however knowledge gaps still exist regarding to this aspect locally accurate surrogate models constructed by adaptively increasing base points close to the posterior have attracted considerable attention in recent years but as the number of samples increases the computational burden also increases therefore a strategy is needed in which the adaptive sampling method is developed to enhance the surrogate model accuracy without increasing the calculation burden at the meanwhile in addition the selection of the initial point has a significant influence on the efficiency of mcmc simulation optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm have been employed to obtain the initial value of the unknown parameters by solving a single objective optimization model zhang et al 2015 when choosing the optimal initial point multiple considerations are often expected however a multiobjective optimization model with an effective algorithm has not been adopted to determine the initial value in mcmc simulation to fill above knowledge gaps the purpose of the present study is to propose and verify a novel locally accurate two stage surrogate based bayesian framework that couples surrogate construction multiobjective optimization mcmc simulation and an adaptive update feedback process to effectively identify groundwater contaminant source parameters in addition theoretical implications for contamination source inversion are enriched and developed specifically the main contributions of the present study are as follows 1 propose an adaptive update feedback process to construct locally accurate surrogates by adding pareto optimal solutions and posterior samples while eliminating some old samples in the adaptive update feedback process the total number of training base points is unchanged and no additional computational burden is imposed for surrogate model construction 2 adopt a multiobjective feasibility enhanced particle swarm optimization mofepso algorithm to locate a sweet spot for the time consuming mcmc search as an initial value of the contamination source parameters by solving a multiobjective optimization model this method has the potential to enhance the efficiency of mcmc simulation to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have investigated a locally accurate two stage surrogate construction based on an adaptive update feedback process and the mofepso algorithm to assist the mcmc simulation in

the reaction rates for component k in phase l and solid phase s respectively a three dimensional multiphase and multicomponent finite difference code university of texas chemical flooding simulator utchem which addresses physical chemical and biological transformations and accounts for dnapl solubilization and mobilization delshad et al 1996 is used to solve the mathematical model 2 2 bayesian experimental design according to bayes theorem the posterior distribution can be calculated as 3 p m d p m p d m p d m p m d m where d represents the result caused by the occurrence of an event m represents one of the reasons for the outcome of the event p m represents the probability of the occurrence of m without considering other factors which is called the prior probability term of m p d m represents the conditional probability term p m d represents the posterior probability term of m and the denominator on the right side of the equation represents the probability of d occurring after all causes are considered which is also called the normalizing constant sadegh and vrugt 2014 the mathematical function of the bayesian formula is to identify the posterior probability of m that is to say given that the result d occurs what is the probability that can be used to infer this result in this study the prior distribution p m denotes the modeler s knowledge about parameters before any measurements are considered p m d denotes the posterior distribution of the contamination source parameters p d m is the likelihood which evaluates the goodness of fit between the measurements and model outputs m represents source parameters and d represents concentration measurements considering that it is difficult to derive an explicit likelihood function for a non linear and complex multiphase flow model the approximate bayesian computation abc sadegh and vrugt 2014 cui et al 2018 is introduced as it relaxes the need to compute an explicit likelihood function by using a summary statistic vrugt and sadegh 2013 cui et al 2018 the abc likelihood function is expressed as 4 l x y min j 1 m j ρ s j y s j y x where ρ s j y s j y x is the abc distance function for more details please refer to sadegh and vrugt 2014 for a nonlinear model the analytical form of the posterior distribution is difficult to obtain a universal method is to employ the mcmc algorithm to obtain realizations from the posterior distribution these realizations are then analyzed to obtain the posterior statistical characteristics in this paper we propose a two stage surrogate assisted mcmc based bayesian approach to identify contamination source parameters the detailed formulation of the mcmc method is not presented here since that is not our focus for more details please refer to haario et al 2006 2 3 kriging method for constructing surrogate models many algorithms have been employed to construct surrogate models such as polynomial regression pr kriging support vector regression svr radial basis function artificial neural network rbfann and kernel extreme learning machines kelm ouyang et al 2017b the kriging method is mathematically very close to a gaussian process and is not only well suited to fitting nonlinear problems but also has good stability and fast convergence chen et al 2014 yan et al 2019 jiang and na 2020 previous studies have concluded that the approximation accuracy of the kriging model is higher than those of the rbfann pr and svr models for building surrogate models of the multiphase flow simulation model luo and lu 2014 hou et al 2015 we also performed tests using rbfann kriging svr and kelm to construct surrogate models and our results show that the kriging and kelm models have higher accuracy than the svr and rbfann models jiang et al 2015 therefore inspired by previous studies and the advantages of the kriging method we choose the kriging model to construct the surrogate model in the proposed framework the kriging model is built by a polynomial regression model and a stochastic error 5 y x f x t β e x where f x f 1 x f 2 x f m x t represents the regression function vector β β 1 β 2 β m t represents the regression parameter vector and e x is a stationary stochastic function with the following statistical characteristics 6 e e x 0 var e x δ 2 c ov e x i e x j δ 2 r x i x j where r represents the correlation function in the present study an isotropic gaussian function is employed for r which is calculated as 7 r x i x j e x p k 1 n θ k x i k x j k 2 where θk denotes the kth unknown correlation parameter in the present study the mofepso algorithm is employed to optimize θk for the base points x1 x2 xn t is the input variable matrix and y y1 y2 yn t is the corresponding output response the response of the

the mofepso algorithm is an enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm that utilizes nondominated repositories and feasible positions to direct feasible particle flight and treats the infeasible and feasible particles differently hasanoglu and dolen 2018 jiang and na 2020 fig 1 illustrates the computational procedure of the mofepso algorithm and the key steps are expressed as follows step 1 initialize the position matrix the velocity matrix global best positions and local best positions step 2 loop over the number of iterations 1 assess whether the current particle position is feasible the infeasible and feasible particles have different behaviors 2 assess whether the new particle position is feasible 3 repeat the loop until the maximum number of particles is identified 4 terminate the iterative process when the maximum number of iterations is satisfied more details about the algorithm can be found in hasanoglu and dolen 2018 2 5 proposed method a two stage surrogate assisted mcmc based bayesian approach is proposed in this paper to adaptively establish locally precise surrogates and efficiently identify groundwater contamination source parameters the proposed approach is illustrated in fig 2 and the key steps are as follows step 1 generate n base points over the prior distribution of unknown parameters using the latin hypercube sampling method the corresponding outputs are calculated using the original simulation model step 2 as only locally precise surrogate models of the original model are required and the computational burden of establishing a kriging surrogate model is proportional to the number of base points it is not necessary to adopt all base points generated in step 1 to reduce the surrogate model training time only a subset of base points whose concentration variation trends in the monitoring wells similar with the observations are selected to establish the kriging surrogate model in addition the base points whose concentration variations in the monitoring wells present different trends in comparation with the observations are eliminated the constructed surrogate models are employed to replace the original model in the optimization model and mcmc simulation process to significantly reduce the computational burden step 3 a multiobjective optimization model is constructed considering two objective functions 1 minimizing the sum of the absolute error of solutions and observations and 2 minimizing the maximum value of the absolute error of solutions and observations the mofepso algorithm is employed to solve this optimization model step 4 to improve the efficiency of the mcmc simulation the solution with the minimum objective function 2 obtained by the mofepso algorithm is set as the initial guess of unknown parameters during the mcmc simulation and the parameter samples are drawn from the posterior distributions of the source parameters by performing the surrogate based mcmc simulation step 5 to build a locally accurate surrogate model in the posterior distribution we design an adaptive update feedback process to update base points and reconstruct the surrogate for one running time of the adaptive feedback process a new set of base points is inserted into the pool of candidate base points half of the new base points are selected from the multiobjective optimization results obtained in step 3 and the other half of the base points are selected from the proposed distributions obtained in step 4 then the same number of base points exhibiting different trends of concentration variations in the monitoring wells in comparison with the observations are eliminated the total number of training base points is unchanged without incurring any additional computational burden in the process of surrogate reconstruction step 6 repeat step 3 to step 5 until a stop criterion is reached in the present study the adaptive feedback process stops when the accuracy of the surrogate models no longer increases 3 numerical applications 3 1 case study description a synthetic 3 d multiphase flow numerical case is used to assess the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method the transport of nitrobenzene is simulated with the multiphase flow utchem code considering both the aqueous phase and oleic phase the case is designed by referring to practical problems and is as close as possible to the requirements of the actual situation including hydrogeological conditions of the site such as pollutant types aquifer configuration hydrogeological parameters initial conditions and boundary conditions the flow domain is 8400 m2 with a depth of 20 m fig 3 with no flux boundaries for the top and bottom boundaries first type boundaries for the southwestern and northeastern boundaries and no flux boundaries for the northwestern and southeastern boundaries the goal is to identify unknown parameters of the contamination source in this case the uncertainty is assumed to stem from only the contamination source since direct measurements of contaminant transport related parameters such as the release history intensity and location of the contaminant source are frequently infeasible sun et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 yan et al 2019 other parameters such as the permeability porosity and dispersivity are supposed to be deterministically known since they can be obtained by many means such as the hydrogeological tests geophysical exploration field investigations and monitoring the aquifer is heterogeneous and the permeability in zone i and zone ii is assumed to be constant at 5 527 10 11 m2 and 1 776 10 11 m2 respectively the porosity is 0 30 and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are chosen as 1 00 m and 0 30 m respectively water and nitrobenzene density are 1 000 g cm3 and 1 205 g cm3 respectively water and nitrobenzene viscosity are set as 0 001 pa s and 0 00168 pa s respectively residual saturation of water and nitrobenzene are set as 0 24 and 0 17 respectively nitrobenzene solubility in water is set as 1 9 g l and nitrobenzene water interfacial tension is set as 0 02566 n m the assumed observations from the three monitoring wells are generated by running the simulation model with the designed true values of the contaminant source parameters instead of the actual sampling measurements at the monitoring wells therefore the noise is not considered here however it would be necessary to consider the noises for real word problems the location of the contamination source is unknown a contamination source is released from 1 t to 4 t with unknown and time varying intensities which is described by four intensity parameters thus the contamination source is described by six parameters x y s1 s2 s3 s4 where x y is the contamination source location and s1 s2 s3 s4 are the time varying release strengths which are expressed by the rate of oleic phase leakage into the aquifer from the pollutant source we suppose that the prior contaminant source parameters are uniformly distributed within the ranges presented in table 1 3 2 implementation of the proposed framework in this case 300 and 50 simulation model calculations are operated to obtain training samples and testing samples respectively in the present study according to our experience and past trials totally 100 base points existing similar concentration variation trends in comparation with the observations are selected from the training samples to establish kriging surrogate models an additional five base points based on the same criteria mentioned above are selected from the testing samples to test the surrogate models the surrogate models are mapped from contaminant source parameters to the dnapl concentration values at each observation well a multiobjective optimization model as shown in eq 12 is established and the constructed surrogate models are used to substitute for the original model to calculate the dnapl concentration in the optimization model 12 min f 1 k 1 6 i 1 3 a b s c s i k c o i k min f 2 max i 1 3 a b s c s i c o i s t c s i k f x y s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 50 x 60 10 y 20 0 s 1 6 0 s 2 6 0 s 3 6 0 s 4 6 where f1 and f2 are objectives and c s i k and c o i k are simulated and observed concentration values for the kth period and ith observation well respectively in the present study i 3 k 6 c s i k in the objective functions and constraint condition are predicted by the surrogate models and x y s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 are decision variables the optimization model is solved by the mofepso algorithm then the mcmc simulation is then implemented and the constructed surrogate models are used to substitute for the original model to calculate the likelihood in the mcmc simulation a set of new base points are selected from the multiobjective optimization results and proposed distribution before determining the number of new base points added each time a pretest is conducted and the results show that each of the five pareto solutions and five samples selected from the posterior distribution per time can adequately reflect the characteristics of optimization and posterior information respectively therefore 10 new base points is added each time which requires 10 additional original model evaluations subsequently the new base points are inserted into the pool of candidate base points while simultaneously eliminating the same number of base points whose concentration variation trends are different from the observations the adaptive update feedback process is terminated when the stop condition is reached for the implementation of the proposed algorithm the two stage surrogate model construction based on the adaptive feedback process are coded by the authors whereas the code of the mofepso algorithm was as reported by hasanoglu and dolen 2018 the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream zs algorithm which is a multiple chain mcmc method and can deal with the large numbers in inversion problems with complex high dimensional and multi modal target distributions sadegh and vrugt 2014 vrugt 2016 cui et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 was employed to generate parameter posterior samples 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of two stage surrogate model the coefficient of determination r2 is used to evaluate the surrogate model accuracy the higher the value of r2 is the more accurate the prediction results are 13 r 2 1 i 1 n s y i y i 2 i 1 n s y i y 2 where yi and y i denote the actual and predicted values of the dnapl concentration for the ith testing base points respectively y denotes the average value of the exact testing base points and ns denotes the number of testing base points jiang and na 2020 to determine the total number of updated base points the r2 of the two stage surrogate model reconstructed using the same number of base points but different number of update times is compared with that of the one stage surrogate model which is trained only once using the initial 100 base points when we update the base points four times the value of r2 reaches its largest value when the number of update times reaches five the accuracy of the surrogate model slightly decreases therefore we determine that the total number of updated base points is 40 i e it has been updated four times to verify the performance of the two stage surrogate model the predictions obtained by the model are compared with those obtained by the one stage surrogate model fig 4 presents the predictions of the two stage and one stage surrogate models for the tested base points most of the dnapl concentrations evaluated using the one stage surrogate model are in good agreement with the results calculated by the simulation model however the dnapl concentrations computed by the two stage surrogate model present better agreement than the calculations using the one stage surrogate model indicating that the surrogate model accuracy is further enhanced by the adaptive update feedback process although the improvement is small the value of r2 increases from 0 9856 to 0 9884 it will influence the posterior distribution the significant effect on the posterior distribution is discussed in section 4 2 1 the true values versus the base points of the six source parameters after the adaptive update feedback process are presented in fig 5 fig 5 shows that the newly added base points of the source location approach the true values and the added base points of time varying release strengths have a relatively shorter distance from the true values than the eliminated points this indicates that the proposed adaptive update feedback process provides useful optimization and posterior information which will help to build locally accurate surrogate models near the true values of the source parameters to demonstrate the surrogate model accuracy over the posterior distributions the concentrations calculated by the simulation model and surrogate models at the three observation wells for 10 posterior parameter realizations with 180 dots after the final feedback correction process are compared as presented in fig 6 a the r2 0 9902 is very close to 1 furthermore a root mean squared error rmse of 0 018 is found between the concentrations of the simulation model and the final surrogate models above statistic indicates that the two stage surrogate models become precise surrogates of the original simulation model over the posterior distributions which can result in very precise posterior probability densities of the contamination source parameters in addition fig 6b presents the optimization results from the same multiobjective experiment using the same optimization algorithm with assistance of the two stage and one stage surrogate models respectively the range of pareto results obtained by the two stage surrogate based multiobjective optimization model is much smaller than that obtained by the one stage surrogate based multiobjective optimization model indicating that the predicted concentrations corresponding to the two stage surrogate based multiobjective optimization results are closer to the actual observed values this further verifies the effectiveness of the adaptive updating feedback process 4 2 verification of accuracy and efficiency of proposed method 4 2 1 verification of the adaptive update feedback process the number of iterations in dream zs algorithm was 30 000 and the number of search chains was three a total of 90 000 model evaluations the r diagnostic was employed as the quantitative convergence criterion gelman and rubin 1992 values of r smaller than 1 2 denote convergence to a limiting distribution sadegh and vrugt 2014 zhang et al 2020 the trace plots of the r statistic in fig 7 show that the optimized initial value based dream zs algorithm in the proposed framework requires about 1 800 model evaluations to satisfy the convergence threshold of 1 2 trace plots of the last 5 000 posterior parameter samples generated by the proposed framework are presented in fig 8 the estimated values of all the source parameters by the proposed method blue lines coverage to the area around true values red lines to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive update feedback process in the proposed framework the same inversion problem is solved by running the entire process with a one stage surrogate assisted mcmc based framework using the same parameters except for the surrogate model the trace plots of the one stage surrogate assisted mcmc based framework cyan color in fig 8 show that the estimated values of the parameters are coverage to the similar area with the proposed method fig 9 presents marginal posterior distributions of the parameters derived from the different frameworks the last 20 000 posterior realizations were selected to appraise the statistical characteristics of the posterior distributions fig 9 shows that all posterior distributions of the source parameters obtained by the proposed framework represented by red curves and the one stage surrogate based framework represented by purple curves incorporate true values vertical black lines when the maximum a posteriori density values map for each parameter was selected as the identification result the rmse between map and true value of parameters by the proposed method decreased by 71 3 in comparison with the one stage surrogate based framework therefore we concluded that the improvement in surrogate accuracy generated by the adaptive update feedback process can improve the proximity of identification results to the parameters true values 4 2 2 verification of the efficiency of mofepso algorithm the proposed framework adopts the mofepso algorithm to locate a sweet spot for the time consuming mcmc search as an initial value of the contamination source parameters to further assess the efficiency of adopting mofepso the same inversion problem is solved with the random value based mcmc simulation which uses random values as the initial guess of the unknown parameters while keeping the parameters and surrogate models are all the same except for the initial value of the mcmc simulation for comparison the trace plots and posterior probability densities obtained by the two methods are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively fig 8 shows that the sampled chains of both optimized initial values and random initial values based mcmc algorithms converge to the same area the estimated posterior distributions of the proposed framework and random initial value based mcmc simulation are in close agreement with each other and incorporate the true values fig 9 however the trace plots of the r statistic displayed in fig 7 shows that optimized initial values based mcmc algorithm requires about 1 800 model evaluations to satisfy the convergence threshold of 1 2 and needs about 15 000 model evaluations to reach stable at the value of 1 0 in comparison the random initial value based mcmc algorithm requires a substantially larger number of model evaluations 3 600 to converge to the target distribution and needs about 30 000 model evaluations to reach stable at the value of 1 0 therefore we can conclude that adopting mofepso to generate an initial guess of the contamination source parameters improves the efficiency of mcmc simulation 4 2 3 comparation of computational costs for the implementation of the proposed method to identify contamination source parameters a total of 50 35 computational hours are required on a macbook pro platform with a 2 3 ghz intel core i5 cpu and 8 gb of 2133 mhz lpddr3 ram the computational costs include 300 original simulation operations to obtain the training samples 50 original simulation operations to obtain the testing samples 40 original simulation operations to obtain the updated samples five rounds of surrogate model construction and optimization model solution and 90 000 runs of the surrogate during the mcmc simulation compared with the one stage surrogate based framework the proposed framework requires 17 35 additional hours to construct locally accurate surrogate models however this additional time would lead to the rmse between true value and map of parameters obtained by the proposed method decreased by 71 3 therefore we believe that this extra computational cost is reasonable to obtain an improved proximity of identification results to true values by contrast the total number of original simulation operations is 90 000 for a completely original simulation based mcmc simulation and this process requires approximately 7 500 h thus the computational burden is reduced by approximately 99 3 when using the proposed method therefore the proposed framework is effective for identifying contamination source parameters while requiring approximately 0 7 of the simulation based mcmc simulation computational burden above results and discussion indicate that the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified and the contamination source location and time varying release intensities can be accurately and effectively identified using the proposed framework 4 3 identification of the contamination source parameters the effective identification of groundwater pollution sources provides not only information support for designing reasonable remediation strategies but also technical support for clarifying the responsibilities and rights of groundwater pollution control and treatment the boxplot and posterior probability densities of the identified contamination source location and intensity corresponding to each of the release histories by the proposed method are presented in fig 10 decision makers can select the point with the highest probability density in the location and release history of the contamination source or the median mean and maximum values as the identification results according to their requirements in previous studies surrogate models were mostly established based on the prior distribution and the surrogate accuracy in the posterior region may not be high siade et al 2020 to eliminate the surrogate introduced bias the present study proposed a locally accurate two stage surrogate based bayesian framework for groundwater contaminant source identification different from previous studies the present study specifically considered the posterior information and multiobjective optimization results to enhance surrogate model accuracy in the posterior region in addition the proposed framework adopted the mofepso algorithm to locate a sweet spot for the time consuming mcmc search for an initial value of the contamination source parameters to enhance the efficiency of the mcmc simulation in the present case study only the contamination source parameters are taken into account as uncertain parameters while the other parameters and conditions e g permeability and boundary conditions are assumed to be known for an actual complicated site problem when an aquifer is particularly heterogeneous the permeability should be considered as a spatial continuously varying random field due to the significant number of unknown parameters the computational cost for surrogate model establishment may be unaffordable dimension reduction techniques e g karhooven loeve expansion zhang and lu 2004 zhang et al 2007 2015 may be a good choice to decrease the number of unknown parameters to alleviate the large computational burden after dimension reduction the method proposed in this paper can be employed for inversion problems in which other parameters and conditions must be taken into account simultaneously however the computational burden in the surrogate construction will be increased to some extent when the number of unknowns increases the applications of the proposed framework are not limited to identifying the source and hydrogeological parameters of multiple phase contaminant problems and also include single phase contaminant problems constructing a locally accurate surrogate over the posterior distribution is a better choice when constructing a globally precise surrogate model for a high dimensional nonlinear original model is computationally prohibitive zhang et al 2016 2017 while for the parameter dimension and the model nonlinearity are sufficiently low to allow for constructing a globally precise surrogate model the proposed framework can be used with the assistance of a global surrogate model to replace the locally accurate surrogate for the real word problems the reliability of inversion results should be verified by combining survey data and professional knowledge especially when there are many different local optima for the inversion problems of groundwater contaminant sources identification 5 conclusions in this paper a locally accurate surrogate based bayesian framework that couples surrogate construction multiobjective optimization mcmc simulation and an adaptive update feedback process is proposed to effectively identify groundwater contamination source parameters mcmc simulation is employed to generate realizations for posterior parameters to avoid the substantial computational burden surrogate models are constructed to replace the original model during mcmc simulation to improve the surrogate accuracy in the posterior region we propose an adaptive update feedback process to construct locally accurate surrogates over the posterior distribution by adding pareto optimal solutions and posterior information while eliminating some old samples to increase the efficiency of the mcmc simulation the proposed framework adopts the mofepso algorithm to generate the initial guess of contamination source parameters via a case study the following conclusions are obtained 1 for bayesian parameter identification problems establishing a locally precise surrogate model over the posterior distribution of contamination source parameters to assist mcmc simulation is much more computationally efficient than the original model based mcmc simulation in terms of the computational efficiency significant acceleration can be achieved compared with the simulation model assisted method 2 the proposed two stage surrogate model based bayesian inversion approach can produce more accurate posterior parameter estimations than the one stage surrogate model based method the proposed adaptive update feedback process improves the accuracy of the surrogate model over the parameters posterior distributions further enhancing the parameter identification performance 3 adopting mofepso for generating an initial guess of the contamination source parameter boosts the efficiency of mcmc in this paper a synthetic case is designed according to the actual conditions to the extent possible however a certain gap remains between the real world problems and the synthetic case for real world problems more complex conditions should be considered such as noise in the actual observation data aquifer heterogeneity and complex boundary conditions therefore applying the proposed method and dimension reduction techniques to address complicated real world problems to verify and enrich the relevant conclusions and achievements of the inversion topic of groundwater contaminant sources will be pursued in our future research we also note the limitations of the kriging surrogate model although it replaces the simulation quite well when the contaminated source covers a large area with numerous unknown parameters the accuracy of the kriging model may decrease for high parameter dimension problems therefore more studies are required to compare the effectiveness of the different model emulating algorithms such as the polynomial chaos expansion and ensemble surrogate algorithms for high dimension problems and new surrogate algorithms particularly for highly parameterized inversion problems need to be created credit authorship contribution

4862,groundwater contaminant source identification is normally a prerequisite for contaminant remediation this study proposes a new two stage surrogate assisted markov chain monte carlo mcmc based bayesian framework to identify contaminant source parameters for groundwater polluted by dense nonaqueous phase liquid in the framework an adaptive update feedback process is proposed to construct a locally accurate surrogate model over posterior distributions to replace the time consuming multiphase flow model to increase the efficiency of the mcmc simulation a multiobjective feasibility enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm mofepso is adopted to generate the initial guess of the contamination source parameters the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework are confirmed via a synthetic study the contaminant source parameters generated by the proposed approach are compared with those computed by the one stage surrogate assisted mcmc based bayesian approach the results demonstrate that the root mean squared error rmse between true value of parameters and maximum a posteriori density values map obtained by the proposed method decreased by 71 3 compared with those obtained by one stage surrogate based framework to further assess the efficiency of mofepso the same inversion problem is solved with random values as the initial guesses of the unknown parameters during mcmc simulation the other conditions are the same as the proposed framework the results indicate that adopting mofepso improves the efficiency of mcmc simulation therefore the proposed approach can accurately and effectively identify the contaminant source parameters with achieving about 148 times of speed up compared to the simulation based mcmc simulation keywords groundwater contamination sources inversion bayesian two stage surrogate model multiobjective optimization 1 introduction dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl contaminated groundwater is among the most urgent water pollution problems worldwide kueper and mcwhorter 1991 ji et al 2003 jiang and na 2020 after entering an aquifer dnapls can displace groundwater and continue to infiltrate and accumulate toward the water resistant floor and they may become a long term continuous contamination source slough et al 1999 ouyang et al 2017a groundwater pollution source information is an important prerequisite for designing in situ or ectopic remediation schemes for groundwater dnapl contaminated sites datta et al 2009 west and kueper 2012 kang et al 2018 li et al 2020 however groundwater contamination exhibits characteristics of concealment and hysteresis making it difficult to directly obtain contamination source parameters such as the release history intensity and location sun et al 2006 yan et al 2019 therefore effectively identifying contamination source parameters for dnapl contaminated site remediation is particularly significant as it can help project personnel propose more targeted remediation strategies to improve the remediation efficiency and reduce remediation costs identifying parameters of contaminant sources demands an inversion problem to be solved traditional optimization based inversion approaches e g least squares regression and linear programing nonlinear optimization with the embedding technique and heuristic global search methods have been employed in groundwater contamination source identification gorelick et al 1983 mahar and datta 1997 2001 mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 zhang et al 2015 however the inverse problems are always regarded as ill posed in that the solution may exhibit nonexistence or nonuniqueness zhang et al 2015 moreover the uncertainty in inverse results cannot be completely characterized by optimization based approaches ma and zabaras 2009 zhang et al 2015 as alternative methods bayesian inversion approaches have the capacity to address such uncertainty zhang et al 2015 yan et al 2019 in the bayesian method the unknown parameters are regarded as random variables whose posterior distributions can be appraised with markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation haario et al 2006 thus this approach has become increasingly universal for representing uncertainties in hydrologic models vrugt et al 2008 smith and marshall 2008 yustres et al 2012 zeng et al 2012 laloy et al 2013 wang and jin 2013 zhang et al 2015 yan et al 2019 in bayesian parameter estimation based on mcmc simulation simulation models must be repetitively computed to assess the likelihood for cpu demanding flow and contaminant transport problems the computational cost may be prohibitive zhang et al 2015 to overcome this disadvantage employing a surrogate model to replace the original computation intensive simulation model is one promising approach zeng et al 2018 yan et al 2019 for example zeng et al 2012 employed a surrogate to reduce the computational burden of mcmc to accelerate contamination source parameter identification zhang et al 2015 used a genetic algorithm to generate the initial value of the parameters to be identified with the surrogate model to enhance the efficiency of mcmc in the process of contaminant source parameter identification the current methods for establishing surrogate models are based mostly on prior distribution and the surrogate model accuracy in the posterior region may not be high siade et al 2020 thus the results of surrogate assisted mcmc algorithms may deviate from the true characteristics of the groundwater contamination sources due to the prediction error of the surrogate leading to the meaningless of the inverse results a sufficiently accurate surrogate must be constructed to eliminate surrogate introduced bias zhao et al 2020 or the original model can be used to correct the surrogate model in a two stage manner zeng et al 2012 laloy et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 because of the high computational cost a globally precise substitution for a high dimensional original model is difficult to construct except when the model nonlinearity is sufficiently low to allow for linear approximation li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 moreover additional original model calculations are needed and still entail a high computational cost for the two stage approach zhang et al 2016 however as the posterior distribution usually accounts for only a small proportion of the prior distribution it is computationally feasible to establish a locally precise surrogate over the posterior distribution zhang et al 2016 li and marzouk 2014 attempted to obtain a distribution close to the posterior distribution by minimizing cross entropy and constructed a locally precise surrogate model over this distribution zhang et al 2016 formulated an efficient method in which surrogate models are adaptively established over the posterior distribution of the model parameters by integrating a gaussian process surrogate and mcmc method these studies have demonstrated the great potential of constructing a locally precise surrogate model over the posterior distribution for mcmc based bayesian inferences however knowledge gaps still exist regarding to this aspect locally accurate surrogate models constructed by adaptively increasing base points close to the posterior have attracted considerable attention in recent years but as the number of samples increases the computational burden also increases therefore a strategy is needed in which the adaptive sampling method is developed to enhance the surrogate model accuracy without increasing the calculation burden at the meanwhile in addition the selection of the initial point has a significant influence on the efficiency of mcmc simulation optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm have been employed to obtain the initial value of the unknown parameters by solving a single objective optimization model zhang et al 2015 when choosing the optimal initial point multiple considerations are often expected however a multiobjective optimization model with an effective algorithm has not been adopted to determine the initial value in mcmc simulation to fill above knowledge gaps the purpose of the present study is to propose and verify a novel locally accurate two stage surrogate based bayesian framework that couples surrogate construction multiobjective optimization mcmc simulation and an adaptive update feedback process to effectively identify groundwater contaminant source parameters in addition theoretical implications for contamination source inversion are enriched and developed specifically the main contributions of the present study are as follows 1 propose an adaptive update feedback process to construct locally accurate surrogates by adding pareto optimal solutions and posterior samples while eliminating some old samples in the adaptive update feedback process the total number of training base points is unchanged and no additional computational burden is imposed for surrogate model construction 2 adopt a multiobjective feasibility enhanced particle swarm optimization mofepso algorithm to locate a sweet spot for the time consuming mcmc search as an initial value of the contamination source parameters by solving a multiobjective optimization model this method has the potential to enhance the efficiency of mcmc simulation to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have investigated a locally accurate two stage surrogate construction based on an adaptive update feedback process and the mofepso algorithm to assist the mcmc simulation in hydrogeology bayesian groundwater contamination source identification problems 2 methods 2 1 mathematical model the concentrations of dnapl are calculated by employing a mathematical model that includes a mass conservation equation and definite conditions jiang and na 2020 the mass conservation equation is shown as follows delshad et al 1996 1 t c k ρ k l 1 n p ρ k c kl u l s l k kl c k l r k where represents the porosity c k represents the overall concentration of component k ρk represents the density of k np is the number of phases including aqueous and oleic ckl represents the concentration of k in phase l u l represents the darcy velocity of l sl represents the saturation of l k kl represents the dispersion tensor and rk represents the total source terms of k delshad et al 1996 jiang et al 2017 jiang and na 2020 which can be expressed as 2 r k l 1 np s l r kl 1 r ks q k where q k denotes the injection production rate for component k per bulk volume and r kl and r ks are

utchem which addresses physical chemical and biological transformations and accounts for dnapl solubilization and mobilization delshad et al 1996 is used to solve the mathematical model 2 2 bayesian experimental design according to bayes theorem the posterior distribution can be calculated as 3 p m d p m p d m p d m p m d m where d represents the result caused by the occurrence of an event m represents one of the reasons for the outcome of the event p m represents the probability of the occurrence of m without considering other factors which is called the prior probability term of m p d m represents the conditional probability term p m d represents the posterior probability term of m and the denominator on the right side of the equation represents the probability of d occurring after all causes are considered which is also called the normalizing constant sadegh and vrugt 2014 the mathematical function of the bayesian formula is to identify the posterior probability of m that is to say given that the result d occurs what is the probability that can be used to infer this result in this study the prior distribution p m denotes the modeler s knowledge about parameters before any measurements are considered p m d denotes the posterior distribution of the contamination source parameters p d m is the likelihood which evaluates the goodness of fit between the measurements and model outputs m represents source parameters and d represents concentration measurements considering that it is difficult to derive an explicit likelihood function for a non linear and complex multiphase flow model the approximate bayesian computation abc sadegh and vrugt 2014 cui et al 2018 is introduced as it relaxes the need to compute an explicit likelihood function by using a summary statistic vrugt and sadegh 2013 cui et al 2018 the abc likelihood function is expressed as 4 l x y min j 1 m j ρ s j y s j y x where ρ s j y s j y x is the abc distance function for more details please refer to sadegh and vrugt 2014 for a nonlinear model the analytical form of the posterior distribution is difficult to obtain a universal method is to employ the mcmc algorithm to obtain realizations from the posterior distribution these realizations are then analyzed to obtain the posterior statistical characteristics in this paper we propose a two stage surrogate assisted mcmc based bayesian approach to identify contamination source parameters the detailed formulation of the mcmc method is not presented here since that is not our focus for more details please refer to haario et al 2006 2 3 kriging method for constructing surrogate models many algorithms have been employed to construct surrogate models such as polynomial regression pr kriging support vector regression svr radial basis function artificial neural network rbfann and kernel extreme learning machines kelm ouyang et al 2017b the kriging method is mathematically very close to a gaussian process and is not only well suited to fitting nonlinear problems but also has good stability and fast convergence chen et al 2014 yan et al 2019 jiang and na 2020 previous studies have concluded that the approximation accuracy of the kriging model is higher than those of the rbfann pr and svr models for building surrogate models of the multiphase flow simulation model luo and lu 2014 hou et al 2015 we also performed tests using rbfann kriging svr and kelm to construct surrogate models and our results show that the kriging and kelm models have higher accuracy than the svr and rbfann models jiang et al 2015 therefore inspired by previous studies and the advantages of the kriging method we choose the kriging model to construct the surrogate model in the proposed framework the kriging model is built by a polynomial regression model and a stochastic error 5 y x f x t β e x where f x f 1 x f 2 x f m x t represents the regression function vector β β 1 β 2 β m t represents the regression parameter vector and e x is a stationary stochastic function with the following statistical characteristics 6 e e x 0 var e x δ 2 c ov e x i e x j δ 2 r x i x j where r represents the correlation function in the present study an isotropic gaussian function is employed for r which is calculated as 7 r x i x j e x p k 1 n θ k x i k x j k 2 where θk denotes the kth unknown correlation parameter in the present study the mofepso algorithm is employed to optimize θk for the base points x1 x2 xn t is the input variable matrix and y y1 y2 yn t is the corresponding output response the response of the

on the best linear unbiased estimation 9 β f t r 1 f 1 f t r 1 y the estimation of the δ 2 is given as 10 δ 2 1 n y t f 1 β t r 1 y t f 1 β to guarantee the accuracy of the model the minimum number of samples is required to satisfy jin et al 2001 gao et al 2019 11 n n v 1 n v 2 2 where nv is the number of design variables 2 4 multiobjective feasibility enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm the mofepso algorithm is an enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm that utilizes nondominated repositories and feasible positions to direct feasible particle flight and treats the infeasible and feasible particles differently hasanoglu and dolen 2018 jiang and na 2020 fig 1 illustrates the computational procedure of the mofepso algorithm and the key steps are expressed as follows step 1 initialize the position matrix the velocity matrix global best positions and local best positions step 2 loop over the number of iterations 1 assess whether the current particle position is feasible the infeasible and feasible particles have different behaviors 2 assess whether the new particle position is feasible 3 repeat the loop until the maximum number of particles is identified 4 terminate the iterative process when the maximum number of iterations is satisfied more details about the algorithm can be found in hasanoglu and dolen 2018 2 5 proposed method a two stage surrogate assisted mcmc based bayesian approach is proposed in this paper to adaptively establish locally precise surrogates and efficiently identify groundwater contamination source parameters the proposed approach is illustrated in fig 2 and the key steps are as follows step 1 generate n base points over the prior distribution of unknown parameters using the latin hypercube sampling method the corresponding outputs are calculated using the original simulation model step 2 as only locally precise surrogate models of the original model are required and the computational burden of establishing a kriging surrogate model is proportional to the number of base points it is not necessary to adopt all base points generated in step 1 to reduce the surrogate model training time only a subset of base points whose concentration variation trends in the monitoring wells similar with the observations are selected to establish the kriging surrogate model in addition the base points whose concentration variations in the monitoring wells present different trends in comparation with the observations are eliminated the constructed surrogate models are employed to replace the original model in the optimization model and mcmc simulation process to significantly reduce the computational burden step 3 a multiobjective optimization model is constructed considering two objective functions 1 minimizing the sum of the absolute error of solutions and observations and 2 minimizing the maximum value of the absolute error of solutions and observations the mofepso algorithm is employed to solve this optimization model step 4 to improve the efficiency of the mcmc simulation the solution with the minimum objective function 2 obtained by the mofepso algorithm is set as the initial guess of unknown parameters during the mcmc simulation and the parameter samples are drawn from the posterior distributions of the source parameters by performing the surrogate based mcmc simulation step 5 to build a locally accurate surrogate model in the posterior distribution we design an adaptive update feedback process to update base points and reconstruct the surrogate for one running time of the adaptive feedback process a new set of base points is inserted into the pool of candidate base points half of the new base points are selected from the multiobjective optimization results obtained in step 3 and the other half of the base points are selected from the proposed distributions obtained in step 4 then the same number of base points exhibiting different trends of concentration variations in the monitoring wells in comparison with the observations are eliminated the total number of training base points is unchanged without incurring any additional computational burden in the process of surrogate reconstruction step 6 repeat step 3 to step 5 until a stop criterion is reached in the present study the adaptive feedback process stops when the accuracy of the surrogate models no longer increases 3 numerical applications 3 1 case study description a synthetic 3 d multiphase flow numerical case is used to assess the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method the transport of nitrobenzene is simulated with the multiphase flow utchem code considering both the aqueous phase and oleic phase the case is designed by referring to practical problems and is as close as possible to the requirements of the actual situation including hydrogeological conditions of the site such as pollutant types aquifer configuration hydrogeological parameters initial conditions and boundary conditions the flow domain is 8400 m2 with a depth of 20 m fig 3 with no flux boundaries for the top and bottom boundaries first type boundaries for the southwestern and northeastern boundaries and no flux boundaries for the northwestern and southeastern boundaries the goal is to identify unknown parameters of the contamination source in this case the uncertainty is assumed to stem from only the contamination source since direct measurements of contaminant transport related parameters such as the release history intensity and location of the contaminant source are frequently infeasible sun et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 yan et al 2019 other parameters such as the permeability porosity and dispersivity are supposed to be deterministically known since they can be obtained by many means such as the hydrogeological tests geophysical exploration field investigations and monitoring the aquifer is heterogeneous and the permeability in zone i and zone ii is assumed to be constant at 5 527 10 11 m2 and 1 776 10 11 m2 respectively the porosity is 0 30 and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are chosen as 1 00 m and 0 30 m respectively water and nitrobenzene density are 1 000 g cm3 and 1 205 g cm3 respectively water and nitrobenzene viscosity are set as 0 001 pa s and 0 00168 pa s respectively residual saturation of water and nitrobenzene are set as 0 24 and 0 17 respectively nitrobenzene solubility in water is set as 1 9 g l and nitrobenzene water interfacial tension is set as 0 02566 n m the assumed observations from the three monitoring wells are generated by running the simulation model with the designed true values of the contaminant source parameters instead of the actual sampling measurements at the monitoring wells therefore the noise is not considered here however it would be necessary to consider the noises for real word problems the location of the contamination source is unknown a contamination source is released from 1 t to 4 t with unknown and time varying intensities which is described by four intensity parameters thus the contamination source is described by six parameters x y s1 s2 s3 s4 where x y is the contamination source location and s1 s2 s3 s4 are the time varying release strengths which are expressed by the rate of oleic phase leakage into the aquifer from the pollutant source we suppose that the prior contaminant source parameters are uniformly distributed within the ranges presented in table 1 3 2 implementation of the proposed framework in this case 300 and 50 simulation model calculations are operated to obtain training samples and testing samples respectively in the present study according to our experience and past trials totally 100 base points existing similar concentration variation trends in comparation with the observations are selected from the training samples to establish kriging surrogate models an additional five base points based on the same criteria mentioned above are selected from the testing samples to test the surrogate models the surrogate models are mapped from contaminant source parameters to the dnapl concentration values at each observation well a multiobjective optimization model as shown in eq 12 is established and the constructed surrogate models are used to substitute for the original model to calculate the dnapl concentration in the optimization model 12 min f 1 k 1 6 i 1 3 a b s c s i k c o i k min f 2 max i 1 3 a b s c s i c o i s t c s i k f x y s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 50 x 60 10 y 20 0 s 1 6 0 s 2 6 0 s 3 6 0 s 4 6 where f1 and f2 are objectives and c s i k and c o i k are simulated and observed concentration values for the kth period and ith observation well respectively in the present study i 3 k 6 c s i k in the objective functions and constraint condition are predicted by the surrogate models and x y s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 are decision variables the optimization model is solved by the mofepso algorithm then the mcmc simulation is then implemented and the constructed surrogate models are used to substitute for the original model to calculate the likelihood in the mcmc simulation a set of new base points are selected from the multiobjective optimization results and proposed distribution before determining the number of new base points added each time a pretest is conducted and the results show that each of the five pareto solutions and five samples selected from the posterior distribution per time can adequately reflect the characteristics of optimization and posterior information respectively therefore 10 new base points is added each time which requires 10 additional original model evaluations subsequently the new base points are inserted into the pool of candidate base points while simultaneously eliminating the same number of base points whose concentration variation trends are different from the observations the adaptive update feedback process is terminated when the stop condition is reached for the implementation of the proposed algorithm the two stage surrogate model construction based on the adaptive feedback process are coded by the authors whereas the code of the mofepso algorithm was as reported by hasanoglu and dolen 2018 the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream zs algorithm which is a multiple chain mcmc method and can deal with the large numbers in inversion problems with complex high dimensional and multi modal target distributions sadegh and vrugt 2014 vrugt 2016 cui et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 was employed to generate parameter posterior samples 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of two stage surrogate model the coefficient of determination r2 is used to evaluate the surrogate model accuracy the higher the value of r2 is the more accurate the prediction results are 13 r 2 1 i 1 n s y i y i 2 i 1 n s y i y 2 where yi and y i denote the actual and predicted values of the dnapl concentration for the ith testing base points respectively y denotes the average value of the exact testing base points and ns denotes the number of testing base points jiang and na 2020 to determine the total number of updated base points the r2 of the two stage surrogate model reconstructed using the same number of base points but different number of update times is compared with that of the one stage surrogate model which is trained only once using the initial 100 base points when we update the base points four times the value of r2 reaches its largest value when the number of update times reaches five the accuracy of the surrogate model slightly decreases therefore we determine that the total number of updated base points is 40 i e it has been updated four times to verify the performance of the two stage surrogate model the predictions obtained by the model are compared with those obtained by the one stage surrogate model fig 4 presents the predictions of the two stage and one stage surrogate models for the tested base points most of the dnapl concentrations evaluated using the one stage surrogate model are in good agreement with the results calculated by the simulation model however the dnapl concentrations computed by the two stage surrogate model present better agreement than the calculations using the one stage surrogate model indicating that the surrogate model accuracy is further enhanced by the adaptive update feedback process although the improvement is small the value of r2 increases from 0 9856 to 0 9884 it will influence the posterior distribution the significant effect on the posterior distribution is discussed in section 4 2 1 the true values versus the base points of the six source parameters after the adaptive update feedback process are presented in fig 5 fig 5 shows that the newly added base points of the source location approach the true values and the added base points of time varying release strengths have a relatively shorter distance from the true values than the eliminated points this indicates that the proposed adaptive update feedback process provides useful optimization and posterior information which will help to build locally accurate surrogate models near the true values of the source parameters to demonstrate the surrogate model accuracy over the posterior distributions the concentrations calculated by the simulation model and surrogate models at the three observation wells for 10 posterior parameter realizations with 180 dots after the final feedback correction process are compared as presented in fig 6 a the r2 0 9902 is very close to 1 furthermore a root mean squared error rmse of 0 018 is found between the concentrations of the simulation model and the final surrogate models above statistic indicates that the two stage surrogate models become precise surrogates of the original simulation model over the posterior distributions which can result in very precise posterior probability densities of the contamination source parameters in addition fig 6b presents the optimization results from the same multiobjective experiment using the same optimization algorithm with assistance of the two stage and one stage surrogate models respectively the range of pareto results obtained by the two stage surrogate based multiobjective optimization model is much smaller than that obtained by the one stage surrogate based multiobjective optimization model indicating that the predicted concentrations corresponding to the two stage surrogate based multiobjective optimization results are closer to the actual observed values this further verifies the effectiveness of the adaptive updating feedback process 4 2 verification of accuracy and efficiency of proposed method 4 2 1 verification of the adaptive update feedback process the number of iterations in dream zs algorithm was 30 000 and the number of search chains was three a total of 90 000 model evaluations the r diagnostic was employed as the quantitative convergence criterion gelman and rubin 1992 values of r smaller than 1 2 denote convergence to a limiting distribution sadegh and vrugt 2014 zhang et al 2020 the trace plots of the r statistic in fig 7 show that the optimized initial value based dream zs algorithm in the proposed framework requires about 1 800 model evaluations to satisfy the convergence threshold of 1 2 trace plots of the last 5 000 posterior parameter samples generated by the proposed framework are presented in fig 8 the estimated values of all the source parameters by the proposed method blue lines coverage to the area around true values red lines to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive update feedback process in the proposed framework the same inversion problem is solved by running the entire process with a one stage surrogate assisted mcmc based framework using the same parameters except for the surrogate model the trace plots of the one stage surrogate assisted mcmc based framework cyan color in fig 8 show that the estimated values of the parameters are coverage to the similar area with the proposed method fig 9 presents marginal posterior distributions of the parameters derived from the different frameworks the last 20 000 posterior realizations were selected to appraise the statistical characteristics of the posterior distributions fig 9 shows that all posterior distributions of the source parameters obtained by the proposed framework represented by red curves and the one stage surrogate based framework represented by purple curves incorporate true values vertical black lines when the maximum a posteriori density values map for each parameter was selected as the identification result the rmse between map and true value of parameters by the proposed method decreased by 71 3 in comparison with the one stage surrogate based framework therefore we concluded that the improvement in surrogate accuracy generated by the adaptive update feedback process can improve the proximity of identification results to the parameters true values 4 2 2 verification of the efficiency of mofepso algorithm the proposed framework adopts the mofepso algorithm to locate a sweet spot for the time consuming mcmc search as an initial value of the contamination source parameters to further assess the efficiency of adopting mofepso the same inversion problem is solved with the random value based mcmc simulation which uses random values as the initial guess of the unknown parameters while keeping the parameters and surrogate models are all the same except for the initial value of the mcmc simulation for comparison the trace plots and posterior probability densities obtained by the two methods are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively fig 8 shows that the sampled chains of both optimized initial values and random initial values based mcmc algorithms converge to the same area the estimated posterior distributions of the proposed framework and random initial value based mcmc simulation are in close agreement with each other and incorporate the true values fig 9 however the trace plots of the r statistic displayed in fig 7 shows that optimized initial values based mcmc algorithm requires about 1 800 model evaluations to satisfy the convergence threshold of 1 2 and needs about 15 000 model evaluations to reach stable at the value of 1 0 in comparison the random initial value based mcmc algorithm requires a substantially larger number of model evaluations 3 600 to converge to the target distribution and needs about 30 000 model evaluations to reach stable at the value of 1 0 therefore we can conclude that adopting mofepso to generate an initial guess of the contamination source parameters improves the efficiency of mcmc simulation 4 2 3 comparation of computational costs for the implementation of the proposed method to identify contamination source parameters a total of 50 35 computational hours are required on a macbook pro platform with a 2 3 ghz intel core i5 cpu and 8 gb of 2133 mhz lpddr3 ram the computational costs include 300 original simulation operations to obtain the training samples 50 original simulation operations to obtain the testing samples 40 original simulation operations to obtain the updated samples five rounds of surrogate model construction and optimization model solution and 90 000 runs of the surrogate during the mcmc simulation compared with the one stage surrogate based framework the proposed framework requires 17 35 additional hours to construct locally accurate surrogate models however this additional time would lead to the rmse between true value and map of parameters obtained by the proposed method decreased by 71 3 therefore we believe that this extra computational cost is reasonable to obtain an improved proximity of identification results to true values by contrast the total number of original simulation operations is 90 000 for a completely original simulation based mcmc simulation and this process requires approximately 7 500 h thus the computational burden is reduced by approximately 99 3 when using the proposed method therefore the proposed framework is effective for identifying contamination source parameters while requiring approximately 0 7 of the simulation based mcmc simulation computational burden above results and discussion indicate that the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified and the contamination source location and time varying release intensities can be accurately and effectively identified using the proposed framework 4 3 identification of the contamination source parameters the effective identification of groundwater pollution sources provides not only information support for designing reasonable remediation strategies but also technical support for clarifying the responsibilities and rights of groundwater pollution control and treatment the boxplot and posterior probability densities of the identified contamination source location and intensity corresponding to each of the release histories by the proposed method are presented in fig 10 decision makers can select the point with the highest probability density in the location and release history of the contamination source or the median mean and maximum values as the identification results according to their requirements in previous studies surrogate models were mostly established based on the prior distribution and the surrogate accuracy in the posterior region may not be high siade et al 2020 to eliminate the surrogate introduced bias the present study proposed a locally accurate two stage surrogate based bayesian framework for groundwater contaminant source identification different from previous studies the present study specifically considered the posterior information and multiobjective optimization results to enhance surrogate model accuracy in the posterior region in addition the proposed framework adopted the mofepso algorithm to locate a sweet spot for the time consuming mcmc search for an initial value of the contamination source parameters to enhance the efficiency of the mcmc simulation in the present case study only the contamination source parameters are taken into account as uncertain parameters while the other parameters and conditions e g permeability and boundary conditions are assumed to be known for an actual complicated site problem when an aquifer is particularly heterogeneous the permeability should be considered as a spatial continuously varying random field due to the significant number of unknown parameters the computational cost for surrogate model establishment may be unaffordable dimension reduction techniques e g karhooven loeve expansion zhang and lu 2004 zhang et al 2007 2015 may be a good choice to decrease the number of unknown parameters to alleviate the large computational burden after dimension reduction the method proposed in this paper can be employed for inversion problems in which other parameters and conditions must be taken into account simultaneously however the computational burden in the surrogate construction will be increased to some extent when the number of unknowns increases the applications of the proposed framework are not limited to identifying the source and hydrogeological parameters of multiple phase contaminant problems and also include single phase contaminant problems constructing a locally accurate surrogate over the posterior distribution is a better choice when constructing a globally precise surrogate model for a high dimensional nonlinear original model is computationally prohibitive zhang et al 2016 2017 while for the parameter dimension and the model nonlinearity are sufficiently low to allow for constructing a globally precise surrogate model the proposed framework can be used with the assistance of a global surrogate model to replace the locally accurate surrogate for the real word problems the reliability of inversion results should be verified by combining survey data and professional knowledge especially when there are many different local optima for the inversion problems of groundwater contaminant sources identification 5 conclusions in this paper a locally accurate surrogate based bayesian framework that couples surrogate construction multiobjective optimization mcmc simulation and an adaptive update feedback process is proposed to effectively identify groundwater contamination source parameters mcmc simulation is employed to generate realizations for posterior parameters to avoid the substantial computational burden surrogate models are constructed to replace the original model during mcmc simulation to improve the surrogate accuracy in the posterior region we propose an adaptive update feedback process to construct locally accurate surrogates over the posterior distribution by adding pareto optimal solutions and posterior information while eliminating some old samples to increase the efficiency of the mcmc simulation the proposed framework adopts the mofepso algorithm to generate the initial guess of contamination source parameters via a case study the following conclusions are obtained 1 for bayesian parameter identification problems establishing a locally precise surrogate model over the posterior distribution of contamination source parameters to assist mcmc simulation is much more computationally efficient than the original model based mcmc simulation in terms of the computational efficiency significant acceleration can be achieved compared with the simulation model assisted method 2 the proposed two stage surrogate model based bayesian inversion approach can produce more accurate posterior parameter estimations than the one stage surrogate model based method the proposed adaptive update feedback process improves the accuracy of the surrogate model over the parameters posterior distributions further enhancing the parameter identification performance 3 adopting mofepso for generating an initial guess of the contamination source parameter boosts the efficiency of mcmc in this paper a synthetic case is designed according to the actual conditions to the extent possible however a certain gap remains between the real world problems and the synthetic case for real world problems more complex conditions should be considered such as noise in the actual observation data aquifer heterogeneity and complex boundary conditions therefore applying the proposed method and dimension reduction techniques to address complicated real world problems to verify and enrich the relevant conclusions and achievements of the inversion topic of groundwater contaminant sources will be pursued in our future research we also note the limitations of the kriging surrogate model although it replaces the simulation quite well when the contaminated source covers a large area with numerous unknown parameters the accuracy of the kriging model may decrease for high parameter dimension problems therefore more studies are required to compare the effectiveness of the different model emulating algorithms such as the polynomial chaos expansion and ensemble surrogate algorithms for high dimension problems and new surrogate algorithms particularly for highly parameterized inversion problems need to be created credit authorship contribution

4863,groundwater withdrawal has caused severe land subsidence in ningbo since 1964 the land subsidence rate slowed down by the prohibition of groundwater exploitation however water supply crisis prompted a new task of how to satisfy the emergency demands of water supply this study tries to provide insights into the prediction of groundwater level and land subsidence and formulate reasonable exploitation plans for emergency water supply in ningbo urban area a coupling model of groundwater and land subsidence was developed to quantify the subsidence caused by water withdrawal the proposed model is recognized for the period 1989 1992 and is verified for the period 1992 1993 using observed groundwater and land subsidence records in ningbo urban area based on the calibrated and evaluated model six reasonable exploitation plans for emergency water supply in ningbo urban area are formulated and the dynamic prediction of groundwater level and land subsidence changes in each plan are made numerical results show that the pore confined water in ningbo urban area has good supply conditions and strong water level recovery ability which can meet the demand of short term centralized water supply a longer time of emergency water supply and a lower controlling depth of water level leads to larger subsidence after the completion of water supply areas near exploited well may appear subsidence rebound due to the recovery of groundwater level but subsidence continues to increase in areas far away from the exploited well due to the delayed settlement of the lagging interbeds

beijing shi et al 2012 used a multiscale finite element method to simulate dynamic evolutions of groundwater level and the related land sinking or rebound in suzhou ningbo located in the south wing of the yangtze river delta is an important port city in china due to the overexploitation of groundwater the regional land subsidence occurred in the central urban area of ningbo since 1964 with the expansion of groundwater exploitation this area suffered from a severe ground settlement numerous efforts were devoted since 1986 to control groundwater drawdown and the land subsidence by the end of 2008 an overall ban on groundwater exploitation in ningbo was brought into operation and the subsidence rate slowed down with the gradual recovery of groundwater level on the other hand surface water has been increasingly polluted due to industrial domestic wastewater and agricultural runoff shi et al 2012 therefore groundwater is expected to use as an emergency water supply source in case of disaster most studies concerning subsidence issues regard regular groundwater exploitation while emergency water supply is usually characterized by high intensity exploitation for a limited time however the issue was never addressed from a modeling and forecasting perspective and an effective procedure to formulate reasonable exploitation plans and predict subsidence phenomenon linked to emergency water supply had not yet been reached how do changes in emergency water supply influence the groundwater level and land subsidence of ningbo and what kind of exploitation plan is more reasonable which can meet the land subsidence control this study tries to provide insights into the prediction of groundwater level and land subsidence and formulate reasonable exploitation plans for emergency water supply in ningbo the paper is arranged as follows section 2 presents an updated description of the geologic and hydrogeologic characteristics of the ningbo urban area the development of the hydrogeological model is demonstrated in section 3 then section 4 is devoted to present the coupling model of groundwater and land subsidence including its identification and verification with the available time series of data section 5 shows the simulation results of emergency water supply with different exploitation plans including prediction of emergency water supply capacity groundwater flow field the renewable capacity of groundwater and land subsidence the main conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 study area 2 1 geology and hydrogeology ningbo is located longitudes of 120 55 122 16 e and latitudes of 28 51 30 33 n in the northeastern part of the zhejiang province china seen in fig 1 the urban area of ningbo almost covers an area of 1000 km2 the study area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate mild and humid with an average annual temperature of approximately 16 c the rainfall is affected by tropical storms and is concentrated from may to september which accounts for 60 of the average annual precipitation of 1300 1400 mm zhao et al 2019 the drainage density of the study area is above 3 km km2 the river channel is generally distributed in a net like shape due to the gentle riverbed gradient and mainly includes a longitudinal channel from south to north and a transverse channel from west to east the surface of ningbo is characterized by a sequence of holocene to the middle pleistocene age the underlying succession of sediments consists of 23 strata including artificial fill silty clay gravels etc these strata are divided into 8 levels to build the hydrogeological model of the study area fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the hydrogeological units in the study area confined aquifer i is composed of upper pleistocene alluvial sand round gravel and sand confined aquifer ii is located in middle pleistocene alluvial fine sand fine sand medium fine sand gravel moderately coarse sand etc confined aquifer i with a roof at a depth of 22 7 60 1 m confined aquifer ii with a roof at a depth of 60 90 m 2 2 history of groundwater exploitation the migration of groundwater mainly depends on human activities the most important part of which is groundwater exploitation the groundwater exploitation in ningbo lasted until 2008 and the peak period was in 1980 1985 the maximum annual variation of the mining wells water level was 20 m in the 1980 s and less than 10 m after 2000 the water level showed obvious seasonal characteristics as shown in fig 3 which was relatively low in july september and high in january march according to the statistical data groundwater exploitation was concentrated in summer while some wells had artificial recharge in winter but the quantity was small in other words groundwater exploitation caused the decline of groundwater level in summer but the recovery rate of groundwater level in winter was also very fast even in the 1980 s the groundwater level was lower than 30 m in summer and was often higher than 10 m in winter the over exploitation of groundwater has led to a series of environmental geological problems such as land subsidence and groundwater salinization regional land subsidence in ningbo urban area occurs since 1964 from 1964 to 1985 groundwater was increasingly over exploited during this period the groundwater level decreased annually resulting in increasing subsidence the maximum subsidence rate was over 50 mm a in 1980 1985 to mitigate subsidence the local government imposed restrictions on groundwater exploitation although the restrictions had some positive effects on controlling subsidence the rate of land subsidence slows down cumulative settlement is still increasing in 2008 there was an outright ban on groundwater exploitation in ningbo after the ban on groundwater exploitation the groundwater level rose 10 m and the subsidence rate was controlled in 20 mm a 3 hydrogeological model in ningbo urban area the hydrogeological model in ningbo urban area is build based on the drilling data resistivity data and geological profile data the symmetrical quadrupole electrical sounding method is used for resistivity measurement with a total of 108 sounding points on 13 lines the inversion depth was calibrated using the results of the field work we conducted this calibration by comparing the interpreted lithology based on electrical resistivity data with the borehole data fig 4 shows inverted resistivity images and corresponding drill hole profiles for survey line ccd24 note that the points a b c and d in fig 4 mark the locations of formation interface the resistivity value decreased first and then increased gradually with the increase of depth for the surface layer approximately 0 5 m below ground surface the inverted resistivity was larger than that at deeper locations based on the lithology revealed by the boreholes data we conclude that the surface layer composed of silty clay which exhibited higher resistivity characteristics a relatively low resistivity range 3 50 ω m can be determined at the depth of 5 30 m where the formation was primarily of mucky silty clay silt and sand gravel as depth increased the formation resistivity increased largely and part formation lithology was bedrock generally the interpreted lithology based on electrical resistivity data matched well with the borehole data to describe the errors in resistivity data we calculated the differences between the results of the electrical resistivity tomography method and borehole method the percent bias pbias was used to describe the differences following the method of fang et al 2019 1 pbias i 1 n x i y i x i n 100 where yi is the value of the electrical resistivity tomography depth and xi is the depth obtained from the borehole method which provided the real values the calculated results illustrate that the difference in the results between the electrical resistivity tomography and field survey methods varies from 2 1 to 8 6 with an average pbias of 5 2 fig 5 illustrates the construction process of the 3d hydrogeological model the drilling data were collected from 268 boreholes the top and bottom elevations of each layer in the borehole were imported into the gms software the elevation at the bottom of the bedrock is uniformly set as 150 m the boundary coordinate data extracted from the geological information database is imported into gms to form the model boundary fig 5a according to the lithology of the imported borehole the links between adjacent boreholes are established and geological profiles are automatically interpolated then the virtual boreholes were developed and imported into the gms to improve the geological profiles by using the apparent resistivity data the measured geological profiles data were utilized to check and calibrate the generated profiles finally three dimensional entities are generated in the entire simulation region as shown in fig 5c 4 coupling model of groundwater and land subsidence in ningbo urban area 4 1 mathematical model 4 1 1 the 3d groundwater flow model the groundwater in the study area conforms to three dimensional unsteady flow the general expression of flow governing equation is shi et al 2008a bajni et al 2019 ochoa gonzález et al 2018 2 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t x y z ω t 0 h x y z t t 0 h 0 x y z x y z ω h x

sources or withdrawals of water ss is the specific storage of porous media ω is the flow domain of groundwater γ1 γ2 and γ3 are the first second and third class boundary of the seepage area as shown in fig 6 t is time n is the normal direction of the boundary hr is the hydraulic head at the third class boundary ζ is the resistance coefficient at the third class boundary h0 is the initial hydraulic head q is the flow function per unit area at the second class boundary kn is the permeability coefficient in the normal direction of boundary kxx kyy and kzz donate the permeability coefficient in x y and z direction respectively 4 1 2 soil deformation equation since the study area covers a wide range the deformation in the horizontal direction of the soil layer can be ignored compared with the deformation in the vertical direction based on the terzaghi theory the change of effective stress caused by the hydraulic head change in confined aquifer can be expressed as 3 d σ zz ρ w g d h where σ zz is the effective stress h is the hydraulic head the vertical compressibility factor is defined as 4 α 1 b db d σ zz where b is the initial thickness of the clay layer substituting eq 3 into eq 4 yields 5 ρ w g α b s sk b s k db dh where ssk is the skeletal component of specific storage and sk is the skeletal storage coefficient when the increment of effective stress is small eq 5 can be linearized into 6 δ b s k δ h s sk b δ h 7 s sk s ske σ zz σ zz max o r h h min s skv σ zz σ zz max o r h h min to account for large changes in skeletal specific storage when the effective stress exceeds the preconsolidation stress σ zz pre the following two parameters are often used 8 s sk s ske σ zz σ zz p r e s skv σ zz σ zz p r e where sske and sskv are the elastic and inelastic skeletal component of specific storage respectively for a certain point in the ground surface subsidence b caused by hydraulic head change can be calculated as 9 b i 1 n δ b i i 1 n s ki δ h i where n is the number of layers ski and δhi is the storage coefficient and hydraulic head change of the ith layer respectively soil deformation equation demonstrates that layer subsidence depends on the the initial thickness and skeletal specific storage of layer the larger the skeletal specific storage or layer thickness the higher the subsidence rate 4 1 3 coupling the compaction formulation was previously implemented in the modflow by leake and prudic 1991 and hoffmann et al 2003 to couple the compaction formulation the term on the right hand side of eq 2 should be multiplied by 1 γ where γ is defined as the ratio of compressible interbeds volume over the total aquifer system volume the storage of the compressible interbeds is represented by q added to the left hand side thus the coupled governing equation can be written as 10 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w q 1 γ s s h t where q γ s sk h t is flow per unit volume for the compressible interbeds s sk is the skeletal specific storage of interbeds two different simulation approaches no delay interbeds instantaneous compaction and delay interbeds considers the delay in the dissipation of the pressures were used to simulate the subsidence of thick and compressible interbeds and continuous aquitards through the subsidence and aquifer system compaction package sub package the delay τ can be expressed by 11 τ b 2 2 s skv k v where kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity based on the coupled governing equation 10 hydrogeologic properties such as hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient and so on of aquifer system have a significant influence on the modeled results specifically the higher the vertical hydraulic conductivity the faster the hydraulic head drops the hydraulic head change can lower the groundwater levels and increase subsidence rates 4 2 model conditions the mathematical model is solved by three dimensional finite difference program modflow and the land subsidence is solved by sub package rectangular grid elements were used in the model the computational domain is divided into 8 levels vertically 271 rows and 230 columns on the plane with a total of 498 640 units of which 223 720 are active units based on the measured data of the aquifer ⅰ and aquifer ⅱ from february 1989 kriging interpolation method is applied to obtain the initial hydraulic heads meanwhile february 1989 is taken as the initial moment for settlement calculation and the initial compaction value is set as 0 for the subsidence model the study area is a complete hydrogeological unit with relatively simple boundary conditions three kinds of boundaries were defined as shown in fig 6 the boundary of fixed water level located in the northeast of the study area is defined as the first class boundary the second class boundary is defined as zero flow boundary which mainly happens in the junction of mountain and plain other artificial boundaries are defined as the third class boundary the groundwater sources collected in the study area include four parts infiltration recharge by rainfall evaporation discharge river recharge and discharge and groundwater extraction and recharge infiltration recharge by rainfall qj can be calculated by 12 q j i α i p i a i where α is the rainfall infiltration coefficient p is the precipitation a is the area and the subscript i donates the ith subarea evaporation discharge can be calculated through aviyanov s empirical formula for the intensity of diving evaporation 13 q z i e 1 d i d 0 n a i d i d 0 where qz is the evaporation of phreatic water e is the surface evaporation strength d0 is the critical evaporation depth of phreatic water n is an empirical coefficient di and ai are the buried depth and area of the ith computing unit river recharge and discharge are also considered in the model yin river western fenghuaxi river eastern fenghua river xian river and shan river flowed into the research area and gathered in the mainstream of fenghua river according to the monitoring data of river water level and flow in each hydrological station of ningbo city the river program package in modflow groundwater software was used to simulate the recharge and discharge of the river in the study area 4 3 model calibration and verification observed groundwater level and subsidence records from february 1989 to february 1993 were used for model calibration and verification because the monitoring data of this period were abundant specifically observed data from 15 observation wells during the period of 1989 to 1992 were used as for model calibration and data from 9 observation wells during the period of 1992 to 1993 were selected for verification the numerical model was calibrated by the combination of automatic inversion and trial calculation the specific steps are as follows 1 the pest parameter inversion package in the modflow is used to invert and identify the hydrogeological parameters in the flow model according to the monitoring data of groundwater level 2 the hydrogeological parameters in the soil deformation model were adjusted according to the settlement calculation results and monitoring data 3 repeat the first two steps and adjust the hydrogeological parameters of the model repeatedly to get parameters that fit well with the real observed values fig 7 shows a fitting curve of the observed groundwater level a good agreement can be observed between the observed and calculated groundwater levels 4 4 model verification after obtaining optimal values for the hydrogeological parameters the calibrated model is used to calculate the groundwater level and subsidence in the period of february 1992 to february 1993 and compare them with the monitoring data fig 8 shows the comparison of model calculated results with monitoring data for groundwater level the figures clearly demonstrate that the calculated results are very consistent with the field monitoring results the absolute error between the calculated and observed groundwater level is less than 1 m fig 9 shows the comparison of model calculated results with monitoring data for the accumulated deformation of the subsidence center the figure illustrates that the calculated results of the aquitard 1 the aquitard 2 and the aquitard 4 have good agreement with the monitoring data for the aquifer ⅰ and ⅱ there is a certain deviation between the calculated and observed subsidence due to the small thickness and uneven distribution of the clay interbeds in general the calculated results show the same trend with the monitoring data the above analysis indicates that the built model is capable of predicting groundwater flow and land subsidence of the study area 5 simulation of emergency water supply in ningbo urban area 5 1 exploitation scenarios to avoid severe negative environmental effects induced by groundwater exploitation for emergency purposes the following principles are followed 1 control the groundwater level for sustainable groundwater uses the groundwater level should not be less than the lowest groundwater level in history controlling depth of 40 m and 25 m which represent the lowest groundwater level and average groundwater level in 1980 1985 are considered in this simulation 2 temporal exploitation control the groundwater can be considered as an emergency water source when the yields satisfy the premises that the groundwater levels rise gradually shi et al 2012 based on the two principles 6 scenarios with different execution times and controlling depth were designed as shown in table 1 table 2 listed the allowable groundwater exploitation for each scenario the allowable withdrawal in the aquifer ⅰ is larger than the aquifer ⅱ generally a scenario with short execution time and lower controlling depth has more allowable groundwater exploitation scenario 2 has the maximum allowable groundwater exploitation of 25 2 104 m3 d while scenario 5 has the minimum allowable groundwater exploitation of 9 4 104 m3 d 5 2 dynamic prediction of groundwater level and land subsidence 5 2 1 groundwater flow field the evolution of aquifer groundwater level is analyzed for scenarios 1 to 6 successively with the main results being exemplified by scenario 6 fig 10 and fig 11 shows the groundwater flow field change of the aquifer i and aquifer ⅱ under groundwater exploitation of scenario 6 groundwater level of aquifer decreases gradually with exploitation forming a groundwater depression cone centered on emergency exploitation well at the beginning of emergency supply these groundwater depression cones are independent with each other after 3 months of groundwater exploitation groundwater depression cones induced by exploitation well 76 and well 48 of the aquifer ⅱ are connected after 4 months of groundwater exploitation groundwater depression cones induced by exploitation well wi 1 and well g96 of the aquifer ⅰ are connected as groundwater exploitation moves on groundwater level of exploitation well gradually approaches the controlling depth of water level meanwhile these groundwater depression cones link up into a single stretch fig 12 shows the areas of groundwater depression cones when the groundwater level is below 25 m the area growth of scenario 2 is the fastest compared to other scenarios because of the short exploitation time and strong exploitation intensity in the aquifer i areas of groundwater depression cones induced by exploitation scenario 2 scenario 4 and scenario 6 are 6 18 km2 14 7 km2 and 28 6 km2 respectively areas of groundwater depression cones in the aquifer ii are much larger than that of the aquifer i which are 23 75 km2 35 9 km2 and 44 5 km2 respectively this can be explained by the two facts that 1 the aquifer i has a wider distribution and larger thickness than the aquifer ii 2 the aquifer i is above the aquifer ii thus receiving more groundwater recharge 5 2 2 renewable capacity of groundwater figs 13 and 14 show the evolution of groundwater level with time in the aquifer i and the aquifer ii respectively during the period of emergency water supply groundwater level decreases sharply when the groundwater exploitation ceases groundwater level shows a rapid growth first and then increases at a much slower speed after 6 months of ceasing exploitation groundwater level of well g96 in aquifer i restored from 25 m to more than 13 m for scenario 1 3 and 5 and restored from 40 m to more than 16 m for scenario 2 4 and 6 table 3 shows the time required for groundwater level recovering to 10 8 and 5 m after exploitation as shown in the table scenario 1 required the minimum time 8 months for groundwater level recovering to 5m and scenario 6 required the maximum time 19 5 years to recover these predicted results indicate that the confined water in ningbo city has good replenishment conditions and a strong renewable capacity of groundwater 5 2 3 land subsidence table 4 shows the subsidence area and the maximum subsidence at the end of emergency water supply the land subsidence depends on exploitation time controlling depth of groundwater level the longer the exploitation time or the lower the controlling depth the lager the subsidence area and the maximum subsidence are in cases of scenario 1 and scenario 5 with the same controlling depth but different exploitation time the subsidence area and the maximum subsidence of scenario 1 are 0 19 km2 and 14 76 mm which are much smaller than the values of scenario 5 68 41 km2 for subsidence area and 45 76 mm for the maximum subsidence in cases of scenario 3 and scenario 4 with the same exploitation time but different controlling depth the values of subsidence area and the maximum subsidence of scenario 4 are much larger than the values of scenario 3 fig 15 shows the contour map of land subsidence with the main results being exemplified by scenario 3 with the groundwater exploitation pore pressure decreases the effective stress between soil particles increases resulting in soil deformation subsidence occurs first at the center of groundwater depression cones which develops gradually into a settlement trough spatial characteristics and temporal evolution of settlement trough are consistent with the groundwater depression cones both the center of groundwater depression cone and settlement trough are located in jiangdong hefeng located at the middle of ningbo urban area and the shape and extension of settlement trough are basically the same as that of groundwater depression cone after 3 months of groundwater exploitation settlement troughs in areas with high concentrations of exploited well connected with each other when the groundwater exploitation ceases subsidence area continues to increase after 10 years of ceasing exploitation land subsidence tends to stabilize the maximum subsidence occurs in well g208 with a value of 29 23 mm due to the high pre consolidation water level note that after ceasing exploitation subsidence rebound happens in areas near the exploited well while subsidence continues to increase in areas far away from the exploited well as shown in fig 15c and 15d a reasonable explanation is that deformation induced by groundwater level recovery is larger than the delayed settlement of interbeds but in areas far away from the exploited well groundwater level recovery is relatively week therefore subsidence continues to increase in these areas 6 conclusions this paper on the basis of fully understanding the geological and hydrogeological conditions of the ningbo area analyzes and summarizes the main characteristics and interrelations of groundwater level and land subsidence under emergency water supply the main conclusions are as follows 1 the development of land subsidence in the study area corresponds to the exploitation of groundwater in time and space both the center of groundwater depression cone and settlement trough are located in jiangdong hefeng and the shape and extension of settlement trough are basically the same as that of groundwater depression cone 2 a coupling model of groundwater flow and compaction in the study area is established the model considers the elastic and inelastic deformation of the soil layer and the lag phenomenon of drainage and compression the hydrogeological parameters of the model are calibrated and verified by the observation data of groundwater level and the monitoring data of the land subsidence center the results show that the groundwater level and land subsidence are well fitted which proves the reliability of the numerical model and can better reflect the changes of groundwater level and land subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation in the study area 3 based on the coupled model six reasonable exploitation plans for emergency water supply in ningbo urban area are formulated the pore confined water in ningbo urban area has good supply conditions and strong groundwater level recovery ability which can meet the demand of short term centralized water supply the shorter the exploitation time and the lower the controlling groundwater level depth the more allowable groundwater exploitation meanwhile a longer time of emergency water supply and a lower controlling depth of water level leads to larger subsidence after the completion of water supply the surface deformation in the study area is affected by the elastic rebound caused by the recovery of groundwater level and the delayed settlement of the lagging interbeds the area near the mining well appears the subsidence rebound while the area far away from the exploited well continues to increase the subsidence credit authorship contribution statement yu zhao writing original draft chaolin wang

4863,groundwater withdrawal has caused severe land subsidence in ningbo since 1964 the land subsidence rate slowed down by the prohibition of groundwater exploitation however water supply crisis prompted a new task of how to satisfy the emergency demands of water supply this study tries to provide insights into the prediction of groundwater level and land subsidence and formulate reasonable exploitation plans for emergency water supply in ningbo urban area a coupling model of groundwater and land subsidence was developed to quantify the subsidence caused by water withdrawal the proposed model is recognized for the period 1989 1992 and is verified for the period 1992 1993 using observed groundwater and land subsidence records in ningbo urban area based on the calibrated and evaluated model six reasonable exploitation plans for emergency water supply in ningbo urban area are formulated and the dynamic prediction of groundwater level and land subsidence changes in each plan are made numerical results show that the pore confined water in ningbo urban area has good supply conditions and strong water level recovery ability which can meet the demand of short term centralized water supply a longer time of emergency water supply and a lower controlling depth of water level leads to larger subsidence after the completion of water supply areas near exploited well may appear subsidence rebound due to the recovery of groundwater level but subsidence continues to increase in areas far away from the exploited well due to the delayed settlement of the lagging interbeds

groundwater exploitation the groundwater exploitation in ningbo lasted until 2008 and the peak period was in 1980 1985 the maximum annual variation of the mining wells water level was 20 m in the 1980 s and less than 10 m after 2000 the water level showed obvious seasonal characteristics as shown in fig 3 which was relatively low in july september and high in january march according to the statistical data groundwater exploitation was concentrated in summer while some wells had artificial recharge in winter but the quantity was small in other words groundwater exploitation caused the decline of groundwater level in summer but the recovery rate of groundwater level in winter was also very fast even in the 1980 s the groundwater level was lower than 30 m in summer and was often higher than 10 m in winter the over exploitation of groundwater has led to a series of environmental geological problems such as land subsidence and groundwater salinization regional land subsidence

interface the resistivity value decreased first and then increased gradually with the increase of depth for the surface layer approximately 0 5 m below ground surface the inverted resistivity was larger than that at deeper locations based on the lithology revealed by the boreholes data we conclude that the surface layer composed of silty clay which exhibited higher resistivity characteristics

resistivity increased largely and part formation lithology was bedrock generally the interpreted lithology based on electrical resistivity data matched well with the borehole data to describe the errors in resistivity data we calculated the differences between the results of the electrical resistivity tomography method and borehole method the percent bias pbias was used to describe the differences following the method of fang et al 2019 1 pbias i 1 n x i y i x i n 100 where yi is the value of the electrical resistivity tomography depth and xi is the depth obtained from the borehole method which provided the real values the calculated results illustrate that the difference in the results between the electrical resistivity tomography and field survey methods varies from 2 1 to 8 6 with an average pbias of 5 2 fig 5 illustrates the construction process of the 3d hydrogeological model the drilling data were collected from 268 boreholes the top and bottom elevations of each layer in the borehole were imported into the gms software the elevation at the bottom of the bedrock is uniformly set as 150 m the boundary coordinate data extracted from the geological information database is imported into gms to form the model boundary fig 5a according to the lithology of the imported borehole the links between adjacent boreholes are established and geological profiles are automatically interpolated then the virtual boreholes were developed and imported into the gms to improve the geological profiles by using the apparent resistivity data the measured geological profiles data were utilized to check and calibrate the generated profiles finally three dimensional entities are generated in the entire simulation region as shown in fig 5c 4 coupling model of groundwater and land subsidence in ningbo urban area 4 1 mathematical model 4 1 1 the 3d groundwater flow model the groundwater in the study area conforms to three dimensional unsteady flow the general expression of flow governing equation is shi et al 2008a bajni et al 2019 ochoa gonzález et al 2018 2 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t x y z ω t 0 h x y z t t 0 h 0 x y z x y z ω h x

sources or withdrawals of water ss is the specific storage of porous media ω is the flow domain of groundwater γ1 γ2 and γ3 are the first second and third class boundary of the seepage area as shown in fig 6 t is time n is the normal direction of the boundary hr is the hydraulic head at the third class boundary ζ is the resistance coefficient at the third class boundary h0 is the initial hydraulic head q is the flow function per unit area at the second class boundary kn is the permeability coefficient in the normal direction of boundary kxx kyy and kzz donate the permeability coefficient in x y and z direction respectively 4 1 2 soil deformation equation since the study area covers a wide range the deformation in the horizontal direction of the soil layer can be ignored compared with the deformation in the vertical direction based on the terzaghi theory the change of effective stress caused by the hydraulic head change in confined aquifer can be expressed as 3 d σ zz ρ w g d h where σ zz is the effective stress h is the hydraulic head the vertical compressibility factor is defined as 4 α 1 b db d σ zz where b is the initial thickness of the clay layer substituting eq 3 into eq 4 yields 5 ρ w g α b s sk b s k db dh where ssk is the skeletal component of specific storage and sk is the skeletal storage coefficient when the increment of effective stress is small eq 5 can be linearized into 6 δ b s k δ h s sk b δ h 7 s sk s ske σ zz σ zz max o r h h min s skv σ zz σ zz max o r h h min to account for large changes in skeletal specific storage when the effective stress exceeds the preconsolidation stress σ zz pre the following two parameters are often used 8 s sk s ske σ zz σ zz p r e s skv σ zz σ zz p r e where sske and sskv are the elastic and inelastic skeletal component of specific storage respectively for a certain point in the ground surface subsidence b caused by hydraulic head change can be calculated as 9 b i 1 n δ b i i 1 n s ki δ h i where n is the number of layers ski and δhi is the storage coefficient and hydraulic head change of the ith layer respectively soil deformation equation demonstrates that layer subsidence depends on the the initial thickness and skeletal specific storage of layer the larger the skeletal specific storage or layer thickness the higher the subsidence rate 4 1 3 coupling the compaction formulation was previously implemented in the modflow by leake and prudic 1991 and hoffmann et al 2003 to couple the compaction formulation the term on the right hand side of eq 2 should be multiplied by 1 γ where γ is defined as the ratio of compressible interbeds volume over the total aquifer system volume the storage of the compressible interbeds is represented by q added to the left hand side thus the coupled governing equation can be written as 10 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w q 1 γ s s h t where q γ s sk h t is flow per unit volume for the compressible interbeds s sk is the skeletal specific storage of interbeds two different simulation approaches no delay interbeds instantaneous compaction and delay interbeds considers the delay in the dissipation of the pressures were used to simulate the subsidence of thick and compressible interbeds and continuous aquitards through the subsidence and aquifer system compaction package sub package the delay τ can be expressed by 11 τ b 2 2 s skv k v where kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity based on the coupled governing equation 10 hydrogeologic properties such as hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient and so on of aquifer system have a significant influence on the modeled results specifically the higher the vertical hydraulic conductivity the faster the hydraulic head drops the hydraulic head change can lower the groundwater levels and increase subsidence rates 4 2 model conditions the mathematical model is solved by three dimensional finite difference program modflow and the land subsidence is solved by sub package rectangular grid elements were used in the model the computational domain is divided into 8 levels vertically 271 rows and 230 columns on the plane with a total of 498 640 units of which 223 720 are active units based on the measured data of the aquifer ⅰ and aquifer ⅱ from february 1989 kriging interpolation method is applied to obtain the initial hydraulic heads meanwhile february 1989 is taken as the initial moment for settlement calculation and the initial compaction value is set as 0 for the subsidence model the study area is a complete hydrogeological unit with relatively simple boundary conditions three kinds of boundaries were defined as shown in fig 6 the boundary of fixed water level located in the northeast of the study area is defined as the first class boundary the second class boundary is defined as zero flow boundary which mainly happens in the junction of mountain and plain other artificial boundaries are defined as the third class boundary the groundwater sources collected in the study area include four parts infiltration recharge by rainfall evaporation discharge river recharge and discharge and groundwater extraction and recharge infiltration recharge by rainfall qj can be calculated by 12 q j i α i p i a i where α is the rainfall infiltration coefficient p is the precipitation a is the area and the subscript i donates the ith subarea evaporation discharge can be calculated through aviyanov s empirical formula for the intensity of diving evaporation 13 q z i e 1 d i d 0 n a i d i d 0 where qz is the evaporation of phreatic water e is the surface evaporation strength d0 is the critical evaporation depth of phreatic water n is an empirical coefficient di and ai are the buried depth and area of the ith computing unit river recharge and discharge are also considered in the model yin river western fenghuaxi river eastern fenghua river xian river and shan river flowed into the research area and gathered in the mainstream of fenghua river according to the monitoring data of river water level and flow in each hydrological station of ningbo city the river program package in modflow groundwater software was used to simulate the recharge and discharge of the river in the study area 4 3 model calibration and verification observed groundwater level and subsidence records from february 1989 to february 1993 were used for model calibration and verification because the monitoring data of this period were abundant specifically observed data from 15 observation wells during the period of 1989 to 1992 were used as for model calibration and data from 9 observation wells during the period of 1992 to 1993 were selected for verification the numerical model was calibrated by the combination of automatic inversion and trial calculation the specific steps are as follows 1 the pest parameter inversion package in the modflow is used to invert and identify the hydrogeological parameters in the flow model according to the monitoring data of groundwater level 2 the hydrogeological parameters in the soil deformation model were adjusted according to the settlement calculation results and monitoring data 3 repeat the first two steps and adjust the hydrogeological parameters of the model repeatedly to get parameters that fit well with the real observed values fig 7 shows a fitting curve of the observed groundwater level a good agreement can be observed between the observed and calculated groundwater levels 4 4 model verification after obtaining optimal values for the hydrogeological parameters the calibrated model is used to calculate the groundwater level and subsidence in the period of february 1992 to february 1993 and compare them with the monitoring data fig 8 shows the comparison of model calculated results with monitoring data for groundwater level the figures clearly demonstrate that the calculated results are very consistent with the field monitoring results the absolute error between the calculated and observed groundwater level is less than 1 m fig 9 shows the comparison of model calculated results with monitoring data for the accumulated deformation of the subsidence center the figure illustrates that the calculated results of the aquitard 1 the aquitard 2 and the aquitard 4 have good agreement with the monitoring data for the aquifer ⅰ and ⅱ there is a certain deviation between the calculated and observed subsidence due to the small thickness and uneven distribution of the clay interbeds in general the calculated results show the same trend with the monitoring data the above analysis indicates that the built model is capable of predicting groundwater flow and land subsidence of the study area 5 simulation of emergency water supply in ningbo urban area 5 1 exploitation scenarios to avoid severe negative environmental effects induced by groundwater exploitation for emergency purposes the following principles are followed 1 control the groundwater level for sustainable groundwater uses the groundwater level should not be less than the lowest groundwater level in history controlling depth of 40 m and 25 m which represent the lowest groundwater level and average groundwater level in 1980 1985 are considered in this simulation 2 temporal exploitation control the groundwater can be considered as an emergency water source when the yields satisfy the premises that the groundwater levels rise gradually shi et al 2012 based on the two principles 6 scenarios with different execution times and controlling depth were designed as shown in table 1 table 2 listed the allowable groundwater exploitation for each scenario the allowable withdrawal in the aquifer ⅰ is larger than the aquifer ⅱ generally a scenario with short execution time and lower controlling depth has more allowable groundwater exploitation scenario 2 has the maximum allowable groundwater exploitation of 25 2 104 m3 d while scenario 5 has the minimum allowable groundwater exploitation of 9 4 104 m3 d 5 2 dynamic prediction of groundwater level and land subsidence 5 2 1 groundwater flow field the evolution of aquifer groundwater level is analyzed for scenarios 1 to 6 successively with the main results being exemplified by scenario 6 fig 10 and fig 11 shows the groundwater flow field change of the aquifer i and aquifer ⅱ under groundwater exploitation of scenario 6 groundwater level of aquifer decreases gradually with exploitation forming a groundwater depression cone centered on emergency exploitation well at the beginning of emergency supply these groundwater depression cones are independent with each other after 3 months of groundwater exploitation groundwater depression cones induced by exploitation well 76 and well 48 of the aquifer ⅱ are connected after 4 months of groundwater exploitation groundwater depression cones induced by exploitation well wi 1 and well g96 of the aquifer ⅰ are connected as groundwater exploitation moves on groundwater level of exploitation well gradually approaches the controlling depth of water level meanwhile these groundwater depression cones link up into a single stretch fig 12 shows the areas of groundwater depression cones when the groundwater level is below 25 m the area growth of scenario 2 is the fastest compared to other scenarios because of the short exploitation time and strong exploitation intensity in the aquifer i areas of groundwater depression cones induced by exploitation scenario 2 scenario 4 and scenario 6 are 6 18 km2 14 7 km2 and 28 6 km2 respectively areas of groundwater depression cones in the aquifer ii are much larger than that of the aquifer i which are 23 75 km2 35 9 km2 and 44 5 km2 respectively this can be explained by the two facts that 1 the aquifer i has a wider distribution and larger thickness than the aquifer ii 2 the aquifer i is above the aquifer ii thus receiving more groundwater recharge 5 2 2 renewable capacity of groundwater figs 13 and 14 show the evolution of groundwater level with time in the aquifer i and the aquifer ii respectively during the period of emergency water supply groundwater level decreases sharply when the groundwater exploitation ceases groundwater level shows a rapid growth first and then increases at a much slower speed after 6 months of ceasing exploitation groundwater level of well g96 in aquifer i restored from 25 m to more than 13 m for scenario 1 3 and 5 and restored from 40 m to more than 16 m for scenario 2 4 and 6 table 3 shows the time required for groundwater level recovering to 10 8 and 5 m after exploitation as shown in the table scenario 1 required the minimum time 8 months for groundwater level recovering to 5m and scenario 6 required the maximum time 19 5 years to recover these predicted results indicate that the confined water in ningbo city has good replenishment conditions and a strong renewable capacity of groundwater 5 2 3 land subsidence table 4 shows the subsidence area and the maximum subsidence at the end of emergency water supply the land subsidence depends on exploitation time controlling depth of groundwater level the longer the exploitation time or the lower the controlling depth the lager the subsidence area and the maximum subsidence are in cases of scenario 1 and scenario 5 with the same controlling depth but different exploitation time the subsidence area and the maximum subsidence of scenario 1 are 0 19 km2 and 14 76 mm which are much smaller than the values of scenario 5 68 41 km2 for subsidence area and 45 76 mm for the maximum subsidence in cases of scenario 3 and scenario 4 with the same exploitation time but different controlling depth the values of subsidence area and the maximum subsidence of scenario 4 are much larger than the values of scenario 3 fig 15 shows the contour map of land subsidence with the main results being exemplified by scenario 3 with the groundwater exploitation pore pressure decreases the effective stress between soil particles increases resulting in soil deformation subsidence occurs first at the center of groundwater depression cones which develops gradually into a settlement trough spatial characteristics and temporal evolution of settlement trough are consistent with the groundwater depression cones both the center of groundwater depression cone and settlement trough are located in jiangdong hefeng located at the middle of ningbo urban area and the shape and extension of settlement trough are basically the same as that of groundwater depression cone after 3 months of groundwater exploitation settlement troughs in areas with high concentrations of exploited well connected with each other when the groundwater exploitation ceases subsidence area continues to increase after 10 years of ceasing exploitation land subsidence tends to stabilize the maximum subsidence occurs in well g208 with a value of 29 23 mm due to the high pre consolidation water level note that after ceasing exploitation subsidence rebound happens in areas near the exploited well while subsidence continues to increase in areas far away from the exploited well as shown in fig 15c and 15d a reasonable explanation is that deformation induced by groundwater level recovery is larger than the delayed settlement of interbeds but in areas far away from the exploited well groundwater level recovery is relatively week therefore subsidence continues to increase in these areas 6 conclusions this paper on the basis of fully understanding the geological and hydrogeological conditions of the ningbo area analyzes and summarizes the main characteristics and interrelations of groundwater level and land subsidence under emergency water supply the main conclusions are as follows 1 the development of land subsidence in the study area corresponds to the exploitation of groundwater in time and space both the center of groundwater depression cone and settlement trough are located in jiangdong hefeng and the shape and extension of settlement trough are basically the same as that of groundwater depression cone 2 a coupling model of groundwater flow and compaction in the study area is established the model considers the elastic and inelastic deformation of the soil layer and the lag phenomenon of drainage and compression the hydrogeological parameters of the model are calibrated and verified by the observation data of groundwater level and the monitoring data of the land subsidence center the results show that the groundwater level and land subsidence are well fitted which proves the reliability of the numerical model and can better reflect the changes of groundwater level and land subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation in the study area 3 based on the coupled model six reasonable exploitation plans for emergency water supply in ningbo urban area are formulated the pore confined water in ningbo urban area has good supply conditions and strong groundwater level recovery ability which can meet the demand of short term centralized water supply the shorter the exploitation time and the lower the controlling groundwater level depth the more allowable groundwater exploitation meanwhile a longer time of emergency water supply and a lower controlling depth of water level leads to larger subsidence after the completion of water supply the surface deformation in the study area is affected by the elastic rebound caused by the recovery of groundwater level and the delayed settlement of the lagging interbeds the area near the mining well appears the subsidence rebound while the area far away from the exploited well continues to increase the subsidence credit authorship contribution statement yu zhao writing original draft chaolin wang

4864,drought is one of the major hazards that could have a significant impact on agriculture in this study two drought indices at high spatial resolution soil water deficit index swdi and soil moisture deficit index smdi were derived by 1 km downscaled soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture sm global land data assimilation system gldas long term sm and soil attribute products and used to analyze the drought conditions in australia in 2015 2019 the swdi was calculated from smap sm estimates and sm at field capacity wilting point derived from soil attribute data while the smdi was calculated by integrating gldas and smap sm using a temporally incremental based method we found that in the eastern and western coastal regions the droughts occurred during spring and summer and were relieved in fall and winter the temporal change pattern of drought conditions for the northern coastal regions was opposite of the eastern western coasts on the other hand the inland regions always had more severe drought conditions additionally the validation results for the 1 km smap sm using international soil moisture network ismn in situ data showed reliable accuracy and the root mean square deviation rmsd ranged from 0 02 to 0 09 m3 m3 both swdi and smdi showed clear seasonal and interannual variability and the drought conditions worsened in 2017 2019 from the 1 km swdi smdi maps in the murray darling river basin terrain and streamflow were found to be two deterministic factors for the drought conditions keywords drought index soil moisture smap gldas ismn 1 introduction sm properties can be used to derive indices that help quantify agricultural droughts which have significant social and economic impacts as they directly affect agricultural success determining drought dynamics quickly can aid in management decisions and reduce their negative impacts sheffield et al 2004 however it is often difficult to quantify droughts so indices are often used to identify the main attributes that define an agricultural drought event martínez fernández et al 2016 yang et al 2018 mishra et al 2017 developed swdi and it was generated using smap sm and soil information regarding field capacity and water content in order to improve agricultural drought monitoring they used the swdi to quantify agricultural drought based on the surface sm in the top 5 cm of soil the swdi was found to be a good agricultural drought indicator as it was able to capture information content similar to the in situ atmospheric water deficit awd index when the two indices were compared over the contiguous united states conus martínez fernández et al 2016 used the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos satellite data to derive swdi in an area of spain with an ample in situ network for validation this study also found that swdi was able to adequately identify drought conditions compared to ground observations and was agreeable against awd narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 used the hydrological model soil water assessment tool swat to simulate sm from daily weather data these weekly sm estimates at 16 km2 were used to create the drought index smdi the smdi were highly correlated with crop yields having correlation coefficient r greater than 0 75 during critical growth stages additionally the smdi calculated in the top 60 cm was found to have the lowest auto correlation lag due to its ability to participate in evapotranspiration the results of mishra et al 2017 martínez fernández et al 2016 and narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 indicated that swdi and smdi could be useful for identifying and monitoring drought affecting agriculture due to its extreme climate australia has experienced floods and droughts in past years which have had devastating effects on river health and agricultural practices rahmati et al 2020 described australia as the driest inhabited continent on earth southeast australia experienced what is considered the worst drought on record for the region from 2001 to 2009 this event which is referred as the millennium drought caused devastation to ecosystems economy and society van dijk et al 2013 in the period from 2018 to 2019 australia experienced another severe drought that caused large deficits in agricultural farmers profits hughes et al 2019 with the impending effects of climate change future droughts could be as severe or worse than the millennium drought and thus warrant better management which begins with a better understanding of drought conditions in the region previous studies showed that major drought events in australia were mainly driven by different kinds of particular climatic processes which can be described as the irregular variations between winds and sea surface temperatures abbot 2019 nicholls 2010 kiem and verdon kidd 2010 moreover it is reported that the regional climate changes might contribute to the recent droughts cai et al 2014 cook et al 2016 climate change has been linked to higher temperatures across australia and lower winter rainfall trends in the past 20 years which has led to increased periods of drought and negative effects on farm profitability hughes et al 2019 the study presented here assesses agricultural drought indices in australia due to the great risk of droughts and the even greater impact of droughts on agriculture in this region a systematic assessment of river health named the sustainable rivers audit was performed on the murray darling river basin mdb and classified it as a dryland river system with a high evaporation and low runoff rate accounting for 94 and 4 of precipitation respectively davies et al 2010 this assessment also found that many low lying regions of major rivers were in poor condition due to drought conditions the mdb is responsible for almost 40 of the income derived from agricultural production in australia and its 23 river valleys cover 14 of the total area of australia which is over 1 million km2 davies et al 2010 crabb 1997 the uncertainty and changes in australia s climate which directly affect agriculture warrant further assessment of drought events in this region this study and similar studies provide a deeper understanding of past drought dynamics and can be used for better management of future droughts in australia sm is directly affected by short term precipitation and provides a good measure of drought conditions when consistent sm data is available for analyses sheffield et al 2004 a study by rahmati et al 2020 compared a stand alone adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis to several hybrid models with machine learning to predict areas that were expected to experience drought in queensland australia using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and root mean square error for validation they found that the hybridized models performed well but lacked continuous sm data in recent years there have been several satellite missions with the goal of capturing global sm estimates which can be beneficial for analyses of areas lacking or with limited in situ sm data lakshmi 2013 kim et al 2020 dandridge et al 2020 however the smap mission is one of the most recent satellite operations and despite its early radar failure is able to capture global maps of sm every 3 days at 9 km using the functioning radiometer wigneron et al 2017 the original smap sm product has been well validated velpuri et al 2015 validated smap estimates with in situ sm in the high plains region of usa and found the highest correlation with surface sm between 0 and 5 cm additionally pan et al 2016 found that smap l3 compared very well to in situ sm observations over conus and smap performed better than land surface modeled sm current and past studies have shown the use of new satellite sensors such as cyclone global navigation satellite system cygnss provides higher temporal repeat soil moisture kim and lakshmi 2018 launched in 2009 smos is able to provide global sm maps every 3 days at 50 km spatial resolution kerr et al 2001 grace is used in conjunction with hydrological modeling for estimation of evapotranspiration billah et al 2015 lakshmi 2016 lakshmi et al 2018 use of multi sensor satellite data to estimate vegetation properties hong et al 2007 or downscaling passive microwave derived soil moisture using active radar narayan and lakshmi 2008 vegetation and surface temperature fang et al 2013 2018a 2018b 2019 2020 precipitation is the most important hydrological variable to determine drought conditions historically precipitation based indices have been used to identify droughts in different parts of the world jiang et al 2020 lai et al 2019 the precipitation only based indices like standard precipitation index spi can accurately capture the meteorological and hydrological droughts over a region but they lack the ability to meticulously manifest agricultural droughts due to its limitation of excluding the compound effects of temperature on potential evapotranspiration tirivarombo et al 2018 while the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei can account for it the spatial resolution of precipitation becomes a limiting factor to study these indices in a local region although precipitation and sm are closely correlated the precipitation based drought indices cannot be directly translated to quantify agricultural droughts the gldas 2 noah model data is generated from a climatologically consistent atmospheric forcing dataset so it can provide reliable long term sm for drought related studies spennemann et al 2015 for example in spennemann et al 2015 the gldas sm was used to study sm anomalies in southern south america they found that there was a significant relationship between sm and precipitation and sm coincided with the geographical distribution of precipitation there was a lagged correlation between sm and precipitation anomalies with sm leading additionally gldas sm was used to calculate terrestrial water storage tws in order to analyze monthly changes in tws in iran moghim 2020 they found that sm has been decreasing in iran since 2002 which could be influenced by climate change and that the spatial pattern of negative changes in tws closely followed sm patterns in yang et al 2018 gldas sm was used to derive smdi which they renamed as soil moisture availability index smai at four different soil layers to study drought conditions in north china yang et al 2018 the smai was used to estimate drought conditions and successfully detected several significant drought events from 2001 to 2015 that were validated with observational data the research presented here focuses on the remote sensing aspect of water scarcity assessment since droughts can adversely affect the water security of a nation it is very important to have pre hand information about the prevailing drought conditions in a region this information includes the analyses of various sources of contributions and impacts on droughts in both time and space scales van dijk et al 2013 especially the analyses at catchment watershed scales bond et al 2008 this information can be used to predict monitor and assess drought events as well as properly allocate and manage water resources in these drought prone regions white et al 1993 due to the low spatial coverage of in situ measurements it is still a challenging issue to assess hydrological conditions over a watershed scale with high temporal frequency west et al 2019 this study focuses on applying the latest approaches of calculating drought condition indices swdi smdi which require only a few input parameters sm estimates from smap gldas and soil attributes it makes use of the 1 km downscaled smap sm product derived from fang and lakshmi 2014 to creatively generate the high spatial resolution drought condition index products in australia the main objective of this study is to take advantage of the high resolution drought indices swdi smdi derived from the downscaled smap sm at 1 km to evaluate the drought conditions as well as to study the relationships between sm data sets smap gldas and in situ in australia the major advantages of using the downscaled smap sm to calculate swdi smdi are that it can provide more spatial temporal information of drought conditions in detail especially at watershed station scales as well as can help to study the influence of other geophysical factors e g terrain streamflow on drought conditions the following contents of the paper consist of 1 an introduction of all the input and validation data sets 2 the methodology for calculating the two drought indices swdi smdi 3 results and discussion for interpreting and analyzing the swdi smdi estimates at both national scale and watershed scale mdb as well as the comparisons between swdi smdi smap sm ismn sm and global precipitation measurement gpm precipitation 4 conclusions for summarizing works and new findings of this paper 2 data 2 1 smap smap is an observatory launched in 2015 by national aeronautics and space administration nasa to measure the sm content in the top 5 cm of the soil layer it can measure the sm content at places where vegetation water content is less than 5 kg m2 the standard version of smap sm products provides data at a 36 km spatial resolution while the enhanced product is given at 9 km chan et al 2018 2016 the enhanced product uses the backus gilbert optimal interpolation techniques to extract information from smap s antenna temperature and convert them to brightness temperatures many studies made use of the smap sm dataset to study the water cycle as well as the carbon cycle apart from it weather and climate studies also used smap data to study evaporation from the land surface as well as the health of vegetation colliander et al 2017 wigneron et al 2017 in this study the 1 km smap sm used for calculating swdi smdi were derived from the enhanced level 2 half orbit 9 km radiometer sm produced by national snow and ice data center nsidc the sm downscaling algorithm is based on the thermal inertia theory that the surface sm is negatively related to change in surface temperature during the corresponding time period fang and lakshmi 2014 the algorithm was implemented by using gldas advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis to derive the downscaled smap sm at 1 km resolution of 1 30 a m p m overpasses separately from the research on validating the downscaled smap sm product by using ismn in situ sm from 100 stations within conus fang et al 2020 it is known that the average r2 is 0 541 and unbiased rmse is 0 02 m3 m3 which indicates good accuracy 2 2 gldas gldas is an assimilation model which

provided by the department of soil and landscape grid of australia website https data csiro au there are three sets of products provided including national soil attributes three dimensional 3d soil attributes and regional data the datasets were generated using soil attribute data from field measurements from the national soil site data collection as well as estimates from the commonwealth

attributes were estimated at 6 depth intervals from 0 to 200 cm at 3 arc seconds 90 m spatial resolution in this study we used three modeled soil attributes from the database including sand clay and organic carbon unit from the topsoil layer 0 5 cm to be consistent with the sensing depth of smap sm estimates 2 4 gpm gpm provides global observations of rainfall and snow using a network of

the forecasting capabilities of disasters like floods and droughts sharifi et al 2016 tang et al 2016 2 5 ismn the ismn provides in situ sm measurements from 1400 stations and 35 international sm networks which are available from 1952 to present there have been many studies on validating the ismn data from different sm networks dorigo et al 2011 2013 gruber et al 2013 in this study in situ sm measurements of 0 5 cm topsoil layer from 19 stations between 2015 and 2018 from australia s oznet hydrological monitoring network were downloaded from the ismn website https ismn geo tuwien ac at these stations are all located in the mdb southeastern australia and they can be subdivided into two zones based on their coordinates additionally the coordinates of the other 5 five sm stations were also used to study swdi smdi change trends at different climate zones in australia the locations of the sm stations are shown in fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 swdi the swdi is used to monitor drought conditions by measuring the sm deficit and is related to sm estimates and associated soil properties martínez fernández et al 2015 mishra et al 2017 the swdi is important for monitoring and quantifying drought events in this study we only considered extracting the swdi at the top soil layer from 0 to 5 cm by making use of 1 km downscaled smap sm as well as soil attribute products in australia the swdi is calculated by eq 1 1 swdi θ θ fc θ awc 10 where θ θ fc and θ awc are sm estimates sm at field capacity and sm at available water capacity respectively the θ awc can be calculated by the difference between sm at field capacity θ fc and sm at wilting point θ wp as 2 θ awc θ fc θ wp the positive swdi indicates that the sm is higher than the field capacity while the negative swdi indicates drought conditions the swdi can be classified into 5 levels for monitoring droughts table 1 previous studies have shown the relationships between θ fc θ wp and soil physical characteristics such as soil texture percentages of sand silt and clay organic matter and bulk density these relationships can be expressed by the pedotransfer functions ptfs bouma and van lanen 1987 which is based on a regression approach the ptfs are useful to link the soil data and hydraulic properties especially when the soil water parameters are not available in this study we used the modified ptfs equations by saxton et al 1986 to derive the soil water parameters in australia based on high spatial resolution soil attribute products for the top soil layer percentages of clay c sand s and organic carbon the organic carbon was converted to organic matter om by dividing by an empirical factor of 0 58 pribyl 2010 shangguan et al 2014 the equations for calculating θ fc and θ wp are expressed as follows 3 θ wp θ wp 0 14 θ wp 0 02 θ wp 0 024 s 0 487 c 0 006 o m 0 005 s o m 0 013 c o m 0 068 s c 0 031 4 θ fc θ fc 1 283 θ fc 2 0 374 θ fc 0 015 θ fc 0 251 s 0 195 c 0 011 o m 0 006 s o m 0 027 c o m 0 452 s c 0 299 where s c and om are the percentages of sand clay and organic matter θ wp and θ fc are the first solution of θ wp and θ fc mishra et al 2017 the θ wp and θ fc calculations used the 1 km downscaled smap sm and the soil attribute data which were upscaled using the nearest neighbor interpolation approach at 1 km spatial resolution 3 2 smdi the smdi is able to characterize short term drought conditions and is not affected by different seasons or climate zones the smdi is derived using sm estimates only including the long term sm characteristics and the short term period of which drought conditions are going to be evaluated narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 in this study daily gldas sm estimates at the 0 10 cm layer between 1981 and 2018 were obtained and used as the long term sm records to derive the three basic statistical metrics as inputs for the smdi calculation including the median maximum and minimum sm values mswj maxswj and minswj at the topsoil layer for any given month we made an assumption that all the 1 km sm estimates within any gldas grid could be summarized by the long term sm records of this gldas grid so the smdi can be calculated by the following steps 5 sd j sw j msw j msw j m i n sw j 100 i f sw j msw j where sd j is the soil water deficit unit sw j is the monthly averaged sm estimates of the period to evaluate drought and is derived from the downscaled smap sm j is the long term sm data within a given month the sd j effectively removed the seasonality and was scaled to the range between 100 and 100 for different climate zones which indicates very dry to very wet conditions narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 regarding the issue for selecting the appropriate time period to study drought the methodology for calculating the drought index on a temporally incremental basis was adopted palmer 1965 the smdi j of any given month j can be calculated by 6 smdi j 0 5 s m d i j 1 sd j 50 where smdi j 1 is the smdi from the past month as the range of sd values is defined between 100 and 100 and supposes the drought occurred in the subsequent months for the initial month the smdi 1 can be calculated as 7 smdi 1 sd 1 50 the long term gldas sm data was disaggregated at 1 km resolution to match up with the downscaled smap sm for calculating sd j of all months and then the smdi j was calculated from the past month smdi j 1 and current month sd j the smdi j for any month ranges from 4 to 4 indicating dry to wet conditions 4 results and discussions 4 1 comparisons between smap gldas and in situ sm data fig 2 shows the maps of the yearly averaged 1 km downscaled smap sm gldas noah model sm outputs as well as relative bias in percent between the two sm data sets in 2015 2019 in australia the relative bias can be calculated by 8 100 θ smap θ gldas θ gldas it can be summarized that the two sm products had similar spatial patterns however smap sm demonstrated greater differences of sm between coastal and inland regions than gldas sm these features can be better tracked from the relative bias maps in the third column in fig 2 the central regions of australia had higher negative relative biases than the other regions many grids of which were less than 50 as opposed to this the eastern and southwestern coastal regions tasmania island as well as some large inland water bodies e g lake eyre lake torrens had high positive relative biases 50 and smap sm were wetter than gldas sm the failed capture of the inland water bodies was mainly due to the limitation of the gldas noah model simulations which could not properly represent surface water storage syed et al 2008 the main reasons which caused the differences between smap and gldas sm include firstly the coastal regions are mainly composed of wetlands or forests of which have vegetation water content 5 kg m2 this is the threshold of smap sm retrieval requirement and sm are mostly overestimated in these regions colliander et al 2017 secondly as mentioned above smap sm and gldas sm have different sensing depths of the soil layer a study showed that the surface soil layer tended to have smaller sm values and greater variability than the deep soil layer because of the atmospheric conditions such as precipitation anguela et al 2008 finally 2019 had lower overall relative biases than the other years for the entire australia fig 3 compares the monthly averaged in situ sm with smap and gldas sm corresponding to the 19 stations in mdb in 2015 2018 it can be known that the three sm data sets all showed clear seasonal and interannual variations as well as decreasing trends in 2017 2018 the three sm data sets had a good agreement for most of the stations but it is also found that the smap sm was overestimated especially during fall winter seasons in 2016 which was a wet year and had high overall sm the differences between in situ and smap sm were generally less than 0 05 m3 m3 for the other months additionally it is found that the gldas sm were slightly higher than smap sm and had higher variability for most of the months except wet seasons which corresponded to the maps shown in fig 2 the performance of downscaled smap sm as well as gldas sm against the in situ sm corresponding to the 19 stations in 2015 2018 was compared fig 4 from the comparison we find that 13 stations showed correlation coefficients r 0 8 in addition to that only 2 stations depicted r 0 5 for the centered rmsd the values ranged from 0 02 0 09 m3 m3 and the standard deviation std varied from 0 09 0 13 m3 m3 it is also important to note that 15 stations had rmsd less than 0 7 m3 m3 showing good performance of smap sm with in situ sm we also observed that the gldas sm showed higher rmsd compared to the downscaled smap sm on the other hand we found that the standard deviation was lesser compared to smap sm the correlation coefficient for gldas and smap sm showed similar ranges 4 2 interpretation of swdi smdi results figs 5 and 6 are the seasonally averaged swdi and smdi maps in australia and mdb from 2019 while figs 7 and 8 are the yearly averaged swdi and smdi maps in australia and mdb in 2015 2019 all the maps are produced at 1 km spatial resolution it can be known that both swdi smdi maps from figs 5 and 6 were able to capture the seasonal variability of drought condition in different climate zones in australia in fig 5a it is found that summer fall seasons january june were wet and had mild drought conditions while winter spring seasons july to january were dry in the northern coast of australia this region is characterized as tropical savanna rainforest climate in the southwestern coast southeastern coast eastern coast and tasmania it is found that fall winter seasons were wet and had no drought conditions while spring summer seasons were dry and had mild moderate drought conditions in winter these regions had the greatest wetting trend and the swdi values reached the peak of the year the corresponding regions are characterized as mediterranean sub tropical or oceanic climate the inland regions which fall in semi arid or arid climate zones showed consistent severe or extreme drought conditions and did not show distinct dry or wet seasons the only exceptions were the areas surrounding water bodies which had no or mild drought condition in fig 5b smdi showed a different temporal change pattern than the swdi and similar drought condition differences between coastal and inland regions as swdi in the northern and southwestern coast of australia there was hardly seasonal variation through the entire year while the southeastern coast showed great wetting trend and high smdi values in winter and spring lastly the inland regions had almost no seasonal variation of drought conditions for the whole year and slightly less severe drought condition in summer for the mdb region in fig 6 a b it is found that the northern basin had lower seasonal variations than the southern portion of the river basin the swdi along the southern boundary of the river basin varied greatly from 10 to 20 through all four seasons in the south of mdb there was no drought or mild drought conditions in fall or winter and moderate drought conditions ocurred in spring and summer both swdi and smdi showed strong wetting trends and had the highest values of the year in the south of mdb during winter the seasonal variations of precipitation and temperature were the major reasons that caused such patterns this region is near the southeastern coast which is dominated by the mediterranean climate with wet mild winter and dry hot summer on the other hand for the inland regions of the basin the northern region queensland sandstone belt always had high drought conditions from either swdi or smdi maps while the western region along the murray river had moderate or low drought conditions additionally it is also found that high altitude regions in southern eastern edges of mdb and the regions along the main river network had lower drought conditions from the smdi maps in mdb in fig 6b it can be observed that during the winter and spring seasons the region with no drought condition smdi 0 near the southern boundaries was greater than this of the swdi maps finally the arid regions in the west and north of the basin showed less drought conditions in summer and fall than winter and spring in the smdi maps whereas these regions did not show very clear seasonal change patterns in the swdi maps this is because the smdi is a time dependent variable and is calculated based on the characteristics of long term sm variations and smdi of the past month from fig 7a the interannual variations of the drought conditions between 2015 and 2019 can be observed particularly more severe drought conditions occurred in the inland regions of eastern australia in 2017 2019 additionally the western part of australia did not show much difference in drought conditions in the five years the southwestern coast of australia consistently had no drought condition the maps in fig 7b also showed that the interannual variations of swdi were generally greater in the eastern than the western part of australia in the five years please note that the blank areas presented in the tropical region in 2017 and 2018 for smdi they were caused by the cloud cover contamination issue which induced missing 1 km modis lst retrievals and downscaled 1 km smap sm unlike the swdi the smdi were calculated on a monthly basis and from smdi of the initial month january the missing 1 km smdi in tropical regions in january would be passed down to the rest of months in this year and caused the data to be missing in the same regions in fig 8a it is known that the northern part of mdb had a larger area under severe drought conditions in 2018 and 2019 while the eastern and southern rims of the river basin had smaller areas of no drought between 2017 and 2019 these facts were mainly due to the rainfall deficiencies during the three years lastly from fig 8a b it can be summarized that the whole river basin had the worst drought conditions in 2018 among the five years 4 3 time series analyses of swdi smdi fig 9 compares the monthly averaged swdi smdi with gpm accumulated precipitation at the locations of 8 in situ sm monitoring stations over different climate zones in australia from 2019 the swdi smdi gpm data were extracted by the nearest grid point values corresponding to the station coordinates for the station located in the tropical savanna climate zone weany creek the swdi did not show much seasonal variations between dry and wet seasons the high precipitation that occurred in summer and spring did not quite attenuate the drought conditions and this region was always under moderate drought conditions for the stations in the mediterranean climate or oceanic climate zone gnangara and tullochgorum the precipitation was high in fall and winter and it correlated to high swdi which indicated no drought condition moderate drought trends could be observed in spring and summer seasons in tumbarumba which is an inland station for the other four stations in the semi arid inland regions temora silver springs samarra and evergreen the precipitation was always low and had severe drought conditions in spring and summer additionally the comparison results of stations tumbarumba and temora indicated that the drought condition might not respond to precipitation very well and streamflow or groundwater might contribute to drought condition mitigation with respect to the smdi it showed a similar temporal change pattern as swdi in five stations except gnangara which showed less variations in the time series if we compare swdi smdi of the three adjacent stations silver springs samarra and evergreen which lie in a small region of 25 km 25 km we can observe the discrepancies silver springs mostly had higher values ranged approximately 15 40 than the other two stations throughout the year evergreen and samarra showed more severe drought conditions than silver spring especially in summer and fall therefore from these results it can be concluded that the 1 km drought indices were able to capture more detailed drought information for both spatial and temporal scales than the 9 km comparing with swdi smdi also showed differences between the three stations but less differences than swdi the results from our analyses are consistent with similar studies in australia for agricultural droughts for instance mladenova et al 2020 identified 2018 as the worst year for the analysis period of 2015 2018 with respect to the new south wales region in australia this is consistent with our findings in figs 7 and 8 which reveal the high negative values for smdi and swdi for the murray darling river basin which partly lies inside the new south wales region another study by dikshit et al 2020 similarly classified new south wales as moderately dry and extremely dry corresponding to spei 1 and spei 3 respectively for 2018 one of the limitations to our study is the short temporal availability of smap data 2015 onwards in addition to that uncertainties are associated with the drought indices retrievals the uncertainties for producing the high resolution 1 km swdi smdi data sets are as follows 1 the two drought indices were calculated using the 1 km smap sm downscaled from 9 km smap sm retrievals bias of the 9 km sm and inconsistency between smap radiometer and modis instruments could affect the accuracy of 1 km sm the accuracy especially downgraded during the wet season in 2016 fig 3 2 the smap and gldas sm products represent different sensing depths of soil layer 0 5 cm for smap sm and 0 10 cm for gldas sm additionally the downscaled smap sm and gldas sm have different spatial resolution hence when calculating smdi we assumed that all the 1 km smap grids within one gldas grid could be summarized by the long term sm characteristics of that gldas grid 5 conclusions in this study we utilized two drought indices at 1 km resolution daily swdi and monthly smdi to evaluate the drought conditions in australia in 2015 2019 the drought indices were calculated using the 1 km downscaled smap sm estimates high resolution soil attribute products and gldas noah sm outputs the conclusions are as follows the swdi requires high spatial resolution sm estimates and soil water parameters only and does not need long term sm records as it is usually difficult to obtain high resolution soil water parameters i e sm at field capacity and wilting point to overcome this limitation these parameters were estimated by high resolution data of soil attributes on the contrary the smdi integrated the long term gldas sm and 1 km smap sm by a temporally incremental based method this index can effectively overcome the limitation of selecting an appropriate time period for studying droughts the high spatial resolution drought indices which are derived from the downscaled smap sm can provide drought conditions with more detailed spatial and temporal information in australia the 1 km smap sm and 25 km gldas sm were validated by in situ sm measurements from 19 ismn stations located in mdb between 2015 and 2018 the validation results showed that the three sm products had a good agreement in temporal scale the differences between smap and in situ sm were generally 0 05 m3 m3 for any months except the fall winter months in 2016 the rmsd from validations which ranged 0 02 0 09 m3 m3 indicated reliable accuracy the derived swdi smdi products are capable of demonstrating finer scale seasonal variations of drought conditions as well as demonstrating the different patterns of dry wet seasons in different climate zones of australia from these products it is observed that the dry wet seasons for the tropical climate zone and the mediterranean oceanic climate zones were opposite while the semi arid arid climate zones did not have distinct dry wet seasons additionally from the swdi and smdi estimates it is also found that the severe droughts occurred in 2017 2019 in large portion of australia except some coastal regions the inland semi arid arid regions were consistently under drought condition and had little seasonal variation the drought index maps in mdb provided more detailed drought information at watershed scale and indicated that the terrain and streamflow were possibly two major factors which could determine the drought conditions on the other hand by analyzing the comparison results at in situ stations it can be known that the 1 km swdi is able to show greater seasonal and interannual variances than smdi and especially better captured the severe drought conditions in 2017 2019 therefore swdi is preferred to study droughts at both spatial and temporal scales in australia credit authorship contribution statement bin fang conceptualization methodology formal analysis software resources

4864,drought is one of the major hazards that could have a significant impact on agriculture in this study two drought indices at high spatial resolution soil water deficit index swdi and soil moisture deficit index smdi were derived by 1 km downscaled soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture sm global land data assimilation system gldas long term sm and soil attribute products and used to analyze the drought conditions in australia in 2015 2019 the swdi was calculated from smap sm estimates and sm at field capacity wilting point derived from soil attribute data while the smdi was calculated by integrating gldas and smap sm using a temporally incremental based method we found that in the eastern and western coastal regions the droughts occurred during spring and summer and were relieved in fall and winter the temporal change pattern of drought conditions for the northern coastal regions was opposite of the eastern western coasts on the other hand the inland regions always had more severe drought conditions additionally the validation results for the 1 km smap sm using international soil moisture network ismn in situ data showed reliable accuracy and the root mean square deviation rmsd ranged from 0 02 to 0 09 m3 m3 both swdi and smdi showed clear seasonal and interannual variability and the drought conditions worsened in 2017 2019 from the 1 km swdi smdi maps in the murray darling river basin terrain and streamflow were found to be two deterministic factors for the drought conditions keywords drought index soil moisture smap gldas ismn 1 introduction sm properties can be used to derive indices that help quantify agricultural droughts which have significant social and economic impacts as they directly affect agricultural success determining drought dynamics quickly can aid in management decisions and reduce their negative impacts sheffield et al 2004 however it is often difficult to quantify droughts so indices are often used to identify the main attributes that define an agricultural drought event martínez fernández et al 2016 yang et al 2018 mishra et al 2017 developed swdi and it was generated using smap sm and soil information regarding field capacity and water content in order to improve agricultural drought monitoring they used the swdi to quantify agricultural drought based on the surface sm in the top 5 cm of soil the swdi was found to be a good agricultural drought indicator as it was able to capture information content similar to the in situ atmospheric water deficit awd index when the two indices were compared over the contiguous united states conus martínez fernández et al 2016 used the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos satellite data to derive swdi in an area of spain with an ample in situ network for validation this study also found that swdi was able to adequately identify drought conditions compared to ground observations and was agreeable against awd narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 used the hydrological model soil water assessment tool swat to simulate sm from daily weather data these weekly sm estimates at 16 km2 were used to create the drought index smdi the smdi were highly correlated with crop yields having correlation coefficient r greater than 0 75 during critical growth stages additionally the smdi calculated in the top 60 cm was found to have the lowest auto correlation lag due to its ability to participate in evapotranspiration the results of mishra et al 2017 martínez fernández et al 2016 and narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 indicated that swdi and smdi could be useful for identifying and monitoring drought affecting agriculture due to its extreme climate australia has experienced floods and droughts in past years which have had devastating effects on river health and agricultural practices rahmati et al 2020 described australia as the driest inhabited continent on earth southeast australia experienced what is considered the worst drought on record for the region from 2001 to 2009 this event which is referred as the millennium drought caused devastation to ecosystems economy and society van dijk et al 2013 in the period from 2018 to 2019 australia experienced another severe drought that caused large deficits in agricultural farmers profits hughes et al 2019 with the impending effects of climate change future droughts could be as severe or worse than the millennium drought and thus warrant better management which begins with a better understanding of drought conditions in the region previous studies showed that major drought events in australia were mainly driven by different kinds of particular climatic processes which can be described as the irregular variations between winds and sea surface temperatures abbot 2019 nicholls 2010 kiem and verdon kidd 2010 moreover it is reported that the regional climate changes might contribute to the recent droughts cai et al 2014 cook et al 2016 climate change has been linked to higher temperatures across australia and lower winter rainfall trends in the past 20 years which has led to increased periods of drought and negative effects on farm profitability hughes et al 2019 the study presented here assesses agricultural drought indices in australia due to the great risk of droughts and the even greater impact of droughts on agriculture in this region a systematic assessment of river health named the sustainable rivers audit was performed on the murray darling river basin mdb and classified it as a dryland river system with a high evaporation and low runoff rate accounting for 94 and 4 of precipitation respectively davies et al 2010 this assessment also found that many low lying regions of major rivers were in poor condition due to drought conditions the mdb is responsible for almost 40 of the income derived from agricultural production in australia and its 23 river valleys cover 14 of the total area of australia which is over 1 million km2 davies et al 2010 crabb 1997 the uncertainty and changes in australia s climate which directly affect agriculture warrant further assessment of drought events in this region this study and similar studies provide a deeper understanding of past drought dynamics and can be used for better management of future droughts in australia sm is directly affected by short term precipitation and provides a good measure of drought conditions when consistent sm data is available for analyses sheffield et al 2004 a study by rahmati et al 2020 compared a stand alone adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis to several hybrid models with machine learning to predict areas that were expected to experience drought in queensland australia using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and root mean square error for validation they found that the hybridized models performed well but lacked continuous sm data in recent years there have been several satellite missions with the goal of capturing global sm estimates which can be beneficial for analyses of areas lacking or with limited in situ sm data lakshmi 2013 kim et al 2020 dandridge et al 2020 however the smap mission is one of the most recent satellite operations and despite its early radar failure is able to capture global maps of sm every 3 days at 9 km using the functioning radiometer wigneron et al 2017 the original smap sm product has been well validated velpuri et al 2015 validated smap estimates with in situ sm in the high plains region of usa and found the highest correlation with surface sm between 0 and 5 cm additionally pan et al 2016 found that smap l3 compared very well to in situ sm observations over conus and smap performed better than land surface modeled sm current and past studies have shown the use of new satellite sensors such as cyclone global navigation satellite system cygnss provides higher temporal repeat soil moisture kim and lakshmi 2018 launched in 2009 smos is able to provide global sm maps every 3 days at 50 km spatial resolution kerr et al 2001 grace is used in conjunction with hydrological modeling for estimation of evapotranspiration billah et al 2015 lakshmi 2016 lakshmi et al 2018 use of multi sensor satellite data to estimate vegetation properties hong et al 2007 or downscaling passive microwave derived soil moisture using active radar narayan and lakshmi 2008 vegetation and surface temperature fang et al 2013 2018a 2018b 2019 2020 precipitation is the most important hydrological variable to determine drought conditions historically precipitation based indices have been used to identify droughts in different parts of the world jiang et al 2020 lai et al 2019 the precipitation only based indices like standard precipitation index spi can accurately capture the meteorological and hydrological droughts over a region but they lack the ability to meticulously manifest agricultural droughts due to its limitation of excluding the compound effects of temperature on potential evapotranspiration tirivarombo et al 2018 while the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei can account for it the spatial resolution of precipitation becomes a limiting factor to study these indices in a local region although precipitation and sm are closely correlated the precipitation based drought indices cannot be directly translated to quantify agricultural droughts the gldas 2 noah model data is generated from a climatologically consistent atmospheric forcing dataset so it can provide reliable long term sm for drought related studies spennemann et al 2015 for example in spennemann et al 2015 the gldas sm was used to study sm anomalies in southern south america they found that there was a significant relationship between sm and precipitation and sm coincided with the geographical distribution of precipitation there was a lagged correlation between sm and precipitation anomalies with sm leading additionally gldas sm was used to calculate terrestrial water storage tws in order to analyze monthly changes in tws in iran moghim 2020 they found that sm has been decreasing in iran since 2002 which could be influenced by climate change and that the spatial pattern of negative changes in tws closely followed sm patterns in yang et al 2018 gldas sm was used to derive smdi which they renamed as soil moisture availability index smai at four different soil layers to study drought conditions in north china yang et al 2018 the smai was used to estimate drought conditions and successfully detected several significant drought events from 2001 to 2015 that were validated with observational data the research presented here focuses on the remote sensing aspect of water scarcity assessment since droughts can adversely affect the water security of a nation it is very important to have pre hand information about the prevailing drought conditions in a region this information includes the analyses of various sources of contributions and impacts on droughts in both time and space scales van dijk et al 2013 especially the analyses at catchment watershed scales bond et al 2008 this information can be used to predict monitor and assess drought events as well as properly allocate and manage water resources in these drought prone regions white et al 1993 due to the low spatial coverage of in situ measurements it is still a challenging issue to assess hydrological conditions over a watershed scale with high temporal frequency west et al 2019 this study focuses on applying the latest approaches of calculating drought condition indices swdi smdi which require only a few input parameters sm estimates from smap gldas and soil attributes it makes use of the 1 km downscaled smap sm product derived from fang and lakshmi 2014 to creatively generate the high spatial resolution drought condition index products in australia the main objective of this study is to take advantage of the high resolution drought indices swdi smdi derived from the downscaled smap sm at 1 km to evaluate the drought conditions as well as to study the relationships between sm data sets smap gldas and in situ in australia the major advantages of using the downscaled smap sm to calculate swdi smdi are that it can provide more spatial temporal information of drought conditions in detail especially at watershed station scales as well as can help to study the influence of other geophysical factors e g terrain streamflow on drought conditions the following contents of the paper consist of 1 an introduction of all the input and validation data sets 2 the methodology for calculating the two drought indices swdi smdi 3 results and discussion for interpreting and analyzing the swdi smdi estimates at both national scale and watershed scale mdb as well as the comparisons between swdi smdi smap sm ismn sm and global precipitation measurement gpm precipitation 4 conclusions for summarizing works and new findings of this paper 2 data 2 1 smap smap is an observatory launched in 2015 by national aeronautics and space administration nasa to measure the sm content in the top 5 cm of the soil layer it can measure the sm content at places where vegetation water content is less than 5 kg m2 the standard version of smap sm products provides data at a 36 km spatial resolution while the enhanced product is given at 9 km chan et al 2018 2016 the enhanced product uses the backus gilbert optimal interpolation techniques to extract information from smap s antenna temperature and convert them to brightness temperatures many studies made use of the smap sm dataset to study the water cycle as well as the carbon cycle apart from it weather and climate studies also used smap data to study evaporation from the land surface as well as the health of vegetation colliander et al 2017 wigneron et al 2017 in this study the 1 km smap sm used for calculating swdi smdi were derived from the enhanced level 2 half orbit 9 km radiometer sm produced by national snow and ice data center nsidc the sm downscaling algorithm is based on the thermal inertia theory that the surface sm is negatively related to change in surface temperature during the corresponding time period fang and lakshmi 2014 the algorithm was implemented by using gldas advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis to derive the downscaled smap sm at 1 km resolution of 1 30 a m p m overpasses separately from the research on validating the downscaled smap sm product by using ismn in situ sm from 100 stations within conus fang et al 2020 it is known that the average r2 is 0 541 and unbiased rmse is 0 02 m3 m3 which indicates good accuracy 2 2 gldas gldas is an assimilation model which

provided by the department of soil and landscape grid of australia website https data csiro au there are three sets of products provided including national soil attributes three dimensional 3d soil attributes and regional data the datasets were generated using soil attribute data from field measurements from the national soil site data collection as well as estimates from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro national spectroscopic database rossel and webster 2012 the data were spatially modeled using decision tree and kriging methods the soil attributes were estimated at 6 depth intervals from 0 to 200 cm at 3 arc seconds 90 m spatial resolution in this study we used three modeled soil attributes from the database including sand clay and organic carbon unit from the topsoil layer 0 5 cm to be consistent with the sensing depth of smap sm estimates 2 4 gpm gpm provides global observations of rainfall and snow using a network of

the forecasting capabilities of disasters like floods and droughts sharifi et al 2016 tang et al 2016 2 5 ismn the ismn provides in situ sm measurements from 1400 stations and 35 international sm networks which are available from 1952 to present there have been many studies on validating the ismn data from different sm networks dorigo et al 2011 2013 gruber et al 2013 in this study in situ sm measurements of 0 5 cm topsoil layer from 19 stations between 2015 and 2018 from australia s oznet hydrological monitoring network were downloaded from the ismn website https ismn geo tuwien ac at these stations are all located in the mdb southeastern australia and they can be subdivided into two zones based on their coordinates additionally the coordinates of the other 5 five sm stations were also used to study swdi smdi change trends at different climate zones in australia the locations of the sm stations are shown in fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 swdi the swdi is used to monitor drought conditions by measuring the sm deficit and is related to sm estimates and associated soil properties martínez fernández et al 2015 mishra et al 2017 the swdi is important for monitoring and quantifying drought events in this study we only considered extracting the swdi at the top soil layer from 0 to 5 cm by making use of 1 km downscaled smap sm as well as soil attribute products in australia the swdi is calculated by eq 1 1 swdi θ θ fc θ awc 10 where θ θ fc and θ awc are sm estimates sm at field capacity and sm at available water capacity respectively the θ awc can be calculated by the difference between sm at field capacity θ fc and sm at wilting point θ wp as 2 θ awc θ fc θ wp the positive swdi indicates that the sm is higher than the field capacity while the negative swdi indicates drought conditions the swdi can be classified into 5 levels for monitoring droughts table 1 previous studies have shown the relationships between θ fc θ wp and soil physical characteristics such as soil texture percentages of sand silt and clay organic matter and bulk density these relationships can be expressed by the pedotransfer functions ptfs bouma and van lanen 1987 which is based on a regression approach the ptfs are useful to link the soil data and hydraulic properties especially when the soil water parameters are not available in this study we used the modified ptfs equations by saxton et al 1986 to derive the soil water parameters in australia based on high spatial resolution soil attribute products for the top soil layer percentages of clay c sand s and organic carbon the organic carbon was converted to organic matter om by dividing by an empirical factor of 0 58 pribyl 2010 shangguan et al 2014 the equations for calculating θ fc and θ wp are expressed as follows 3 θ wp θ wp 0 14 θ wp 0 02 θ wp 0 024 s 0 487 c 0 006 o m 0 005 s o m 0 013 c o m 0 068 s c 0 031 4 θ fc θ fc 1 283 θ fc 2 0 374 θ fc 0 015 θ fc 0 251 s 0 195 c 0 011 o m 0 006 s o m 0 027 c o m 0 452 s c 0 299 where s c and om are the percentages of sand clay and organic matter θ wp and θ fc are the first solution of θ wp and θ fc mishra et al 2017 the θ wp and θ fc calculations used the 1 km downscaled smap sm and the soil attribute data which were upscaled using the nearest neighbor interpolation approach at 1 km spatial resolution 3 2 smdi the smdi is able to characterize short term drought conditions and is not affected by different seasons or climate zones the smdi is derived using sm estimates only including the long term sm characteristics and the short term period of which drought conditions are going to be evaluated narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 in this study daily gldas sm estimates at the 0 10 cm layer between 1981 and 2018 were obtained and used as the long term sm records to derive the three basic statistical metrics as inputs for the smdi calculation including the median maximum and minimum sm values mswj maxswj and minswj at the topsoil layer for any given month we made an assumption that all the 1 km sm estimates within any gldas grid could be summarized by the long term sm records of this gldas grid so the smdi can be calculated by the following steps 5 sd j sw j msw j msw j m i n sw j 100 i f sw j msw j where sd j is the soil water deficit unit sw j is the monthly averaged sm estimates of the period to evaluate drought and is derived from the downscaled smap sm j is the long term sm data within a given month the sd j effectively removed the seasonality and was scaled to the range between 100 and 100 for different climate zones which indicates very dry to very wet conditions narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 regarding the issue for selecting the appropriate time period to study drought the methodology for calculating the drought index on a temporally incremental basis was adopted palmer 1965 the smdi j of any given month j can be calculated by 6 smdi j 0 5 s m d i j 1 sd j 50 where smdi j 1 is the smdi from the past month as the range of sd values is defined between 100 and 100 and supposes the drought occurred in the subsequent months for the initial month the smdi 1 can be calculated as 7 smdi 1 sd 1 50 the long term gldas sm data was disaggregated at 1 km resolution to match up with the downscaled smap sm for calculating sd j of all months and then the smdi j was calculated from the past month smdi j 1 and current month sd j the smdi j for any month ranges from 4 to 4 indicating dry to wet conditions 4 results and discussions 4 1 comparisons between smap gldas and in situ sm data fig 2 shows the maps of the yearly averaged 1 km downscaled smap sm gldas noah model sm outputs as well as relative bias in percent between the two sm data sets in 2015 2019 in australia the relative bias can be calculated by 8 100 θ smap θ gldas θ gldas it can be summarized that the two sm products had similar spatial patterns however smap sm demonstrated greater differences of sm between coastal and inland regions than gldas sm these features can be better tracked from the relative bias maps in the third column in fig 2 the central regions of australia had higher negative relative biases than the other regions many grids of which were less than 50 as opposed to this the eastern and southwestern coastal regions tasmania island as well as some large inland water bodies e g lake eyre lake torrens had high positive relative biases 50 and smap sm were wetter than gldas sm the failed capture of the inland water bodies was mainly due to the limitation of the gldas noah model simulations which could not properly represent surface water storage syed et al 2008 the main reasons which caused the differences between smap and gldas sm include firstly the coastal regions are mainly composed of wetlands or forests of which have vegetation water content 5 kg m2 this is the threshold of smap sm retrieval requirement and sm are mostly overestimated in these regions colliander et al 2017 secondly as mentioned above smap sm and gldas sm have different sensing depths of the soil layer a study showed that the surface soil layer tended to have smaller sm values and greater variability than the deep soil layer because of the atmospheric conditions such as precipitation anguela et al 2008 finally 2019 had lower overall relative biases than the other years for the entire australia fig 3 compares the monthly averaged in situ sm with smap and gldas sm corresponding to the 19 stations in mdb in 2015 2018 it can be known that the three sm data sets all showed clear seasonal and interannual variations as well as decreasing trends in 2017 2018 the three sm data sets had a good agreement for most of the stations but it is also found that the smap sm was overestimated especially during fall winter seasons in 2016 which was a wet year and had high overall sm the differences between in situ and smap sm were generally less than 0 05 m3 m3 for the other months additionally it is found that the gldas sm were slightly higher than smap sm and had higher variability for most of the months except wet seasons which corresponded to the maps shown in fig 2 the performance of downscaled smap sm as well as gldas sm against the in situ sm corresponding to the 19 stations in 2015 2018 was compared fig 4 from the comparison we find that 13 stations showed correlation coefficients r 0 8 in addition to that only 2 stations depicted r 0 5 for the centered rmsd the values ranged from 0 02 0 09 m3 m3 and the standard deviation std varied from 0 09 0 13 m3 m3 it is also important to note that 15 stations had rmsd less than 0 7 m3 m3 showing good performance of smap sm with in situ sm we also observed that the gldas sm showed higher rmsd compared to the downscaled smap sm on the other hand we found that the standard deviation was lesser compared to smap sm the correlation coefficient for gldas and smap sm showed similar ranges 4 2 interpretation of swdi smdi results figs 5 and 6 are the seasonally averaged swdi and smdi maps in australia and mdb from 2019 while figs 7 and 8 are the yearly averaged swdi and smdi maps in australia and mdb in 2015 2019 all the maps are produced at 1 km spatial resolution it can be known that both swdi smdi maps from figs 5 and 6 were able to capture the seasonal variability of drought condition in different climate zones in australia in fig 5a it is found that summer fall seasons january june were wet and had mild drought conditions while winter spring seasons july to january were dry in the northern coast of australia this region is characterized as tropical savanna rainforest climate in the southwestern coast southeastern coast eastern coast and tasmania it is found that fall winter seasons were wet and had no drought conditions while spring summer seasons were dry and had mild moderate drought conditions in winter these regions had the greatest wetting trend and the swdi values reached the peak of the year the corresponding regions are characterized as mediterranean sub tropical or oceanic climate the inland regions which fall in semi arid or arid climate zones showed consistent severe or extreme drought conditions and did not show distinct dry or wet seasons the only exceptions were the areas surrounding water bodies which had no or mild drought condition in fig 5b smdi showed a different temporal change pattern than the swdi and similar drought condition differences between coastal and inland regions as swdi in the northern and southwestern coast of australia there was hardly seasonal variation through the entire year while the southeastern coast showed great wetting trend and high smdi values in winter and spring lastly the inland regions had almost no seasonal variation of drought conditions for the whole year and slightly less severe drought condition in summer for the mdb region in fig 6 a b it is found that the northern basin had lower seasonal variations than the southern portion of the river basin the swdi along the southern boundary of the river basin varied greatly from 10 to 20 through all four seasons in the south of mdb there was no drought or mild drought conditions in fall or winter and moderate drought conditions ocurred in spring and summer both swdi and smdi showed strong wetting trends and had the highest values of the year in the south of mdb during winter the seasonal variations of precipitation and temperature were the major reasons that caused such patterns this region is near the southeastern coast which is dominated by the mediterranean climate with wet mild winter and dry hot summer on the other hand for the inland regions of the basin the northern region queensland sandstone belt always had high drought conditions from either swdi or smdi maps while the western region along the murray river had moderate or low drought conditions additionally it is also found that high altitude regions in southern eastern edges of mdb and the regions along the main river network had lower drought conditions from the smdi maps in mdb in fig 6b it can be observed that during the winter and spring seasons the region with no drought condition smdi 0 near the southern boundaries was greater than this of the swdi maps finally the arid regions in the west and north of the basin showed less drought conditions in summer and fall than winter and spring in the smdi maps whereas these regions did not show very clear seasonal change patterns in the swdi maps this is because the smdi is a time dependent variable and is calculated based on the characteristics of long term sm variations and smdi of the past month from fig 7a the interannual variations of the drought conditions between 2015 and 2019 can be observed particularly more severe drought conditions occurred in the inland regions of eastern australia in 2017 2019 additionally the western part of australia did not show much difference in drought conditions in the five years the southwestern coast of australia consistently had no drought condition the maps in fig 7b also showed that the interannual variations of swdi were generally greater in the eastern than the western part of australia in the five years please note that the blank areas presented in the tropical region in 2017 and 2018 for smdi they were caused by the cloud cover contamination issue which induced missing 1 km modis lst retrievals and downscaled 1 km smap sm unlike the swdi the smdi were calculated on a monthly basis and from smdi of the initial month january the missing 1 km smdi in tropical regions in january would be passed down to the rest of months in this year and caused the data to be missing in the same regions in fig 8a it is known that the northern part of mdb had a larger area under severe drought conditions in 2018 and 2019 while the eastern and southern rims of the river basin had smaller areas of no drought between 2017 and 2019 these facts were mainly due to the rainfall deficiencies during the three years lastly from fig 8a b it can be summarized that the whole river basin had the worst drought conditions in 2018 among the five years 4 3 time series analyses of swdi smdi fig 9 compares the monthly averaged swdi smdi with gpm accumulated precipitation at the locations of 8 in situ sm monitoring stations over different climate zones in australia from 2019 the swdi smdi gpm data were extracted by the nearest grid point values corresponding to the station coordinates for the station located in the tropical savanna climate zone weany creek the swdi did not show much seasonal variations between dry and wet seasons the high precipitation that occurred in summer and spring did not quite attenuate the drought conditions and this region was always under moderate drought conditions for the stations in the mediterranean climate or oceanic climate zone gnangara and tullochgorum the precipitation was high in fall and winter and it correlated to high swdi which indicated no drought condition moderate drought trends could be observed in spring and summer seasons in tumbarumba which is an inland station for the other four stations in the semi arid inland regions temora silver springs samarra and evergreen the precipitation was always low and had severe drought conditions in spring and summer additionally the comparison results of stations tumbarumba and temora indicated that the drought condition might not respond to precipitation very well and streamflow or groundwater might contribute to drought condition mitigation with respect to the smdi it showed a similar temporal change pattern as swdi in five stations except gnangara which showed less variations in the time series if we compare swdi smdi of the three adjacent stations silver springs samarra and evergreen which lie in a small region of 25 km 25 km we can observe the discrepancies silver springs mostly had higher values ranged approximately 15 40 than the other two stations throughout the year evergreen and samarra showed more severe drought conditions than silver spring especially in summer and fall therefore from these results it can be concluded that the 1 km drought indices were able to capture more detailed drought information for both spatial and temporal scales than the 9 km comparing with swdi smdi also showed differences between the three stations but less differences than swdi the results from our analyses are consistent with similar studies in australia for agricultural droughts for instance mladenova et al 2020 identified 2018 as the worst year for the analysis period of 2015 2018 with respect to the new south wales region in australia this is consistent with our findings in figs 7 and 8 which reveal the high negative values for smdi and swdi for the murray darling river basin which partly lies inside the new south wales region another study by dikshit et al 2020 similarly classified new south wales as moderately dry and extremely dry corresponding to spei 1 and spei 3 respectively for 2018 one of the limitations to our study is the short temporal availability of smap data 2015 onwards in addition to that uncertainties are associated with the drought indices retrievals the uncertainties for producing the high resolution 1 km swdi smdi data sets are as follows 1 the two drought indices were calculated using the 1 km smap sm downscaled from 9 km smap sm retrievals bias of the 9 km sm and inconsistency between smap radiometer and modis instruments could affect the accuracy of 1 km sm the accuracy especially downgraded during the wet season in 2016 fig 3 2 the smap and gldas sm products represent different sensing depths of soil layer 0 5 cm for smap sm and 0 10 cm for gldas sm additionally the downscaled smap sm and gldas sm have different spatial resolution hence when calculating smdi we assumed that all the 1 km smap grids within one gldas grid could be summarized by the long term sm characteristics of that gldas grid 5 conclusions in this study we utilized two drought indices at 1 km resolution daily swdi and monthly smdi to evaluate the drought conditions in australia in 2015 2019 the drought indices were calculated using the 1 km downscaled smap sm estimates high resolution soil attribute products and gldas noah sm outputs the conclusions are as follows the swdi requires high spatial resolution sm estimates and soil water parameters only and does not need long term sm records as it is usually difficult to obtain high resolution soil water parameters i e sm at field capacity and wilting point to overcome this limitation these parameters were estimated by high resolution data of soil attributes on the contrary the smdi integrated the long term gldas sm and 1 km smap sm by a temporally incremental based method this index can effectively overcome the limitation of selecting an appropriate time period for studying droughts the high spatial resolution drought indices which are derived from the downscaled smap sm can provide drought conditions with more detailed spatial and temporal information in australia the 1 km smap sm and 25 km gldas sm were validated by in situ sm measurements from 19 ismn stations located in mdb between 2015 and 2018 the validation results showed that the three sm products had a good agreement in temporal scale the differences between smap and in situ sm were generally 0 05 m3 m3 for any months except the fall winter months in 2016 the rmsd from validations which ranged 0 02 0 09 m3 m3 indicated reliable accuracy the derived swdi smdi products are capable of demonstrating finer scale seasonal variations of drought conditions as well as demonstrating the different patterns of dry wet seasons in different climate zones of australia from these products it is observed that the dry wet seasons for the tropical climate zone and the mediterranean oceanic climate zones were opposite while the semi arid arid climate zones did not have distinct dry wet seasons additionally from the swdi and smdi estimates it is also found that the severe droughts occurred in 2017 2019 in large portion of australia except some coastal regions the inland semi arid arid regions were consistently under drought condition and had little seasonal variation the drought index maps in mdb provided more detailed drought information at watershed scale and indicated that the terrain and streamflow were possibly two major factors which could determine the drought conditions on the other hand by analyzing the comparison results at in situ stations it can be known that the 1 km swdi is able to show greater seasonal and interannual variances than smdi and especially better captured the severe drought conditions in 2017 2019 therefore swdi is preferred to study droughts at both spatial and temporal scales in australia credit authorship contribution statement bin fang conceptualization methodology formal analysis software resources
