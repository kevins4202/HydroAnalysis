4725,simulating heat transfer in an aquifer with one or more vertical borehole heat exchangers bhes of a ground source heat pump gshp system by means of a finite difference code is difficult because of the square or rectangular geometry grid and computational times thus limiting the types of evaluations that can be performed the aim of this work is to explore through modflow usg code public domain software a different approach towards simulating a borefield that would be more efficient computationally in order to enable simulations of larger domains with multiple bhes the connected linear network cln package introduced in modflow usg generally simulates 1 d linear computational cells in a 3 d grid such as hydraulic pipes in subsoil but for the first time has been adapted to reproduce vertical closed loop u pipe of a bhe therefore this work evaluates the modflow usg and cln package capability to reproduce the yearly operation of one or more bhes in an aquifer as a simpler and faster approach compared to a very fine finite difference discretization once the cln package was adapted a sensitivity analysis on the grid size refinement was performed there were several findings from this work the results of the different numerical models were in good agreement with an already validated model in terms of exchanged energies and aquifer thermal perturbation same analyses were carried out for different groundwater flow velocities and it was confirmed that the exchanged energy by a bhe increases with the groundwater flow velocity in accordance with literature studies at last a borefield of 7 bhes was implemented in a numerical model in a more expeditious and efficient way and without any computational effort keywords borehole heat exchanger cln package

the temperature variation of groundwater flow that needs to be monitored in cities with low enthalpy geothermal systems or other anthropogenic forces e g underground tunnels sewage leaks or heating networks many authors studied how the groundwater temperature is influenced by climate change or anthropogenic forcers kupfersberger et al 2017 taylor and stefan 2009 specifically an increase of groundwater temperature affects the physical biological and chemical properties of the aquifer hähnlein et al 2013 riedel 2019 such as aquifer dependent organisms and ecosystems hancock et al 2009 mixing processes of groundwater flow bonte et al 2011 and silicates dissolution arning et al 2006 ground source heat pumps gshp using borehole heat exchangers bhe and groundwater heat pumps gwhp using injection extraction wells are considered one of the main causes of the aquifer thermal perturbation ferguson and woodbury 2004 menberg et al 2013 even though this has not been adequately demonstrated lee and hahn 2006 the influence of gshp or gwhp systems on aquifers underneath cities was studied by several authors guimerà et al guimerà et al 2007 found out that in several aquifers of european cities abnormal effects in aquifer s temperature were probably caused by intensive use of the geothermal resource in the summer season in summer in basel epting et al epting et al 2013 detected the maximum temperature of the aquifer right downstream of geothermal systems in zaragoza epting et al epting et al 2017 measured a groundwater temperature equal to 41 c downstream of geothermal systems compared to an average air temperature equal to 15 5 c whenever economic resources are not available for thermal monitoring of the aquifer a predictive analysis of the effects of gshp and gwhp systems by numerical modelling of flow and heat transport in aquifers is the least invasive and most effective approach for evaluating the thermal impacts of bhe systems several scientific studies examined the problem of the heat transport in aquifers by means of analytical solutions alcaraz et al 2016 molina giraldo et al 2011 or finite elements choi et al 2011 or finite differences codes langevin et al 2010 somogyi et al 2015 among these solutions common hydrogeological and hydrological software such as modflow harbaugh et al 2000 mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 feflow diersch et al 2010 hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 are suitable for reproducing heat transfer between bhe and aquifer in different hydrogeological settings the modflow mt3dms finite difference code however has limitations to reproduce several bhes simultaneously in the same model because of the need of a very fine grid refinement modflow usg panday et al 2013 is the new version of the public domain software modflow and is able to overcome these limitations due to the use of an unstructured grid sbai 2020 and the cln package the code has the potential of efficiently simulating large complex subsurface thermal regimes and their interaction with gshp systems due to the unstructured grid capability that is effective for discretizing large domains at the appropriate resolution implementation of an unstructured formulation within the modflow framework modflow usg allows application of regional models to address local problems feinstein et al 2016 in addition to unstructured grids modflow usg implements a cln package of 1 d cylindrical cells that can be placed within a 3 d subsurface numerical grid the clns readily implement specific features such as a closed loop u shape pipe bhe no longer requiring detailed grid refinement as in angelotti et al 2014a up to now many authors mainly used finite elements codes to implement one or more bhe in aquifers casasso and sethi 2019 diersch et al 2011a 2011b piccinini et al 2012 al khoury et al al khoury et al 2010 implemented a double u pipe bhes in a finite element numerical model to simulate heat transfer with multiple bhes in a numerically efficient manner bauer et al bauer et al 2011 developed and applied a 3d numerical simulation model for a u shape pipe implementing each element of the bhe such as fluid inside well grout etc with simplified thermal resistance and capacity models brunetti et al brunetti et al 2017 implemented a computationally efficient pseudo 3d model by means of hydrus they validated it comparing the numerical results with a thermal response test trt data carried out at two different sites in japan and at last used it to study the influence of groundwater flow and geology on gshp success in numerical simulations of bhe systems in aquifers was followed by sensitivity studies that examined the impact and significance of hydrogeological and physical parameters casasso and sethi 2014 many studies focused on thermal perturbations in the aquifer related to bhes under different groundwater flow velocities angelotti et al 2014b florea et al 2017 zanchini et al 2012 capozza et al 2013 evaluated by means of analytical solutions moving line source the effect of groundwater flow on the thermal drift in the aquifer generated by the heating operation of a gshp and evaluated the influence of an existing borefield on a nearby one in presence of either still or moving groundwater the current paper compares the use of cln package through the modflow usg code against the numerical solution proposed in angelotti et al 2014a for implementing bhes and simulating the related thermal perturbation in groundwater at first a single bhe is implemented in a homogeneous aquifer and thermal and energy results are compared with angelotti s model that was already compared with experimental data antelmi 2016 and was implemented using a classic finite difference grid refinement then modflow usg is applied to simultaneously simulate several bhes to show how the cln package can efficiently simulate the thermal perturbation in groundwater in a single numerical model faster and without computational efforts 2 material and methods 2 1 groundwater flow modelling by means of modflow usg modflow usg is a three dimensional control volume finite difference cvfd groundwater flow modelling code first released in 2013 by the u s geological survey panday et al 2013 the cvfd approach allows design of flexible structured or unstructured 3 d grids represented by triangles rectangles hexagons etc to solve for the groundwater flow gwf process of the code furthermore grids can include local nesting or other refinement methods for example quadtree refinement is another way to develop a nested grid with flexibility to add grid refinement only where needed around a point along a line or within an area the structural flexibility of the grid is a relevant issue when a numerical model needs to reproduce local problems in regional simulations such as the influence of rivers or wells or to implement bhe or to discretize layers for better representations of hydro stratigraphic units the three dimensional groundwater flow equation for the cvfd formulation can be written as 1 k h n d s s s v h t w v where k is hydraulic conductivity h is hydraulic head ss is specific storage v is the volume t is time w is a volumetric source or sink per unit volume n is an outward pointing unit normal vector on the surface s of the volume note that the integral of equation 1 is a summation of flow between cells in a numerically discretized form the formulation in modflow usg also accounts for unconfined conditions which are simulated based on the routines available in modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 the newton raphson approach of modflow nwt provides for a robust efficient and stable solution methodology for simulating unconfined flow 2 2 connected linear network cln process a significant feature of modflow usg is the connected linear network cln process to reproduce one dimensional connection elements into a structured or unstructured three dimensional gwf process grid panday et al 2013 a one dimensional cln cell is a hydrogeologic or hydrologic water feature that has a cross sectional dimension smaller than the longitudinal flow component of the feature and the size of cell where is inserted a cln cell can reproduce wells pipes karst conduits fractures rivers and many linear components that requires flow connections with the aquifer when a cln element is implemented a new domain is created therefore the distinction between the cln domain for cln cells and the groundwater domain for gwf cells is necessary the cln cell is separate from the gwf cell with flow possibly occurring between them for instance groundwater flow to a pumping well that is represented by a vertical cylindrical cln cell the introduction of a cln component into the modelling domain is indeed equal to the introduction of a sub model a model inside the initial model with its own nodal numbering and flow and transport equations solved in the cln domain and possibly interacting with the gwf domain a strong capability of modflow usg is that the flow within the cln and gwf domains and their interactions is solved fully implicitly within one matrix thus the total number of cells in a model will be the sum of the number of cln and gwf cells which have flow terms that are solved simultaneously flow within the 1 d network of cln cells includes laminar and turbulent flow formulations thus flow within a cln pipe occurs due to head gradients within it against the resistance of the pipe or of fluid turbulence the formulation is similar to equation 1 for the gwf cell except that storage of fluid within the hollow of the pipe and the hydraulic conductivity is a function of the pipe flow formulation leakance formulations across the wetted circumference of the cln tube allow for interaction of water between cln pipe and gwf cells if necessary the leakance can be set to a null value in order to reproduce impermeable tubes alternate formulations are also provided and they used analytical solutions to produce grid independent solutions to flow between gwf and cln domains thus allowing for small diameter wells to be properly simulated even within a large dimension gwf cell neville and tonkin 2004 also the cvfd formulation allows for a pipe spanning multiple groundwater cells or for a network of multiple pipes to exist within a single groundwater cell since the flow is ruled by the connectivity and the area of flow between cells as noted in equation 1 this flexibility is important in discretization of the domains appropriate to the flow characteristics within it and one grid does not determine flexibility of another modflow usg applications commonly use clns to simulate pumping or abandoned wells within a groundwater domain the cln cells have also been used in a horizontal setting to simulate rivers and streams angled clns have been used to simulate karst features and clns have been used to represent multiple such features in one simulation setting what makes them ideal to simulate bhes is that a few cln cells can be joined in a u tube configuration to simulate flow of fluids within the bhes as well 2 3 heat transfer modelling there have been several version updates and enhancements to modflow usg since its initial release in 2013 several further developments have been published as open source and public domain usg transport software panday 2020 it is also available in groundwater vistas 7 gwv which was used for pre processing and post processing of data and output for this study among the additional capabilities the block centered transport bct package has a crucial role in the current study because it implements solute and heat transport in a porous medium and in a cln domain the code solves for solute transport equations immediately after groundwater flow equations as already discussed in alberti et al 2017 thorne et al 2006 the groundwater solute transport equation is comparable to the heat transport equation therefore the energy transport equation in groundwater can be written as 2 ϕ s w ρ w c w t t 1 ϕ ρ s c s t s t x i λ m ϕ s w ρ w c w α v i t x j x i ϕ s w ρ w c w v i t γ mc q b where ϕ is the porosity sw the saturation of water ρ w and ρ s the density of water and solid material cw and c s the specific heat capacity of water and solid t the temperature of water t the time ts the solid temperature λm the effective thermal conductivity of the medium vi the darcy velocity in direction xi α the dispersivity γ mc the heat exchange term between soil matrix and cln conduit cell and qb the boundary heat flux the energy conservation equation within the cln domain equation 2 can be written as 3 ρ w c w v s t t l cc λ cln v s ρ w c w α v cc t l cc ρ w c w v cc t l cc γ mc q b where vs is the fraction of the total volume of the cln cell that is saturated during unconfined conditions lcc is the length dimension of the cln cell λcln is the thermal conductivity along the length of the cln domain and vcc is the velocity of flow along the cln cell note that a cln cell can be vertical horizontal or angled equation 3 for heat transfer in the cln domain is similar to equation 2 for energy transport in the groundwater domain except that heat flow equation is 1 d along the length of the cln pipe instead of 3 d in the subsurface also in equation 3 the heat capacity of cln pipe is neglected only of water within the pipe is included and therefore an adsorption type term is not included furthermore as the heat conductance along the cln material is neglected then the effective cln heat conductance can be expressed only by the liquid phase conductance as follows 4 λ cln v s λ w note that the term γ mc appears with a negative sign in equation 2 but a positive sign in equation 3 because heat lost from the gwf domain will equal the heat gained by the cln domain this heat transfer occurs due to advection and dispersion and is expressed as 5 γ mc v mc t u m c l mc l mc α mc v mc v s λ mc t l mc where vmc is the flux per unit area from cln cell to gwf cell representing convective flux of heat between cln and gwf domain tu mc is the temperature of the upstream location between the matrix and the cln cell lmc is the hydraulic radius of the cln cell plus the effective cell radius of the gwf cell and λmc is the thermal conductivity between the porous matrix and the fluid within the cln pipe the first term on the right side of equation 5 represents advective heat transfer and the second term represents dispersive heat transfer but for closed bhe systems there is no interaction of fluids between the bhe pipe and the external groundwater and thus v mc will be zero the leakance between gwf and clns can be set to zero while solving for flow to simulate the closed bhe system for that case only the heat conductivity term between cln and gwf domains transfers energy between the domains i e no fluid transfer between the domains modflow usg code coupled with cln process does not yet include convective heat transfer coefficient which is considered relevant in the energy exchange performed by the bhe and in groundwater temperatures close to the bhe nevertheless this study mainly focuses on environmental impacts of bhe and on groundwater temperatures from 2 m up to 30 m downstream of the bhe where the convective heat transfer coefficient seems to represent a subdued percentage of the total energy exchanged with groundwater as explained in numerical results and discussion section modflow usg solves the energy transport equation in a fully implicit manner similar to the flow equation solution between domains thus energy transport within the gwf domain equation 3 energy transport within the cln domain equation 4 and energy transfer between domains equation 5 are all assembled into one matrix for solution of the entire system at each time step boundary conditions can then be provided to the gwf domain to simulate appropriate heat transfer into groundwater for example from to rivers recharge evapotranspiration wells etc those boundaries can be provided with a prescribed temperature condition or a prescribed heat flux condition with inflowing or outflowing water specifically for the bhe implementation a boundary conditions needs to be provided to cells of a cln tube to represent the heat input and output of the bhe a prescribed inflow temperature and inlet flow rate neumann condition should be assigned to the inlet cln node whereas just a constant flow rate have to be assigned to the oultlet cln node the representation of the bhe in the numerical model and the connections between gwf or cln nodes and boundary conditions is summarized in the fig 1 2 4 numerical model implementation of the bhe the implementation of a bhe in finite different codes was up to now quite complex the main limitation was the reproduction of circular geometries in codes such as modflow which use rectangular or square grids as discussed in angelotti et al 2014a a very strong grid refinement was necessary fig 2 a to validate the numerical model of a bhe related to analytical solutions in angelotti et al 2014a through modflow mt3dms the bhe was implemented as one u shape pipe where the heat carrier fluid flows vertically by means of 36 cells enclosed within 0 37 cm cells reproducing polyethylene grey cells in fig 2a a horizontal pipe section at the bottom of the bhe to join the two pipes angelotti et al 2014a and 3 vertical layers ranging in thickness from 0 37 to 3 36 cm for other details please see the publication of angelotti et al 2014a using modflow usg the bhe was implemented by means of two analytical elements named cln well and one named cln polyline fig 2b the cln well is a vertical conduit consisting of cln cells placed in all layers of the discretized 3 d gwf domain and used to reproduce the vertical inlet and outlet pipes of the u tube wells have circular geometry therefore they reproduce a real bhe more closely than the square section used in the modflow mt3dms model of angelotti et al 2014a the horizontal section of the bhe connecting outlet to inlet u pipe was implemented by means of the analytical element cln polyline generally used for horizontal hydraulic pipes the ensemble of the three cln elements ensures the continuous circulation of the heat carrier fluid inside the u pipe instead of assigning constant head boundary conditions to inlet outlet of the u pipe to reproduce the circulation as in angelotti et al 2014a users need only to insert the flow rate within the u pipe here 1000 kg h at the top of the inlet u pipe a constant temperature value depending on the heating or cooling period as shown in table 1 was assigned modifying the prescribed concentration boundary pcb package that is generally used to implement constant concentration boundary conditions barbieri 2020 in angelotti et al 2014a the numerical simulations were run imposing a constant heat rate reproducing trt such as in brunetti et al 2017 or a constant input temperature at the inlet pipe of the bhe reproducing the typical yearly operation of a gshp whereas in the present study modflow usg simulations were run only to reproduce the typical gshp yearly operation table 1 the case study implemented in modflow usg refers to a typical bhe consisting of a 100 m polyethylene u pipe with an inner radius of 2 cm and a pipe to pipe centers distance of 8 cm the u pipe is located into a 160 m saturated homogenous and not dispersive sandy aquifer for the sake of simplicity the borehole filling material grout is assumed to be equal to the surrounding soil the aquifer has an initial unperturbed uniform temperature of 11 8 c representative of the yearly average outdoor temperature in north italy hydrogeological and physical properties representing the aquifer were assigned to active cells using the same values implemented in angelotti et al 2014a and are shown in table 2 all the modflow usg models were compared to the angelotti model with a groundwater darcy velocity of 10 5 m s in following pages named ma in addition different groundwater velocities were also implemented by varying the hydraulic conductivity constant head 100 m and constant unperturbed temperature 11 8 c boundary conditions were assigned to the left side of the model domain while only constant head 99 5 m was assigned to the right one blue cells in fig 3 for a constant hydraulic gradient equal to 0 005 initial temperature of 11 8 c was set to the entire model domain the model domain is 100 m long and 50 m wide and according to the different grid refinement table 3 a different number of cells was adopted varying from 80 432 to 375536 for each model the vertical domain was discretized into 16 layers with a constant thickness equal to 10 m for an aquifer depth of 160 m and the properties are always the same reported in table 2 2 5 numerical model grid refinement to test the impact of grid resolution on the results different numerical models implementing different grid refinement solutions were compared with the angelotti et al 2014a as shown in table 3 and fig 4 the cln qt1 cln qt2 and cln qt3 models were implemented using a quadtree refinement located around the bhe respectively with a minimum cell size ranging from 5 to 50 cm otherwise the cln 1 cln 2 and cln 3 models were implemented using a classic refinement similar to the ma model with a minimum cell size again ranging from 5 to 50 cm the quadtree refinement is performed by division of the study area in different zones which correspond to the zones with different cells size or refinement smaller cells are in higher numbered zones a maximum of 7 zones can be defined and the zone number 1 is the area where the cells are not divided zone 2 is the area where each cell is divided in 4 cells zone 3 is the area where each cell is divided in 16 cells and so on up to zone 7 in each model the two analytical elements cln well described above were inserted in two adjacent cells which dimensions are shown in table 3 for each model the two cln well elements interconnected at layer 10 by cln polyline were always horizontally inserted at the same distance 8 cm and vertically from layer 1 to layer 10 to compare the results of the new models to the ma model an absolute residual value of temperature was calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the temperature achieved in the ma model and the temperature in new models the residual values were calculated at 4 different times t one for each operation period or at certain distances d for observation points downstream of the bhe with the following formulations 6 t res t t ma t t model t 7 t res d t ma d t model d where tres is the difference between the temperature achieved in ma model tma and the temperature achieved in new models tmodel reported in table 3 3 numerical results and discussion in this section the results of the heat transport numerical simulations are discussed showing the comparison between ma model and cln models varying the grid refinement and the darcy velocities and the number of bhe in a borefield once the model with one bhe was validated other models were implemented to reproduce more than one bhe in the same modelling domain 3 1 grid refinement 3 1 1 heat carrier fluid temperature at the outlet pipe of the bhe the outlet temperatures of the heat carrier fluid circulating inside the bhe are shown only for the winter season after 180 days of simulation in table 4 these values reproduce the temperature value of the fluid at the last outlet section pipe of the bhe regardless of the temperature distribution along the entire depth of the bhe the outlet fluid temperatures are in accordance with the ma model up to 11 considering that both the results of the ma model were validated with respect to analytical solutions showing 10 variation and were compared with experimental data antelmi et al 2020 ly 2015 the differences achieved are similar therefore they showed good accordance cln qt3 and cln 3 models respectively a quadtree and classical refinement with a minimum cell size of 50 cm showed the best fit when compared to ma model the ma model showed more problems to reach convergence specifically one run took a long time to reach the final solution and moreover before the run a lot of time and effort was spent to find the right set of solver parameters in mt3dms that allowed convergence of the solution differently the modflow usg models did not have convergence issues did not need to find convergence parameters and ran quickly 3 1 2 energy exchanged by the bhe a further comparison related to the outlet fluid temperatures was based on the exchanged energy between the bhe and the aquifer calculated from the heat rate exchanged q in each time step 8 q m c w t in t out where m is the mass flow rate circulating in the bhe tin is the bhe fluid inlet temperature and tout is the fluid outlet temperature the simulations last 180 day for heating period inlet fluid temperature equal to 1 c and 90 days for cooling period inlet fluid temperature equal to 28 c after a few days the heat rate values reached a steady state condition because of the significant groundwater velocity 10 5 m s the energy exchange that is the integral underlying the heat rate curve q for specific time period was calculated for both winter and summer season and shown in table 5 from the table 5 each model showed a higher energy exchange in winter season than in summer because of the initial hypothesis of stress periods length table 1 the differences between ma model and remaining models are equal in winter and summer seasons the difference between ma model and cln models was less than 13 specifically for the cooling season maximum difference was achieved for cln qt1 classic refinement and cell size of 6 cm and for cln 1 quadtree refinement and cell size of 5 cm respectively equal to 11 and 12 9 these differences agreed with the outlet fluid temperatures and were considered acceptable 3 1 3 temperature in the aquifer groundwater temperatures of an observation well located at 5 m downstream of the bhe were monitored for a period of one year in each layer since the aquifer is sandy homogeneous temperatures along the depth varied less than 0 1 c therefore a medium depth corresponding to layer 5 45 m depth was chosen as the most representative of the vertical profile fig 5 in each model during winter or summer season the temperature reached an equilibrium value after a few days similarly during the pauses the undisturbed value of the aquifer temperature 11 8 c was rapidly reached this is due to the advection phenomenon that ruled the heat transfer in these simulations in fig 5 ma model reached a temperature value equal to 11 2 c during the heating period and 12 8 c during the cooling period of the gshp in table 6 the absolute residual values of temperature compared to the ma model were calculated at the observation point 5 m downstream of the bhe as in equation 6 at 4 different times one for each simulation period winter spring summer and autumn seasons the absolute residual temperature showed a good agreement between ma model and new models during heating period t 109 d or during cooling period t 249 d the worst temperature differences were respectively less than 0 16 c and 0 24 c during the pause the differences become negligible in summary in this observation point the difference between ma model and new models was always less than 0 25 c therefore the ability of each new model to reproduce groundwater temperatures similar to the ma model was clear further checks were carried out on the groundwater temperature for a specific time at the end of the heating period along distance downstream of the bhe as above the groundwater temperature values refer to layer 5 at 8 different observation points located into the domain for a distance from bhe ranging from 5 cm to 10 m fig 6 from fig 6 cln qt1 and cln 1 model showed temperatures closest to the ma model on the other hand models less discretized cln qt2 cln 2 cln qt3 and cln 3 showed high temperature values around the bhe despite similar results to ma model in terms of outlet fluid temperature and exchanged energies this is what it was expected because the implementation of the cln package is comparable to a sub model inside another model where cln cells are connected to gwf cells by means of the equation 5 grid resolution was therefore significant in the evaluation of temperature around the bhe for instance between the bhe and 50 cm downstream of it cln qt3 model has only one groundwater temperature value i e one node cln qt2 has 2 values cln qt1 has 9 values due to the larger number of cells same explanation can be given for cln 1 cln 2 and cln 3 models in table 7 the absolute residual values of temperature were calculated for the same observation points at the same time as in equation 7 equal to the end of the heating period table 7 shows higher absolute residual values of temperature in the proximity of the bhe 0 05 m and 0 24 m and especially in the cln qt3 and cln 3 models due to their coarse spatial discretization from the distance of 5 m downstream of the bhe typical value of interaxle spacing between adjacent bhes in a borefield the maximum temperature difference between the validated model and new models is equal to 0 16 c therefore the adaptation performed on the cln package is adequate to numerically simulate the heat transfer in aquifer as previously discussed the cln approach does not consider the convective heat transfer coefficient but on the opposite it was accounted in the ma model which represented through 36 cells the water flowing into the pipe nevertheless considering the domain beyond 2 m from the bhe as the above results show each modflow usg model simulates groundwater temperatures very close to the one simulated in the ma validated model therefore when the simulations aim is the environmental impact neglecting the convective heat transfer coefficient does not lead to wrong results differently the discrepancy in energy and temperatures close to the bhe results are more relevant and when the simulations aim is the evaluation of the bhe energy performances indeed that mechanism should be considered 3 2 darcy velocities further efforts were conducted on the quadtree refinement models cln qt1 cln qt2 and cln qt3 varying the hydraulic conductivity values so considering the darcy velocity as product of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient it ranged from a maximum of 10 4 m s to minimum of 10 6 m s the aim was to evaluate how the heat transfer changed when the advection term varied such as in angelotti et al 2014a the results were compared in terms of groundwater temperature fig 7 and exchanged energy between bhe and aquifer at the end of the heating period the groundwater temperatures in the case of darcy velocity equal to 10 5 m s corresponds to the ma model and was reported in previous fig 6 examining the results at the end of the heating period when the groundwater flow velocity increased the cold thermal plume moved faster downstream of the bhe in fig 7 a the groundwater temperatures were highest in the proximity of the bhe with a minimum value of 9 3 c corresponding to cln qt1 model when the groundwater flow velocity was lower 10 6 m s the thermal plume moved slowly and lower values up to 5 5 c corresponding to cln qt1 model were achieved close to the bhe fig 7 b this result is confirmed by the prevalence of the advection term when groundwater flow is high the water coming from upstream with an undisturbed temperature equal to 11 8 c washed away the cold plume stretching it and groundwater temperatures result closer to the undisturbed temperature value for the 3 velocities cln qt1 showed temperatures closest to the ma model confirming that a high grid refinement is able to give better results throughout the domain on the other hand the coarser grids gave larger errors closer to the bhe and mainly for highest velocities than for lower ones fig 7 b generally it is possible to affirm that the cln qt1 cln qt2 and cln qt3 models were in accordance with the ma model as after 5 m downstream the bhe the temperature difference result less than 0 25 c as seen for the groundwater flow velocity equal to 10 5 m s the results of the exchanged energy showed the same results discussed in angelotti et al 2014a where as the groundwater velocity increased the energy performance of gshp system proportionally increased for each new model regardless of the spatial discretization used 3 3 application to a borefield of 7 bhe finally the 3 models above described implementing cln package and quadtree refinement were used to simulate 7 bhes at the same time here the intention was to show the potentialities of the new way to represent bhe by means of cln elements and quadtree and to evaluate bhes overlapping effects the area where the quadtree refinement was applied was extended because of the presence at the 7 bhes as noted on fig 8 the bhes properties are the same as the previous models the distance between each bhe was equal to 7 m and they were located parallel to the groundwater flow direction this choice allowed examination of overlapping thermal plumes and evaluation of the groundwater temperature distribution in several downgradient observation points the darcy velocity was equal to 10 5 m s the numerical simulations were performed assuming a heating operation of 180 days with a constant inlet fluid temperature 1 c fig 9 shows the groundwater temperature distribution downstream of the 7 bhes layer 5 at the end of the simulation comparing fig 6 and 9 the temperatures in the proximity of the bhes are lower than the same model where only one bhe was present in the domain for instance in the new simulations groundwater temperatures of the cln qt1 model ranged from a minimum of 6 5 c at 5 cm downstream of the 7th bhe to a maximum of 10 4 c at 10 m downstream of the 7th bhe whereas in the model representing one bhe groundwater temperatures were higher ranging from 7 2 c to 11 2 c similar behavior can be observed for the cln qt2 and cln qt3 cases this is due to the overlapping effects created by the gshp heating operation the effect of the overlapping is also clearly showed by the analysis of the exchanged energies during the heating period the energy exchanged by the bhe 7 that is influenced by the six cold plumes flowing from the upstream exchangers ranges from 16 to 19 lower than the bhe 1 depending on the grid discretization implemented in the considered numerical model the numerical simulations showed the great advantage of simulating simultaneously more than one bhe in a unique numerical model to evaluate the impact of implementation of one or more geothermal probes on groundwater and on each other this is possible by adapting the cln package and using special grid refinement no comparison with ma model was carried out because to reproduce more than one bhe with a strong grid refinement was not practical and quite impossible for the numerical burden 4 conclusions evaluation of the thermal perturbation of aquifers in cities is an interesting and practical theme the comprehension of the anthropogenic forcing able to alter the unperturbed thermal regime of a city s aquifer is essential this study explains how to implement bhe in an aquifer by means of the finite difference code modflow usg in a more efficient innovative and quick way compared to the classic modflow mt3d approach the proposed methodology involves the use of vertical and horizontal cln elements to reproduce the u pipe of a real bhe to verify proper operation of the bhe system in an aquifer as represented by the cln package different numerical models were implemented varying the spatial grid discretization around the bhe three numerical models were implemented by means of a new grid refinement method quadtree refinement available in modflow usg and three models were implemented by means of a classical refinement method the minimum cell dimension where the bhe was located ranged from 5 cm to 50 cm the results of the new numerical simulations were compared to the ma model angelotti et al 2014a implemented in modflow mt3dms and previously validated through the comparison with an analytical solution comparing the temperatures of the heat carrier fluid at the outlet pipe the difference between the cln models and the ma model was less than 0 6 c in terms of exchanged energies the difference was less than 13 groundwater temperatures at distances greater than 5 m downstream of the bhe show differences between new models and ma model of less than 0 25 c some refined grid configurations were closest to the results of the ma model including the case with a cell size of 50 cm such a configuration is the right compromise because it is closer to the validated model ma and is easily implementable into practical models without strong grid refinement other simulations were performed varying the groundwater flow velocity and the results achieved were very similar to the ma model a strong increase in energy performance and a lower thermal disturbance in terms of absolute groundwater temperature values was noted as velocity increases the new approach with the cln package and quadtree refinement in modflow usg unlike the conventional methodology of other finite difference codes shows the ability to simultaneously simulate more than one bhe in an aquifer in a single heat transport numerical model this could provide the gshp system designer additional insights resulting from the modeling of heat transfer in the aquifer and the evaluation of bhe interferences in addition by means of predictive modelling scenarios environmental consultants will also be able to estimate the contribution of different gshp systems in total aquifer thermal perturbation this work represents the first published application of the cln package or bhe simulation and in future some improvements and in depth analysis should be done in order to refine the package capacity to fully represent the involved heat transport mechanisms the cln approach does not consider the convective heat transfer coefficient but when the simulations aim is the environmental impact neglecting this coefficient does not lead to wrong results indeed the inclusion of this mechanism would improve the capacity of cln to simulate the bhe energy performances and the outlet fluid temperatures with a greater accuracy furthermore an additional validation through experimental data e g trt would allow another step in the cln package reliability assessment even if at present is not possible to simulate a constant heat rate test through the cln package this option is presently under implementation and will be available for additional investigations credit authorship contribution statement matteo antelmi resources methodology software validation investigation data

4725,simulating heat transfer in an aquifer with one or more vertical borehole heat exchangers bhes of a ground source heat pump gshp system by means of a finite difference code is difficult because of the square or rectangular geometry grid and computational times thus limiting the types of evaluations that can be performed the aim of this work is to explore through modflow usg code public domain software a different approach towards simulating a borefield that would be more efficient computationally in order to enable simulations of larger domains with multiple bhes the connected linear network cln package introduced in modflow usg generally simulates 1 d linear computational cells in a 3 d grid such as hydraulic pipes in subsoil but for the first time has been adapted to reproduce vertical closed loop u pipe of a bhe therefore this work evaluates the modflow usg and cln package capability to reproduce the yearly operation of one or more bhes in an aquifer as a simpler and faster approach compared to a very fine finite difference discretization once the cln package was adapted a sensitivity analysis on the grid size refinement was performed there were several findings from this work the results of the different numerical models were in good agreement with an already validated model in terms of exchanged energies and aquifer thermal perturbation same analyses were carried out for different groundwater flow velocities and it was confirmed that the exchanged energy by a bhe increases with the groundwater flow velocity in accordance with literature studies at last a borefield of 7 bhes was implemented in a numerical model in a more expeditious and efficient way and without any computational effort keywords borehole heat exchanger cln package

the temperature variation of groundwater flow that needs to be monitored in cities with low enthalpy geothermal systems or other anthropogenic forces e g underground tunnels sewage leaks or heating networks many authors studied how the groundwater temperature is influenced by climate change or anthropogenic forcers kupfersberger et al 2017 taylor and stefan 2009 specifically an increase of groundwater temperature affects the physical biological and chemical properties of the aquifer hähnlein et al 2013 riedel 2019 such as aquifer dependent organisms and ecosystems hancock et al 2009 mixing processes of groundwater flow bonte et al 2011 and silicates dissolution arning et al 2006 ground source heat pumps gshp using borehole heat exchangers bhe and groundwater heat pumps gwhp using injection extraction wells are considered one of the main causes of the aquifer thermal perturbation ferguson and woodbury 2004 menberg et al 2013 even though this has not been adequately demonstrated lee and hahn 2006 the influence of gshp or gwhp systems on aquifers underneath cities was studied by several authors guimerà et al guimerà et al 2007 found out that in several aquifers of european cities abnormal effects in aquifer s temperature were probably caused by intensive use of the geothermal resource in the summer season in summer in basel epting et al epting et al 2013 detected the maximum temperature of the aquifer right downstream of geothermal systems in zaragoza epting et al epting et al 2017 measured a groundwater temperature equal to 41 c downstream of geothermal systems compared to an average air temperature equal to 15 5 c whenever economic resources are not available for thermal monitoring of the aquifer a predictive analysis of the effects of gshp and gwhp systems by numerical modelling of flow and heat transport in aquifers is the least invasive and most effective approach for evaluating the thermal impacts of bhe systems several scientific studies examined the problem of the heat transport in aquifers by means of analytical solutions alcaraz et al 2016 molina giraldo et al 2011 or finite elements choi et al 2011 or finite differences codes langevin et al 2010 somogyi et al 2015 among these solutions common hydrogeological and hydrological software such as modflow harbaugh et al 2000 mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 feflow diersch et al 2010 hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 are suitable for reproducing heat transfer between bhe and aquifer in different hydrogeological settings the modflow mt3dms finite difference code however has limitations to reproduce several bhes simultaneously in the same model because of the need of a very fine grid refinement modflow usg panday et al 2013 is the new version of the public domain software modflow and is able to overcome these limitations due to the use of an unstructured grid sbai 2020 and the cln package the code has the potential of efficiently simulating large complex subsurface thermal regimes and their interaction with gshp systems due to the unstructured grid capability that is effective for discretizing large domains at the appropriate resolution implementation of an unstructured formulation within the modflow framework modflow usg allows application of regional models to address local problems feinstein et al 2016 in addition to unstructured grids modflow usg implements a cln package of 1 d cylindrical cells that can be placed within a 3 d subsurface numerical grid the clns readily implement specific features such as a closed loop u shape pipe bhe no longer requiring detailed grid refinement as in angelotti et al 2014a up to now many authors mainly used finite elements codes to implement one or more bhe in aquifers casasso and sethi 2019 diersch et al 2011a 2011b piccinini et al 2012 al khoury et al al khoury et al 2010 implemented a double u pipe bhes in a finite element numerical model to simulate heat transfer with multiple bhes in a numerically efficient manner bauer et al bauer et al 2011 developed and applied a 3d numerical simulation model for a u shape pipe implementing each element of the bhe such as fluid inside well grout etc with simplified thermal resistance and capacity models brunetti et al brunetti et al 2017 implemented a computationally efficient pseudo 3d model by means of hydrus they validated it comparing the numerical results with a thermal response test trt data carried out at two different sites in japan and at last used it to study the influence of groundwater flow and geology on gshp success in numerical simulations of bhe systems in aquifers was followed by sensitivity studies that examined the impact and significance of hydrogeological and physical parameters casasso and sethi 2014 many studies focused on thermal perturbations in the aquifer related to bhes under different groundwater flow velocities angelotti et al 2014b florea et al 2017 zanchini et al 2012 capozza et al 2013 evaluated by means of analytical solutions moving line source the effect of groundwater flow on the thermal drift in the aquifer generated by the heating operation of a gshp and evaluated the influence of an existing borefield on a nearby one in presence of either still or moving groundwater the current paper compares the use of cln package through the modflow usg code against the numerical solution proposed in angelotti et al 2014a for implementing bhes and simulating the related thermal perturbation in groundwater at first a single bhe is implemented in a homogeneous aquifer and thermal and energy results are compared with angelotti s model that was already compared with experimental data antelmi 2016 and was implemented using a classic finite difference grid refinement then modflow usg is applied to simultaneously simulate several bhes to show how the cln package can efficiently simulate the thermal perturbation in groundwater in a single numerical model faster and without computational efforts 2 material and methods 2 1 groundwater flow modelling by means of modflow usg modflow usg is a three dimensional control volume finite difference cvfd groundwater flow modelling code first released in 2013 by the u s geological survey panday et al 2013 the cvfd approach allows design of flexible structured or unstructured 3 d grids represented by triangles rectangles hexagons etc to solve for the groundwater flow gwf process of the code furthermore grids can include local nesting or other refinement methods for example quadtree refinement is another way to develop a nested grid with flexibility to add grid refinement only where needed around a point along a line or within an area the structural flexibility of the grid is a relevant issue when a numerical model needs to reproduce local problems in regional simulations such as the influence of rivers or wells or to implement bhe or to discretize layers for better representations of hydro stratigraphic units the three dimensional groundwater flow equation for the cvfd formulation can be written as 1 k h n d s s s v h t w v where k is hydraulic conductivity h is hydraulic head ss is specific storage v is the volume t is time w is a volumetric source or sink per unit volume n is an outward pointing unit normal vector on the surface s of the volume note that the integral of equation 1 is a summation of flow between cells in a numerically discretized form the formulation in modflow usg also accounts for unconfined conditions which are simulated based on the routines available in modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 the newton raphson approach of modflow nwt provides for a robust efficient and stable solution methodology for simulating unconfined flow 2 2 connected linear network cln process a significant feature of modflow usg is the connected linear network cln process to reproduce one dimensional connection elements into a structured or unstructured three dimensional gwf process grid panday et al 2013 a one dimensional cln cell is a hydrogeologic or hydrologic water feature that has a cross sectional dimension smaller than the longitudinal flow component of the feature and the size of cell where is inserted a cln cell can reproduce wells pipes karst conduits fractures rivers and many linear components that requires flow connections with the aquifer when a cln element is implemented a new domain is created therefore the distinction between the cln domain for cln cells and the groundwater domain for gwf cells is necessary the cln cell is separate from the gwf cell with flow possibly occurring between them for instance groundwater flow to a pumping well that is represented by a vertical cylindrical cln cell the introduction of a cln component into the modelling domain is indeed equal to the introduction of a sub model a model inside the initial model with its own nodal numbering and flow and transport equations solved in the cln domain and possibly interacting with the gwf domain a strong capability of modflow usg is that the flow within the cln and gwf domains and their interactions is solved fully implicitly within one matrix thus the total number of cells in a model will be the sum of the number of cln and gwf cells which have flow terms that are solved simultaneously flow within the 1 d network of cln cells includes laminar and turbulent flow formulations thus flow within a cln pipe occurs due to head gradients within it against the resistance of the pipe or of fluid turbulence the formulation is similar to equation 1 for the gwf cell except that storage of fluid within the hollow of the pipe and the hydraulic conductivity is a function of the pipe flow formulation leakance formulations across the wetted circumference of the cln tube allow for interaction of water between cln pipe and gwf cells if necessary the leakance can be set to a null value in order to reproduce impermeable tubes alternate formulations are also provided and they used analytical solutions to produce grid independent solutions to flow between gwf and cln domains thus allowing for small diameter wells to be properly simulated even within a large dimension gwf cell neville and tonkin 2004 also the cvfd formulation allows for a pipe spanning multiple groundwater cells or for a network of multiple pipes to exist within a single groundwater cell since the flow is ruled by the connectivity and the area of flow between cells as noted in equation 1 this flexibility is important in discretization of the domains appropriate to the flow characteristics within it and one grid does not determine flexibility of another modflow usg applications commonly use clns to simulate pumping or abandoned wells within a groundwater domain the cln cells have also been used in a horizontal setting to simulate rivers and streams angled clns have been used to simulate karst features and clns have been used to represent multiple such features in one simulation setting what makes them ideal to simulate bhes is that a few cln cells can be joined in a u tube configuration to simulate flow of fluids within the bhes as well 2 3 heat transfer modelling there have been several version updates and enhancements to modflow usg since its initial release in 2013 several further developments have been published as open source and public domain usg transport software panday 2020 it is also available in groundwater vistas 7 gwv which was used for pre processing and post processing of data and output for this study among the additional capabilities the block centered transport bct package has a crucial role in the current study because it implements solute and heat transport in a porous medium and in a cln domain the code solves for solute transport equations immediately after groundwater flow equations as already discussed in alberti et al 2017 thorne et al 2006 the groundwater solute transport equation is comparable to the heat transport equation therefore the energy transport equation in groundwater can be written as 2 ϕ s w ρ w c w t t 1 ϕ ρ s c s t s t x i λ m ϕ s w ρ w c w α v i t x j x i ϕ s w ρ w c w v i t γ mc q b where ϕ is the porosity sw the saturation of water ρ w and ρ s the density of water and solid material cw and c s the specific heat capacity of water and solid t the temperature of water t the time ts the solid temperature λm the effective thermal conductivity of the medium vi the darcy velocity in direction xi α the dispersivity γ mc the heat exchange term between soil matrix and cln conduit cell and qb the boundary heat flux the energy conservation equation within the cln domain equation 2 can be written as 3 ρ w c w v s t t l cc λ cln v s ρ w c w α v cc t l cc ρ w c w v cc t l cc γ mc q b where vs is the fraction of the total volume of the cln cell that is saturated during unconfined conditions lcc is the length dimension of the cln cell λcln is the thermal conductivity along the length of the cln domain and vcc is the velocity of flow along the cln cell note that a cln cell can be vertical horizontal or angled equation 3 for heat transfer in the cln domain is similar to equation 2 for energy transport in the groundwater domain except that heat flow equation is 1 d along the length of the cln pipe instead of 3 d in the subsurface also in equation 3 the heat capacity of cln pipe is neglected only of water within the pipe is included and therefore an adsorption type term is not included furthermore as the heat conductance along the cln material is neglected then the effective cln heat conductance can be expressed only by the liquid phase conductance as follows 4 λ cln v s λ w note that the term γ mc appears with a negative sign in equation 2 but a positive sign in equation 3 because heat lost from the gwf domain will equal the heat gained by the cln domain this heat transfer occurs due to advection and dispersion and is expressed as 5 γ mc v mc t u m c l mc l mc α mc v mc v s λ mc t l mc where vmc is the flux per unit area from cln cell to gwf cell representing convective flux of heat between cln and gwf domain tu mc is the temperature of the upstream location between the matrix and the cln cell lmc is the hydraulic radius of the cln cell plus the effective cell radius of the gwf cell and λmc is the thermal conductivity between the porous matrix and the fluid within the cln pipe the first term on the right side of equation 5 represents advective heat transfer and the second term represents dispersive heat transfer but for closed bhe systems there is no interaction of fluids between the bhe pipe and the external groundwater and thus v mc will be zero the leakance between gwf and clns can be set to zero while solving for flow to simulate the closed bhe system for that case only the heat conductivity term between cln and gwf domains transfers energy between the domains i e no fluid transfer between the domains modflow usg code coupled with cln process does not yet include convective heat transfer coefficient which is considered relevant in the energy exchange performed by the bhe and in groundwater temperatures close to the bhe nevertheless this study mainly focuses on environmental impacts of bhe and on groundwater temperatures from 2 m up to 30 m downstream of the bhe where the convective heat transfer coefficient seems to represent a subdued percentage of the total energy exchanged with groundwater as explained in numerical results and discussion section modflow usg solves the energy transport equation in a fully implicit manner similar to the flow equation solution between domains thus energy transport within the gwf domain equation 3 energy transport within the cln domain equation 4 and energy transfer between domains equation 5 are all assembled into one matrix for solution of the entire system at each time step boundary conditions can then be provided to the gwf domain to simulate appropriate heat transfer into groundwater for example from to rivers recharge evapotranspiration wells etc those boundaries can be provided with a prescribed temperature condition or a prescribed heat flux condition with inflowing or outflowing water specifically for the bhe implementation a boundary conditions needs to be provided to cells of a cln tube to represent the heat input and output of the bhe a prescribed inflow temperature and inlet flow rate neumann condition should be assigned to the inlet cln node whereas just a constant flow rate have to be assigned to the oultlet cln node the representation of the bhe in the numerical model and the connections between gwf or cln nodes and boundary conditions is summarized in the fig 1 2 4 numerical model implementation of the bhe the implementation of a bhe in finite different codes was up to now quite complex the main limitation was the reproduction of circular geometries in codes such as modflow which use rectangular or square grids as discussed in angelotti et al 2014a a very strong grid refinement was necessary fig 2 a to validate the numerical model of a bhe related to analytical solutions in angelotti et al 2014a through modflow mt3dms the bhe was implemented as one u shape pipe where the heat carrier fluid flows vertically by means of 36 cells enclosed within 0 37 cm cells reproducing polyethylene grey cells in fig 2a a horizontal pipe section at the bottom of the bhe to join the two pipes angelotti et al 2014a and 3 vertical layers ranging in thickness from 0 37 to 3 36 cm for other details please see the publication of angelotti et al 2014a using modflow usg the bhe was implemented by means of two analytical elements named cln well and one named cln polyline fig 2b the cln well is a vertical conduit consisting of cln cells placed in all layers of the discretized 3 d gwf domain and used to reproduce the vertical inlet and outlet pipes of the u tube wells have circular geometry therefore they reproduce a real bhe more closely than the square section used in the modflow mt3dms model of angelotti et al 2014a the horizontal section of the bhe connecting outlet to inlet u pipe was implemented by means of the analytical element cln polyline generally used for horizontal hydraulic pipes the ensemble of the three cln elements ensures the continuous circulation of the heat carrier fluid inside the u pipe instead of assigning constant head boundary conditions to inlet outlet of the u pipe to reproduce the circulation as in angelotti et al 2014a users need only to insert the flow rate within the u pipe here 1000 kg h at the top of the inlet u pipe a constant temperature value depending on the heating or cooling period as shown in table 1 was assigned modifying the prescribed concentration boundary pcb package that is generally used to implement constant concentration boundary conditions barbieri 2020 in angelotti et al 2014a the numerical simulations were run imposing a constant heat rate reproducing trt such as in brunetti et al 2017 or a constant input temperature at the inlet pipe of the bhe reproducing the typical yearly operation of a gshp whereas in the present study modflow usg simulations were run only to reproduce the typical gshp yearly operation table 1 the case study implemented in modflow usg refers to a typical bhe consisting of a 100 m polyethylene u pipe with an inner radius of 2 cm and a pipe to pipe centers distance of 8 cm the u pipe is located into a 160 m saturated homogenous and not dispersive sandy aquifer for the sake of simplicity the borehole filling material grout is assumed to be equal to the surrounding soil the aquifer has an initial unperturbed uniform temperature of 11 8 c representative of the yearly average outdoor temperature in north italy hydrogeological and physical properties representing the aquifer were assigned to active cells using the same values implemented in angelotti et al 2014a and are shown in table 2 all the modflow usg models were compared to the angelotti model with a groundwater darcy velocity of 10 5 m s in following pages named ma in addition different groundwater velocities were also implemented by varying the hydraulic conductivity constant head 100 m and constant unperturbed temperature 11 8 c boundary conditions were assigned to the left side of the model domain while only constant head 99 5 m was assigned to the right one blue cells in fig 3 for a constant hydraulic gradient equal to 0 005 initial temperature of 11 8 c was set to the entire model domain the model domain is 100 m long and 50 m wide and according to the different grid refinement table 3 a different number of cells was adopted varying from 80 432 to 375536 for each model the vertical domain was discretized into 16 layers with a constant thickness equal to 10 m for an aquifer depth of 160 m and the properties are always the same reported in table 2 2 5 numerical model grid refinement to test the impact of grid resolution on the results different numerical models implementing different grid refinement solutions were compared with the angelotti et al 2014a as shown in table 3 and fig 4 the cln qt1 cln qt2 and cln qt3 models were implemented using a quadtree refinement located around the bhe respectively with a minimum cell size ranging from 5 to 50 cm otherwise the cln 1 cln 2 and cln 3 models were implemented using a classic refinement similar to the ma model with a minimum cell size again ranging from 5 to 50 cm the quadtree refinement is performed by division of the study area in different zones which correspond to the zones with different cells size or refinement smaller cells are in higher numbered zones a maximum of 7 zones can be defined and the zone number 1 is the area where the cells are not divided zone 2 is the area where each cell is divided in 4 cells zone 3 is the area where each cell is divided in 16 cells and so on up to zone 7 in each model the two analytical elements cln well described above were inserted in two adjacent cells which dimensions are shown in table 3 for each model the two cln well elements interconnected at layer 10 by cln polyline were always horizontally inserted at the same distance 8 cm and vertically from layer 1 to layer 10 to compare the results of the new models to the ma model an absolute residual value of temperature was calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the temperature achieved in the ma model and the temperature in new models the residual values were calculated at 4 different times t one for each operation period or at certain distances d for observation points downstream of the bhe with the following formulations 6 t res t t ma t t model t 7 t res d t ma d t model d where tres is the difference between the temperature achieved in ma model tma and the temperature achieved in new models tmodel reported in table 3 3 numerical results and discussion in this section the results of the heat transport numerical simulations are discussed showing the comparison between ma model and cln models varying the grid refinement and the darcy velocities and the number of bhe in a borefield once the model with one bhe was validated other models were implemented to reproduce more than one bhe in the same modelling domain 3 1 grid refinement 3 1 1 heat carrier fluid temperature at the outlet pipe of the bhe the outlet temperatures of the heat carrier fluid circulating inside the bhe are shown only for the winter season after 180 days of simulation in table 4 these values reproduce the temperature value of the fluid at the last outlet section pipe of the bhe regardless of the temperature distribution along the entire depth of the bhe the outlet fluid temperatures are in accordance with the ma model up to 11 considering that both the results of the ma model were validated with respect to analytical solutions showing 10 variation and were compared with experimental data antelmi et al 2020 ly 2015 the differences achieved are similar therefore they showed good accordance cln qt3 and cln 3 models respectively a quadtree and classical refinement with a minimum cell size of 50 cm showed the best fit when compared to ma model the ma model showed more problems to reach convergence specifically one run took a long time to reach the final solution and moreover before the run a lot of time and effort was spent to find the right set of solver parameters in mt3dms that allowed convergence of the solution differently the modflow usg models did not have convergence issues did not need to find convergence parameters and ran quickly 3 1 2 energy exchanged by the bhe a further comparison related to the outlet fluid temperatures was based on the exchanged energy between the bhe and the aquifer calculated from the heat rate exchanged q in each time step 8 q m c w t in t out where m is the mass flow rate circulating in the bhe tin is the bhe fluid inlet temperature and tout is the fluid outlet temperature the simulations last 180 day for heating period inlet fluid temperature equal to 1 c and 90 days for cooling period inlet fluid temperature equal to 28 c after a few days the heat rate values reached a steady state condition because of the significant groundwater velocity 10 5 m s the energy exchange that is the integral underlying the heat rate curve q for specific time period was calculated for both winter and summer season and shown in table 5 from the table 5 each model showed a higher energy exchange in winter season than in summer because of the initial hypothesis of stress periods length table 1 the differences between ma model and remaining models are equal in winter and summer seasons the difference between ma model and cln models was less than 13 specifically for the cooling season maximum difference was achieved for cln qt1 classic refinement and cell size of 6 cm and for cln 1 quadtree refinement and cell size of 5 cm respectively equal to 11 and 12 9 these differences agreed with the outlet fluid temperatures and were considered acceptable 3 1 3 temperature in the aquifer groundwater temperatures of an observation well located at 5 m downstream of the bhe were monitored for a period of one year in each layer since the aquifer is sandy homogeneous temperatures along the depth varied less than 0 1 c therefore a medium depth corresponding to layer 5 45 m depth was chosen as the most representative of the vertical profile fig 5 in each model during winter or summer season the temperature reached an equilibrium value after a few days similarly during the pauses the undisturbed value of the aquifer temperature 11 8 c was rapidly reached this is due to the advection phenomenon that ruled the heat transfer in these simulations in fig 5 ma model reached a temperature value equal to 11 2 c during the heating period and 12 8 c during the cooling period of the gshp in table 6 the absolute residual values of temperature compared to the ma model were calculated at the observation point 5 m downstream of the bhe as in equation 6 at 4 different times one for each simulation period winter spring summer and autumn seasons the absolute residual temperature showed a good agreement between ma model and new models during heating period t 109 d or during cooling period t 249 d the worst temperature differences were respectively less than 0 16 c and 0 24 c during the pause the differences become negligible in summary in this observation point the difference between ma model and new models was always less than 0 25 c therefore the ability of each new model to reproduce groundwater temperatures similar to the ma model was clear further checks were carried out on the groundwater temperature for a specific time at the end of the heating period along distance downstream of the bhe as above the groundwater temperature values refer to layer 5 at 8 different observation points located into the domain for a distance from bhe ranging from 5 cm to 10 m fig 6 from fig 6 cln qt1 and cln 1 model showed temperatures closest to the ma model on the other hand models less discretized cln qt2 cln 2 cln qt3 and cln 3 showed high temperature values around the bhe despite similar results to ma model in terms of outlet fluid temperature and exchanged energies this is what it was expected because the implementation of the cln package is comparable to a sub model inside another model where cln cells are connected to gwf cells by means of the equation 5 grid resolution was therefore significant in the evaluation of temperature around the bhe for instance between the bhe and 50 cm downstream of it cln qt3 model has only one groundwater temperature value i e one node cln qt2 has 2 values cln qt1 has 9 values due to the larger number of cells same explanation can be given for cln 1 cln 2 and cln 3 models in table 7 the absolute residual values of temperature were calculated for the same observation points at the same time as in equation 7 equal to the end of the heating period table 7 shows higher absolute residual values of temperature in the proximity of the bhe 0 05 m and 0 24 m and especially in the cln qt3 and cln 3 models due to their coarse spatial discretization from the distance of 5 m downstream of the bhe typical value of interaxle spacing between adjacent bhes in a borefield the maximum temperature difference between the validated model and new models is equal to 0 16 c therefore the adaptation performed on the cln package is adequate to numerically simulate the heat transfer in aquifer as previously discussed the cln approach does not consider the convective heat transfer coefficient but on the opposite it was accounted in the ma model which represented through 36 cells the water flowing into the pipe nevertheless considering the domain beyond 2 m from the bhe as the above results show each modflow usg model simulates groundwater temperatures very close to the one simulated in the ma validated model therefore when the simulations aim is the environmental impact neglecting the convective heat transfer coefficient does not lead to wrong results differently the discrepancy in energy and temperatures close to the bhe results are more relevant and when the simulations aim is the evaluation of the bhe energy performances indeed that mechanism should be considered 3 2 darcy velocities further efforts were conducted on the quadtree refinement models cln qt1 cln qt2 and cln qt3 varying the hydraulic conductivity values so considering the darcy velocity as product of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient it ranged from a maximum of 10 4 m s to minimum of 10 6 m s the aim was to evaluate how the heat transfer changed when the advection term varied such as in angelotti et al 2014a the results were compared in terms of groundwater temperature fig 7 and exchanged energy between bhe and aquifer at the end of the heating period the groundwater temperatures in the case of darcy velocity equal to 10 5 m s corresponds to the ma model and was reported in previous fig 6 examining the results at the end of the heating period when the groundwater flow velocity increased the cold thermal plume moved faster downstream of the bhe in fig 7 a the groundwater temperatures were highest in the proximity of the bhe with a minimum value of 9 3 c corresponding to cln qt1 model when the groundwater flow velocity was lower 10 6 m s the thermal plume moved slowly and lower values up to 5 5 c corresponding to cln qt1 model were achieved close to the bhe fig 7 b this result is confirmed by the prevalence of the advection term when groundwater flow is high the water coming from upstream with an undisturbed temperature equal to 11 8 c washed away the cold plume stretching it and groundwater temperatures result closer to the undisturbed temperature value for the 3 velocities cln qt1 showed temperatures closest to the ma model confirming that a high grid refinement is able to give better results throughout the domain on the other hand the coarser grids gave larger errors closer to the bhe and mainly for highest velocities than for lower ones fig 7 b generally it is possible to affirm that the cln qt1 cln qt2 and cln qt3 models were in accordance with the ma model as after 5 m downstream the bhe the temperature difference result less than 0 25 c as seen for the groundwater flow velocity equal to 10 5 m s the results of the exchanged energy showed the same results discussed in angelotti et al 2014a where as the groundwater velocity increased the energy performance of gshp system proportionally increased for each new model regardless of the spatial discretization used 3 3 application to a borefield of 7 bhe finally the 3 models above described implementing cln package and quadtree refinement were used to simulate 7 bhes at the same time here the intention was to show the potentialities of the new way to represent bhe by means of cln elements and quadtree and to evaluate bhes overlapping effects the area where the quadtree refinement was applied was extended because of the presence at the 7 bhes as noted on fig 8 the bhes properties are the same as the previous models the distance between each bhe was equal to 7 m and they were located parallel to the groundwater flow direction this choice allowed examination of overlapping thermal plumes and evaluation of the groundwater temperature distribution in several downgradient observation points the darcy velocity was equal to 10 5 m s the numerical simulations were performed assuming a heating operation of 180 days with a constant inlet fluid temperature 1 c fig 9 shows the groundwater temperature distribution downstream of the 7 bhes layer 5 at the end of the simulation comparing fig 6 and 9 the temperatures in the proximity of the bhes are lower than the same model where only one bhe was present in the domain for instance in the new simulations groundwater temperatures of the cln qt1 model ranged from a minimum of 6 5 c at 5 cm downstream of the 7th bhe to a maximum of 10 4 c at 10 m downstream of the 7th bhe whereas in the model representing one bhe groundwater temperatures were higher ranging from 7 2 c to 11 2 c similar behavior can be observed for the cln qt2 and cln qt3 cases this is due to the overlapping effects created by the gshp heating operation the effect of the overlapping is also clearly showed by the analysis of the exchanged energies during the heating period the energy exchanged by the bhe 7 that is influenced by the six cold plumes flowing from the upstream exchangers ranges from 16 to 19 lower than the bhe 1 depending on the grid discretization implemented in the considered numerical model the numerical simulations showed the great advantage of simulating simultaneously more than one bhe in a unique numerical model to evaluate the impact of implementation of one or more geothermal probes on groundwater and on each other this is possible by adapting the cln package and using special grid refinement no comparison with ma model was carried out because to reproduce more than one bhe with a strong grid refinement was not practical and quite impossible for the numerical burden 4 conclusions evaluation of the thermal perturbation of aquifers in cities is an interesting and practical theme the comprehension of the anthropogenic forcing able to alter the unperturbed thermal regime of a city s aquifer is essential this study explains how to implement bhe in an aquifer by means of the finite difference code modflow usg in a more efficient innovative and quick way compared to the classic modflow mt3d approach the proposed methodology involves the use of vertical and horizontal cln elements to reproduce the u pipe of a real bhe to verify proper operation of the bhe system in an aquifer as represented by the cln package different numerical models were implemented varying the spatial grid discretization around the bhe three numerical models were implemented by means of a new grid refinement method quadtree refinement available in modflow usg and three models were implemented by means of a classical refinement method the minimum cell dimension where the bhe was located ranged from 5 cm to 50 cm the results of the new numerical simulations were compared to the ma model angelotti et al 2014a implemented in modflow mt3dms and previously validated through the comparison with an analytical solution comparing the temperatures of the heat carrier fluid at the outlet pipe the difference between the cln models and the ma model was less than 0 6 c in terms of exchanged energies the difference was less than 13 groundwater temperatures at distances greater than 5 m downstream of the bhe show differences between new models and ma model of less than 0 25 c some refined grid configurations were closest to the results of the ma model including the case with a cell size of 50 cm such a configuration is the right compromise because it is closer to the validated model ma and is easily implementable into practical models without strong grid refinement other simulations were performed varying the groundwater flow velocity and the results achieved were very similar to the ma model a strong increase in energy performance and a lower thermal disturbance in terms of absolute groundwater temperature values was noted as velocity increases the new approach with the cln package and quadtree refinement in modflow usg unlike the conventional methodology of other finite difference codes shows the ability to simultaneously simulate more than one bhe in an aquifer in a single heat transport numerical model this could provide the gshp system designer additional insights resulting from the modeling of heat transfer in the aquifer and the evaluation of bhe interferences in addition by means of predictive modelling scenarios environmental consultants will also be able to estimate the contribution of different gshp systems in total aquifer thermal perturbation this work represents the first published application of the cln package or bhe simulation and in future some improvements and in depth analysis should be done in order to refine the package capacity to fully represent the involved heat transport mechanisms the cln approach does not consider the convective heat transfer coefficient but when the simulations aim is the environmental impact neglecting this coefficient does not lead to wrong results indeed the inclusion of this mechanism would improve the capacity of cln to simulate the bhe energy performances and the outlet fluid temperatures with a greater accuracy furthermore an additional validation through experimental data e g trt would allow another step in the cln package reliability assessment even if at present is not possible to simulate a constant heat rate test through the cln package this option is presently under implementation and will be available for additional investigations credit authorship contribution statement matteo antelmi resources methodology software validation investigation data

4726,groundwater plays a vital role in food security water availability and economic growth of more than 1 3 billion people in india notwithstanding the development of irrigation schemes based on surface water groundwater remains a primary source of irrigation in large parts of the country the green revolution in the 1970s contributed considerably to increasing food production in india through the development of groundwater based irrigation which resulted in an expansion of irrigated area and a rapid rise in the number of electric and diesel pumps a large part of the rain fed area was converted to irrigated agriculture leading to growing multiple crops in a year with increased crop yields while the expansion in groundwater based irrigation helped meet the rising food demands of a large population of india it has resulted in several environmental implications groundwater depletion in india has now become one of the most prominent challenges for food and water security both in situ and satellite based observations indicate a rapid decline in groundwater storage in north india both natural and anthropogenic factors cause groundwater depletion in india groundwater pumping for irrigation remains the primary driver of groundwater depletion which can further affect food and water security in india under climate change both in situ and satellite based measurements have issues and uncertainty land surface hydrological models provide essential insights in understanding the groundwater storage variability however need improvements in the representation of complex processes related to climate human interactions sustainable management of groundwater in india is vital for tackling growing challenges related to water availability here we discuss the challenges and opportunities related to the measurements and modelling of groundwater groundwater recharge cropping systems and irrigation efficiency and social and policy reforms for sustainable groundwater management in india keywords groundwater groundwater depletion irrigation groundwater recharge grace groundwater pumping 1 introduction climate change and population growth have significantly affected the global water resources in the 20th century and are likely to pose more challenges in the future milly et al 2005 vörösmarty et al 2000 groundwater is an essential source of freshwater meeting the domestic needs of about half of the global population zekt s er et al 2004 about 38 of global consumptive irrigation water demand is met by groundwater siebert et al 2010 depletion of groundwater is significant in most of the irrigated regions in the world where millions of people reside kerr 2009 groundwater abstraction accounts for 33 of the total withdrawals globally and provides water for agricultural 42 domestic 36 and industrial 27 needs döll et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 the exploitation of groundwater is mainly due to the quick expansion of irrigated lands to meet the needs of food demands of the increasing population giordano 2009 wada et al 2012 irrigated water use for food production for more than 50 population is from groundwater famiglietti 2014 in around 39 million ha irrigated land siebert et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012b estimated current global groundwater footprint to be 3 5 times the actual aquifer area threatening about 1 7 billion people while 80 of aquifers having footprint smaller than their area implying that only a few overexploited aquifers drive the net global footprint groundwater depletion is mainly concentrated in localized overexploited aquifer systems wada et al 2012 as in northern india rodell et al 2009 india has the most substantial extent of the irrigated area with groundwater siebert et al 2010 fig 1 a large part of the country is under intensive agriculture fig 1a and mostly irrigated by groundwater fig 1b irrigation is a significant contributor to increased food production in densely populated india fig 1c india has 4 of total global land hosting 24 of the worldwide population and having greater than 30 of irrigated land in the world fao 2013 irrigated area in india has increased from 58 8 to 60 4 from 1961 to 2016 world bank 2017 the net irrigated area from different sources canals tanks wells and tube wells and others has increased from 56 94 mha to 68 38 mha from 2001 to 2015 mospi 2018 global groundwater depletion for irrigation has increased from 2000 to 2010 and 23 of which is contributed by india dalin et al 2017 india is an epitome for assessing the impact of energy policy on groundwater as the power needed for water extraction is either free or highly subsidized in the significant regions of the country giordano 2009 in water limited areas irrigated agriculture is more suitable than rainfed agriculture cassman 2016 mueller et al 2012 mismanagement of water resources can lead to more reliance on groundwater even in the rain abundant areas and also due to uneven distribution of rainfall rodell et al 2009 india is mainly dependent on the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr and weaker summer monsoon can cause droughts as in 2009 goldin 2016 during such dry periods water abstracted from groundwater results in a reduction in groundwater levels and thereby can worsen the drought conditions van loon et al 2016 therefore groundwater is an essential resource for the sustainability of ecosystems and livelihoods in the second most populated country in the world also groundwater can minimize the adverse impacts of climate variability on water availability rapid groundwater depletion remains one of the most profound sustainability challenges that india is facing currently sustaining groundwater is essential for meeting the needs of food and water in the current and projected future climate however the current status of the monitoring and management of groundwater depletion and its implications and knowledge gaps in india have not been systematically reviewed here we provide an overview of groundwater depletion in india and the sustainability challenges it poses fig 2 first we discuss the overview of the spatial and temporal variability of the groundwater storage in india available from in situ and satellites then we provide an overview of the consequences of groundwater depletion in india next the management strategies for the sustainable usage of groundwater resources in india are discussed we discuss the challenges and opportunities and the key areas that need enhancements for sustainable groundwater management in india finally we provide knowledge gaps and open questions related to groundwater management in india 2 observed changes in groundwater storage in india understanding of the observed changes in groundwater storage is vital for a proper examination of the issues and challenges related to groundwater sustainability in india both natural and anthropogenic factors have driven observed changes in groundwater storage for instance droughts and floods can lead to groundwater depletion and rise in the water table respectively on the other hand groundwater pumping for irrigation can cause a long term deficit in groundwater storage in india both satellite based and in situ operations show variations in the changes in groundwater storage which warrants a need to discuss the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater storage in india in this section we provide a detailed overview of the observed changes in groundwater storage in india india has several groundwater stressed aquifers in the world gleeson et al 2012b fig 1 stressed groundwater aquifers are also found in the western part of ganges brahmaputra aquifer systems whereas the eastern part is unstressed fig 3 consistent with the cgwb estimation gleeson and wada 2013 this contrast is due to the combination of more recharge rates and less consumption in lower ganges compared to upper ganges aquifer gleeson et al 2012b these stressed aquifers determine the national average time series of groundwater data the northwest region lost groundwater storage of around 109 km3 in six years 2002 2008 which is more than triple the volume of the largest human made reservoir in the usa rodell et al 2009 northwest india has high groundwater abstraction rate with water table going beyond 20 m and declining at a rate greater than 1 m yr 1 macdonald et al 2016 mishra et al 2018 punjab is the hotspot region representing the highest nonrenewable groundwater extraction of 34 66 km3 panda and wahr 2016 whereas renewable volume is only 20 35 km3 cgwb 2014 in punjab groundwater abstraction is considerably higher than mean annual rainfall leading to unsustainable usage mishra et al 2018 groundwater depletion in india has a large spatial variability groundwater depth during 1996 2013 from most of cgwb observation wells located above 23 north showed a significant decline 15 25 cm yr 1 p 0 05 asoka et al 2017 fig 3 rodell et al 2018 estimated the terrestrial water storage tws depletion rate in northern india to be 19 2 1 1 gt yr 1 during 2002 2016 as the abstractions are already exceeding the groundwater recharge during normal monsoon years mishra et al 2018 in the north and central india groundwater is abstracted during the post and pre monsoon seasons to provide irrigation for rice and wheat crops asoka et al 2017 panda and wahr 2016 rodell et al 2018 meghwal et al 2019 analyzed the northwest indian states of gujarat and rajasthan from 2002 to 2016 and found groundwater storage increased in gujarat by 1 76 km3 yr 1 while declined in rajasthan by 4 17 km3 yr 1 a negative trend of 2 cm yr 1 p 0 05 in groundwater anomalies is observed in the majority of north india from 2002 to 2013 asoka et al 2017 and north east parts of india from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites rise in the groundwater table in most parts of south india was observed after 2005 tiwari et al 2011 asoka et al 2017 also reported an increase 1 2 cm yr 1 in grace groundwater storage anomalies in south india consistent with the changes based on the observation wells during the 2002 2013 period for instance a significant increase of 5 20 cm per year was observed from wellsand grace data in south india asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2017 reported a replenishment rate of 2 04 0 20 km3 yr 1 in 2002 2014 in the western part and 0 76 0 08 km3 yr 1 in 2003 2014 in the southern part of india rodell et al 2018 also reported an increasing trend 9 4 0 6 gt yr 1 in groundwater storage in central and south india during 2002 2016 please see table 1 for a detailed comparison of changes in groundwater in different studies the rising trend in groundwater storage in south india can be attributed to the increase in the monsoon season rainfall asoka et al 2017 and changes associated with electricity subsidies for groundwater extraction bhanja et al 2017 meghwal et al 2019 shah 2012 the southern and central india show different trends from in situ well observations that cannot be assessed using the grace satellites primarily due to their coarse spatial resolution scanlon et al 2012 a few opposite trends can also be seen in the north and south india groundwater levels thus showing a complex nature of localized groundwater due to pumping requirements and recharge from nearby sources asoka et al 2017 hora et al 2019 pointed out a survivor bias in which missing groundwater stress information from defunct or dry wells in south india might explain groundwater recovery at those locations overall the contrasting changes in the groundwater storage in the north and south india can be attributed to groundwater pumping for irrigation asoka et al 2018 rodell et al 2009 and decline in precipitation in the north while an increase in precipitation in south india respectively droughts cause excess groundwater loss as the extra withdrawal is needed to meet the drinking water demand and to balance the moisture deficit as seen from the in situ drawdown groundwater table famiglietti and rodell 2013 goldin 2016 panda and wahr 2016 taylor et al 2013 in 2009 precipitation shortage of around 2 5 times the national average had led to the depletion of grace tws and groundwater storage gws of 7 35 cm and 5 63 cm respectively in northern india panda and wahr 2016 depletion rate went up to 80 gt in 2009 while there is a net rise in groundwater storage in the wet season of 2008 24 gt and 2011 35 gt in north west india chen et al 2014 in 2010 excess rainfall in northwestern parts though below long term normal was not sufficient to fully recover the groundwater panda and wahr 2016 in situ observations show a good agreement based on correlation with the grace data with the transition from positive to negative anomalies in 2007 with the most remarkable change in 2009 and then recovery in 2011 asoka et al 2017 panda and wahr 2016 fig 3 an extensive depletion in groundwater storage from the grace satellites occurred during the 2002 2016 period that is consistent with the groundwater well observations fig 3 the nwi faced a persistent groundwater drought shown by both grace and well observations after 2012 fig 3 which is linked with the pumping of groundwater north central india nci has experienced drought after 2014 mainly due to the decline of long term precipitation mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 as well as pumping extraction of nonrenewable groundwater for irrigation in india has a significant contribution of about 68 km3 yr 1 for the year 2000 which is the highest in the world wada et al 2012 mishra et al 2018 reported that there had been a significant increase in the number of tube wells in india during the 1950 2010 period fig 4 the rise in the number of tube wells considerably outpaced the rise in canals tanks and other wells fig 4a the electric pumps dominate groundwater pumping for irrigation in the majority of states of india fig 4b bihar west bengal and uttar pradesh have more diesel pumps than electric pumps fig 4b the northwestern and western states of india rely on abstraction from groundwater wells canal networks and subsidized electricity to pump water while the eastern states have fewer canal networks and also unsubsidized pumping facilities shah 2010 cheap electricity has encouraged farmers to grow water intensive crops that have led to a rapid decline in groundwater in india mishra et al 2018 the stressed aquifers in india are located in the regions with intensive irrigation which need urgent technological and policy interventions to ensure water security in the future while well and grace observations help us in identifying the current hotspots of groundwater depletion in india the country may witness new hotspots in the future due to climate change and increased irrigation and residential water demands 3 implications of groundwater depletion groundwater depletion is more prominent in north india while satellite based observations showed an increase in groundwater storage in peninsular india groundwater depletion caused by unsustainable groundwater pumping can have large implications for food and water security in the region the green revolution led to an increase in food production in india the irrigated area is on the rise to meet the food demands of the population which exacerbates the groundwater depletion in the densely populated and highly irrigated parts used from groundwater more dependence on nonrenewable groundwater to meet food and water supply causes sustainability environmental and ecological challenges in this section we provide a detailed discussion of the critical implications of groundwater depletion in india food security remains one of india s most profound implications associated with groundwater depletion groundwater depletion can be further worsened by the substantial increase in the concurrent hot and dry monsoon extremes are projected in india hot and dry extremes during the monsoon season are projected to rise under the warming climate with implications for food production and to maintain crop yields aadhar and mishra 2020 mishra et al 2020 2021 in addition area affected by the concurrent dry and wet extremes during the monsoon season have increased and likely to rise in the future changes in climate in the monsoon and non monsoon seasons are projected in india which can pose tremendous challenges for water availability putting more burden on already depleting groundwater resources sowing and harvesting time of crops like rice may vary according to shifts in the monsoon and may affect crop yields kelkar et al 2008 the depletion in root zone soil moisture caused by the decline in precipitation and air temperature is met by the irrigation mostly from groundwater kumar and mishra 2020 dry october december season soil moisture showed a declining trend in the indo gangetic plain and central india during 1982 2018 fig 5 a however satellite based normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr in the same season has significantly increased in large parts of india including those faced a decline in soil moisture fig 5b this increase in ndvi is mainly due to irrigation to maintain food production in india indicating the future needs of groundwater to manage droughts and the impacts of climate variability and change notwithstanding the decline in the monsoon season precipitation in indo gangetic plain and central india long term increase in ndvi indicates the use of groundwater based irrigation for food production in india ambika and mishra 2019 asoka and mishra 2015 the role of groundwater in minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change on food security can increase under the warming climate development of irrigated agriculture led to increased agricultural production and price stability which are crucial for feeding the world population rosegrant et al 2009 food demand is also on the rise due to population growth and change in food diets of people enhancing groundwater depletion foley et al 2011 india is feeding its population by over drafting of groundwater from aquifers and may lose its capacity of food production in the coming decades india faces blue water scarcity during the crop growing period and irrigation water demands are primarily met by the unsustainable abstraction of groundwater rosa et al 2020 also about 11 of nonrenewable groundwater use for irrigation is associated with international food trade and india is among the top three contributors dalin et al 2017 water scarcity has implications on the expansion of irrigated areas as well as slowing down the yield growth rate of cereals in developing countries rosegrant et al 2009 therefore proper usage of agricultural water forms the basis of solution for water crisis assessments rosegrant et al 2009 zhu et al 2019 while groundwater depletion poses challenges for food and water security in india it impacts the environment and ecosystems in different ways the environmental implications of groundwater depletion are well beyond decreasing freshwater availability as it results in degradation of groundwater quality famiglietti 2014 and an increase in the pumping cost from deeper depths konikow and kendy 2005 moreover groundwater depletion contributes to sea level rise a decrease of groundwater discharge to streams land subsidence giordano 2009 and seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 konikow and kendy 2005 loss of groundwater results in decline in surface water condon and maxwell 2019 as rivers like the indus and colorado now do not reach the oceans famiglietti 2014 baseflow to ganga river is reduced in summer due to groundwater pumping mukherjee et al 2018 shallow groundwater depletion due to pumping and land use change are the likely drivers for reduced streamflow in the human dominated watershed of arkavathy sub basin in southern india during the last fifty years penny et al 2020 srinivasan et al 2015 groundwater over extraction in the agricultural regions outside the forest may result in deeper groundwater levels in an adjacent basin which can influence streamflow krishnaswamy et al 2013 sekhar et al 2004 streamflow declines not only near the areas of groundwater pumping but also have a persistent effect in the downstream regions condon and maxwell 2019 in addition groundwater vegetation interactions are important for deep rooted forest ecosystems as they have ability to groundwater uptake significantly from higher depth to distribute to short rooted vegetation and can play key roles in ecosystem and also have implications for groundwater recharge orellana et al 2012 groundwater depletion can have ecological implications for instance riparian and aquatic ecosystems also get affected by groundwater storage variability in days to centuries timescales barlow and leake 2012 especially during the low flow season gleeson richter 2018 de graaf et al 2019 showed that the hotspots areas of groundwater depletion of upper ganges and indus basins have already reached their limits to environmental flow before 2010 the south eastern parts of the ganges basin have not reached their environmental flow limit though experienced significant head declines de graaf et al 2019 the reason may be the delay between the effects of pumping on streamflow and disjoint between the riverbed and groundwater level de graaf et al 2019 dry season low flows could have negative impacts on ganges river endangered dolphin species choudhary et al 2012 dey et al 2019 the krishna river basin is an example of both ecological destruction and drought driven conflict srinivasan et al 2012 groundwater pumping can crucially influence ecosystem services while sustainable groundwater resources management can strengthen ecosystem resilience for future climate extremes and variability qiu et al 2019 ferguson and gleeson 2012 reported that coastal aquifers are relatively more vulnerable to the abstraction of groundwater than the sea level rise projected under different hydrogeologic conditions overall groundwater depletion in different parts of india can have various short and long term environmental consequences however the role of groundwater depletion on environment and ecology has not been widely studied in india 4 sustainable management of groundwater resource considering the rapid depletion of groundwater for irrigation and its implications for food and water security in india sustainable management of groundwater resources is needed sustainable management of groundwater resources in india needs an integrated approach that reduces groundwater abstraction and increasing the groundwater recharge since groundwater pumping happens primarily for irrigation changes in the cropping patterns improving the irrigation water use efficiency shifting to the crops that are less water intensive and other policy interventions can be potential areas that need attention on the other hand enhancing the groundwater recharge during the monsoon season is required which needs information related to aquifer characteristics rainwater harvesting managed aquifer recharge and water quality in this section we discuss the ways that can lead to the sustainable management of groundwater resources in india irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of groundwater in india sustainable and efficient agriculture methods are needed to cope with the pressure of increasing crop production with less water availability lenton 2014 foley et al 2011 stated that the world s agricultural yield could be derived within 95 for 16 major crops by calculating the distribution of potential new calories globally india is one of the hotspots of yield stagnation for maize rice wheat and soybean cereals which is a challenge to meet the agricultural demand ray et al 2012 shifting of growing areas of crops like rice and wheat can increase the net farmer s revenue as well as reduce the groundwater and energy consumptions in already stressed regions of india devineni and perveen 2012 davis et al 2018 found that consumptive irrigation water demand is mainly due to the production of wheat during the rabi season rice is not a water efficient cereal therefore diet shift from rice to other alternatives like maize or millet can reduce the irrigation water demand by 33 davis et al 2018 switching to lower water demand crops like from rice to pulses may help in reducing the groundwater depletion rate in india as shown for punjab russo et al 2015 improving the irrigation water use efficiency can play a crucial role in groundwater sustainability in india direct seeding of different plant varieties on level land with furrow diking by energy efficient sprinklers and knowing when and where to irrigate can increase the agricultural water use efficiency gleick 2003 the adoption of low cost tensiometer based irrigation scheduling can save groundwater used for irrigation and power usage leading to economic advantage in punjab india vatta et al 2018 already existing strategies that can help in groundwater conservation include drip irrigation remedies in soil restoration of wetland and water reducing crops foley et al 2011 allocation of irrigated water between crops can increase the economic efficiency of water usage as well as alleviate irrigation water consumption bierkens et al 2019 crop growing patterns methods and efficiency in using water decide the rate of groundwater abstraction siebert et al 2010 in the western gangetic basin fishman et al 2015 showed that maximum theoretical agricultural efficiency can limit the depletion but cannot reverse the depleted state therefore aquifer stress may not be reduced by improving efficiency in the regions of combined surface and groundwater usage due to reduction in irrigation return flow wada heinrich 2013 moreover farmers can irrigate more land by the water saved from irrigation efficiency fishman et al 2015 grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2017 flood irrigation leads to more evapotranspiration losses which increases aquifer depletion and results in soil salinization giordano 2009 scanlon et al 2012 optimized use of combined surface and groundwater for irrigation konikow and kendy 2005 can be productive which provides pathways to minimize aquifer stress and sustainable groundwater development wada heinrich 2013 however this can be limited to the regions that have considerable surface water availability during crop growing seasons enhancing the groundwater recharge is vital for the long term sustainability of groundwater storage in india shallow and unconfined aquifers are recharged during the monsoon seasons southwest and northeast monsoons in india managed aquifer recharge mar can be seen as an adaptation measure to meet the increasing future water demands and to restore the groundwater level dillon et al 2019 massuel et al 2014 shah 2014 stefan and ansems 2018 modifications of streambed channels bank filtration water spreading well recharge and release from the reservoir are a few examples of managed aquifer storage dillon et al 2019 watershed development wsd in india is aimed to increase rainwater storage and agricultural yields to meet food security objectives gray and srinidhi 2013 wsd can help in reducing the impact of declining groundwater yield by supplemental recharge of groundwater in drought prone hard rock aquifers in karnataka chandrakanth et al 2004 however wsd is constrained by limitations in regular data collection and impact assessments regarding drought resilience gray and srinidhi 2013 aquifer based common pool resource sophocleous 2010 is becoming popular for managing groundwater in india kulkarni et al 2015 saha et al 2018 water can be stored in subsurface reservoirs instead of surface reservoirs to restrict the evaporation losses aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 canal networks can be converted to artificial recharge systems in india shah 2009 canal links help maintain groundwater levels through recharge while also providing irrigation water when required to reduce groundwater abstraction and alleviate irrigation costs also during the monsoon season on farm water storage and rainwater harvesting can enhance the groundwater recharge and reduce the pressure of groundwater system during the dry season aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 glendenning et al 2012 rockström et al 2010 water harvesting system accounts for 50 of aquifer recharge in the semi arid watershed of southern india perrin et al 2012 groundwater banking maliva 2020 may offer sustainable groundwater management by providing storage during extreme floods and then abstracting that water during long term droughts scanlon et al 2012 conjunctive use of canal and groundwater is common in scarce canal water and marginal saline groundwater condition in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest india mandare et al 2008 coordination between surface water and groundwater monitoring agencies and framework is needed for long term quantifications and allocation of water resources srinivasan and kulkarni 2014 water governance such as subsidizing electricity will increase groundwater pumping as seen in india suhag 2016 and even in the areas where surface water is available and during the monsoon season rapid groundwater withdrawal in northwest india is not sustainable for the long term management of groundwater resources lenton 2014 a significant abstraction of groundwater for irrigation leads to lowering of the water table which may require deepening of tube wells however the cost associated with deepening the tube wells may not be a problem for wealthy farmers with electricity subsidies for instance the economic value is not a significant concern for medium and large farmers in punjab jain 2006 sarkar 2012 where wells are dug deep to reach over 40 m for groundwater so most probably the environmental limit will decide the groundwater availability de graaf et al 2019 tariff policies based on groundwater exploitation will help in the sustainable use of groundwater in northwestern and western india metered tariff policies to promote groundwater conservation while in eastern parts like west bengal hybrid flat cum metered tariff should be done to benefit the farmers as well as to check the unsustainable exploitation of groundwater sidhu et al 2020 however policy implementation to curb groundwater exploitation is controlled by large holding farmers communities and governments shiferaw et al 2008 as shown by the contrasting cases of success in west bengal and failure in gujarat states mukherji 2006 in the hard rock areas some initiatives are started by farmers communities and ngos to supplement groundwater recharge and counter depletion rate by enforcement of rules shah 2012 policy and state level incentives will drive the crop use pattern and related irrigation water usage in india davis et al 2018 shiferaw et al 2008 minimum support prices for some cereals like rice and wheat by the government has caused them to grow even in unlikely areas chatterjee and kapur 2017 fishman et al 2011 showed that deep alluvial aquifers in northwestern india punjab agriculture is energy and land limited as water is extracted from deeper depths on the other hand in central india telangana the agriculture is water limited as the shallow hard rock aquifers have small storage capacity that is depleted and renewed by rainfall therefore management of groundwater in alluvial aquifers is a long term sustainability problem based on energy usage while in hard rock aquifers it is a short term reliability problem fishman et al 2011 regional strategies selection is critical for policy implementation and adaptation to strengthen regulation and management of groundwater and irrigation considering local scale heterogeneity in alluvial and hard rock aquifers edwards and guilfoos 2020 giordano 2009 sophocleous 2010 theesfeld 2010 solar irrigation pumps sip can be the alternative policy to help mitigate groundwater depletion in water scarce regions shah et al 2018 however using solar pumps as a standby option to diesel or electric pumps result in more groundwater pumping durga et al 2016 gupta 2019 shah et al 2018 and can be promoted if farmers pay the price for each unit of extracted groundwater agrawal and jain 2019 o keeffe et al 2018 found that changes in farmers irrigation behaviour could impact water consumption the interactions and feedback between social practices and environment should be understood to make a better policy for water security perspective giuliani et al 2016 gleeson et al 2012a li et al 2017 sivapalan et al 2014 wagener et al 2010 5 critical needs for understanding the groundwater storage variations measurement and modelling are crucial for better understanding the groundwater depletion implications and sustainable management given that india is the frontrunner in the massive groundwater extraction we need to identify the areas that need enhancement for the better understanding of the groundwater storage variability and groundwater recharge in situ and satellite based monitoring play a vital role in examining the role of natural climate variability and anthropogenic influence on groundwater storage in india on the other hand enhancing the groundwater recharge requires the methods of groundwater recharge estimations and understanding of the aquifer characteristics understanding the observed and projected impacts of climate change are vital for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in india in this section we review a few critical needs that can help us in better understanding groundwater depletion and finding out the ways for sustainable management 5 1 groundwater measurements and monitoring 5 1 1 in situ well observations measurement and monitoring of groundwater storage are essential for understanding the anthropogenic and natural impacts central ground water board cgwb has developed a network of 23 125 observation wells all over the country as of march 2017 cgwb 2019 fig 6 groundwater well measurements are available four times in a year in january may august and november the pre monsoon well level data is monitored in march april or may depending on the monsoon onset in a given region for most of the states in india pre monsoon well observations are in may for west bengal orissa and kerala observations are taken in april and for the north eastern part in march as the summer monsoon onset occurs earlier cgwb 2014 groundwater well observations for the post monsoon are taken in november to assess the impact of monsoon on groundwater the water level in november reflects both the groundwater recharge and withdrawal components while the water level in january reflects the withdrawal for irrigation during the rabi november march season groundwater well level in august shows the influence of the monsoon season groundwater recharge in the well observations asoka et al 2018 while cgwb monitoring wells are located across india there are issues and challenges associated with in situ measurements of groundwater we do not know if the current monitoring of the groundwater level is sufficient to understand space time variability in groundwater storage in india therefore the current density of groundwater wells in different regions has to be evaluated designing of a groundwater monitoring network involves two components zhou 1996 number of observation wells and their locations density of the network and the number of observations per unit time sampling frequency there have been studies focusing on the optimization of groundwater monitoring networks ohmer et al 2019 the majority of approaches are based on the geostatistical analysis dhar 2013 kumar et al 2005 prakash and singh 2000 yang et al 2008 such as kriging to interpolate the groundwater surface to identify the additional requirement of observation wells or redundancy in the existing wells algorithms based on kalman filter wu 2004 zhang et al 2005 have been used for the assessment of groundwater network density and measurement frequency entropy information theory for optimizing information and cost mogheir and singh 2002 mondal and singh 2012 in the groundwater monitoring network cgwb monitors groundwater level four times in a year and it remains unclear if the temporal resolution of existing cgwb observations is sufficient for examining the drivers of groundwater depletion in india the groundwater measurement sampling frequency of once every month is desired for detectability of trends accuracy in the estimation of groundwater fluctuations and accuracy of measurement of stationary components zhou 1996 adequacy of groundwater monitoring wells can vary from one region to the other depending on the spatial variability and heterogeneity in groundwater fig 6 monitoring wells can be additionally placed in the areas of high variability for instance in intensively irrigated areas increased density of observational wells to get a more robust estimation which can better capture the regional variability in contrast there might be regions in the country that may have redundancy in the groundwater monitoring network which also need to be identified an average density of 1 well in every 0 25 km2 area depending on the hydrogeology of hard rock aquifers is necessary kulkarni and shankar 2009 locating the ideal place for monitoring well is an essential choice for groundwater managers mostly because of the cost related to groundwater monitoring similarly we need to examine the desired frequency of groundwater observations based on groundwater fluctuation and can be improved to better understand the role of irrigation during the crop growing seasons on groundwater storage variability community based monitoring presents a way to complement existing groundwater monitoring where community volunteers measure the regional water levels and upload through a web based portal that can be used by water resource planners little et al 2016 citizen science approach can provide a valuable data set regarding the monthly water level measurements and can cover regions of high spatial variability overall there is a need for careful evaluation of the appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions of groundwater well observations in india to examine the role of natural and anthropogenic factors on groundwater storage 5 1 2 satellite based measurement other than in situ observations of groundwater storage variability the satellite based information has played an essential role grace satellite gravimetry is the first remote sensing based technique that can be used to estimate large scale changes in groundwater storage rodell et al 2007 yeh et al 2006 groundwater depletion due to anthropogenic and climate driven fingerprints can be estimated using the groundwater storage anomalies calculated using the grace satellites pokhrel et al 2012 2015 richey et al 2015b scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2010 the grace satellites fill the gaps that exist in the well level observations however at much coarser spatial resolution for instance grace satellites capture the groundwater storage variability of shallow and deep wells meghwal et al 2019 tiwari et al 2009 the grace satellite measures the vertically integrated tws anomaly monthly with an accuracy of 1 5 cm equivalent water height famiglietti and rodell 2013 and spatial resolution of roughly 400 km tapley 2004 depending on the altitude of grace satellites and the distance between the twin satellites apart from the coarse spatial resolution the grace based groundwater estimates can have other sources of uncertainty there are different products available from the grace satellites that contribute to considerable uncertainty in the estimation of tws depending on the region fig 7 grace twsa from jpl and csr mascons captures groundwater changes better than spherical harmonics sh primarily in the regions affected by groundwater depletion in india save et al 2016 spherical harmonics suffer from more signal loss in the pre processing scanlon et al 2016 while leakage errors in grace mascons are relatively lower the grace mission has been successful in assessing the groundwater depletion rates especially in the northern parts of india however there is substantial uncertainty which resulted in an overestimation of the groundwater depletion in northwest india long et al 2016 scale factors estimated from comparing land surface model simulated tws changes landerer and swenson 2012 are used for leakage bias correction in grace estimates velicogna and wahr 2006 scaling factor method is suitable for restoring seasonal tws trends and not for the interannual variation due to uncertainty in land surface models chen et al 2016 moreover as most of the cgwb observations are from shallow wells care must be taken to compare the groundwater storage variability from the grace and in situ observations meghwal et al 2019 grace based groundwater storage estimates are more accurate for the large areas as limited spatial resolution and noise could cause bias and leakage errors if the region is small longuevergne et al 2010 scanlon et al 2016 this also highlights the need for in situ observations in small irrigated basins which cannot be accurately measured using grace satellites grace groundwater storage anomalies have limitations associated with coarser resolution which can be overcome by a statistical downscaling approach using evapotranspiration yin et al 2018 however only in the regions that have a strong correlation with groundwater storage anomalies moreover if the local scale variability is not consistent with the regional pattern then the downscaling will not capture the changes in groundwater level downscaling of the grace data can be further validated using the in situ measurements at the same spatial scale sun 2013 then grace monthly measurements can help in filling the temporal gaps in quarterly groundwater levels measurements in india downscaled tws using artificial neural network ann miro and famiglietti 2018 can capture the variability present in the combined effects of climatic and anthropogenic impacts seyoum and milewski 2017 however the limitation of such data driven models is that they are mostly domain specific and have to be recalibrated to apply for a different region of interest these kinds of studies will be useful in the areas where groundwater level measurements are sparse grace follow on grace fo mission launched in 2018 will continue measuring the movement of masses to provide valuable estimates ciracì et al 2020 flechtner et al 2016 kusche et al 2016 with laser ranging system to improve the spatial resolution mccabe et al 2017 5 2 land surface modelling lsm and statistical approaches global hydrological and land surface models played a vital role in improving our understanding of climatic and anthropogenic linkage with terrestrial and groundwater storage variability several land surface models have taken human factors like groundwater withdrawal into account while considering the water budget pokhrel et al 2016 sood and smakhtin 2015 for instance watergap döll et al 2012 pcraster global water balance pcr globwb wada et al 2010 h08 hanasaki et al 2018 community water model cwatm burek et al 2019 lpjml rost et al 2008 wbmplus wisser et al 2010 matsiro pokhrel et al 2012 and higw mat pokhrel et al 2015 consider human influence in simulating water budget and land surface processes these models estimate long term groundwater recharge and simulate groundwater abstraction influence on groundwater storage variability at regional and local scales which cannot be quantified by the grace satellites due to coarser spatial resolution döll et al 2014 pcr globwb has been coupled with modflow groundwater model at a high resolution wada et al 2016 to simulate groundwater levels and lateral groundwater flow and they found a substantial impact of humans on terrestrial water fluxes in india groundwater storage estimates therefore can be estimated using the grace tws and surface water storage estimated from the land surface models the accuracy of land surface model estimates depends on the input meteorological forcing data and model parameterization of the physical processes since the grace cannot separate various components of tws change water storage changes in snow surface water reservoirs and soil have to be estimated from the other sources e g land surface models the uncertainty associated with water storage components simulated by the land surface models can influence groundwater storage anomaly estimates from the grace satellites chen et al 2016 long et al 2016 richey et al 2015a rodell and famiglietti 2002 van loon et al 2017 scanlon et al 2018 compared decadal trends in land water storage from seven global water models and reported that models underestimate water storage trends against those estimated from the grace satellites mainly due to lack of human intervention representation and climate forcing uncertainty in most of the models however the estimates of groundwater depletion using hydrological models are generally higher in the irrigated regions of northern india konikow 2011 wada et al 2012 when compared with grace estimates of rodell et al 2009 and tiwari et al 2009 as the models mostly do not consider the return flow from irrigation diversions and lateral groundwater flow aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 a better understanding of the physical processes in the hydrological models can provide improved estimates of the groundwater changes in the current and future climate a proper representation of subsurface characteristics in the models is required to quantify better the groundwater response times recharge rates and groundwater climate feedbacks groundwater atmosphere feedback is linked to human water use which is influenced by groundwater pumping for irrigation keune et al 2018 lateral groundwater flow can aggravate the water table pattern but can buffer the seasonal variability of groundwater levels zeng et al 2018 therefore the inclusion of lateral groundwater flow in the earth system models condon and maxwell 2019 can be helpful in simulating terrestrial water fluxes maxwell and kollet 2008 parameterization of groundwater capillary flux in global hydrological models has a strong dependence on water table depth and hydraulic properties of soil and changes recharge and evapotranspiration koirala et al 2019 hydraulic network connectivity decreases with depth in the fractured layer guihéneuf et al 2014 subsurface properties can influence river discharge as well for instance the himalayan rivers have transient groundwater storage of around 45 days andermann et al 2012 therefore the inclusion of subsurface heterogeneity in the modelling studies can further enhance groundwater recharge rates and sensitivity of recharge to climate variability hartmann et al 2017 better sub surface representation in land surface models can improve groundwater persistence which can be taken into account for management strategies to climate change impacts cuthbert et al 2019 data assimilation of grace observations along with the inclusion of anthropogenic modules like groundwater abstraction in hydrological models can improve simulations of groundwater storage variability girotto et al 2017 li et al 2019 nie et al 2019 also grace data assimilation can be useful to make robust decisions in monitoring groundwater related droughts famiglietti 2014 famiglietti and rodell 2013 mishra and singh 2010 thomas et al 2017 girotto et al 2017 assimilated grace data in catchment land surface model clsm for india and reported an improvement in the simulation of groundwater against the in situ observations in the irrigated areas of northwestern india inter annual variability in groundwater trends are more reasonable in assimilation estimates but also shows an erroneous negative et trend due to lack of anthropogenic representation like irrigation and groundwater extraction in the clsm model girotto et al 2017 joint assimilation of grace and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos data can improve the tws estimates especially soil moisture and groundwater components tian et al 2017 and therefore can capture enhanced et due to increased soil moisture from irrigation also assimilation of the grace data and model simulations incorporating groundwater extraction for irrigation can provide better estimates of tws and evapotranspiration nie et al 2019 other than the land surface modelling based approaches to estimate groundwater storage variability statistical and data driven approaches have also been used among the data driven approaches bayesian networks fienen et al 2013 response matrices cheng et al 2011 polynomial chaos laloy et al 2013 and hierarchical based method he et al 2013 have been used for surrogate groundwater modelling asher et al 2015 time series modelling of groundwater with response functions can give insights into the variation of groundwater levels and recovery time from drought and quantification of aquifer stressors bakker and schaars 2019 nonlinear transfer function noise tfn model can be used to model groundwater hydrographs for simulating episodic recharge and head declines chappell et al 2017 peterson and western 2014 and to statistically interpolate monthly groundwater hydrographs to get regular frequency at daily time steps with temporal kriging peterson and western 2018 van dijk et al 2020 used a tfn model in northwestern india and found that geological variability in the aquifer system affects the aquifer response to its drivers which can be used in mitigation strategy random forests machine learning technique can use physically based model predictions to predict shallow groundwater table trends while using geological topographical land cover precipitation variables as covariates koch et al 2019 a comprehensive review of artificial intelligence ai methods for groundwater level modelling is given in rajaee et al 2019 support vector regression svr performs better than the ann when twsa is used as a significant variable to predict groundwater level in india mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 similarly satellite based vegetation cover as an indicator of groundwater storage bhanja et al 2019a krishnaswamy et al 2014 is used in natural vegetation areas in india where the groundwater table is shallow and scarce in situ observations support vector machine svm generated irrigated classified cropland maps for crop seasons show the spatiotemporal evolution of irrigation in the kabini river basin in south india to identify the multi cropping and intensive agricultural practices and their impacts on groundwater resources sharma et al 2018 considering the rapid depletion of groundwater in india efforts to integrate modelling assimilation of grace data and statistical approaches are required moreover a country level high resolution groundwater model should be developed to simulate the groundwater responses to drought hellwig et al 2020 model improvements can be made by including high resolution parameterization and coupling of gradient based lateral groundwater flow into the hydrological models hellwig et al 2020 water demand and usage data should also be incorporated into simulations of groundwater variability massoud et al 2018 old boreholes and pumping wells act as recharge point sources therefore their inclusion in the hydrogeological models will enhance groundwater levels estimates ballukraya and srinivasan 2019 agricultural and irrigation systems in india are complex and representing them in the modelling framework remains a challenge for instance most of the global hydrological models do not represent double or triple cropping systems fig 1a that exist in india moreover the heterogeneity in indian agriculture due to small landholdings cannot be properly represented in the coarse resolution hydrological models the amount of groundwater pumping in the models may vary based on the irrigation schemes and choice of crops therefore the models need to be refined to estimate the influence of agriculture on groundwater storage variability in india 5 3 estimation of groundwater recharge estimation of the groundwater recharge is critical for the sustainability of the groundwater resources groundwater recharge can be estimated either by water table fluctuation wtf or water balance wb methods asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2018 healy and cook 2002 kinzelbach et al 2002 scanlon et al 2002 sophocleous 1991 the wtf method is based on the principle of change in the water table in an unconfined aquifer healy and cook 2002 the water level fluctuations are studied and mapped for each monitoring period indicating the frequency distribution of seasonal annual decadal variations long term observations are used asoka et al 2017 for groundwater recharge estimation which is free from missing values and other inconsistencies hora et al 2019 specific yield provided by the cgwb or high resolution gridded map 0 1 x 0 1 bhanja et al 2016 or indo gangetic basin igb aquifer mapping macdonald et al 2016 can be used to estimate groundwater recharge in india groundwater recharge can be estimated by multiplying specific yield and the difference in the groundwater level asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2016 the water balance method can also be used for groundwater recharge estimation which follows the conservation of mass of water therefore groundwater recharge rate r can be estimated from the water budget equation r p et δsm sr where p et δsm and sr are precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture change and surface runoff respectively bhanja et al 2018 healy and scanlon 2010 double water table fluctuation dwtf method is used in the hard rock and semi arid regions to estimate specific yield and groundwater recharge maréchal et al 2006 in the dwtf method first the specific yield is estimated from groundwater budget and water level changes during the dry season and then recharge during the wet season can be calculated from wtf method maréchal et al 2018 the combined use of electrical resistivity tomography and magnetic resonance sounding is efficient for estimating groundwater recharge in hard rock aquifers in western ghats of southern india descloitres et al 2008 the multi tracers study used in the indo gangetic alluvial aquifers reveals that local flow conditions are disturbed due to intense abstraction in deep groundwater and may significantly improve meteoric recharge to depth lapworth et al 2015 also global hydrological models clm 4 0 richey et al 2015b watergap döll and fiedler 2008 pcr globwb wada et al 2010 h08 hanasaki et al 2018 can be used to estimate the groundwater recharge for instance asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2018 estimated groundwater recharge from groundwater wells using the wtf method and also using the pcr globwb hydrological model direct measurement of groundwater recharge is difficult and its spatial and temporal variations increase the complexity healy and scanlon 2010 both water table fluctuation and water balance methods have limitations for instance healy and scanlon 2010 reported that recharge estimation from the wtf method is the best for shallow aquifers and cannot be applied to confined aquifers where fluctuation can be minimal a majority of the cgwb wells in india are placed in shallow aquifers asoka et al 2017 hora et al 2019 therefore recharge estimates may not provide information on the influence of irrigation moreover there can be uncertainty regarding the choice of specific yield as uniform values can produce bias in groundwater recharge estimates in the wtf method asoka et al 2018 healy and cook 2002 the main limitation of the wb method is the lack of measured hydrogeologic parameters like porosity and permeability in the estimation as it is based on precipitation rates bhanja et al 2018 inter aquifer flow return flow base flow and soil moisture in the vadose zone over a certain depth cannot be taken into account in the wb method bhanja et al 2018 with advanced geophysical measurements and availability of remote sensing data the water budget method is used in hydrological modelling healy and scanlon 2010 observations of groundwater level changes and absence of flow path preference is an advantage of using the wtf method but it cannot separate the inter aquifer flow healy and cook 2002 notwithstanding the limitations the wtf method is a widely used method for recharge estimation healy and cook 2002 also both wb and wtf methods showed similar recharge rates in the indo gangetic basin bhanja et al 2018 the advantage of the dwtf technique is the estimation of specific yield at the watershed scale which is well suited for fractured aquifers where a high density of abandoned boreholes can be used for water level measurements maréchal et al 2018 while precipitation remains the main source of recharge canal seepage dochartaigh et al 2019 and return flow from irrigation can also be significant contributors of groundwater recharge joshi et al 2018 maréchal et al 2006 groundwater recharge models are categorized into four classes i e empirical models precipitation recharge soil water balance models coupled soil water balance hydrological models and richards equation based models moeck et al 2016 groundwater recharge from models is uncertain due to model parameter uncertainty parameterization schemes soil heterogeneity climate forcing data resolution the lag time between precipitation and recharge xie et al 2018 unconstrained feedbacks between recharge and climate and groundwater pumping and irrigation practices in the agricultural areas meixner et al 2016 steward et al 2013 there is a time lag in the groundwater recharge and the monsoon rainfall therefore groundwater storage anomalies are compared for a water year to capture the response of groundwater storage change to precipitation variability asoka et al 2018 inclusion of soil moisture and evapotranspiration can help in constraining estimation of groundwater recharge modelling uncertainty xie et al 2018 multi model ensemble having different model structure and parameterization schemes to estimate groundwater recharge provides a more reliable estimate and minimizes the uncertainty zhu et al 2020 proper integration of groundwater flow paths and recharge schemes in models and response of changes in frequency and intensity of precipitation will reduce the uncertainty in recharge estimation meixner et al 2016 overall we find that there are challenges associated with understanding the aquifer characteristics required for groundwater recharge estimates for instance alluvial plains of northern and eastern parts of india have high permeability leading to higher recharge rates in contrast the central and southern parts have fractured crystalline cratonic rocks leading to low permeability and comparatively lower recharge rates asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2019b macdonald et al 2016 inclusion of dwtf in the decision support framework for groundwater management with 3 d map of specific yield for crystalline rock aquifers can be used as a tool for groundwater management at the basin scale dewandel et al 2017 2010 maréchal et al 2018 there exist considerable challenges in the estimation of groundwater recharge in india due to uncertainty in the recharge estimation approaches based on in situ data and hydrological models these uncertainties need to be quantified appropriately especially in the regions that are facing severe groundwater depletion challenges observations of aquifer properties and appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions of monitoring wells are needed moreover the influence of groundwater pumping on recharge can be estimated using the observations from deep aquifers which unfortunately do not exist in sufficient numbers in india 5 4 impacts of observed and projected climate change evaluating the response of groundwater to climate change is essential for the planning and sustainable management of groundwater resources in india climate variability and climate change influence groundwater storage variability aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 alley et al 2002 döll 2009 green et al 2011 konikow and kendy 2005 sophocleous 2002 taylor et al 2013 india has experienced significant changes in precipitation and air temperature during 1951 2016 fig 8 which has influenced groundwater storage variability for instance a large part of the indo gangetic plain northeast india western ghats and parts of central india have experienced a decline in the rainfall fig 8b the temperature has significantly p value 0 05 increased 0 8 c in the western northeastern and peninsular india fig 8d moreover there is considerable spatial and temporal variability in the changes in the monsoon season rainfall in india fig 9 for instance the decline in the monsoon season precipitation in central india during 1951 2018 has been largely contributed by the decline in the late monsoon august september season precipitation fig 9 precipitation in the late monsoon season in central india has declined by 18 6 p value 0 05 while it has increased in western india during the early monsoon season june july fig 9 not only changes in the mean climate were observed in india during 1951 2016 but a significant change has also occurred in the rainfall characteristics for instance asoka et al 2018 reported that the number of rainy days with low intensity precipitation has declined while the extreme precipitation events have increased in india changes in mean and extreme climate have implications for groundwater storage variability in india asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2018 meghwal et al 2019 groundwater has less sensitivity to rainfall variations annually or inter annually than surface water giordano 2009 however there exists a strong connection between groundwater and the monsoon season precipitation asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2018 rodell et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 positive or negative median trends from 1996 to 2013 can be observed in well recharge with an increase or decline of precipitation respectively asoka et al 2018 for instance low intensity precipitation favours the monsoon season groundwater recharge in north india while high intensity precipitation is more useful for groundwater recharge in south india asoka et al 2018 fig 10 bhanja et al 2019b also showed that precipitation played a significant role in groundwater recharge in six indian river basins e g mahanadi sabarmati narmada tapi which are not intensively irrigated with withdrawal rate less than 75 mm a year understanding of the projected future changes in groundwater storage in india is essential however it is not straight forward there are uncertainties associated with groundwater recharge under climate change holman 2006 which are linked to precipitation projections under the future climate chaturvedi et al 2012 kumar et al 2013 niraula et al 2017 turner and slingo 2009 a majority of the global climate models projected an increase in the indian summer monsoon precipitation chaturvedi et al 2012 menon et al 2013 however most of the global climate models do not show the desired skills to simulate the critical features of the summer monsoon variability ashfaq et al 2017 the majority of cmip5 climate models missed the observed 1950 2005 indian summer monsoon rainfall declining trends saha et al 2014 aadhar and mishra 2019 used the projections from the six global climate models that show reasonable skills over india and reported a substantial rise in dryness in south asia under the warming climate mishra et al 2020 reported that the concurrent hot and dry monsoon extremes would increase in india under the future climate similarly the frequency of severe droughts is also projected to increase in india aadhar and mishra 2020 wu et al 2020 reported that groundwater storage is projected to increase in northwestern india under the future climate in the absence of groundwater abstraction for irrigation primarily due to projected increase in precipitation given the uncertainty in the monsoon season precipitation projections aadhar and mishra 2020 2019 menon et al 2013 approaches based on the sensitivity analysis are required to understand the changes in groundwater storage in india in the warming climate projected changes in precipitation will affect groundwater recharge while changes in the atmospheric water demands can influence groundwater abstraction taylor et al 2013 longer droughts and projected increase in irrigation water demands can further pose challenges to already depleting groundwater resources in india in addition to changes in the mean and extreme climate projected changes in groundwater storage will depend on the changes in the irrigated areas and irrigation demands döll et al 2016 fischer et al 2007 wada et al 2013 yoshikawa et al 2014 changes in irrigation efficiency and cropping systems fishman et al 2015 foley et al 2011 jägermeyr et al 2015 2016 lin lawell 2016 pfeiffer and lin 2014 scott et al 2014 groundwater projections do not consider the increase in irrigated areas and water demand which may be mitigated substantially with the improvement in irrigation efficiency wada et al 2014 uncertainties in the emission scenarios in global climate models downscaling hydrologic models climate change impact on land cover change make predicting climate impacts on groundwater a challenging task döll 2009 groundwater component representation in global climate models gcms needs to be improved by including complex interactions between humans and the climate taylor et al 2013 and proper representation of land cover change water withdrawals data kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 also for future recharge scenarios the model ensemble of different gcms with different scenarios should be used in hydrological models therefore understanding of the projected changes in groundwater storage in india is vital yet incomplete 6 synthesis knowledge gaps and open questions india has witnessed rapid groundwater depletion in the last few decades which is caused by the both natural and human factors climate variability and climate change have affected groundwater recharge and abstraction causing a rapid loss in groundwater storage for instance a large part of the country has witnessed a decline in the monsoon season precipitation during 1951 2018 also the climate has become warmer by one c during the last six decades in india there have been noticeable changes in the characteristics of the monsoon season precipitation asoka et al 2018 singh et al 2014 the number of rainy days and rainy days with low intensity precipitation have significantly declined in india affecting groundwater recharge during the monsoon season which remains the key source of supply to groundwater storage on the other hand the number of days with high intensity precipitation has increased in india during the 1951 2018 period asoka et al 2018 which is favourable to groundwater recharge in south india dominated by bedrock aquifers a majority of the observation wells in india is located in shallow aquifers and they do not provide the recharge estimates in the confined aquifers groundwater pumping for irrigation mostly happens from the deep aquifers for which observations for long term are not available therefore groundwater observations mostly do not provide the information of recharge and abstraction rather they indicate the role of climate variability on the shallow aquifers the grace satellites have provided and grace fo will continue to provide valuable information on both shallow and deep groundwater storage the grace data have been beneficial for understanding the causes of groundwater depletion in india however relatively shorter records and other uncertainties long et al 2016 associated with surface water storage from the land surface models produce challenges for understanding the role of climate and humans on groundwater systems land surface hydrological models fill a significant gap that exists due to the lack of observations of hydrological variables soil moisture evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage however the hydrological models have known uncertainties due to parameterization process representation and availability of input data in addition a majority of the models do not represent in a sufficient manner the complex processes associated with human climate interaction that affect groundwater groundwater has significantly depleted primarily due to unsustainable groundwater pumping for irrigation groundwater depletion is likely to continue in india due to increased climate warming and enhanced food demands for the rising population while there are uncertainties in the climate model projections in india a majority of the models project an increase in the summer monsoon precipitation menon et al 2013 mishra et al 2020 however the projected increase in the monsoon season precipitation does not avoid the possibility of droughts in india aadhar and mishra 2020 moreover enhanced groundwater recharge due to the projected increase in rainfall can be nullified by the increased irrigation demands during the dry season because of the rise in temperature understanding the impacts of projected future change in climate cropping patterns irrigation systems and irrigation efficiency on groundwater storage in india remains a grand challenge future of food and water security in india can be significantly influenced by the way coupled human and climate systems will change in the future based on our review the following are the knowledge gaps and open questions that need attention measurement of groundwater variability is the key to finding out ways for sustainable management despite a large number of observational wells in india the fraction of deep wells is significantly low which hampers our ability to understand recharge and abstraction dynamics in the deep aquifers therefore there is a need to increase the observations from the deep aquifers the other important aspect related to the in situ measurement of well level is associated with sampling frequency the frequency of measurements needs to be increased at least once every month to understand better the role of irrigation and climate on groundwater storage variability moreover the optimality of the groundwater monitoring network in different regions needs to be carefully examined grace data provide valuable information on groundwater storage variability however uncertainties associated with different products based on the grace satellites need to be quantified in addition how the errors in the grace based observations vary spatially in the country in different aquifer types need to be understood groundwater storage estimates based on the grace can have uncertainties based on soil moisture from the land surface models therefore there is a need to properly evaluate the land surface models against the in situ observations of soil moisture evapotranspiration groundwater level and streamflow in india land surface hydrological models provide essential information that helps us in understanding the variability in groundwater storage however current generation land surface models lack the representation of complex processes associated with human climate interactions for instance agricultural and irrigation practices have considerable heterogeneity which is often not represented in the physical processes in the models there is a strong need to develop new or enhance the existing land surface hydrological models for the indian condition to improve our understanding related to drivers of groundwater storage variability in india since models require observations for input or calibration and evaluation observational networks and testbeds need to be established in india new approaches of downscaling the groundwater observations at different spatial and temporal resolution are required for better understanding of groundwater storage variability in response to climate variability and anthropogenic intervention machine learning based approach combined with process based models needs to be evaluated in different regions of the country while the importance of groundwater for food and freshwater security in india has been broadly studied there is little knowledge about how the significance of groundwater will change in the future in india therefore there is a need to develop realistic projections of population food demands land use change irrigated area irrigation technology and irrigation efficiency for india moreover how these factors will be influenced by climate change need to be understood to some extent to develop future scenarios of groundwater in india the sensitivity of groundwater recharge to changes in precipitation and air temperature needs to be quantified for different aquifers in the country moreover the influence of extreme events droughts and floods on groundwater recharge during the monsoon season and abstraction during the dry season is not well understood the role of groundwater conservation and enhancing groundwater recharge in the observed and projected future climate needs to be quantified given the other uncertainties moreover the future hotspots of groundwater depletion and its drivers need to be identified to develop a framework for food and water security in those regions the problem of groundwater depletion in india is challenging an integrated framework of in situ and satellite based observations process models agricultural and irrigation practices and political and stakeholders participation

4726,groundwater plays a vital role in food security water availability and economic growth of more than 1 3 billion people in india notwithstanding the development of irrigation schemes based on surface water groundwater remains a primary source of irrigation in large parts of the country the green revolution in the 1970s contributed considerably to increasing food production in india through the development of groundwater based irrigation which resulted in an expansion of irrigated area and a rapid rise in the number of electric and diesel pumps a large part of the rain fed area was converted to irrigated agriculture leading to growing multiple crops in a year with increased crop yields while the expansion in groundwater based irrigation helped meet the rising food demands of a large population of india it has resulted in several environmental implications groundwater depletion in india has now become one of the most prominent challenges for food and water security both in situ and satellite based observations indicate a rapid decline in groundwater storage in north india both natural and anthropogenic factors cause groundwater depletion in india groundwater pumping for irrigation remains the primary driver of groundwater depletion which can further affect food and water security in india under climate change both in situ and satellite based measurements have issues and uncertainty land surface hydrological models provide essential insights in understanding the groundwater storage variability however need improvements in the representation of complex processes related to climate human interactions sustainable management of groundwater in india is vital for tackling growing challenges related to water availability here we discuss the challenges and opportunities related to the measurements and modelling of groundwater groundwater recharge cropping systems and irrigation efficiency and social and policy reforms for sustainable groundwater management in india keywords groundwater groundwater depletion irrigation groundwater recharge grace groundwater pumping 1 introduction climate change and population growth have significantly affected the global water resources in the 20th century and are likely to pose more challenges in the future milly et al 2005 vörösmarty et al 2000 groundwater is an essential source of freshwater meeting the domestic needs of about half of the global population zekt s er et al 2004 about 38 of global consumptive irrigation water demand is met by groundwater siebert et al 2010 depletion of groundwater is significant in most of the irrigated regions in the world where millions of people reside kerr 2009 groundwater abstraction accounts for 33 of the total withdrawals globally and provides water for agricultural 42 domestic 36 and industrial 27 needs döll et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 the exploitation of groundwater is mainly due to the quick expansion of irrigated lands to meet the needs of food demands of the increasing population giordano 2009 wada et al 2012 irrigated water use for food production for more than 50 population is from groundwater famiglietti 2014 in around 39 million ha irrigated land siebert et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012b estimated current global groundwater footprint to be 3 5 times the actual aquifer area threatening about 1 7 billion people while 80 of aquifers having footprint smaller than their area implying that only a few overexploited aquifers drive the net global footprint groundwater depletion is mainly concentrated in localized overexploited aquifer systems wada et al 2012 as in northern india rodell et al 2009 india has the most substantial extent of the irrigated area with groundwater siebert et al 2010 fig 1 a large part of the country is under intensive agriculture fig 1a and mostly irrigated by groundwater fig 1b irrigation is a significant contributor to increased food production in densely populated india fig 1c india has 4 of total global land hosting 24 of the worldwide population and having greater than 30 of irrigated land in the world fao 2013 irrigated area in india has increased from 58 8 to 60 4 from 1961 to 2016 world bank 2017 the net irrigated area from different sources canals tanks wells and tube wells and others has increased from 56 94 mha to 68 38 mha from 2001 to 2015 mospi 2018 global groundwater depletion for irrigation has increased from 2000 to 2010 and 23 of which is contributed by india dalin et al 2017 india is an epitome for assessing the impact of energy policy on groundwater as the power needed for water extraction is either free or highly subsidized in the significant regions of the country giordano 2009 in water limited areas irrigated agriculture is more suitable than rainfed agriculture cassman 2016 mueller et al 2012 mismanagement of water resources can lead to more reliance on groundwater even in the rain abundant areas and also due to uneven distribution of rainfall rodell et al 2009 india is mainly dependent on the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr and weaker summer monsoon can cause droughts as in 2009 goldin 2016 during such dry periods water abstracted from groundwater results in a reduction in groundwater levels and thereby can worsen the drought conditions van loon et al 2016 therefore groundwater is an essential resource for the sustainability of ecosystems and livelihoods in the second most populated country in the world also groundwater can minimize the adverse impacts of climate variability on water availability rapid groundwater depletion remains one of the most profound sustainability challenges that india is facing currently sustaining groundwater is essential for meeting the needs of food and water in the current and projected future climate however the current status of the monitoring and management of groundwater depletion and its implications and knowledge gaps in india have not been systematically reviewed here we provide an overview of groundwater depletion in india and the sustainability challenges it poses fig 2 first we discuss the overview of the spatial and temporal variability of the groundwater storage in india available from in situ and satellites then we provide an overview of the consequences of groundwater depletion in india next the management strategies for the sustainable usage of groundwater resources in india are discussed we discuss the challenges and opportunities and the key areas that need enhancements for sustainable groundwater management in india finally we provide knowledge gaps and open questions related to groundwater management in india 2 observed changes in groundwater storage in india understanding of the observed changes in groundwater storage is vital for a proper examination of the issues and challenges related to groundwater sustainability in india both natural and anthropogenic factors have driven observed changes in groundwater storage for instance droughts and floods can lead to groundwater depletion and rise in the water table respectively on the other hand groundwater pumping for irrigation can cause a long term deficit in groundwater storage in india both satellite based and in situ operations show variations in the changes in groundwater storage which warrants a need to discuss the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater storage in india in this section we provide a detailed overview of the observed changes in groundwater storage in india india has several groundwater stressed aquifers in the world gleeson et al 2012b fig 1 stressed groundwater aquifers are also found in the western part of ganges brahmaputra aquifer systems whereas the eastern part is unstressed fig 3 consistent with the cgwb estimation gleeson and wada 2013 this contrast is due to the combination of more recharge rates and less consumption in lower ganges compared to upper ganges aquifer gleeson et al 2012b these stressed aquifers determine the national average time series of groundwater data the northwest region lost groundwater storage of around 109 km3 in six years 2002 2008 which is more than triple the volume of the largest human made reservoir in the usa rodell et al 2009 northwest india has high groundwater abstraction rate with water table going beyond 20 m and declining at a rate greater than 1 m yr 1 macdonald et al 2016 mishra et al 2018 punjab is the hotspot region representing the highest nonrenewable groundwater extraction of 34 66 km3 panda and wahr 2016 whereas renewable volume is only 20 35 km3 cgwb 2014 in punjab groundwater abstraction is considerably higher than mean annual rainfall leading to unsustainable usage mishra et al 2018 groundwater depletion in india has a large spatial variability groundwater depth during 1996 2013 from most of cgwb observation wells located above 23 north showed a significant decline 15 25 cm yr 1 p 0 05 asoka et al 2017 fig 3 rodell et al 2018 estimated the terrestrial water storage tws depletion rate in northern india to be 19 2 1 1 gt yr 1 during 2002 2016 as the abstractions are already exceeding the groundwater recharge during normal monsoon years mishra et al 2018 in the north and central india groundwater is abstracted during the post and pre monsoon seasons to provide irrigation for rice and wheat crops asoka et al 2017 panda and wahr 2016 rodell et al 2018 meghwal et al 2019 analyzed the northwest indian states of gujarat and rajasthan from 2002 to 2016 and found groundwater storage increased in gujarat by 1 76 km3 yr 1 while declined in rajasthan by 4 17 km3 yr 1 a negative trend of 2 cm yr 1 p 0 05 in groundwater anomalies is observed in the majority of north india from 2002 to 2013 asoka et al 2017 and north east parts of india from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites rise in the groundwater table in most parts of south india was observed after 2005 tiwari et al 2011 asoka et al 2017 also reported an increase 1 2 cm yr 1 in grace groundwater storage anomalies in south india consistent with the changes based on the observation wells during the 2002 2013 period for instance a significant increase of 5 20 cm per year was observed from wellsand grace data in south india asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2017 reported a replenishment rate of 2 04 0 20 km3 yr 1 in 2002 2014 in the western part and 0 76 0 08 km3 yr 1 in 2003 2014 in the southern part of india rodell et al 2018 also reported an increasing trend 9 4 0 6 gt yr 1 in groundwater storage in central and south india during 2002 2016 please see table 1 for a detailed comparison of changes in groundwater in different studies the rising trend in groundwater storage in south india can be attributed to the increase in the monsoon season rainfall asoka et al 2017 and changes associated with electricity subsidies for groundwater extraction bhanja et al 2017 meghwal et al 2019 shah 2012 the southern and central india show different trends from in situ well observations that cannot be assessed using the grace satellites primarily due to their coarse spatial resolution scanlon et al 2012 a few opposite trends can also be seen in the north and south india groundwater levels thus showing a complex nature of localized groundwater due to pumping requirements and recharge from nearby sources asoka et al 2017 hora et al 2019 pointed out a survivor bias in which missing groundwater stress information from defunct or dry wells in south india might explain groundwater recovery at those locations overall the contrasting changes in the groundwater storage in the north and south india can be attributed to groundwater pumping for irrigation asoka et al 2018 rodell et al 2009 and decline in precipitation in the north while an increase in precipitation in south india respectively droughts cause excess groundwater loss as the extra withdrawal is needed to meet the drinking water demand and to balance the moisture deficit as seen from the in situ drawdown groundwater table famiglietti and rodell 2013 goldin 2016 panda and wahr 2016 taylor et al 2013 in 2009 precipitation shortage of around 2 5 times the national average had led to the depletion of grace tws and groundwater storage gws of 7 35 cm and 5 63 cm respectively in northern india panda and wahr 2016 depletion rate went up to 80 gt in 2009 while there is a net rise in groundwater storage in the wet season of 2008 24 gt and 2011 35 gt in north west india chen et al 2014 in 2010 excess rainfall in northwestern parts though below long term normal was not sufficient to fully recover the groundwater panda and wahr 2016 in situ observations show a good agreement based on correlation with the grace data with the transition from positive to negative anomalies in 2007 with the most remarkable change in 2009 and then recovery in 2011 asoka et al 2017 panda and wahr 2016 fig 3 an extensive depletion in groundwater storage from the grace satellites occurred during the 2002 2016 period that is consistent with the groundwater well observations fig 3 the nwi faced a persistent groundwater drought shown by both grace and well observations after 2012 fig 3 which is linked with the pumping of groundwater north central india nci has experienced drought after 2014 mainly due to the decline of long term precipitation mishra et al 2012 roxy et al 2015 as well as pumping extraction of nonrenewable groundwater for irrigation in india has a significant contribution of about 68 km3 yr 1 for the year 2000 which is the highest in the world wada et al 2012 mishra et al 2018 reported that there had been a significant increase in the number of tube wells in india during the 1950 2010 period fig 4 the rise in the number of tube wells considerably outpaced the rise in canals tanks and other wells fig 4a the electric pumps dominate groundwater pumping for irrigation in the majority of states of india fig 4b bihar west bengal and uttar pradesh have more diesel pumps than electric pumps fig 4b the northwestern and western states of india rely on abstraction from groundwater wells canal networks and subsidized electricity to pump water while the eastern states have fewer canal networks and also unsubsidized pumping facilities shah 2010 cheap electricity has encouraged farmers to grow water intensive crops that have led to a rapid decline in groundwater in india mishra et al 2018 the stressed aquifers in india are located in the regions with intensive irrigation which need urgent technological and policy interventions to ensure water security in the future while well and grace observations help us in identifying the current hotspots of groundwater depletion in india the country may witness new hotspots in the future due to climate change and increased irrigation and residential water demands 3 implications of groundwater depletion groundwater depletion is more prominent in north india while satellite based observations showed an increase in groundwater storage in peninsular india groundwater depletion caused by unsustainable groundwater pumping can have large implications for food and water security in the region the green revolution led to an increase in food production in india the irrigated area is on the rise to meet the food demands of the population which exacerbates the groundwater depletion in the densely populated and highly irrigated parts used from groundwater more dependence on nonrenewable groundwater to meet food and water supply causes sustainability environmental and ecological challenges in this section we provide a detailed discussion of the critical implications of groundwater depletion in india food security remains one of india s most profound implications associated with groundwater depletion groundwater depletion can be further worsened by the substantial increase in the concurrent hot and dry monsoon extremes are projected in india hot and dry extremes during the monsoon season are projected to rise under the warming climate with implications for food production and to maintain crop yields aadhar and mishra 2020 mishra et al 2020 2021 in addition area affected by the concurrent dry and wet extremes during the monsoon season have increased and likely to rise in the future changes in climate in the monsoon and non monsoon seasons are projected in india which can pose tremendous challenges for water availability putting more burden on already depleting groundwater resources sowing and harvesting time of crops like rice may vary according to shifts in the monsoon and may affect crop yields kelkar et al 2008 the depletion in root zone soil moisture caused by the decline in precipitation and air temperature is met by the irrigation mostly from groundwater kumar and mishra 2020 dry october december season soil moisture showed a declining trend in the indo gangetic plain and central india during 1982 2018 fig 5 a however satellite based normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr in the same season has significantly increased in large parts of india including those faced a decline in soil moisture fig 5b this increase in ndvi is mainly due to irrigation to maintain food production in india indicating the future needs of groundwater to manage droughts and the impacts of climate variability and change notwithstanding the decline in the monsoon season precipitation in indo gangetic plain and central india long term increase in ndvi indicates the use of groundwater based irrigation for food production in india ambika and mishra 2019 asoka and mishra 2015 the role of groundwater in minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change on food security can increase under the warming climate development of irrigated agriculture led to increased agricultural production and price stability which are crucial for feeding the world population rosegrant et al 2009 food demand is also on the rise due to population growth and change in food diets of people enhancing groundwater depletion foley et al 2011 india is feeding its population by over drafting of groundwater from aquifers and may lose its capacity of food production in the coming decades india faces blue water scarcity during the crop growing period and irrigation water demands are primarily met by the unsustainable abstraction of groundwater rosa et al 2020 also about 11 of nonrenewable groundwater use for irrigation is associated with international food trade and india is among the top three contributors dalin et al 2017 water scarcity has implications on the expansion of irrigated areas as well as slowing down the yield growth rate of cereals in developing countries rosegrant et al 2009 therefore proper usage of agricultural water forms the basis of solution for water crisis assessments rosegrant et al 2009 zhu et al 2019 while groundwater depletion poses challenges for food and water security in india it impacts the environment and ecosystems in different ways the environmental implications of groundwater depletion are well beyond decreasing freshwater availability as it results in degradation of groundwater quality famiglietti 2014 and an increase in the pumping cost from deeper depths konikow and kendy 2005 moreover groundwater depletion contributes to sea level rise a decrease of groundwater discharge to streams land subsidence giordano 2009 and seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 konikow and kendy 2005 loss of groundwater results in decline in surface water condon and maxwell 2019 as rivers like the indus and colorado now do not reach the oceans famiglietti 2014 baseflow to ganga river is reduced in summer due to groundwater pumping mukherjee et al 2018 shallow groundwater depletion due to pumping and land use change are the likely drivers for reduced streamflow in the human dominated watershed of arkavathy sub basin in southern india during the last fifty years penny et al 2020 srinivasan et al 2015 groundwater over extraction in the agricultural regions outside the forest may result in deeper groundwater levels in an adjacent basin which can influence streamflow krishnaswamy et al 2013 sekhar et al 2004 streamflow declines not only near the areas of groundwater pumping but also have a persistent effect in the downstream regions condon and maxwell 2019 in addition groundwater vegetation interactions are important for deep rooted forest ecosystems as they have ability to groundwater uptake significantly from higher depth to distribute to short rooted vegetation and can play key roles in ecosystem and also have implications for groundwater recharge orellana et al 2012 groundwater depletion can have ecological implications for instance riparian and aquatic ecosystems also get affected by groundwater storage variability in days to centuries timescales barlow and leake 2012 especially during the low flow season gleeson richter 2018 de graaf et al 2019 showed that the hotspots areas of groundwater depletion of upper ganges and indus basins have already reached their limits to environmental flow before 2010 the south eastern parts of the ganges basin have not reached their environmental flow limit though experienced significant head declines de graaf et al 2019 the reason may be the delay between the effects of pumping on streamflow and disjoint between the riverbed and groundwater level de graaf et al 2019 dry season low flows could have negative impacts on ganges river endangered dolphin species choudhary et al 2012 dey et al 2019 the krishna river basin is an example of both ecological destruction and drought driven conflict srinivasan et al 2012 groundwater pumping can crucially influence ecosystem services while sustainable groundwater resources management can strengthen ecosystem resilience for future climate extremes and variability qiu et al 2019 ferguson and gleeson 2012 reported that coastal aquifers are relatively more vulnerable to the abstraction of groundwater than the sea level rise projected under different hydrogeologic conditions overall groundwater depletion in different parts of india can have various short and long term environmental consequences however the role of groundwater depletion on environment and ecology has not been widely studied in india 4 sustainable management of groundwater resource considering the rapid depletion of groundwater for irrigation and its implications for food and water security in india sustainable management of groundwater resources is needed sustainable management of groundwater resources in india needs an integrated approach that reduces groundwater abstraction and increasing the groundwater recharge since groundwater pumping happens primarily for irrigation changes in the cropping patterns improving the irrigation water use efficiency shifting to the crops that are less water intensive and other policy interventions can be potential areas that need attention on the other hand enhancing the groundwater recharge during the monsoon season is required which needs information related to aquifer characteristics rainwater harvesting managed aquifer recharge and water quality in this section we discuss the ways that can lead to the sustainable management of groundwater resources in india irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of groundwater in india sustainable and efficient agriculture methods are needed to cope with the pressure of increasing crop production with less water availability lenton 2014 foley et al 2011 stated that the world s agricultural yield could be derived within 95 for 16 major crops by calculating the distribution of potential new calories globally india is one of the hotspots of yield stagnation for maize rice wheat and soybean cereals which is a challenge to meet the agricultural demand ray et al 2012 shifting of growing areas of crops like rice and wheat can increase the net farmer s revenue as well as reduce the groundwater and energy consumptions in already stressed regions of india devineni and perveen 2012 davis et al 2018 found that consumptive irrigation water demand is mainly due to the production of wheat during the rabi season rice is not a water efficient cereal therefore diet shift from rice to other alternatives like maize or millet can reduce the irrigation water demand by 33 davis et al 2018 switching to lower water demand crops like from rice to pulses may help in reducing the groundwater depletion rate in india as shown for punjab russo et al 2015 improving the irrigation water use efficiency can play a crucial role in groundwater sustainability in india direct seeding of different plant varieties on level land with furrow diking by energy efficient sprinklers and knowing when and where to irrigate can increase the agricultural water use efficiency gleick 2003 the adoption of low cost tensiometer based irrigation scheduling can save groundwater used for irrigation and power usage leading to economic advantage in punjab india vatta et al 2018 already existing strategies that can help in groundwater conservation include drip irrigation remedies in soil restoration of wetland and water reducing crops foley et al 2011 allocation of irrigated water between crops can increase the economic efficiency of water usage as well as alleviate irrigation water consumption bierkens et al 2019 crop growing patterns methods and efficiency in using water decide the rate of groundwater abstraction siebert et al 2010 in the western gangetic basin fishman et al 2015 showed that maximum theoretical agricultural efficiency can limit the depletion but cannot reverse the depleted state therefore aquifer stress may not be reduced by improving efficiency in the regions of combined surface and groundwater usage due to reduction in irrigation return flow wada heinrich 2013 moreover farmers can irrigate more land by the water saved from irrigation efficiency fishman et al 2015 grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2017 flood irrigation leads to more evapotranspiration losses which increases aquifer depletion and results in soil salinization giordano 2009 scanlon et al 2012 optimized use of combined surface and groundwater for irrigation konikow and kendy 2005 can be productive which provides pathways to minimize aquifer stress and sustainable groundwater development wada heinrich 2013 however this can be limited to the regions that have considerable surface water availability during crop growing seasons enhancing the groundwater recharge is vital for the long term sustainability of groundwater storage in india shallow and unconfined aquifers are recharged during the monsoon seasons southwest and northeast monsoons in india managed aquifer recharge mar can be seen as an adaptation measure to meet the increasing future water demands and to restore the groundwater level dillon et al 2019 massuel et al 2014 shah 2014 stefan and ansems 2018 modifications of streambed channels bank filtration water spreading well recharge and release from the reservoir are a few examples of managed aquifer storage dillon et al 2019 watershed development wsd in india is aimed to increase rainwater storage and agricultural yields to meet food security objectives gray and srinidhi 2013 wsd can help in reducing the impact of declining groundwater yield by supplemental recharge of groundwater in drought prone hard rock aquifers in karnataka chandrakanth et al 2004 however wsd is constrained by limitations in regular data collection and impact assessments regarding drought resilience gray and srinidhi 2013 aquifer based common pool resource sophocleous 2010 is becoming popular for managing groundwater in india kulkarni et al 2015 saha et al 2018 water can be stored in subsurface reservoirs instead of surface reservoirs to restrict the evaporation losses aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 canal networks can be converted to artificial recharge systems in india shah 2009 canal links help maintain groundwater levels through recharge while also providing irrigation water when required to reduce groundwater abstraction and alleviate irrigation costs also during the monsoon season on farm water storage and rainwater harvesting can enhance the groundwater recharge and reduce the pressure of groundwater system during the dry season aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 glendenning et al 2012 rockström et al 2010 water harvesting system accounts for 50 of aquifer recharge in the semi arid watershed of southern india perrin et al 2012 groundwater banking maliva 2020 may offer sustainable groundwater management by providing storage during extreme floods and then abstracting that water during long term droughts scanlon et al 2012 conjunctive use of canal and groundwater is common in scarce canal water and marginal saline groundwater condition in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest india mandare et al 2008 coordination between surface water and groundwater monitoring agencies and framework is needed for long term quantifications and allocation of water resources srinivasan and kulkarni 2014 water governance such as subsidizing electricity will increase groundwater pumping as seen in india suhag 2016 and even in the areas where surface water is available and during the monsoon season rapid groundwater withdrawal in northwest india is not sustainable for the long term management of groundwater resources lenton 2014 a significant abstraction of groundwater for irrigation leads to lowering of the water table which may require deepening of tube wells however the cost associated with deepening the tube wells may not be a problem for wealthy farmers with electricity subsidies for instance the economic value is not a significant concern for medium and large farmers in punjab jain 2006 sarkar 2012 where wells are dug deep to reach over 40 m for groundwater so most probably the environmental limit will decide the groundwater availability de graaf et al 2019 tariff policies based on groundwater exploitation will help in the sustainable use of groundwater in northwestern and western india metered tariff policies to promote groundwater conservation while in eastern parts like west bengal hybrid flat cum metered tariff should be done to benefit the farmers as well as to check the unsustainable exploitation of groundwater sidhu et al 2020 however policy implementation to curb groundwater exploitation is controlled by large holding farmers communities and governments shiferaw et al 2008 as shown by the contrasting cases of success in west bengal and failure in gujarat states mukherji 2006 in the hard rock areas some initiatives are started by farmers communities and ngos to supplement groundwater recharge and counter depletion rate by enforcement of rules shah 2012 policy and state level incentives will drive the crop use pattern and related irrigation water usage in india davis et al 2018 shiferaw et al 2008 minimum support prices for some cereals like rice and wheat by the government has caused them to grow even in unlikely areas chatterjee and kapur 2017 fishman et al 2011 showed that deep alluvial aquifers in northwestern india punjab agriculture is energy and land limited as water is extracted from deeper depths on the other hand in central india telangana the agriculture is water limited as the shallow hard rock aquifers have small storage capacity that is depleted and renewed by rainfall therefore management of groundwater in alluvial aquifers is a long term sustainability problem based on energy usage while in hard rock aquifers it is a short term reliability problem fishman et al 2011 regional strategies selection is critical for policy implementation and adaptation to strengthen regulation and management of groundwater and irrigation considering local scale heterogeneity in alluvial and hard rock aquifers edwards and guilfoos 2020 giordano 2009 sophocleous 2010 theesfeld 2010 solar irrigation pumps sip can be the alternative policy to help mitigate groundwater depletion in water scarce regions shah et al 2018 however using solar pumps as a standby option to diesel or electric pumps result in more groundwater pumping durga et al 2016 gupta 2019 shah et al 2018 and can be promoted if farmers pay the price for each unit of extracted groundwater agrawal and jain 2019 o keeffe et al 2018 found that changes in farmers irrigation behaviour could impact water consumption the interactions and feedback between social practices and environment should be understood to make a better policy for water security perspective giuliani et al 2016 gleeson et al 2012a li et al 2017 sivapalan et al 2014 wagener et al 2010 5 critical needs for understanding the groundwater storage variations measurement and modelling are crucial for better understanding the groundwater depletion implications and sustainable management given that india is the frontrunner in the massive groundwater extraction we need to identify the areas that need enhancement for the better understanding of the groundwater storage variability and groundwater recharge in situ and satellite based monitoring play a vital role in examining the role of natural climate variability and anthropogenic influence on groundwater storage in india on the other hand enhancing the groundwater recharge requires the methods of groundwater recharge estimations and understanding of the aquifer characteristics understanding the observed and projected impacts of climate change are vital for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in india in this section we review a few critical needs that can help us in better understanding groundwater depletion and finding out the ways for sustainable management 5 1 groundwater measurements and monitoring 5 1 1 in situ well observations measurement and monitoring of groundwater storage are essential for understanding the anthropogenic and natural impacts central ground water board cgwb has developed a network of 23 125 observation wells all over the country as of march 2017 cgwb 2019 fig 6 groundwater well measurements are available four times in a year in january may august and november the pre monsoon well level data is monitored in march april or may depending on the monsoon onset in a given region for most of the states in india pre monsoon well observations are in may for west bengal orissa and kerala observations are taken in april and for the north eastern part in march as the summer monsoon onset occurs earlier cgwb 2014 groundwater well observations for the post monsoon are taken in november to assess the impact of monsoon on groundwater the water level in november reflects both the groundwater recharge and withdrawal components while the water level in january reflects the withdrawal for irrigation during the rabi november march season groundwater well level in august shows the influence of the monsoon season groundwater recharge in the well observations asoka et al 2018 while cgwb monitoring wells are located across india there are issues and challenges associated with in situ measurements of groundwater we do not know if the current monitoring of the groundwater level is sufficient to understand space time variability in groundwater storage in india therefore the current density of groundwater wells in different regions has to be evaluated designing of a groundwater monitoring network involves two components zhou 1996 number of observation wells and their locations density of the network and the number of observations per unit time sampling frequency there have been studies focusing on the optimization of groundwater monitoring networks ohmer et al 2019 the majority of approaches are based on the geostatistical analysis dhar 2013 kumar et al 2005 prakash and singh 2000 yang et al 2008 such as kriging to interpolate the groundwater surface to identify the additional requirement of observation wells or redundancy in the existing wells algorithms based on kalman filter wu 2004 zhang et al 2005 have been used for the assessment of groundwater network density and measurement frequency entropy information theory for optimizing information and cost mogheir and singh 2002 mondal and singh 2012 in the groundwater monitoring network cgwb monitors groundwater level four times in a year and it remains unclear if the temporal resolution of existing cgwb observations is sufficient for examining the drivers of groundwater depletion in india the groundwater measurement sampling frequency of once every month is desired for detectability of trends accuracy in the estimation of groundwater fluctuations and accuracy of measurement of stationary components zhou 1996 adequacy of groundwater monitoring wells can vary from one region to the other depending on the spatial variability and heterogeneity in groundwater fig 6 monitoring wells can be additionally placed in the areas of high variability for instance in intensively irrigated areas increased density of observational wells to get a more robust estimation which can better capture the regional variability in contrast there might be regions in the country that may have redundancy in the groundwater monitoring network which also need to be identified an average density of 1 well in every 0 25 km2 area depending on the hydrogeology of hard rock aquifers is necessary kulkarni and shankar 2009 locating the ideal place for monitoring well is an essential choice for groundwater managers mostly because of the cost related to groundwater monitoring similarly we need to examine the desired frequency of groundwater observations based on groundwater fluctuation and can be improved to better understand the role of irrigation during the crop growing seasons on groundwater storage variability community based monitoring presents a way to complement existing groundwater monitoring where community volunteers measure the regional water levels and upload through a web based portal that can be used by water resource planners little et al 2016 citizen science approach can provide a valuable data set regarding the monthly water level measurements and can cover regions of high spatial variability overall there is a need for careful evaluation of the appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions of groundwater well observations in india to examine the role of natural and anthropogenic factors on groundwater storage 5 1 2 satellite based measurement other than in situ observations of groundwater storage variability the satellite based information has played an essential role grace satellite gravimetry is the first remote sensing based technique that can be used to estimate large scale changes in groundwater storage rodell et al 2007 yeh et al 2006 groundwater depletion due to anthropogenic and climate driven fingerprints can be estimated using the groundwater storage anomalies calculated using the grace satellites pokhrel et al 2012 2015 richey et al 2015b scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2010 the grace satellites fill the gaps that exist in the well level observations however at much coarser spatial resolution for instance grace satellites capture the groundwater storage variability of shallow and deep wells meghwal et al 2019 tiwari et al 2009 the grace satellite measures the vertically integrated tws anomaly monthly with an accuracy of 1 5 cm equivalent water height famiglietti and rodell 2013 and spatial resolution of roughly 400 km tapley 2004 depending on the altitude of grace satellites and the distance between the twin satellites apart from the coarse spatial resolution the grace based groundwater estimates can have other sources of uncertainty there are different products available from the grace satellites that contribute to considerable uncertainty in the estimation of tws depending on the region fig 7 grace twsa from jpl and csr mascons captures groundwater changes better than spherical harmonics sh primarily in the regions affected by groundwater depletion in india save et al 2016 spherical harmonics suffer from more signal loss in the pre processing scanlon et al 2016 while leakage errors in grace mascons are relatively lower the grace mission has been successful in assessing the groundwater depletion rates especially in the northern parts of india however there is substantial uncertainty which resulted in an overestimation of the groundwater depletion in northwest india long et al 2016 scale factors estimated from comparing land surface model simulated tws changes landerer and swenson 2012 are used for leakage bias correction in grace estimates velicogna and wahr 2006 scaling factor method is suitable for restoring seasonal tws trends and not for the interannual variation due to uncertainty in land surface models chen et al 2016 moreover as most of the cgwb observations are from shallow wells care must be taken to compare the groundwater storage variability from the grace and in situ observations meghwal et al 2019 grace based groundwater storage estimates are more accurate for the large areas as limited spatial resolution and noise could cause bias and leakage errors if the region is small longuevergne et al 2010 scanlon et al 2016 this also highlights the need for in situ observations in small irrigated basins which cannot be accurately measured using grace satellites grace groundwater storage anomalies have limitations associated with coarser resolution which can be overcome by a statistical downscaling approach using evapotranspiration yin et al 2018 however only in the regions that have a strong correlation with groundwater storage anomalies moreover if the local scale variability is not consistent with the regional pattern then the downscaling will not capture the changes in groundwater level downscaling of the grace data can be further validated using the in situ measurements at the same spatial scale sun 2013 then grace monthly measurements can help in filling the temporal gaps in quarterly groundwater levels measurements in india downscaled tws using artificial neural network ann miro and famiglietti 2018 can capture the variability present in the combined effects of climatic and anthropogenic impacts seyoum and milewski 2017 however the limitation of such data driven models is that they are mostly domain specific and have to be recalibrated to apply for a different region of interest these kinds of studies will be useful in the areas where groundwater level measurements are sparse grace follow on grace fo mission launched in 2018 will continue measuring the movement of masses to provide valuable estimates ciracì et al 2020 flechtner et al 2016 kusche et al 2016 with laser ranging system to improve the spatial resolution mccabe et al 2017 5 2 land surface modelling lsm and statistical approaches global hydrological and land surface models played a vital role in improving our understanding of climatic and anthropogenic linkage with terrestrial and groundwater storage variability several land surface models have taken human factors like groundwater withdrawal into account while considering the water budget pokhrel et al 2016 sood and smakhtin 2015 for instance watergap döll et al 2012 pcraster global water balance pcr globwb wada et al 2010 h08 hanasaki et al 2018 community water model cwatm burek et al 2019 lpjml rost et al 2008 wbmplus wisser et al 2010 matsiro pokhrel et al 2012 and higw mat pokhrel et al 2015 consider human influence in simulating water budget and land surface processes these models estimate long term groundwater recharge and simulate groundwater abstraction influence on groundwater storage variability at regional and local scales which cannot be quantified by the grace satellites due to coarser spatial resolution döll et al 2014 pcr globwb has been coupled with modflow groundwater model at a high resolution wada et al 2016 to simulate groundwater levels and lateral groundwater flow and they found a substantial impact of humans on terrestrial water fluxes in india groundwater storage estimates therefore can be estimated using the grace tws and surface water storage estimated from the land surface models the accuracy of land surface model estimates depends on the input meteorological forcing data and model parameterization of the physical processes since the grace cannot separate various components of tws change water storage changes in snow surface water reservoirs and soil have to be estimated from the other sources e g land surface models the uncertainty associated with water storage components simulated by the land surface models can influence groundwater storage anomaly estimates from the grace satellites chen et al 2016 long et al 2016 richey et al 2015a rodell and famiglietti 2002 van loon et al 2017 scanlon et al 2018 compared decadal trends in land water storage from seven global water models and reported that models underestimate water storage trends against those estimated from the grace satellites mainly due to lack of human intervention representation and climate forcing uncertainty in most of the models however the estimates of groundwater depletion using hydrological models are generally higher in the irrigated regions of northern india konikow 2011 wada et al 2012 when compared with grace estimates of rodell et al 2009 and tiwari et al 2009 as the models mostly do not consider the return flow from irrigation diversions and lateral groundwater flow aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 a better understanding of the physical processes in the hydrological models can provide improved estimates of the groundwater changes in the current and future climate a proper representation of subsurface characteristics in the models is required to quantify better the groundwater response times recharge rates and groundwater climate feedbacks groundwater atmosphere feedback is linked to human water use which is influenced by groundwater pumping for irrigation keune et al 2018 lateral groundwater flow can aggravate the water table pattern but can buffer the seasonal variability of groundwater levels zeng et al 2018 therefore the inclusion of lateral groundwater flow in the earth system models condon and maxwell 2019 can be helpful in simulating terrestrial water fluxes maxwell and kollet 2008 parameterization of groundwater capillary flux in global hydrological models has a strong dependence on water table depth and hydraulic properties of soil and changes recharge and evapotranspiration koirala et al 2019 hydraulic network connectivity decreases with depth in the fractured layer guihéneuf et al 2014 subsurface properties can influence river discharge as well for instance the himalayan rivers have transient groundwater storage of around 45 days andermann et al 2012 therefore the inclusion of subsurface heterogeneity in the modelling studies can further enhance groundwater recharge rates and sensitivity of recharge to climate variability hartmann et al 2017 better sub surface representation in land surface models can improve groundwater persistence which can be taken into account for management strategies to climate change impacts cuthbert et al 2019 data assimilation of grace observations along with the inclusion of anthropogenic modules like groundwater abstraction in hydrological models can improve simulations of groundwater storage variability girotto et al 2017 li et al 2019 nie et al 2019 also grace data assimilation can be useful to make robust decisions in monitoring groundwater related droughts famiglietti 2014 famiglietti and rodell 2013 mishra and singh 2010 thomas et al 2017 girotto et al 2017 assimilated grace data in catchment land surface model clsm for india and reported an improvement in the simulation of groundwater against the in situ observations in the irrigated areas of northwestern india inter annual variability in groundwater trends are more reasonable in assimilation estimates but also shows an erroneous negative et trend due to lack of anthropogenic representation like irrigation and groundwater extraction in the clsm model girotto et al 2017 joint assimilation of grace and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos data can improve the tws estimates especially soil moisture and groundwater components tian et al 2017 and therefore can capture enhanced et due to increased soil moisture from irrigation also assimilation of the grace data and model simulations incorporating groundwater extraction for irrigation can provide better estimates of tws and evapotranspiration nie et al 2019 other than the land surface modelling based approaches to estimate groundwater storage variability statistical and data driven approaches have also been used among the data driven approaches bayesian networks fienen et al 2013 response matrices cheng et al 2011 polynomial chaos laloy et al 2013 and hierarchical based method he et al 2013 have been used for surrogate groundwater modelling asher et al 2015 time series modelling of groundwater with response functions can give insights into the variation of groundwater levels and recovery time from drought and quantification of aquifer stressors bakker and schaars 2019 nonlinear transfer function noise tfn model can be used to model groundwater hydrographs for simulating episodic recharge and head declines chappell et al 2017 peterson and western 2014 and to statistically interpolate monthly groundwater hydrographs to get regular frequency at daily time steps with temporal kriging peterson and western 2018 van dijk et al 2020 used a tfn model in northwestern india and found that geological variability in the aquifer system affects the aquifer response to its drivers which can be used in mitigation strategy random forests machine learning technique can use physically based model predictions to predict shallow groundwater table trends while using geological topographical land cover precipitation variables as covariates koch et al 2019 a comprehensive review of artificial intelligence ai methods for groundwater level modelling is given in rajaee et al 2019 support vector regression svr performs better than the ann when twsa is used as a significant variable to predict groundwater level in india mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 similarly satellite based vegetation cover as an indicator of groundwater storage bhanja et al 2019a krishnaswamy et al 2014 is used in natural vegetation areas in india where the groundwater table is shallow and scarce in situ observations support vector machine svm generated irrigated classified cropland maps for crop seasons show the spatiotemporal evolution of irrigation in the kabini river basin in south india to identify the multi cropping and intensive agricultural practices and their impacts on groundwater resources sharma et al 2018 considering the rapid depletion of groundwater in india efforts to integrate modelling assimilation of grace data and statistical approaches are required moreover a country level high resolution groundwater model should be developed to simulate the groundwater responses to drought hellwig et al 2020 model improvements can be made by including high resolution parameterization and coupling of gradient based lateral groundwater flow into the hydrological models hellwig et al 2020 water demand and usage data should also be incorporated into simulations of groundwater variability massoud et al 2018 old boreholes and pumping wells act as recharge point sources therefore their inclusion in the hydrogeological models will enhance groundwater levels estimates ballukraya and srinivasan 2019 agricultural and irrigation systems in india are complex and representing them in the modelling framework remains a challenge for instance most of the global hydrological models do not represent double or triple cropping systems fig 1a that exist in india moreover the heterogeneity in indian agriculture due to small landholdings cannot be properly represented in the coarse resolution hydrological models the amount of groundwater pumping in the models may vary based on the irrigation schemes and choice of crops therefore the models need to be refined to estimate the influence of agriculture on groundwater storage variability in india 5 3 estimation of groundwater recharge estimation of the groundwater recharge is critical for the sustainability of the groundwater resources groundwater recharge can be estimated either by water table fluctuation wtf or water balance wb methods asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2018 healy and cook 2002 kinzelbach et al 2002 scanlon et al 2002 sophocleous 1991 the wtf method is based on the principle of change in the water table in an unconfined aquifer healy and cook 2002 the water level fluctuations are studied and mapped for each monitoring period indicating the frequency distribution of seasonal annual decadal variations long term observations are used asoka et al 2017 for groundwater recharge estimation which is free from missing values and other inconsistencies hora et al 2019 specific yield provided by the cgwb or high resolution gridded map 0 1 x 0 1 bhanja et al 2016 or indo gangetic basin igb aquifer mapping macdonald et al 2016 can be used to estimate groundwater recharge in india groundwater recharge can be estimated by multiplying specific yield and the difference in the groundwater level asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2016 the water balance method can also be used for groundwater recharge estimation which follows the conservation of mass of water therefore groundwater recharge rate r can be estimated from the water budget equation r p et δsm sr where p et δsm and sr are precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture change and surface runoff respectively bhanja et al 2018 healy and scanlon 2010 double water table fluctuation dwtf method is used in the hard rock and semi arid regions to estimate specific yield and groundwater recharge maréchal et al 2006 in the dwtf method first the specific yield is estimated from groundwater budget and water level changes during the dry season and then recharge during the wet season can be calculated from wtf method maréchal et al 2018 the combined use of electrical resistivity tomography and magnetic resonance sounding is efficient for estimating groundwater recharge in hard rock aquifers in western ghats of southern india descloitres et al 2008 the multi tracers study used in the indo gangetic alluvial aquifers reveals that local flow conditions are disturbed due to intense abstraction in deep groundwater and may significantly improve meteoric recharge to depth lapworth et al 2015 also global hydrological models clm 4 0 richey et al 2015b watergap döll and fiedler 2008 pcr globwb wada et al 2010 h08 hanasaki et al 2018 can be used to estimate the groundwater recharge for instance asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2018 estimated groundwater recharge from groundwater wells using the wtf method and also using the pcr globwb hydrological model direct measurement of groundwater recharge is difficult and its spatial and temporal variations increase the complexity healy and scanlon 2010 both water table fluctuation and water balance methods have limitations for instance healy and scanlon 2010 reported that recharge estimation from the wtf method is the best for shallow aquifers and cannot be applied to confined aquifers where fluctuation can be minimal a majority of the cgwb wells in india are placed in shallow aquifers asoka et al 2017 hora et al 2019 therefore recharge estimates may not provide information on the influence of irrigation moreover there can be uncertainty regarding the choice of specific yield as uniform values can produce bias in groundwater recharge estimates in the wtf method asoka et al 2018 healy and cook 2002 the main limitation of the wb method is the lack of measured hydrogeologic parameters like porosity and permeability in the estimation as it is based on precipitation rates bhanja et al 2018 inter aquifer flow return flow base flow and soil moisture in the vadose zone over a certain depth cannot be taken into account in the wb method bhanja et al 2018 with advanced geophysical measurements and availability of remote sensing data the water budget method is used in hydrological modelling healy and scanlon 2010 observations of groundwater level changes and absence of flow path preference is an advantage of using the wtf method but it cannot separate the inter aquifer flow healy and cook 2002 notwithstanding the limitations the wtf method is a widely used method for recharge estimation healy and cook 2002 also both wb and wtf methods showed similar recharge rates in the indo gangetic basin bhanja et al 2018 the advantage of the dwtf technique is the estimation of specific yield at the watershed scale which is well suited for fractured aquifers where a high density of abandoned boreholes can be used for water level measurements maréchal et al 2018 while precipitation remains the main source of recharge canal seepage dochartaigh et al 2019 and return flow from irrigation can also be significant contributors of groundwater recharge joshi et al 2018 maréchal et al 2006 groundwater recharge models are categorized into four classes i e empirical models precipitation recharge soil water balance models coupled soil water balance hydrological models and richards equation based models moeck et al 2016 groundwater recharge from models is uncertain due to model parameter uncertainty parameterization schemes soil heterogeneity climate forcing data resolution the lag time between precipitation and recharge xie et al 2018 unconstrained feedbacks between recharge and climate and groundwater pumping and irrigation practices in the agricultural areas meixner et al 2016 steward et al 2013 there is a time lag in the groundwater recharge and the monsoon rainfall therefore groundwater storage anomalies are compared for a water year to capture the response of groundwater storage change to precipitation variability asoka et al 2018 inclusion of soil moisture and evapotranspiration can help in constraining estimation of groundwater recharge modelling uncertainty xie et al 2018 multi model ensemble having different model structure and parameterization schemes to estimate groundwater recharge provides a more reliable estimate and minimizes the uncertainty zhu et al 2020 proper integration of groundwater flow paths and recharge schemes in models and response of changes in frequency and intensity of precipitation will reduce the uncertainty in recharge estimation meixner et al 2016 overall we find that there are challenges associated with understanding the aquifer characteristics required for groundwater recharge estimates for instance alluvial plains of northern and eastern parts of india have high permeability leading to higher recharge rates in contrast the central and southern parts have fractured crystalline cratonic rocks leading to low permeability and comparatively lower recharge rates asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2019b macdonald et al 2016 inclusion of dwtf in the decision support framework for groundwater management with 3 d map of specific yield for crystalline rock aquifers can be used as a tool for groundwater management at the basin scale dewandel et al 2017 2010 maréchal et al 2018 there exist considerable challenges in the estimation of groundwater recharge in india due to uncertainty in the recharge estimation approaches based on in situ data and hydrological models these uncertainties need to be quantified appropriately especially in the regions that are facing severe groundwater depletion challenges observations of aquifer properties and appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions of monitoring wells are needed moreover the influence of groundwater pumping on recharge can be estimated using the observations from deep aquifers which unfortunately do not exist in sufficient numbers in india 5 4 impacts of observed and projected climate change evaluating the response of groundwater to climate change is essential for the planning and sustainable management of groundwater resources in india climate variability and climate change influence groundwater storage variability aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 alley et al 2002 döll 2009 green et al 2011 konikow and kendy 2005 sophocleous 2002 taylor et al 2013 india has experienced significant changes in precipitation and air temperature during 1951 2016 fig 8 which has influenced groundwater storage variability for instance a large part of the indo gangetic plain northeast india western ghats and parts of central india have experienced a decline in the rainfall fig 8b the temperature has significantly p value 0 05 increased 0 8 c in the western northeastern and peninsular india fig 8d moreover there is considerable spatial and temporal variability in the changes in the monsoon season rainfall in india fig 9 for instance the decline in the monsoon season precipitation in central india during 1951 2018 has been largely contributed by the decline in the late monsoon august september season precipitation fig 9 precipitation in the late monsoon season in central india has declined by 18 6 p value 0 05 while it has increased in western india during the early monsoon season june july fig 9 not only changes in the mean climate were observed in india during 1951 2016 but a significant change has also occurred in the rainfall characteristics for instance asoka et al 2018 reported that the number of rainy days with low intensity precipitation has declined while the extreme precipitation events have increased in india changes in mean and extreme climate have implications for groundwater storage variability in india asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2018 meghwal et al 2019 groundwater has less sensitivity to rainfall variations annually or inter annually than surface water giordano 2009 however there exists a strong connection between groundwater and the monsoon season precipitation asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2018 rodell et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 positive or negative median trends from 1996 to 2013 can be observed in well recharge with an increase or decline of precipitation respectively asoka et al 2018 for instance low intensity precipitation favours the monsoon season groundwater recharge in north india while high intensity precipitation is more useful for groundwater recharge in south india asoka et al 2018 fig 10 bhanja et al 2019b also showed that precipitation played a significant role in groundwater recharge in six indian river basins e g mahanadi sabarmati narmada tapi which are not intensively irrigated with withdrawal rate less than 75 mm a year understanding of the projected future changes in groundwater storage in india is essential however it is not straight forward there are uncertainties associated with groundwater recharge under climate change holman 2006 which are linked to precipitation projections under the future climate chaturvedi et al 2012 kumar et al 2013 niraula et al 2017 turner and slingo 2009 a majority of the global climate models projected an increase in the indian summer monsoon precipitation chaturvedi et al 2012 menon et al 2013 however most of the global climate models do not show the desired skills to simulate the critical features of the summer monsoon variability ashfaq et al 2017 the majority of cmip5 climate models missed the observed 1950 2005 indian summer monsoon rainfall declining trends saha et al 2014 aadhar and mishra 2019 used the projections from the six global climate models that show reasonable skills over india and reported a substantial rise in dryness in south asia under the warming climate mishra et al 2020 reported that the concurrent hot and dry monsoon extremes would increase in india under the future climate similarly the frequency of severe droughts is also projected to increase in india aadhar and mishra 2020 wu et al 2020 reported that groundwater storage is projected to increase in northwestern india under the future climate in the absence of groundwater abstraction for irrigation primarily due to projected increase in precipitation given the uncertainty in the monsoon season precipitation projections aadhar and mishra 2020 2019 menon et al 2013 approaches based on the sensitivity analysis are required to understand the changes in groundwater storage in india in the warming climate projected changes in precipitation will affect groundwater recharge while changes in the atmospheric water demands can influence groundwater abstraction taylor et al 2013 longer droughts and projected increase in irrigation water demands can further pose challenges to already depleting groundwater resources in india in addition to changes in the mean and extreme climate projected changes in groundwater storage will depend on the changes in the irrigated areas and irrigation demands döll et al 2016 fischer et al 2007 wada et al 2013 yoshikawa et al 2014 changes in irrigation efficiency and cropping systems fishman et al 2015 foley et al 2011 jägermeyr et al 2015 2016 lin lawell 2016 pfeiffer and lin 2014 scott et al 2014 groundwater projections do not consider the increase in irrigated areas and water demand which may be mitigated substantially with the improvement in irrigation efficiency wada et al 2014 uncertainties in the emission scenarios in global climate models downscaling hydrologic models climate change impact on land cover change make predicting climate impacts on groundwater a challenging task döll 2009 groundwater component representation in global climate models gcms needs to be improved by including complex interactions between humans and the climate taylor et al 2013 and proper representation of land cover change water withdrawals data kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 also for future recharge scenarios the model ensemble of different gcms with different scenarios should be used in hydrological models therefore understanding of the projected changes in groundwater storage in india is vital yet incomplete 6 synthesis knowledge gaps and open questions india has witnessed rapid groundwater depletion in the last few decades which is caused by the both natural and human factors climate variability and climate change have affected groundwater recharge and abstraction causing a rapid loss in groundwater storage for instance a large part of the country has witnessed a decline in the monsoon season precipitation during 1951 2018 also the climate has become warmer by one c during the last six decades in india there have been noticeable changes in the characteristics of the monsoon season precipitation asoka et al 2018 singh et al 2014 the number of rainy days and rainy days with low intensity precipitation have significantly declined in india affecting groundwater recharge during the monsoon season which remains the key source of supply to groundwater storage on the other hand the number of days with high intensity precipitation has increased in india during the 1951 2018 period asoka et al 2018 which is favourable to groundwater recharge in south india dominated by bedrock aquifers a majority of the observation wells in india is located in shallow aquifers and they do not provide the recharge estimates in the confined aquifers groundwater pumping for irrigation mostly happens from the deep aquifers for which observations for long term are not available therefore groundwater observations mostly do not provide the information of recharge and abstraction rather they indicate the role of climate variability on the shallow aquifers the grace satellites have provided and grace fo will continue to provide valuable information on both shallow and deep groundwater storage the grace data have been beneficial for understanding the causes of groundwater depletion in india however relatively shorter records and other uncertainties long et al 2016 associated with surface water storage from the land surface models produce challenges for understanding the role of climate and humans on groundwater systems land surface hydrological models fill a significant gap that exists due to the lack of observations of hydrological variables soil moisture evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage however the hydrological models have known uncertainties due to parameterization process representation and availability of input data in addition a majority of the models do not represent in a sufficient manner the complex processes associated with human climate interaction that affect groundwater groundwater has significantly depleted primarily due to unsustainable groundwater pumping for irrigation groundwater depletion is likely to continue in india due to increased climate warming and enhanced food demands for the rising population while there are uncertainties in the climate model projections in india a majority of the models project an increase in the summer monsoon precipitation menon et al 2013 mishra et al 2020 however the projected increase in the monsoon season precipitation does not avoid the possibility of droughts in india aadhar and mishra 2020 moreover enhanced groundwater recharge due to the projected increase in rainfall can be nullified by the increased irrigation demands during the dry season because of the rise in temperature understanding the impacts of projected future change in climate cropping patterns irrigation systems and irrigation efficiency on groundwater storage in india remains a grand challenge future of food and water security in india can be significantly influenced by the way coupled human and climate systems will change in the future based on our review the following are the knowledge gaps and open questions that need attention measurement of groundwater variability is the key to finding out ways for sustainable management despite a large number of observational wells in india the fraction of deep wells is significantly low which hampers our ability to understand recharge and abstraction dynamics in the deep aquifers therefore there is a need to increase the observations from the deep aquifers the other important aspect related to the in situ measurement of well level is associated with sampling frequency the frequency of measurements needs to be increased at least once every month to understand better the role of irrigation and climate on groundwater storage variability moreover the optimality of the groundwater monitoring network in different regions needs to be carefully examined grace data provide valuable information on groundwater storage variability however uncertainties associated with different products based on the grace satellites need to be quantified in addition how the errors in the grace based observations vary spatially in the country in different aquifer types need to be understood groundwater storage estimates based on the grace can have uncertainties based on soil moisture from the land surface models therefore there is a need to properly evaluate the land surface models against the in situ observations of soil moisture evapotranspiration groundwater level and streamflow in india land surface hydrological models provide essential information that helps us in understanding the variability in groundwater storage however current generation land surface models lack the representation of complex processes associated with human climate interactions for instance agricultural and irrigation practices have considerable heterogeneity which is often not represented in the physical processes in the models there is a strong need to develop new or enhance the existing land surface hydrological models for the indian condition to improve our understanding related to drivers of groundwater storage variability in india since models require observations for input or calibration and evaluation observational networks and testbeds need to be established in india new approaches of downscaling the groundwater observations at different spatial and temporal resolution are required for better understanding of groundwater storage variability in response to climate variability and anthropogenic intervention machine learning based approach combined with process based models needs to be evaluated in different regions of the country while the importance of groundwater for food and freshwater security in india has been broadly studied there is little knowledge about how the significance of groundwater will change in the future in india therefore there is a need to develop realistic projections of population food demands land use change irrigated area irrigation technology and irrigation efficiency for india moreover how these factors will be influenced by climate change need to be understood to some extent to develop future scenarios of groundwater in india the sensitivity of groundwater recharge to changes in precipitation and air temperature needs to be quantified for different aquifers in the country moreover the influence of extreme events droughts and floods on groundwater recharge during the monsoon season and abstraction during the dry season is not well understood the role of groundwater conservation and enhancing groundwater recharge in the observed and projected future climate needs to be quantified given the other uncertainties moreover the future hotspots of groundwater depletion and its drivers need to be identified to develop a framework for food and water security in those regions the problem of groundwater depletion in india is challenging an integrated framework of in situ and satellite based observations process models agricultural and irrigation practices and political and stakeholders participation

the training validation and test sets are equal to 0 0392 0 0411 and 0 0423 respectively also the mape values for those data sets are 1 241 1 444 and 1 511 respectively the models arima 0 1 3 1 1 1 nar nar ma lstm and lstm ma were used to forecast the water quality according to different time series months k 12 and k 24 at the monitoring points the lstm ma hybrid model provided faster training

seasonal moving average wqi vn vietnamese water quality index 1 introduction it is not deniable that water resources play a critical role in our life therefore surface water quality assessment is one of the significant issues of environmental water management the water quality is related to biological chemical and physical properties columbia basin trust xxxx collins et al 2012 currently many water quality assessments have been developed to support water quality management some traditional techniques are being used such as multivariate analysis jiang qi et al 2013 pollution index qianzhang and hao 2018 quality index samantray et al 2009 hurley et al 2012 the comprehensive fuzzy method chang et al 2011 and biological assessment kartikasari et al 2013 each evaluation method has advantages and disadvantages the multivariate analysis method is used to reduce water quality parameters and describe relationships between properties praus 2007 but it is difficult to draw conclusions about pollution levels when the quality parameters are uncertain chang et al 2011 the water quality index is one of the popular tools used to describe water body health wu et al 2020 however there are many water quality indexes developed until today besides comprehensive fuzzy evaluation can classify water quality gonzález et al 2012 there are still insufficient conditions to improve the accuracy related to the fuzzy calculations the biological indicators classify water pollution based on the presence of aquatic animals kartikasari et al 2013 on the contrary this method is very expensive and requires extensive knowledge of the organism to overcome these limitations neural network technology has been widely used in many different fields such as hydrology economics medicine and the environment eberhart and dobbins 1990 it is completely suitable for water quality control and management lobbrecht et al 2002 nasir et al 2012 moreover it is considered a useful tool for determining the water quality and understanding the water pollution trend rosman 2016 banejad and olyaie 2011 the artificial neural network models ann have been successfully applied for the water quality assessment suggested by juahir et al 2004 he used the direct propagation network to estimate the wqi index the water quality for the ganga river in the kolkata india area was assessed by papita das saha et al 2012 these works have shown the efficiency and ability of the neural networks in simulating water quality kadam et al 2019 conducted water quality assessment for shivganga river basin in india shown that the performance of the ann model has satisfactorily and acceptably in both different seasons the accuracy of the neural network model depends on the parameters set in the model guodong 2000 based on previous investigations the training variables of several studies are used as inputs computed from traditional methods hence the proposed neural network model can be dependent on those methods in another approach neural networks can be used to classify the water quality based on water quality standards the neural networks and genetic algorithms were used to classify river water quality at xindu chengdu published by zhang et al 2010 in another study water quality was evaluated by an artificial neural network with multi layered perceptron and the levenberg marquardt algorithm also published by areerachakul and sanguansintukul 2009 the classification results of the water quality for rivers and slitting in bangkok city yielded 99 34 accuracy an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was developed and used to classify water quality profiles for an accuracy rate of 89 59 han yan and wang 2010 lian z et al applied back propagation bp neural networks combined with genetic algorithms to classify the water quality for five rivers in the xindu area at chengdu the single factor method and comprehensive pollution evaluation results are compared with the obtained class of ga bp neural network model this investigation found that ga bp neural network model has objectivity and feasibility for water quality universal assessment zhang et al 2010 a large number of previous studies have shown the adequate performance of neural networks for water quality assessment this approach solves the dependence on traditional methods in building neural network models as mentioned above however almost all studies have not yet exploited water quality classification forecasts because the water quality assessments cannot provide comprehensive water quality management information the quality forecast will support and supplement the decision making information and water resources protection plan the water quality forecast models have become the study hotspots in environmental science the neural network model is considered a powerful forecasting tool that can replace traditional forecasting methods banejad and olyaie 2011 many studies show that neural network models like nonlinear autoregressive neural network nar nonlinear autoregressive neural network narx lee et al 2017 nar ma tealab et al 2017 long short term memory neural network lstm liu et al 2019 give better predictive results than other traditional methods however tealab et al 2017 revealed that arima and nar ma neural networks are ineffective for the nonlinearity or time series variability among the methods shown above lstm models are widely applied in plenty of articles and research due to outperformance advantages the lstm models are a special kind of feedback neural network built by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it has been improved to be more effective by mikolov krishan et al 2019 the lstm neural networks have been used in many fields such as flood prediction le et al 2019 water flow muzaffar and afshari 2019 air quality krishan et al 2019 qi et al 2019 and water quality liang et al 2020 in another study lake water quality was predicted by wang et al 2017 based on the quality parameters do tp and p of taihu lake the research results have shown that the lstm model is more efficient and accurate than the reverse transmission and online sequential extreme learning machine neural network model similarly the lstm neural network used to predict the quality parameters of the drinking water at yangtze river yangzhou proposed by liu et al 2019 from the research results he showed that the forecast results of the lstm model have good agreement with the actual observed value it has also been reported that the lstm model demonstrates flexibility and efficiency the water quality forecast model using the lstm model has been continuously evolving and innovating in recent years in other words the lstm deep learning model with other data driven techniques has been increasingly developed the lstm hybrid model and gradient boosting decision tree for predicting do concentration in aquaculture developed by huan et al 2020 this model showed better predictability of the extreme learning machine model feedback neural network and particle swarm improved least squares support vector machine and lstm in another study the do concentration at ho tai and victoria bay was predicted by the lstm model and improved the gray relationship analysis developed by zhou et al 2018 the lstm model is a useful predictive model and can solve large scale and nonlinear data published by many different works however the prediction models of the water quality are mostly applied to single water quality parameters the classification for the water quality in the coming time will still be a topic of interest to many scientists in vietnam the water quality index wqi vn decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 is used commonly today the wqi vn index and the multivariate analysis were used to assess the human impacts on water resources proposed by pham et al 2017 the study has shown that the dong nai river is polluted by an average level and is affected by human activities such as service activities agricultural activities and seasonal changes the water quality in the upstream basin for the dong nai river is assessed by the biological index conducted by luu 2017 he proved that the biological index is more sensitive than the wqi vn index it is undeniable that the wqi vn index extracts essential information on water use the parameters that greatly influenced the dong nai river such as the parameters turbidity and tss were removed from the assessment system shown by pham et al 2017 furthermore the water quality assessment efficiency for the field of water environmental science by wqi vn has not been mentioned by any previous research in another study dong nai river s water quality was assessed by using the comprehensive fuzzy method fce conducted by le hoang bao tran et al this work proved that the fce method has no difference from the method of the water quality index tran et al 2014 the dong nai river was evaluated in quality using a multi layered perceptron neural network suggested by ai et al 2014 the multi layered perceptron neural network was developed with five input variables the quality parameters and the wqi index as the output variable they observed that the neural network model saves the evaluation costs more than the wqi vn index method however the nature of this method still depends on the input variables as the value wqi almost research for forecasting river water quality in vietnam is mainly implemented by dynamic models such as ha et al 2018 thai et al 2019 the explicit use of the neural networks lstm to forecast the class of water quality for the dong nai river has not been still conducted up to now in this research the main objectives are the investigation i establishing the optimum feed forward neural network model to classify the water quality for vietnam we carried out several experiments to find the effective model structure of the water quality classification ii the proposed lstm ma hybrid model outperforms conventional models to forecast the water quality classification of the dong nai river according to different time series in the years 2020 to 2022 further the arima nar nar ma and lstm models were used to check the lstm ma forecast efficiency lstm ma hybrid model can capture the water quality class and provide valuable information to serve sustainable water resource management 2 materials and methods 2 1 the monitoring data 2 1 1 study area and monitoring position dong nai river is one of the largest river basins in vietnam and plays an essential role in the southern economic key zone of vietnam dong nai river flows through 5 provinces of south vietnam with a total length of 513 km the most extended section running through the dong nai province is about 294 km dong nai environment and natural resource department 2012 dong nai river which flows through binh duong and dong nai provinces is heavily influenced by urban and industrial development activities therefore the dong nai river is assessed of great importance in the local environmental planning and management data were monitored in dong nai and binh duong provinces in the period from 2007 to 2019 monitoring frequency is once every 1 2 months depending on each monitoring point several new monitoring points have been added to the dong nai river in this period the total number of monitoring points is 21 points in which four monitoring stations dn1 dn2 dn3 dn4 and 17 monitoring stations from sw dn 03 to sw dn 19 were collected in binh duong and dong nai provinces fig 1 respectively 2 1 2 data measurement water quality monitoring data may have some outliers abnormal values can be obtained during monitoring hanrahan 2011 these values may affect the quality of the monitored data before building any model observed data must be checked outliers by the grubb test grubbs 1950 tietjen and moore 1972 the grubbs test was developed to determine whether the greatest value or the lowest value are outliers in this study outliers can be removed from the data set and or replaced with data received by the markov chain monte carlo multivariable algorithm mcmc and the nonlinear partial least squares algorithm nipals wold 1973 buuren 2007 research data were standardized before proceeding to build training models in this study data were normalized in the 0 1 range using the linear scale method wechmongkhonkon et al 2012 gazzaz et al 2012 1 x normalized x x min x max x min where x is the observed value and x min and x max are the minimum and maximum value in the data set 2 2 methods of water quality classification 2 2 1 fuzzy comprehensive evaluation the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is developed based on fuzzy set theory concepts by zadeh 1996 the fuzzy algorithm has been widely applied in water quality problems to solve uncertainties and complex multivariate influences jun and yanfang 2011 ma et al 2010 in this work the comprehensive fuzzy evaluation was used to the water quality classification of dong nai river as the following steps step 1 select assessment parameters the appropriate and representative parameters are selected for water quality assessment and arranged as a set of the evaluation object u x 1 x 2 x n where n the number of selected evaluation parameters includes parameters ph do sat cod bod5 tss ammonium turbidity and coliform step 2 set up evaluation criteria assessment criteria are developed based on national technical regulation on the surface water quality of viet nam qcvn 08 2015 national technical regulation on surface water quality 2015 and guiding water quality classification of vietnam environment administration decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 decision issuing the guidelines for calculation of the water quality index v e administration decision no 879 qđ tcmt 2011 in table 1 therefore the evaluation criteria set v is established to assess parameters in u which can be expressed as v y1 y2 ym where m is the number of assessment criteria categories the water quality is classified into five categories very good i good ii medium iii bad iv and poor v hence we got v i ii iii iv v step 3 establish membership functions and relationship matrix membership functions calculate the class of surface water quality boundary the membership function based on semi trapezoid distribution was suggested by xing et al xing et al 2011 we substitute the monitoring data of a few parameters at each monitoring station and national technical regulation into the membership functions then we got the fuzzy matrix r including m water quality parameters and n water quality standard classes which can be denoted as 2 r r 11 r 12 r 1 m r 21 r 22 r 2 m r n 1 r n 2 r nm n m where values rij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m are the membership level of the ith parameter to the jth level of evaluation criteria step 4 determine the weight the weights of the parameters are crucial when assessing water quality using the comprehensive fuzzy approach jun and yanfang 2011 the weights of the quality parameters were determined using the standard excess rate method jun and yanfang 2011 ma et al 2010 the advantage of this method is that the more over standard times parameters get the more influences on water quality become the following formula calculated the weights of the water quality parameters 3 a i k c i k s i k 4 a i k a i k i 1 n a i k where c i k means the monitoring concentration of the ith parameter at the kth monitoring station s i k is the average of evaluation criteria of the ith parameter a i k is the over standard times of the ith parameter at the kth monitoring site a i k means the weight of the ith evaluation parameter after appropriate computation the weight matrix a can be obtained a a1 k a2 k an k step 5 fuzzy comprehensive evaluation we implemented the fuzzy algorithm by matrix multiplication r a to be obtained a comprehensive evaluation matrix b b1 k b2 k bn k this fuzzy transformation process can be summarized as follows 5 f u f v a a r b b 1 k b 2 k b n k a 1 k a 2 k a n k r 11 r 12 r 1 m r 21 r 22 r 2 m r n 1 r n 2 r nm n m the class of water quality is the maximum level to be obtained from the matrix b max b1 k b2 k bn k 2 2 2 the nemerow index the water quality assessments can use the nemerow index recommended by nemerow and leonard 1974 this index has been used to evaluate the water quality by hao and ge 1989 islam et al 2015 in this study the nemerow index is also used to classify water quality 6 p s avg p i 2 m a x p i 2 2 where ps is the pollution index nemerow pi is the over standard value of pollution parameter i avgpi is the over standard average value of the pollution parameter i maxpi is the highest value exceeding the standard of the ith pollutant parameter pi is determined by formula 7 7 p i c i s i here ci is the concentration of pollutants in surface water si is the permissible concentration limit in surface water according to vietnamese standards water quality is classified into 5 corresponding categories very good i p 1 good ii 1 p 2 average pollution iii 2 p 3 bad iv 3 p 5 poor v p 5 qianzhang and hao 2018 tao et al 2011 2 2 3 feed forward neural network feed forward neural network ffnn model is developed to classify water quality in the dong nai river random numbers are generated based on the national surface water quality standard of vietnam as training data the parameters used to build an ffnn neural network based on vietnamese regulation and available monitoring data encompassing ph do sat cod bod5 tss ammonium turbidity and coliform as inputs the five water quality classes class i ii iii iv and v are transformed to 1 2 3 4 and 5 these five classes are assigned as the output variables for the training model respectively the neural network architecture consists of 3 layers i 8 hl m o 1 used in which i 8 has eight neurons as water quality parameters o 1 is the output layer with one neuron as water quality hl m is the hidden layer with m neurons the number of neurons m on the hidden layer will be determined during neural network training one of the first steps in establishing a training model is to divide the data set the training data have a ratio of 60 80 and the remaining data is used for validation and testing to avoid overfitting of the model given by ostad ali askari et al 2017 heddam 2016 and azad et al 2018 hence random data were randomly divided into 3 data sets including a 70 sample training set 700 samples 15 assessment set 150 samples and 15 test set 150 samples the levenberg marquardt training algorithm and the sigmoid transfer function for each layer were used guzman et al 2017 the loop for training neural networks reaches a maximum of 1000 epoch mu 1010 and gradient 10 7 the number of neurons m of the hidden layer is determined based on training and prediction of the model gazzaz et al 2012 singh et al 2009 in addition the formula for determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer is suggested by ke and liu 2008 stathakis 2009 the formula by zhang et al 2010 can be used in this study to limit the number of neurons m in the hidden layer 8 n i n o 2 n h n i n o 10 where n h is the number of neurons in the hidden layer n i is the number of input neurons and n o is the number of output neurons the process of building this ffnn neural network model is shown in fig 2 a neural network was built to classify water quality in the dong nai river by the matlab 2020a program the neural network training process is based on error change rmse furthermore the neuron of the output layer o 1 is water quality level which is classified into five different categories according to the water quality standards proposed by han yan and wang 2010 level i very good 0 to 1 5 level ii good 1 5 to 2 5 level iii medium 2 5 to 3 5 level iv bad 3 5 to 4 5 and level v poor 4 5 these categories comply with the guidelines for water quality classification of vietnam decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 decision issuing the guidelines for calculation of the water quality index v e administration decision no 879 qđ tcmt 2011 2 2 4 lstm ma neural network the long short term memory neural network is developed based on a feedback neural network rnn model the lstm model has an extended memory capacity and has a more complex structure wang et al 2019 the lstm model is well known as more efficient than other deep machine learning it can be faced with complexities krishan et al 2019 therefore the lstm model is suitable to predict the water quality classification which is influenced by several factors in the environment an lstm neural network also consists of an input layer an output layer and many hidden layers that are repeatedly connected each memory block is composed of one or more self responding cells connected to itself the three multiplier units are input output and forget gate it provides sequential read write and repeat operations for cells pak et al 2018 the lstm network structure is described in detail in wang et al 2019 in this study a long short term memory neural network lstm incorporating a moving average smoothing function was also used to classify the water quality the construction of an lstm ma neural network and the prediction process are depicted in fig 3 the water quality is classified according to the ffnn neural network model then the water quality at each monitoring point was smoothedby moving average ma the data are divided into 3 subsets training set validation set and test set training and validation data were collected from 2007 to 2017 some points from 2012 2017 the test set was taken between 2018 and 2019 the parameters used to build the lstm neural network include many hidden neurons maximum epoch loop learning rate determined through the experiment process the lstm ma was carried out several times to investigate the operational stability of the network structure 2 2 5 nonlinear autoregressive moving average neural network nar ma in addition to the water quality classification according to different methods we also use the nonlinear autoregressive moving average neural network nar ma to classify the dong nai river quality according to time series the nar neural network model is developed based on the nonlinear model nonlinear autoregressive neural network krishan et al 2019 le et al 2019 is applied to predict water quality in time series a description of a discrete and nonlinear autoregressive model can be written as follows 9 y t h y t 1 y t 2 y t p e t y is the value of water quality at the time t y t series of past values p the function h t p is not known in advance e t approximates the y series error at time t the research data includes 70 training set 15 validation training and 15 test set the neural network training algorithms levenberg marquardt and the error back propagation are used in the network training process the neural network training is finished with the smallest error 2 2 6 autoregressive integrated moving average model arima the autoregressive integrated moving average arima method is one of the well known time series models the arima model is often written arima p d q p d q s where p is the order of the autoregressive part of the model q is the order of the moving average part d indicates the average difference order d is the differencing order of the seasonal part s is the time period p is the order of the autoregressive seasonal part and q is the order of the moving average seasonal part the arima model was developed with four steps determining the time series stationery defining the model structure estimating the parameters and testing the model quality wei et al 2016 in this study water quality classification data at the monitoring points and different times are input data 2 3 model verification the statistical values were used to validate the neural network model such as the coefficient of determination r 2 mean square root error rmse ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 mean of absolute percent error mape and the nash efficiency coefficient sutcliffe nse adamowski and chan 2011 the high precision model with mape value δ ten value the excellent model with 10 mape δ 20 reasonable validation model with 21 mape 50 inaccurate validation model with mape 50 was recommended by david 1982 the nash sutcliffe coefficient is valid in the range nse 1 the efficiency coefficient nse 1 corresponds to the suitability for the water quality obtained from the model with observed data the efficiency coefficient nse is 0 which shows that the model value is equal to the observed data mean an nse value 0 indicates that the value obtained does not match the mean observed well thus the model predictive efficiency is not acceptable moriasi et al 2007 the formulas calculate the statistical values as follows 10 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 11 mape i 1 n y i y i y i n 12 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 13 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i y i i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 2 where yi is the ith observation value y is the actual average water quality ŷ i predictive value of the ith model y i is the mean water quality value from the model and n number of observed samples 2 4 scheme of the study the study process is outlined in fig 4 the tasks are carried out via several stages using an integration of different data driven tools from the research objectives water quality classification models are developed with the neural network ffnn the water quality classification models are built from random sample data which used the water quality standards and regulations as the training samples the class of water quality obtained from neural network ffnn was compared with other traditional methods like wqi vn fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and nemerow index we applied data mining techniques to screen and evaluate the reliability of water quality monitoring datasets for the dong nai river the lstm ma hybrid model is developed to forecast the water quality classification of the dong nai river in time series from the years 2020 to 2022 furthermore the water quality classification results from lstm ma models are evaluated and compared with the models arima nar nar ma and lstm to find optimal models the lstm ma models are also applied to forecast the water quality classification to provide the government and policymakers with better information for planning sustainable water resource management 3 results and discussion 3 1 building water quality classification models 3 1 1 constructing standard data many studies applied different neural network models to assess water quality based on water quality monitoring methods in this study the water quality is classified from sample data which used the water quality standards and regulations as the training samples training samples were created based on vietnamese classification standards for water quality decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 national technical regulation on surface water quality 2015 besides the water quality classification in level i and level ii consider the interfering boundary between outstanding 100 and good 90 water quality at the request of the vietnam environment administration le et al 2019 the concentration limits of water quality parameters are divided into five categories i ii iii iv and v table 1 the random sample data were generated based on concentration limits for each water quality parameter in each evaluation level to perform the water quality classification each class has 200 corresponding random samples generated the total data consist of 1000 samples divided into 5 different water quality levels for each parameter table 2 class i was represented by 200 random numbers that requested each parameter value generated 200 samples the same 200 random numbers in class ii were generated another 200 also created for class iii class iv and class v the random sample data set of the eight parameters are arranged vertically in order from class i to class v as the input variables the corresponding water quality class for the data set is considered the output variable 3 1 2 building ffnn model the feed forward neural network ffnn is built from data including a 70 training set 700 samples 15 validation set 150 samples and 15 test set 150 samples these data sets are randomly divided when carrying out the training model the architecture of neural network ffnn consists of 3 layers i 8 hl m o 1 here the number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined during the training ability investigation based on rmse values changes the number of neurons in the hidden layer hl m varies from 5 to 19 based on eq 8 however this study only investigates the number of neurons m varying from 7 to 11 neurons on the hidden layer hl m shown in table 3 the rmse error obtained from neural networks i 8 hl m o 1 increases with m increases from 9 to 11 and m decreases from 8 to 5 the modeling data sets are randomly assigned so the rmse error value in training evaluation and test sets changes according to the number of neurons in the hidden layer and parameters training number the neural network training is done with many loops to define a neural network structure with a lower value rmse and not overfitting occurs the received neural network has the lowest error in the training set validation set and test data the neural network structure i 8 hl 9 o 1 is optimal to classify water quality according to vietnamese regulations here the number of neurons in the hidden layer m of 9 this neural network uses a gradient of 0 01037 moment 10 05 and the rmse values are equal to 0 0392 0 0411 and 0 0423 respectively for the training validation and test set the r correlation coefficients of the training validation and test data set are approximately equal to 1 shown in table 3 and fig 5 this indicates that the water quality level of the model and the observed quality level matches significantly table 3 shows that the rmse value of the training validation and test data set is very consistent with no overfitting phenomenon this proves that the results obtained from the network model i 8 hl 9 o 1 are reliable and applicable compared with the statistical parameters of the neural network structures i 8 hl m o 1 with m 9 shows the neural network structure i 8 hl 9 o 1 is optimal the results of water quality classification obtained from an ffnn neural network with a structure i 8 hl 9 o 1 showed that the percentage of the mape value of training validation and test data sets is deficient at values 1 241 1 444 and 1 511 respectively all percent of mape is not larger than 10 the training results are outstanding and have high accuracy as suggested by david 1982 the nse coefficients obtained values 0 9998 0 9996 and 0 9996 respectively for training evaluation and testing sets the nash sutcliffe coefficients of these data sets are approximately equal to 1 this shows that the water quality classification from the ffnn model is well consistent with the actual quality levels 3 1 3 evaluating the water quality classification we evaluate the applicability and reliability of the water quality classification using the neural network model ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 by comparing with wqi water quality index according to vietnamese standards decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 nemerow index nemerow and leonard 1974 and comprehensive fuzzy method jun and yanfang 2011 ma et al 2010 the analysis and validation of the accuracy based on the confusion matrix for each model are indicated in table 4 the water quality classes obtained from the empirical models are compared with the actual water quality classes the accuracy ratio of each water quality classification from the experiment models and the actual level is determined as shown in table 4 the water quality level of the ffnn model is 100 correct at the whole level meanwhile the wqi vn water quality classification is wrong mainly at level 2 to level 4 the comprehensive fuzzy method and nemerow index show errors mainly at level 3 and level 4 these showed that the class obtained from the neural network ffnn model are well consistent with water quality in the sample sets the overall correctness of the confusion matrix for the fourth models is also expressed in table 4 these results revealed that ffnn scores the highest accuracy at 100 compared to the respective actual classes nevertheless the accuracy of using the nemerow index method is 95 followed by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce reaches 85 and the least accurate is the wqi vn about 41 to determine the reliability of the models the kappa coefficient is used to determine the reliability of the class of water quality haley and osberg 1989 the kappa coefficient ranges from 1 to 1 haley and osberg 1989 kraemer 2014 according to landis and koch the kappa coefficient is proposed as follows 0 81 1 is perfect 0 6 0 8 is good 0 41 0 6 is moderate and 0 21 0 4 is fair 0 0 2 is slight and 0 is poor landis and koch 1977 the analysis results by the confusion matrix for the ffnn neural network have the kappa coefficient of 1 this reveals the highest value compared to the remaining water quality classification models the neural network ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 shows its ability to classify water quality following the observed environmental quality the method of water quality classification according to the wqi vn index gives the kappa number 0 256 0 4 thus this method of classifying this water quality gives classification results as inappropriate the results of the water quality classification here can be seen that the neural network ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 gives the results following the standard regulation national technical regulation on surface water quality 2015 the results obtained of the neural network ffnn are more accurate than the previously used water quality classification 3 2 classification of water quality in the dong nai river 3 2 1 preparing the monitoring data before using the neural network ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 to classify water quality in the dong nai river vietnam the water quality data of the dong nai river were obtained from monitoring stations and checked for outliers that could affect the ability to classify the river water quality by model ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 grubbs test results are shown in table 5 the temperature parameters oc ph do have no abnormal values p value α 0 05 unconfident probability during monitoring the remaining parameters appeared abnormal values in the data set p value α 0 05 the abnormal values are checked with the original data carefully and determine the cause some rough outliers caused by the observational data acquisition were removed from the data set and adjusted to assume values through mcmc and nipal methods the water quality data for the dong nai river were obtained from 19 monitoring points in binh duong and dong nai provinces the data were collected from 2012 to 2019 the data collected during this period were used to classify the water quality of the different models in the period 2012 2019 the collection process of monitoring data from the monitoring points was stable the results of the water quality classification for the dong nai river are shown in table 6 the assessment results of monitoring points conducted in time series show that the dong nai river is at a medium pollution level most monitoring points indicate the water quality at level iii this result is consistent with the published research results of ai et al 2014 tran et al 2014 the water quality of dong nai river over the years 2012 2019 at different monitoring points shows that districts of vinh cuu dong nai section from song be dong nai river to ba mieu wharf thanh phu commune the river water pollution tends to increase in the years 2012 2018 from level 2 to level 3 except for monitoring point sw dn 06 ba mieu pier thanh phu commune in these areas water quality is affected mainly by urban and agricultural activities between binh duong and dong nai provinces the population is quite crowded along the two riversides of the vinh cuu district and tan uyen town river water quality in the river area flowing through tan uyen town binh duong province has an average water quality of polluted water level 3 and does not change much from 2012 to 2019 water quality in the river section passing through the city bien hoa street from hoa an bridge to dong nai bridge is heavily influenced by bien hoa city the dong nai river quality changed from level 2 to level 3 at most of the monitoring points moreover bien hoa city currently does not have an adequate domestic wastewater treatment system for residential areas so dong nai river has received many wastewater sources from residential areas and service centers also the survey results for this river section are affected by fish farming activities and sand exploitation therefore the water quality for the section of a river crossing bien hoa city is polluted besides the river section from the confluence of buong river dong nai river to saigon river dong nai river flows through the industrial area of nhon trach and long thanh districts the level of water pollution in this river section is at a medium level level 3 the pollution level has fluctuated over the years but the amplitude is not large the predicted results are represented by the water quality map for the dong nai river as depicted in fig 6 which shows that the dong nai river is progressing positively but still in a state of pollution in 2012 the river water quality in the section passing binh duong and dong nai provinces changed from level 2 to 3 the section passing binh duong and downstream also had the pollution at level 3 average level in 2015 the area with good water quality green narrowed and yellow and orange were increasing in the vinh cuu district bien hoa city and nhon trach district dong nai province this has reflected increased pollution levels the orange and red areas largely indicate increased downstream pollution levels as a result of research in this area many industrial clusters have come into operation and some industrial clusters do not have wastewater treatment systems and at the same time the urbanization process is happening rapidly the domestic wastewater treatment system has not been built up leading to a decline in water quality in 2018 and 2019 the dong nai river water improved and pollution was moderate but the yellow area has spread to areas outside of bien hoa city the water quality in the river section before entering bien hoa city in tan uyen town and vinh cuu district has improved the narrow orange areas replace mainly yellow the river water quality in the downstream area the river passing through the industrial zone nhon trach and long thanh districts has much improved water quality the environmental monitoring results show that most of the river water quality passing through the industrial zones in nhon trach and long thanh districts has been improved due to wastewater treatment plants the water quality at monitoring points of the dong nai river includes 21 monitoring points building the water quality forecasting models at the points consists of many stages and many steps for the convenience of monitoring we used two monitoring points sw đn07 and sw đn15 for comparison during the construction of the most suitable models for predicting the dong nai river water quality level site sw dn07 is the monitoring point in the river section over bien hoa city and monitoring point sw dn15 is in the section passing the industrial zone in long thanh and nhon trach these are two river sections with higher pollution levels than other sections the monitoring data show monthly pollution levels at sw dn07 and sw dn15 the observation results show that the changes in water quality at 2 points vary by month of the year as shown in fig 7 the augmented dickey fuller test checks the monitoring data at the different monitoring stations to investigate the water quality classification the results show that the water quality classification data is stable p value 0 0001 3 2 2 forecast of water quality by arima we used the arima model to predict water quality over time series to build the arima model the monitoring data on average water quality from 2007 to 2017 at the monitoring point sw dn 07 are used to train the arima model the observed data in 2018 and 2019 are used to test the predictability of the arima model the data consist of 20 time steps used to evaluate the model validation and 12 steps are used to test the predictability the autocorrelation function acf also showed that sine waves diffused the remaining positive and negative correlations and all were not statistically significant as shown in fig 8a from there the largest mean p is 3 and 1 similarly the partial autocorrelation function pacf also shows that the partial correlation coefficients other than 0 reach a statistically significant level at 0 1 2 latency as in fig 8b the maximum correlation coefficient of regression p and seasonal self regression q is 1 many arima models for monitoring point sw dn 07 have been constructed with the adjustment of different model parameters however the results received 16 arima models with parameters p and q in the range columbia basin trust xxxx jiang qi et al 2013 and d 1 showing consistent statistical values the corrected akaike s information criterion aicc sugiura 1978 is used to select a suitable arima model the arima model is most suitable if the aicc values are small the arima model with parameters p 0 d 1 and q 1 gives the lowest aicc value of 225 626 this model depicts the lowest blue circle shown in fig 9 therefore the model arima 0 1 0 1 1 1 12 is the most suitable for forecasting water quality in the dong nai river at the monitoring point sw dn07 furthermore the model arima 0 1 0 1 1 1 12 gave mape and rmse values for the training set of 0 1763 0 30 and 0 6198 1 0 as shown in table 7 this arima model has the highest accuracy in addition this arima model gives values mape and rmse of 0 1254 and 0 4904 for the validation set respectively this also proves that the model arima 0 1 0 1 1 1 12 selected is the most suitable for forecasting the dong nai river water quality at the monitoring point sw dn 07 for the monitoring point sw dn 15 the modeling process is also set up by changing parameters p d and q to find the best arima model all possible models have been compared based on aicc values this arima model has an aicc value of 259 33 therefore the model arima 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 was chosen as the most suitable model this model can be used to predict the water quality at the sw dn15 point the arima model applied for the training and validation set has given the mape and rmse values of 0 1553 0 2186 0 7095 and 0 8435 respectively therefore the model arima 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 to the monitoring point sw dn 15 is the most accurate and appropriate as shown in table 7 the operability of two arima models was assessed by comparing the errors between the monitored values and those from the arima model the forecast value is calculated from 2 arima models 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 of the monitoring points sw dn07 and sw dn15 shown in fig 10 the model arima 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 is used for the test set at the monitoring point sw dn 07 has given the mape and rmse values of 0 2462 and 0 7963 respectively also at the monitoring point sw dn15 the values mape and rmse are 0 2174 and 0 6956 respectively this result shows that the arima models predicted water quality 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 is in good agreement with the actual observed results these study results are consistent with other studies done recently in different regions such as katimon et al 2018 implementation of water quality projections in malaysia and wang et al 2019 to forecast shihe reservoir water quality 3 2 3 forecast of water quality by nar ma the water quality monitoring data is smoothed by the moving average model ma to build the nar ma neural network model the parameters established in the ma model include the equal weighted method q equals 1 and at the confidence level 95 the output values of the ma model are used as input variables of the nar ma hybrid model the different monitoring stations data were divided into 80 training data 10 validation data and 10 test data the delay d is investigated in the range 1 6 the number of neurons surveyed in the hidden layer according to eq 5 is from 2 to 15 neurons the training algorithm used was levenberg marquardt this algorithm has a large memory and shorter training time so this training process will be fast and highly accurate the training process is repeated many times and stops automatically when the modeling mse error is the lowest the model nar ma is considered not overfitting when the mse error of this model for the training validation and test sets has the lowest value fig 11 we experimented with changing many nar ma model parameters to choose the best model for monitoring point sw dn 07 the nar ma model with the number of neurons m 4 in the hidden layer and the delay d of 2 is the most suitable for the nar ma model the predictive ability at the sw dn 07 point is presented in the appropriate rmse value and correlation coefficient the nar ma model predicted the different data sets with the rmse error values in the training set of 0 2815 the validation set of 0 285 and the test set of 0 2899 besides the forecast values resulting from the nar ma model for the training validation and testing sets at the sw dn 07 monitoring point are all distributed near the standard line as shown in fig 11 the r correlation coefficient of the training validation and test set results from the nar ma model is 0 8671 0 8990 and 0 8490 this indicates that the predicted water quality levels from the nar ma model correlate well with the monitored data the nar ma model that can be applied to forecast the water quality levels of the dong nai river is appropriate 3 2 4 forecast of water quality by lstm ma we use the monthly average water quality monitoring data of sw dn 07 dong nai river from 2007 to 2019 to build the lstm ma model the training and validation sets were taken from the water monitoring data in the years 2007 to 2017 the validation data were randomly selected by 10 the monitoring data in the years 2018 and 2019 were used for testing this model moreover the water quality data were screened and smoothed by the moving average model with parameters q 1 and the equal weight at a confidence level of 95 the water quality values obtained in this step are used as the input values of the lstm ma model the neural network was trained with the adaptive moment estimation adam algorithm proposed by kingma and ba 2015 the tanh transfer function and the sigmoid activation function have defaulted for the neural network training process the maximum epoch parameter was set for model lstm ma in 110 during the training and validation process the remaining parameters are set for the lstm ma model including the gradient threshold of 1 the learn rate drop period of 125 and the learn rate drop factor of 0 2 the neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate are investigated through many different experiments to find the most suitable value determining the number of neurons in the hidden layer is difficult so far there is no general rule given by panchal et al 2011 in this study the hidden layer neurons are investigated from 10 to 150 to find the optimal number of neurons for the lstm ma model the results of running the model show that the number of neurons m 100 in the hidden layer gives the most suitable rmse value fig 12 a this lstm ma model gives the rmse value of 0 5749 for the test set and 0 3663 for the validation set as shown in fig 12a the model lstm ma with the number of neurons m 20 in the hidden layer gives an rmse value of 0 2638 for the validation set and for the test set the rmse value is 0 6152 which is greater than that obtained from model lstm ma with the number of neurons m 100 in the hidden layer therefore the number of neurons in the hidden layer m 100 selected is optimal for the lstm ma model this is following the research results suggested by liu et al 2019 moreover the learning rate is also essential in the training process the learning rate of the lstm ma model is changed from 0 001 to 0 01 with the learning rate of 0 008 the lstm ma model has an rmse value of 0 3254 for the evaluation group and for the test group it is 0 5737 as shown in fig 12b the rmse values are lower than those from other learning rates the learning rate also affects the training process of the lstm model this was also pointed out by breuel 2015 thus the number of neurons m 100 in the hidden layer and learning rate of 0 008 are suitable to train the lstm ma model for the monitoring point sw dn 07 similarly for the monitoring point sw dn 15 the lstm ma model is built with the number of neurons m 100 in the hidden layer the learning rate is 0 001 and the maximum epoch value is 110 3 2 5 predictive performance of the methods to find the model for forecasting and classifying the water quality of the dong nai river the models arima nar nar ma lstm and lstm ma were constructed to compare the forecast results of the hybrid model integrated lstm moving average monitoring points sw dn07 and sw dn15 are used to illustrate the model predictability shown in table 8 different time series can affect the accuracy of forecast results the models arima nar nar ma lstm and lstm ma are used to predict the dong nai river water quality in two time series months k 24 and k 12 as seen in table 8 the hybrid lstm model combined with moving average gives good predictive results in all cases this model predicts for the monitoring points sw dn07 and sw dn 15 giving the better rmse value than the models arima nar nar ma and lstm the lstm model always has the minimum rmse value for the test set for the monitoring point sw dn 07 the lstm ma model gives the rmse value of 0 3254 for the validation set this is higher than the rmse value of 0 285 obtained from the nar ma model for the test set the rmse value of 0 5748 of the lstm ma model is the lowest for the validation set and test set the mape value of the lstm ma model was lower than other models at the monitoring point sw dn 15 the rmse values of the lstm ma model for the test and forecast set are 0 2868 and 0 4731 respectively for the validation set at the monitoring point sw dn07 the rmse value obtained from the lstm ma model is higher than the nar ma model however for the forecast set the rmse value of the lstm ma model is smaller than those from the nar ma lstm nar and arima models the mape value of the lstm ma model applied to the monitoring points sw dn 07 and sw dn 15 are also significantly lower than those from other models in this study the rmse and mape values for the arima model are higher than those of the neural network models nar nar ma lstm and lstm ma integrated neural network models nar ma and lstm ma give more consistent results than pure neural network models in particular the lstm ma model has high stability the predicted values of the monitoring point sw dn07 and sw dn15 resulting from the lstm ma model are in good agreement with the actual observed values as illustrated in fig 13 the prediction results of the different models in table 8 by time series months k 24 are not much different from those by time series months k 12 the models can be sorted by predictability lstm ma lstm nar ma nar arima 3 3 forecast of water quality classification in the years 2020 to 2022 from the lstm ma model predictability the lstm ma models have been used to predict the different monitoring points on the dong nai river the building parameters for this neural network model such as the number of hidden neurons epoch and learning rate are adjusted to find a model for the predictive results consistent with the dong nai river water quality the statistical results for the lstm ma models at 21 monitoring points on the dong nai river are shown in table 9 the forecast results of the dong nai river water quality classification in the years 2020 to 2022 are shown in table 10 the water quality of the dong nai river is generally still polluted at level iii this is the common average pollution level in the duration from 2020 to 2022 the highest pollution level is level v at the monitoring point sw dn 04 in vinh cuu district in 2020 however level iii is the pollution level at monitoring points for the river flowing through the vinh cuu district in 2020 it is forecast that the water quality flowing through the vinh cuu district tends to improve the pollution level will decrease gradually from 2020 to 2022 the water quality is forecasted to improve in the vinh cuu district in 2022 but not significantly compared to 2019 most monitoring points sw dn 03 sw dn 04 sw dn 05 and sw dn 06 have pollution levels in the range ii iii similarly the dong nai river water quality which passes through binh duong province is forecasted to have no significant change soon the forecast results for the next three years show that the average water pollution is level iii the monitoring point dn 04 is the only point where the average pollution level improves from level iv in 2019 to level iii in 2022 the river section flows through the bien hoa city and water quality is expected to improve slightly in 2020 the highest pollution was level iv the number of pollution points is much higher than the 4 9 points the monitoring point sw dn 13 has the water quality at pollution level iv it is forecasted that by 2022 the water quality in bien hoa city tends to improve for most of the monitoring points the pollution levels at the monitoring points will fluctuate at levels 2 to 3 for the monitoring point sw dn 12 the water quality can be improved to a better level the water quality trend in bien hoa city will be improved in the coming years because bien hoa city has deployed a wastewater collection system with a pipeline of 120 km and a treatment capacity of 390000 m3 day and night in tam hiep ward the industrial zones and clusters in bien hoa citadel have upgraded and built the wastewater treatment systems before being discharged into the dong nai river source the river section flowing through the industrial zones of long thanh and nhon trach districts the forecast for water quality in 2020 shows that the pollution level here is still quite high common pollution levels at the monitoring points are level iii and level iv according to the forecast results of water quality at sw dn 16 and sw dn 17 there seems to be no improvement in pollution level 3 at monitoring points sw dn 18 and sw dn 19 the forecast results for water sources are at level 4 highest value the water quality at these two monitoring points also seems to have no change from 2020 to 2022 currently there are many industrial clusters in operation that do not have wastewater treatment systems some wastewater treatment systems are efficient in handling organic and microbiological pollutants that do not meet quality standards the impact of industrial wastewater in this area is quite large many urban projects are planned and developed in recent years leading to water pollution in the river the dong nai river water quality is still polluted and not significantly improved in the coming time as can be seen in fig 14 the water quality map of the dong nai river tends to improve in 2019 the dong nai river water quality was at a high level of pollution from the section flowing through bien hoa city section 3 to the section flowing through nhon trach and long thanh industrial zones districts orange and red areas it is forecasted that water quality from 2020 to 2022 will be improved 4 conclusion this study successfully used the chemometric statistical tools and the neural network models to classify and predict the dong nai river water quality vietnam the monitoring data from 2007 to 2019 collected from different monitoring stations were screened and classified reliably according to parameters ph do sat cod bod5 tss ammonium turbidity and coliform before building the models arima 0 1 3 1 1 1 nar nar ma lstm lstm ma the neural network models have been cross validated with different methods of water quality classification the ffnn neural network model with i 8 hl 9 o 1 architecture has been successfully developed for the water quality classification this model gives accurate and reliable classification results the hybrid lstm ma model has also been successfully developed to classify the dong nai river water quality by different time series the hybrid lstm ma model has proven to have faster training time and more stable and reliable predictability than the arima nar nar ma and lstm models the lstm ma hybrid model can classify water quality independently of traditional methods the lstm ma hybrid model becomes a reliable predictive method for future water quality and the dong nai river changes the water quality levels at the monitoring points predicted by the lstm ma hybrid model are appropriate and reliable the forecast results show that the study area does not change significantly in the period 2020 2022 the water quality levels at most monitoring points of dong nai river fluctuate around level

4727,this study has classified and predicted the water quality for the dong nai river at different times the data mining techniques were used to screen out unreliable data the neural network model ffnn in the form of architecture i 8 hl 9 o 1 has been successfully developed to classify the water quality of the dong nai river during the period from 2012 to 2019 for this model the rmse values for the training validation and test sets are equal to 0 0392 0 0411 and 0 0423 respectively also the mape values for those data sets are 1 241 1 444 and 1 511 respectively the models arima 0 1 3 1 1 1 nar nar ma lstm and lstm ma were used to forecast the water quality according to different time series months k 12 and k 24 at the monitoring points the lstm ma hybrid model provided faster training time and more reliable forecasts than the arima nar nar ma and lstm models the rmse and mape values of the lstm ma hybrid model for predicting the forecast set are smaller than those from other models the lstm ma hybrid model was used to classify the water quality over the years 2020 to 2022 the water quality classification derived from the lstm ma hybrid model in close agreement with the actual

seasonal moving average wqi vn vietnamese water quality index 1 introduction it is not deniable that water resources play a critical role in our life therefore surface water quality assessment is one of the significant issues of environmental water management the water quality is related to biological chemical and physical properties columbia basin trust xxxx collins et al 2012 currently many water quality assessments have been developed to support water quality management some traditional techniques are being used such as multivariate analysis jiang qi et al 2013 pollution index qianzhang and hao 2018 quality index samantray et al 2009 hurley et al 2012 the comprehensive fuzzy method chang et al 2011 and biological assessment kartikasari et al 2013 each evaluation method has advantages and disadvantages the multivariate analysis method is used to reduce water quality parameters and describe relationships between properties praus 2007 but it is difficult to draw conclusions about pollution levels when the quality parameters are uncertain chang et al 2011 the water quality index is one of the popular tools used to describe water body health wu et al 2020 however there are many water quality indexes developed until today besides comprehensive fuzzy evaluation can classify water quality gonzález et al 2012 there are still insufficient conditions to improve the accuracy related to the fuzzy calculations the biological indicators classify water pollution based on the presence of aquatic animals kartikasari et al 2013 on the contrary this method is very expensive and requires extensive knowledge of the organism to overcome these limitations neural network technology has been widely used in many different fields such as hydrology economics medicine and the environment eberhart and dobbins 1990 it is completely suitable for water quality control and management lobbrecht et al 2002 nasir et al 2012 moreover it is considered a useful tool for determining the water quality and understanding the water pollution trend rosman 2016 banejad and olyaie 2011 the artificial neural network models ann have been successfully applied for the water quality assessment suggested by juahir et al 2004 he used the direct propagation network to estimate the wqi index the water quality for the ganga river in the kolkata india area was assessed by papita das saha et al 2012 these works have shown the efficiency and ability of the neural networks in simulating water quality kadam et al 2019 conducted water quality assessment for shivganga river basin in india shown that the performance of the ann model has satisfactorily and acceptably in both different seasons the accuracy of the neural network model depends on the parameters set in the model guodong 2000 based on previous investigations the training variables of several studies are used as inputs computed from traditional methods hence the proposed neural network model can be dependent on those methods in another approach neural networks can be used to classify the water quality based on water quality standards the neural networks and genetic algorithms were used to classify river water quality at xindu chengdu published by zhang et al 2010 in another study water quality was evaluated by an artificial neural network with multi layered perceptron and the levenberg marquardt algorithm also published by areerachakul and sanguansintukul 2009 the classification results of the water quality for rivers and slitting in bangkok city yielded 99 34 accuracy an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was developed and used to classify water quality profiles for an accuracy rate of 89 59 han yan and wang 2010 lian z et al applied back propagation bp neural networks combined with genetic algorithms to classify the water quality for five rivers in the xindu area at chengdu the single factor method and comprehensive pollution evaluation results are compared with the obtained class of ga bp neural network model this investigation found that ga bp neural network model has objectivity and feasibility for water quality universal assessment zhang et al 2010 a large number of previous studies have shown the adequate performance of neural networks for water quality assessment this approach solves the dependence on traditional methods in building neural network models as mentioned above however almost all studies have not yet exploited water quality classification forecasts because the water quality assessments cannot provide comprehensive water quality management information the quality forecast will support and supplement the decision making information and water resources protection plan the water quality forecast models have become the study hotspots in environmental science the neural network model is considered a powerful forecasting tool that can replace traditional forecasting methods banejad and olyaie 2011 many studies show that neural network models like nonlinear autoregressive neural network nar nonlinear autoregressive neural network narx lee et al 2017 nar ma tealab et al 2017 long short term memory neural network lstm liu et al 2019 give better predictive results than other traditional methods however tealab et al 2017 revealed that arima and nar ma neural networks are ineffective for the nonlinearity or time series variability among the methods shown above lstm models are widely applied in plenty of articles and research due to outperformance advantages the lstm models are a special kind of feedback neural network built by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it has been improved to be more effective by mikolov krishan et al 2019 the lstm neural networks have been used in many fields such as flood prediction le et al 2019 water flow muzaffar and afshari 2019 air quality krishan et al 2019 qi et al 2019 and water quality liang et al 2020 in another study lake water quality was predicted by wang et al 2017 based on the quality parameters do tp and p of taihu lake the research results have shown that the lstm model is more efficient and accurate than the reverse transmission and online sequential extreme learning machine neural network model similarly the lstm neural network used to predict the quality parameters of the drinking water at yangtze river yangzhou proposed by liu et al 2019 from the research results he showed that the forecast results of the lstm model have good agreement with the actual observed value it has also been reported that the lstm model demonstrates flexibility and efficiency the water quality forecast model using the lstm model has been continuously evolving and innovating in recent years in other words the lstm deep learning model with other data driven techniques has been increasingly developed the lstm hybrid model and gradient boosting decision tree for predicting do concentration in aquaculture developed by huan et al 2020 this model showed better predictability of the extreme learning machine model feedback neural network and particle swarm improved least squares support vector machine and lstm in another study the do concentration at ho tai and victoria bay was predicted by the lstm model and improved the gray relationship analysis developed by zhou et al 2018 the lstm model is a useful predictive model and can solve large scale and nonlinear data published by many different works however the prediction models of the water quality are mostly applied to single water quality parameters the classification for the water quality in the coming time will still be a topic of interest to many scientists in vietnam the water quality index wqi vn decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 is used commonly today the wqi vn index and the multivariate analysis were used to assess the human impacts on water resources proposed by pham et al 2017 the study has shown that the dong nai river is polluted by an average level and is affected by human activities such as service activities agricultural activities and seasonal changes the water quality in the upstream basin for the dong nai river is assessed by the biological index conducted by luu 2017 he proved that the biological index is more sensitive than the wqi vn index it is undeniable that the wqi vn index extracts essential information on water use the parameters that greatly influenced the dong nai river such as the parameters turbidity and tss were removed from the assessment system shown by pham et al 2017 furthermore the water quality assessment efficiency for the field of water environmental science by wqi vn has not been mentioned by any previous research in another study dong nai river s water quality was assessed by using the comprehensive fuzzy method fce conducted by le hoang bao tran et al this work proved that the fce method has no difference from the method of the water quality index tran et al 2014 the dong nai river was evaluated in quality using a multi layered perceptron neural network suggested by ai et al 2014 the multi layered perceptron neural network was developed with five input variables the quality parameters and the wqi index as the output variable they observed that the neural network model saves the evaluation costs more than the wqi vn index method however the nature of this method still depends on the input variables as the value wqi almost research for forecasting river water quality in vietnam is mainly implemented by dynamic models such as ha et al 2018 thai et al 2019 the explicit use of the neural networks lstm to forecast the class of water quality for the dong nai river has not been still conducted up to now in this research the main objectives are the investigation i establishing the optimum feed forward neural network model to classify the water quality for vietnam we carried out several experiments to find the effective model structure of the water quality classification ii the proposed lstm ma hybrid model outperforms conventional models to forecast the water quality classification of the dong nai river according to different time series in the years 2020 to 2022 further the arima nar nar ma and lstm models were used to check the lstm ma forecast efficiency lstm ma hybrid model can capture the water quality class and provide valuable information to serve sustainable water resource management 2 materials and methods 2 1 the monitoring data 2 1

5 provinces of south vietnam with a total length of 513 km the most extended section running through the dong nai province is about 294 km dong nai environment and natural resource department 2012 dong nai river which flows through binh duong and dong nai provinces is heavily influenced by urban and industrial development activities therefore the dong nai river is assessed of great importance in the local environmental planning and management data were monitored in dong nai and binh duong provinces in the period from 2007 to 2019 monitoring frequency is once every 1 2 months depending on each monitoring point several new monitoring points have been added to the dong nai river in this period the total number of monitoring points is 21 points in which four monitoring stations dn1 dn2 dn3 dn4 and 17 monitoring stations from sw dn 03 to sw dn 19 were collected in binh duong and dong nai provinces fig 1 respectively 2 1 2 data measurement water quality monitoring data may have some outliers abnormal values can be obtained during monitoring hanrahan 2011 these values may affect the quality of the monitored data before building any model observed data must be checked outliers by the grubb test grubbs 1950 tietjen and moore 1972 the grubbs test was developed to determine whether the greatest value or the lowest value are outliers in this study outliers can be removed from the data set and or replaced with data received by the markov chain monte carlo multivariable algorithm mcmc and the nonlinear partial least squares algorithm nipals wold 1973 buuren 2007 research data were standardized before proceeding to build training models in this study data were normalized in the 0 1 range using the linear scale method wechmongkhonkon et al 2012 gazzaz et al 2012 1 x normalized x x min x max x min where x is the observed value and x min and x max are the minimum and maximum value in the data set 2 2 methods of water quality classification 2 2 1 fuzzy comprehensive evaluation the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is developed based on fuzzy set theory concepts by zadeh 1996 the fuzzy algorithm has been widely applied in water quality problems to solve uncertainties and complex multivariate influences jun and yanfang 2011 ma et al 2010 in this work the comprehensive fuzzy evaluation was used to the water quality classification of dong nai river as the following steps step 1 select assessment parameters the appropriate and representative parameters are selected for water quality assessment and arranged as a set of the evaluation object u x 1 x 2 x n where n the number of selected evaluation parameters includes parameters ph do sat cod bod5 tss ammonium turbidity and coliform step 2 set up evaluation criteria assessment criteria are developed based on national technical regulation on the surface water quality of viet nam qcvn 08 2015 national technical regulation on surface water quality 2015 and guiding water quality classification of vietnam environment administration decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 decision issuing the guidelines for calculation of the water quality index v e administration decision no 879 qđ tcmt 2011 in table 1 therefore the evaluation criteria set v is established to assess parameters in u which can be expressed as v y1 y2 ym where m is the number of assessment criteria categories the water quality is classified into five categories very good i good ii medium iii bad iv and poor v hence we got v i ii iii iv v step 3 establish membership functions and relationship matrix membership functions calculate the class of surface water quality boundary the membership function based on semi trapezoid distribution was suggested by xing et al xing et al 2011 we substitute the monitoring data of a few parameters at each monitoring station and national technical regulation into the membership functions then we got the fuzzy matrix r including m water quality parameters and n water quality standard classes which can be denoted as 2 r r 11 r 12 r 1 m r 21 r 22 r 2 m r n 1 r n 2 r nm n m where values rij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m are the membership level of the ith parameter to the jth level of evaluation criteria step 4 determine the weight the weights of the parameters are crucial when assessing water quality using the comprehensive fuzzy approach jun and yanfang 2011 the weights of the quality parameters were determined using the standard excess rate method jun and yanfang 2011 ma et al 2010 the advantage of this method is that the more over standard times parameters get the more influences on water quality become the following formula calculated the weights of the water quality parameters 3 a i k c i k s i k 4 a i k a i k i 1 n a i k where c i k means the monitoring concentration of the ith parameter at the kth monitoring station s i k is the average of evaluation criteria of the ith parameter a i k is the over standard times of the ith parameter at the kth monitoring site a i k means the weight of the ith evaluation parameter after appropriate computation the weight matrix a can be obtained a a1 k a2 k an k step 5 fuzzy comprehensive evaluation we implemented the fuzzy algorithm by matrix multiplication r a to be obtained a comprehensive evaluation matrix b b1 k b2 k bn k this fuzzy transformation process can be summarized as follows 5 f u f v a a r b b 1 k b 2 k b n k a 1 k a 2 k a n k r 11 r 12 r 1 m r 21 r 22 r 2 m r n 1 r n 2 r nm n m the class of water quality is the maximum level to be obtained from the matrix b max b1 k b2 k bn k 2 2 2 the nemerow index the water quality assessments can use the nemerow index recommended by nemerow and leonard 1974 this index has been used to evaluate the water quality by hao and ge 1989 islam et al 2015 in this study the nemerow index is also used to classify water quality 6 p s avg p i 2 m a x p i 2 2 where ps is the pollution index nemerow pi is the over standard value of pollution parameter i avgpi is the over standard average value of the pollution parameter i maxpi is the highest value exceeding the standard of the ith pollutant parameter pi is determined by formula 7 7 p i c i s i here ci is the concentration of pollutants in surface water si is the permissible concentration limit in surface water according to vietnamese standards water quality is classified into 5 corresponding categories very good i p 1 good ii 1 p 2 average pollution iii 2 p 3 bad iv 3 p 5 poor v p 5 qianzhang and hao 2018 tao et al 2011 2 2 3 feed forward neural network feed forward neural network ffnn model is developed to classify water quality in the dong nai river random numbers are generated based on the national surface water quality standard of vietnam as training data the parameters used to build an ffnn neural network based on vietnamese regulation and available monitoring data encompassing ph do sat cod bod5 tss ammonium turbidity and coliform as inputs the five water quality classes class i ii iii iv and v are transformed to 1 2 3 4 and 5 these five classes are assigned as the output variables for the training model respectively the neural network architecture consists of 3 layers i 8 hl m o 1 used in which i 8 has eight neurons as water quality parameters o 1 is the output layer with one neuron as water quality hl m is the hidden layer with m neurons the number of neurons m on the hidden layer will be determined during neural network training one of the first steps in establishing a training model is to divide the data set the training data have a ratio of 60 80 and the remaining data is used for validation and testing to avoid overfitting of the model given by ostad ali askari et al 2017 heddam 2016 and azad et al 2018 hence random data were randomly divided into 3 data sets including a 70 sample training set 700 samples 15 assessment set 150 samples and 15 test set 150 samples the levenberg marquardt training algorithm and the sigmoid transfer function for each layer were used guzman et al 2017 the loop for training neural networks reaches a maximum of 1000 epoch mu 1010 and gradient 10 7 the number of neurons m of the hidden layer is determined based on training and prediction of the model gazzaz et al 2012 singh et al 2009 in addition the formula for determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer is suggested by ke and liu 2008 stathakis 2009 the formula by zhang et al 2010 can be used in this study to limit the number of neurons m in the hidden layer 8 n i n o 2 n h n i n o 10 where n h is the number of neurons in the hidden layer n i is the number of input neurons and n o is the number of output neurons the process of building this ffnn neural network model is shown in fig 2 a neural network was built to classify water quality in the dong nai river by the matlab 2020a program the neural network training process is based on error change rmse furthermore the neuron of the output layer o 1 is water quality level which is classified into five different categories according to the water quality standards proposed by han yan and wang 2010 level i very good 0 to 1 5 level ii good 1 5 to 2 5 level iii medium 2 5 to 3 5 level iv bad 3 5 to 4 5 and level v poor 4 5 these categories comply with the guidelines for water quality classification of vietnam decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 decision issuing the guidelines for calculation of the water quality index v e administration decision no 879 qđ tcmt 2011 2 2 4 lstm ma neural network the long short term memory neural network is developed based on a feedback neural network rnn model the lstm model has an extended memory capacity and has a more complex structure wang et al 2019 the lstm model is well known as more efficient than other deep machine learning it can be faced with complexities krishan et al 2019 therefore the lstm model is suitable to predict the water quality classification which is influenced by several factors in the environment an lstm neural network also consists of an input layer an output layer and many hidden layers that are repeatedly connected each memory block is composed of one or more self responding cells connected to itself the three multiplier units are input output and forget gate it provides sequential read write and repeat operations for cells pak et al 2018 the lstm network structure is described in detail in wang et al 2019 in this study a long short term memory neural network lstm incorporating a moving average smoothing function was also used to classify the water quality the construction of an lstm ma neural network and the prediction process are depicted in fig 3 the water quality is classified according to the ffnn neural network model then the water quality at each monitoring point was smoothedby moving average ma the data are divided into 3 subsets training set validation set and test set training and validation data were collected from 2007 to 2017 some points from 2012 2017 the test set was taken between 2018 and 2019 the parameters used to build the lstm neural network include many hidden neurons maximum epoch loop learning rate determined through the experiment process the lstm ma was carried out several times to investigate the operational stability of the network structure 2 2 5 nonlinear autoregressive moving average neural network nar ma in addition to the water quality classification according to different methods we also use the nonlinear autoregressive moving average neural network nar ma to classify the dong nai river quality according to time series the nar neural network model is developed based on the nonlinear model nonlinear autoregressive neural network krishan et al 2019 le et al 2019 is applied to predict water quality in time series a description of a discrete and nonlinear autoregressive model can be written as follows 9 y t h y t 1 y t 2 y t p e t y is the value of water quality at the time t y t series of past values p the function h t p is not known in advance e t approximates the y series error at time t the research data includes 70 training set 15 validation training and 15 test set the neural network training algorithms levenberg marquardt and the error back propagation are used in the network training process the neural network training is finished with the smallest error 2 2 6 autoregressive integrated moving average model arima the autoregressive integrated moving average arima method is one of the well known time series models the arima model is often written arima p d q p d q s where p is the order of the autoregressive part of the model q is the order of the moving average part d indicates the average difference order d is the differencing order of the seasonal part s is the time period p is the order of the autoregressive seasonal part and q is the order of the moving average seasonal part the arima model was developed with four steps determining the time series stationery defining the model structure estimating the parameters and testing the model quality wei et al 2016 in this study water quality classification data at the monitoring points and different times are input data 2 3 model verification the statistical values were used to validate the neural network model such as the coefficient of determination r 2 mean square root error rmse ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 mean of absolute percent error mape and the nash efficiency coefficient sutcliffe nse adamowski and chan 2011 the high precision model with mape value δ ten value the excellent model with 10 mape δ 20 reasonable validation model with 21 mape 50 inaccurate validation model with mape 50 was recommended by david 1982 the nash sutcliffe coefficient is valid in the range nse 1 the efficiency coefficient nse 1 corresponds to the suitability for the water quality obtained from the model with observed data the efficiency coefficient nse is 0 which shows that the model value is equal to the observed data mean an nse value 0 indicates that the value obtained does not match the mean observed well thus the model predictive efficiency is not acceptable moriasi et al 2007 the formulas calculate the statistical values as follows 10 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 11 mape i 1 n y i y i y i n 12 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 13 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i y i i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 2 where yi is the ith observation value y is the actual average water quality ŷ i predictive value of the ith model y i is the mean water quality value from the model and n number of observed samples 2 4 scheme of the study the study process is outlined in fig 4 the tasks are carried out via several stages using an integration of different data driven tools from the research objectives water quality classification models are developed with the neural network ffnn the water quality classification models are built from random sample data which used the water quality standards and regulations as the training samples the class of water quality obtained from neural network ffnn was compared with other traditional methods like wqi vn fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and nemerow index we applied data mining techniques to screen and evaluate the reliability of water quality monitoring datasets for the dong nai river the lstm ma hybrid model is developed to forecast the water quality classification of the dong nai river in time series from the years 2020 to 2022 furthermore the water quality classification results from lstm ma models are evaluated and compared with the models arima nar nar ma and lstm to find optimal models the lstm ma models are also applied to forecast the water quality classification to provide the government and policymakers with better information for planning sustainable water resource management 3 results and discussion 3 1 building water quality classification models 3 1 1 constructing standard data many studies applied different neural network models to assess water quality based on water quality monitoring methods in this study the water quality is classified from sample data which used the water quality standards and regulations as the training samples training samples were created based on vietnamese classification standards for water quality decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 national technical regulation on surface water quality 2015 besides the water quality classification in level i and level ii consider the interfering boundary between outstanding 100 and good 90 water quality at the request of the vietnam environment administration le et al 2019 the concentration limits of water quality parameters are divided into five categories i ii iii iv and v table 1 the random sample data were generated based on concentration limits for each water quality parameter in each evaluation level to perform the water quality classification each class has 200 corresponding random samples generated the total data consist of 1000 samples divided into 5 different water quality levels for each parameter table 2 class i was represented by 200 random numbers that requested each parameter value generated 200 samples the same 200 random numbers in class ii were generated another 200 also created for class iii class iv and class v the random sample data set of the eight parameters are arranged vertically in order from class i to class v as the input variables the corresponding water quality class for the data set is considered the output variable 3 1 2 building ffnn model the feed forward neural network ffnn is built from data including a 70 training set 700 samples 15 validation set 150 samples and 15 test set 150 samples these data sets are randomly divided when carrying out the training model the architecture of neural network ffnn consists of 3 layers i 8 hl m o 1 here the number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined during the training ability investigation based on rmse values changes the number of neurons in the hidden layer hl m varies from 5 to 19 based on eq 8 however this study only investigates the number of neurons m varying from 7 to 11 neurons on the hidden layer hl m shown in table 3 the rmse error obtained from neural networks i 8 hl m o 1 increases with m increases from 9 to 11 and m decreases from 8 to 5 the modeling data sets are randomly assigned so the rmse error value in training evaluation and test sets changes according to the number of neurons in the hidden layer and parameters training number the neural network training is done with many loops to define a neural network structure with a lower value rmse and not overfitting occurs the received neural network has the lowest error in the training set validation set and test data the neural network structure i 8 hl 9 o 1 is optimal to classify water quality according to vietnamese regulations here the number of neurons in the hidden layer m of 9 this neural network uses a gradient of 0 01037 moment 10 05 and the rmse values are equal to 0 0392 0 0411 and 0 0423 respectively for the training validation and test set the r correlation coefficients of the training validation and test data set are approximately equal to 1 shown in table 3 and fig 5 this indicates that the water quality level of the model and the observed quality level matches significantly table 3 shows that the rmse value of the training validation and test data set is very consistent with no overfitting phenomenon this proves that the results obtained from the network model i 8 hl 9 o 1 are reliable and applicable compared with the statistical parameters of the neural network structures i 8 hl m o 1 with m 9 shows the neural network structure i 8 hl 9 o 1 is optimal the results of water quality classification obtained from an ffnn neural network with a structure i 8 hl 9 o 1 showed that the percentage of the mape value of training validation and test data sets is deficient at values 1 241 1 444 and 1 511 respectively all percent of mape is not larger than 10 the training results are outstanding and have high accuracy as suggested by david 1982 the nse coefficients obtained values 0 9998 0 9996 and 0 9996 respectively for training evaluation and testing sets the nash sutcliffe coefficients of these data sets are approximately equal to 1 this shows that the water quality classification from the ffnn model is well consistent with the actual quality levels 3 1 3 evaluating the water quality classification we evaluate the applicability and reliability of the water quality classification using the neural network model ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 by comparing with wqi water quality index according to vietnamese standards decision on the promulgation of technical guidelines for calculation and publication of the vietnam water quality index vn wqi 2019 nemerow index nemerow and leonard 1974 and comprehensive fuzzy method jun and yanfang 2011 ma et al 2010 the analysis and validation of the accuracy based on the confusion matrix for each model are indicated in table 4 the water quality classes obtained from the empirical models are compared with the actual water quality classes the accuracy ratio of each water quality classification from the experiment models and the actual level is determined as shown in table 4 the water quality level of the ffnn model is 100 correct at the whole level meanwhile the wqi vn water quality classification is wrong mainly at level 2 to level 4 the comprehensive fuzzy method and nemerow index show errors mainly at level 3 and level 4 these showed that the class obtained from the neural network ffnn model are well consistent with water quality in the sample sets the overall correctness of the confusion matrix for the fourth models is also expressed in table 4 these results revealed that ffnn scores the highest accuracy at 100 compared to the respective actual classes nevertheless the accuracy of using the nemerow index method is 95 followed by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce reaches 85 and the least accurate is the wqi vn about 41 to determine the reliability of the models the kappa coefficient is used to determine the reliability of the class of water quality haley and osberg 1989 the kappa coefficient ranges from 1 to 1 haley and osberg 1989 kraemer 2014 according to landis and koch the kappa coefficient is proposed as follows 0 81 1 is perfect 0 6 0 8 is good 0 41 0 6 is moderate and 0 21 0 4 is fair 0 0 2 is slight and 0 is poor landis and koch 1977 the analysis results by the confusion matrix for the ffnn neural network have the kappa coefficient of 1 this reveals the highest value compared to the remaining water quality classification models the neural network ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 shows its ability to classify water quality following the observed environmental quality the method of water quality classification according to the wqi vn index gives the kappa number 0 256 0 4 thus this method of classifying this water quality gives classification results as inappropriate the results of the water quality classification here can be seen that the neural network ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 gives the results following the standard regulation national technical regulation on surface water quality 2015 the results obtained of the neural network ffnn are more accurate than the previously used water quality classification 3 2 classification of water quality in the dong nai river 3 2 1 preparing the monitoring data before using the neural network ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 to classify water quality in the dong nai river vietnam the water quality data of the dong nai river were obtained from monitoring stations and checked for outliers that could affect the ability to classify the river water quality by model ffnn i 8 hl 9 o 1 grubbs test results are shown in table 5 the temperature parameters oc ph do have no abnormal values p value α 0 05 unconfident probability during monitoring the remaining parameters appeared abnormal values in the data set p value α 0 05 the abnormal values are checked with the original data carefully and determine the cause some rough outliers caused by the observational data acquisition were removed from the data set and adjusted to assume values through mcmc and nipal methods the water quality data for the dong nai river were obtained from 19 monitoring points in binh duong and dong nai provinces the data were collected from 2012 to 2019 the data collected during this period were used to classify the water quality of the different models in the period 2012 2019 the collection process of monitoring data from the monitoring points was stable the results of the water quality classification for the dong nai river are shown in table 6 the assessment results of monitoring points conducted in time series show that the dong nai river is at a medium pollution level most monitoring points indicate the water quality at level iii this result is consistent with the published research results of ai et al 2014 tran et al 2014 the water quality of dong nai river over the years 2012 2019 at different monitoring points shows that districts of vinh cuu dong nai section from song be dong nai river to ba mieu wharf thanh phu commune the river water pollution tends to increase in the years 2012 2018 from level 2 to level 3 except for monitoring point sw dn 06 ba mieu pier thanh phu commune in these areas water quality is affected mainly by urban and agricultural activities between binh duong and dong nai provinces the population is quite crowded along the two riversides of the vinh cuu district and tan uyen town river water quality in the river area flowing through tan uyen town binh duong province has an average water quality of polluted water level 3 and does not change much from 2012 to 2019 water quality in the river section passing through the city bien hoa street from hoa an bridge to dong nai bridge is heavily influenced by bien hoa city the dong nai river quality changed from level 2 to level 3 at most of the monitoring points moreover bien hoa city currently does not have an adequate domestic wastewater treatment system for residential areas so dong nai river has received many wastewater sources from residential areas and service centers also the survey results for this river section are affected by fish farming activities and sand exploitation therefore the water quality for the section of a river crossing bien hoa city is polluted besides the river section from the confluence of buong river dong nai river to saigon river dong nai river flows through the industrial area of nhon trach and long thanh districts the level of water pollution in this river section is at a medium level level 3 the pollution level has fluctuated over the years but the amplitude is not large the predicted results are represented by the water quality map for the dong nai river as depicted in fig 6 which shows that the dong nai river is progressing positively but still in a state of pollution in 2012 the river water quality in the section passing binh duong and dong nai provinces changed from level 2 to 3 the section passing binh duong and downstream also had the pollution at level 3 average level in 2015 the area with good water quality green narrowed and yellow and orange were increasing in the vinh cuu district bien hoa city and nhon trach district dong nai province this has reflected increased pollution levels the orange and red areas largely indicate increased downstream pollution levels as a result of research in this area many industrial clusters have come into operation and some industrial clusters do not have wastewater treatment systems and at the same time the urbanization process is happening rapidly the domestic wastewater treatment system has not been built up leading to a decline in water quality in 2018 and 2019 the dong nai river water improved and pollution was moderate but the yellow area has spread to areas outside of bien hoa city the water quality in the river section before entering bien hoa city in tan uyen town and vinh cuu district has improved the narrow orange areas replace mainly yellow the river water quality in the downstream area the river passing through the industrial zone nhon trach and long thanh districts has much improved water quality the environmental monitoring results show that most of the river water quality passing through the industrial zones in nhon trach and long thanh districts has been improved due to wastewater treatment plants the water quality at monitoring points of the dong nai river includes 21 monitoring points building the water quality forecasting models at the points consists of many stages and many steps for the convenience of monitoring we used two monitoring points sw đn07 and sw đn15 for comparison during the construction of the most suitable models for predicting the dong nai river water quality level site sw dn07 is the monitoring point in the river section over bien hoa city and monitoring point sw dn15 is in the section passing the industrial zone in long thanh and nhon trach these are two river sections with higher pollution levels than other sections the monitoring data show monthly pollution levels at sw dn07 and sw dn15 the observation results show that the changes in water quality at 2 points vary by month of the year as shown in fig 7 the augmented dickey fuller test checks the monitoring data at the different monitoring stations to investigate the water quality classification the results show that the water quality classification data is stable p value 0 0001 3 2 2 forecast of water quality by arima we used the arima model to predict water quality over time series to build the arima model the monitoring data on average water quality from 2007 to 2017 at the monitoring point sw dn 07 are used to train the arima model the observed data in 2018 and 2019 are used to test the predictability of the arima model the data consist of 20 time steps used to evaluate the model validation and 12 steps are used to test the predictability the autocorrelation function acf also showed that sine waves diffused the remaining positive and negative correlations and all were not statistically significant as shown in fig 8a from there the largest mean p is 3 and 1 similarly the partial autocorrelation function pacf also shows that the partial correlation coefficients other than 0 reach a statistically significant level at 0 1 2 latency as in fig 8b the maximum correlation coefficient of regression p and seasonal self regression q is 1 many arima models for monitoring point sw dn 07 have been constructed with the adjustment of different model parameters however the results received 16 arima models with parameters p and q in the range columbia basin trust xxxx jiang qi et al 2013 and d 1 showing consistent statistical values the corrected akaike s information criterion aicc sugiura 1978 is used to select a suitable arima model the arima model is most suitable if the aicc values are small the arima model with parameters p 0 d 1 and q 1 gives the lowest aicc value of 225 626 this model depicts the lowest blue circle shown in fig 9 therefore the model arima 0 1 0 1 1 1 12 is the most suitable for forecasting water quality in the dong nai river at the monitoring point sw dn07 furthermore the model arima 0 1 0 1 1 1 12 gave mape and rmse values for the training set of 0 1763 0 30 and 0 6198 1 0 as shown in table 7 this arima model has the highest accuracy in addition this arima model gives values mape and rmse of 0 1254 and 0 4904 for the validation set respectively this also proves that the model arima 0 1 0 1 1 1 12 selected is the most suitable for forecasting the dong nai river water quality at the monitoring point sw dn 07 for the monitoring point sw dn 15 the modeling process is also set up by changing parameters p d and q to find the best arima model all possible models have been compared based on aicc values this arima model has an aicc value of 259 33 therefore the model arima 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 was chosen as the most suitable model this model can be used to predict the water quality at the sw dn15 point the arima model applied for the training and validation set has given the mape and rmse values of 0 1553 0 2186 0 7095 and 0 8435 respectively therefore the model arima 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 to the monitoring point sw dn 15 is the most accurate and appropriate as shown in table 7 the operability of two arima models was assessed by comparing the errors between the monitored values and those from the arima model the forecast value is calculated from 2 arima models 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 of the monitoring points sw dn07 and sw dn15 shown in fig 10 the model arima 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 is used for the test set at the monitoring point sw dn 07 has given the mape and rmse values of 0 2462 and 0 7963 respectively also at the monitoring point sw dn15 the values mape and rmse are 0 2174 and 0 6956 respectively this result shows that the arima models predicted water quality 0 1 1 1 1 1 12 is in good agreement with the actual observed results these study results are consistent with other studies done recently in different regions such as katimon et al 2018 implementation of water quality projections in malaysia and wang et al 2019 to forecast shihe reservoir water quality 3 2 3 forecast of water quality by nar ma the water quality monitoring data is smoothed by the moving average model ma to build the nar ma neural network model the parameters established in the ma model include the equal weighted method q equals 1 and at the confidence level 95 the output values of the ma model are used as input variables of the nar ma hybrid model the different monitoring stations data were divided into 80 training data 10 validation data and 10 test data the delay d is investigated in the range 1 6 the number of neurons surveyed in the hidden layer according to eq 5 is from 2 to 15 neurons the training algorithm used was levenberg marquardt this algorithm has a large memory and shorter training time so this training process will be fast and highly accurate the training process is repeated many times and stops automatically when the modeling mse error is the lowest the model nar ma is considered not overfitting when the mse error of this model for the training validation and test sets has the lowest value fig 11 we experimented with changing many nar ma model parameters to choose the best model for monitoring point sw dn 07 the nar ma model with the number of neurons m 4 in the hidden layer and the delay d of 2 is the most suitable for the nar ma model the predictive ability at the sw dn 07 point is presented in the appropriate rmse value and correlation coefficient the nar ma model predicted the different data sets with the rmse error values in the training set of 0 2815 the validation set of 0 285 and the test set of 0 2899 besides the forecast values resulting from the nar ma model for the training validation and testing sets at the sw dn 07 monitoring point are all distributed near the standard line as shown in fig 11 the r correlation coefficient of the training validation and test set results from the nar ma model is 0 8671 0 8990 and 0 8490 this indicates that the predicted water quality levels from the nar ma model correlate well with the monitored data the nar ma model that can be applied to forecast the water quality levels of the dong nai river is appropriate 3 2 4 forecast of water quality by lstm ma we use the monthly average water quality monitoring data of sw dn 07 dong nai river from 2007 to 2019 to build the lstm ma model the training and validation sets were taken from the water monitoring data in the years 2007 to 2017 the validation data were randomly selected by 10 the monitoring data in the years 2018 and 2019 were used for testing this model moreover the water quality data were screened and smoothed by the moving average model with parameters q 1 and the equal weight at a confidence level of 95 the water quality values obtained in this step are used as the input values of the lstm ma model the neural network was trained with the adaptive moment estimation adam algorithm proposed by kingma and ba 2015 the tanh transfer function and the sigmoid activation function have defaulted for the neural network training process the maximum epoch parameter was set for model lstm ma in 110 during the training and validation process the remaining parameters are set for the lstm ma model including the gradient threshold of 1 the learn rate drop period of 125 and the learn rate drop factor of 0 2 the neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate are investigated through many different experiments to find the most suitable value determining the number of neurons in the hidden layer is difficult so far there is no general rule given by panchal et al 2011 in this study the hidden layer neurons are investigated from 10 to 150 to find the optimal number of neurons for the lstm ma model the results of running the model show that the number of neurons m 100 in the hidden layer gives the most suitable rmse value fig 12 a this lstm ma model gives the rmse value of 0 5749 for the test set and 0 3663 for the validation set as shown in fig 12a the model lstm ma with the number of neurons m 20 in the hidden layer gives an rmse value of 0 2638 for the validation set and for the test set the rmse value is 0 6152 which is greater than that obtained from model lstm ma with the number of neurons m 100 in the hidden layer therefore the number of neurons in the hidden layer m 100 selected is optimal for the lstm ma model this is following the research results suggested by liu et al 2019 moreover the learning rate is also essential in the training process the learning rate of the lstm ma model is changed from 0 001 to 0 01 with the learning rate of 0 008 the lstm ma model has an rmse value of 0 3254 for the evaluation group and for the test group it is 0 5737 as shown in fig 12b the rmse values are lower than those from other learning rates the learning rate also affects the training process of the lstm model this was also pointed out by breuel 2015 thus the number of neurons m 100 in the hidden layer and learning rate of 0 008 are suitable to train the lstm ma model for the monitoring point sw dn 07 similarly for the monitoring point sw dn 15 the lstm ma model is built with the number of neurons m 100 in the hidden layer the learning rate is 0 001 and the maximum epoch value is 110 3 2 5 predictive performance of the methods to find the model for forecasting and classifying the water quality of the dong nai river the models arima nar nar ma lstm and lstm ma were constructed to compare the forecast results of the hybrid model integrated lstm moving average monitoring points sw dn07 and sw dn15 are used to illustrate the model predictability shown in table 8 different time series can affect the accuracy of forecast results the models arima nar nar ma lstm and lstm ma are used to predict the dong nai river water quality in two time series months k 24 and k 12 as seen in table 8 the hybrid lstm model combined with moving average gives good predictive results in all cases this model predicts for the monitoring points sw dn07 and sw dn 15 giving the better rmse value than the models arima nar nar ma and lstm the lstm model always has the minimum rmse value for the test set for the monitoring point sw dn 07 the lstm ma model gives the rmse value of 0 3254 for the validation set this is higher than the rmse value of 0 285 obtained from the nar ma model for the test set the rmse value of 0 5748 of the lstm ma model is the lowest for the validation set and test set the mape value of the lstm ma model was lower than other models at the monitoring point sw dn 15 the rmse values of the lstm ma model for the test and forecast set are 0 2868 and 0 4731 respectively for the validation set at the monitoring point sw dn07 the rmse value obtained from the lstm ma model is higher than the nar ma model however for the forecast set the rmse value of the lstm ma model is smaller than those from the nar ma lstm nar and arima models the mape value of the lstm ma model applied to the monitoring points sw dn 07 and sw dn 15 are also significantly lower than those from other models in this study the rmse and mape values for the arima model are higher than those of the neural network models nar nar ma lstm and lstm ma integrated neural network models nar ma and lstm ma give more consistent results than pure neural network models in particular the lstm ma model has high stability the predicted values of the monitoring point sw dn07 and sw dn15 resulting from the lstm ma model are in good agreement with the actual observed values as illustrated in fig 13 the prediction results of the different models in table 8 by time series months k 24 are not much different from those by time series months k 12 the models can be sorted by predictability lstm ma lstm nar ma nar arima 3 3 forecast of water quality classification in the years 2020 to 2022 from the lstm ma model predictability the lstm ma models have been used to predict the different monitoring points on the dong nai river the building parameters for this neural network model such as the number of hidden neurons epoch and learning rate are adjusted to find a model for the predictive results consistent with the dong nai river water quality the statistical results for the lstm ma models at 21 monitoring points on the dong nai river are shown in table 9 the forecast results of the dong nai river water quality classification in the years 2020 to 2022 are shown in table 10 the water quality of the dong nai river is generally still polluted at level iii this is the common average pollution level in the duration from 2020 to 2022 the highest pollution level is level v at the monitoring point sw dn 04 in vinh cuu district in 2020 however level iii is the pollution level at monitoring points for the river flowing through the vinh cuu district in 2020 it is forecast that the water quality flowing through the vinh cuu district tends to improve the pollution level will decrease gradually from 2020 to 2022 the water quality is forecasted to improve in the vinh cuu district in 2022 but not significantly compared to 2019 most monitoring points sw dn 03 sw dn 04 sw dn 05 and sw dn 06 have pollution levels in the range ii iii similarly the dong nai river water quality which passes through binh duong province is forecasted to have no significant change soon the forecast results for the next three years show that the average water pollution is level iii the monitoring point dn 04 is the only point where the average pollution level improves from level iv in 2019 to level iii in 2022 the river section flows through the bien hoa city and water quality is expected to improve slightly in 2020 the highest pollution was level iv the number of pollution points is much higher than the 4 9 points the monitoring point sw dn 13 has the water quality at pollution level iv it is forecasted that by 2022 the water quality in bien hoa city tends to improve for most of the monitoring points the pollution levels at the monitoring points will fluctuate at levels 2 to 3 for the monitoring point sw dn 12 the water quality can be improved to a better level the water quality trend in bien hoa city will be improved in the coming years because bien hoa city has deployed a wastewater collection system with a pipeline of 120 km and a treatment capacity of 390000 m3 day and night in tam hiep ward the industrial zones and clusters in bien hoa citadel have upgraded and built the wastewater treatment systems before being discharged into the dong nai river source the river section flowing through the industrial zones of long thanh and nhon trach districts the forecast for water quality in 2020 shows that the pollution level here is still quite high common pollution levels at the monitoring points are level iii and level iv according to the forecast results of water quality at sw dn 16 and sw dn 17 there seems to be no improvement in pollution level 3 at monitoring points sw dn 18 and sw dn 19 the forecast results for water sources are at level 4 highest value the water quality at these two monitoring points also seems to have no change from 2020 to 2022 currently there are many industrial clusters in operation that do not have wastewater treatment systems some wastewater treatment systems are efficient in handling organic and microbiological pollutants that do not meet quality standards the impact of industrial wastewater in this area is quite large many urban projects are planned and developed in recent years leading to water pollution in the river the dong nai river water quality is still polluted and not significantly improved in the coming time as can be seen in fig 14 the water quality map of the dong nai river tends to improve in 2019 the dong nai river water quality was at a high level of pollution from the section flowing through bien hoa city section 3 to the section flowing through nhon trach and long thanh industrial zones districts orange and red areas it is forecasted that water quality from 2020 to 2022 will be improved 4 conclusion this study successfully used the chemometric statistical tools and the neural network models to classify and predict the dong nai river water quality vietnam the monitoring data from 2007 to 2019 collected from different monitoring stations were screened and classified reliably according to parameters ph do sat cod bod5 tss ammonium turbidity and coliform before building the models arima 0 1 3 1 1 1 nar nar ma lstm lstm ma the neural network models have been cross validated with different methods of water quality classification the ffnn neural network model with i 8 hl 9 o 1 architecture has been successfully developed for the water quality classification this model gives accurate and reliable classification results the hybrid lstm ma model has also been successfully developed to classify the dong nai river water quality by different time series the hybrid lstm ma model has proven to have faster training time and more stable and reliable predictability than the arima nar nar ma and lstm models the lstm ma hybrid model can classify water quality independently of traditional methods the lstm ma hybrid model becomes a reliable predictive method for future water quality and the dong nai river changes the water quality levels at the monitoring points predicted by the lstm ma hybrid model are appropriate and reliable the forecast results show that the study area does not change significantly in the period 2020 2022 the water quality levels at most monitoring points of dong nai river fluctuate around level

4728,on rough agricultural soils initiation of overland flow is primarily related to the gradual filling of small depressions as the volume of water ponding in local depressions increases the connectivity of those depressions increases and that connectivity permits flow across the field boundaries previous studies have aimed at predicting overland flow connectivity by means of depression storage but this is exceedingly difficult to quantify during an irrigation or rainfall event there has been little work linking overland flow connectivity through variables that are more readily measured than depression storage such as the proportion of the soil surface covered in water a sw we propose using a sw as a proxy for hydrological connectivity which can be measured using proximal remote sensing a series of overland flow experiments were conducted in two contrasting plots of 1 5 m2 outlet discharge and changes in soil surface covered in water were continuously recorded during the experiments the experiments demonstrated that the rougher soil surface experienced a delayed initiation of overland flow the results also showed overland flow initiation was characterised by a distinct connectivity threshold and showed a clear response of overland flow to a sw we further investigated the hydrological connectivity in twenty one additional agricultural soils with contrasting micro topographic conditions our results suggest that a predictor based on a sw has substantial potential to predict initiation of overland flow the prediction is sufficiently early that it could be used in modern variable rate irrigation systems in combination with a sensor to measure a sw in real time to prevent substantial flow from fields during irrigation keywords soil roughness micro topography depression storage variable rate irrigation runoff 1 introduction sprinkler irrigation a modern and commonly used system of irrigating is a method of applying water in a controlled manner in that is similar to rainfall hedley et al 2014 however excessive application rates or amounts of irrigation can lead to an accumulation of surface water in small depressions on the soil surface appels et al 2011 chu et al 2015 in turn the accumulation of surface water results in overland flow and a high risk of contaminant loss blaustein et al 2015 deasy et al 2009 mcdowell et al 2003 mcdowell and houlbrooke 2009 moreover the infiltration of ponded water in microtopographic depressions can result in increased macropore flow causing greater water losses and leaching close et al 2007 while irrigation systems should be designed to apply water at rates below the infiltration rate of the soil o shaughnessy et al 2015 to minimise ponding and overland flow soil surface conditions can change rapidly in space and time drewry et al 2008 2019 as a result even under well designed irrigation systems the application rate can exceed the soil s infiltration rate and result in irrigation induced overland flow iof see table 1 for definitions of the terms used here once iof is generated there is the potential for the rapid mobilisation of nutrients and contaminants from the soil although the frequency and size of iof events can be small compared to those of rainfall induced overland flow laurenson et al 2018 iof is similar to rainfall induced overland flow in having a severe impact on surface water quality because of the relatively large quantity of nutrients and contaminants that can be transported rapidly heathwaite et al 2005 louchart et al 2001 monaghan et al 2016 van der salm et al 2012 minimising iof is therefore key in reducing contamination and eutrophication of water bodies and improving the environmental performance of irrigation systems soil surface depressions delay the initiation of overland flow chu et al 2015 darboux and huang 2005 zhao et al 2018 and enhance the retention of water that would otherwise run off a field the soil surface is generally characterised by numerous depressions across scales increasing soil roughness tends to decrease overland flow volume chu et al 2015 as well as reducing its velocity cogo et al 1983 as a result soil erosion and transport of nutrients and contaminants to water bodies are reduced govers et al 2000 helming et al 1998 the development of ponding in surface depressions and the way in which depressions merge and form flow pathways depends on the spatial organisation of the microtopography of the field as depressions fill hydraulic connections are established with neighbouring depressions the hydrologic connectivity c of the field increases leading to the initiation of overland flow antoine et al 2009 consequently overland flow may exhibit a threshold based runoff response which can be attributed to the filling spilling and merging processes and related threshold based overland flow generation chu et al 2015 2013 peñuela et al 2013 a sharp increase in overland flow usually occurs when certain area of the field is connected to the outlet or field boundary defined as connectivity threshold c ct peñuela et al 2015 several studies have investigated the filling spilling and merging of water in soil surface depressions antoine et al 2009 appels et al 2011 chu et al 2015 2013 darboux et al 2002b peñuela et al 2015 shaw et al 2013 most of these studies have investigated the development of ponding and overland flow generation often at plot scales from the perspective of functional hydrological connectivity the relative surface connection function rscf antoine et al 2009 peñuela et al 2015 rscf is a simplification of the runoff hydrograph where the vertical axis represents the instantaneous overland flow rate at the field boundaries normalised by the instantaneous rainfall rate and the horizontal axis represents the depression storage depth d s normalised by the maximum depression storage depression storage capacity dsc value yielding the relative depression storage rds 0 rds 1 due to the assumption of instantaneous flow in the construction of the rscf the normalised flow rate is equivalent to the percentage of the surface connected to the lower outlet of the field one of the main advantages of rscf is that it provides a functional integrated metric because it explicitly integrates the flow network at the soil surface peñuela et al 2016 the instantaneous flow model is also computationally much faster than a full two dimensional hydraulic model e g wu et al 2020 and is therefore more suitable for analysing large numbers of elevation points or in circumstances where fast processing times are needed peñuela et al 2013 further showed that when border effects were negligible overland flow was initiated at a c ct in practice c ct can be defined as the point where the slope of the rscf equals 1 peñuela et al 2015 the rds at c ct represents the minimum depth of stored water needed to initiate overland flow from the perspective of overland flow prevention and management c ct could be a decision trigger as it occurs early enough to minimise or prevent substantial iof for it to be successful c needs to be known for the irrigated area sensors need to be in place to monitor c and the irrigation equipment needs to be equipped with controls to stop or reduce irrigation in response to sensor observations current developments in irrigation technology e g variable rate irrigation o shaughnessy et al 2015 can enable such on the fly decision making although c can be estimated through the measurement of d s using rscf quantifying the changes in d s during an irrigation event is exceedingly difficult therefore it would be beneficial to investigate whether d s can be replaced by a more easily quantifiable variable that could for example be obtained with proximal remote sensing a recent study has demonstrated that the proportion of soil surface covered in water a sw m2 m 2 can be quantified in real time using proximal remote sensing during an irrigation event bradley et al 2020 it is therefore of interest to investigate whether a sw can be linked to the overland flow generation process that replaces measurement of d s as the a sw increases we hypothesize that overland flow connectivity will also increase and therefore increase the risk of overland flow while previous work has suggested that such a link could be possible peñuela et al 2015 our aim is to make this explicit the overall objective of this study was to examine whether overland flow initiation can be predicted using a sw during an irrigation event on relatively flat areas in doing so we first examined the effect of a sw on the overland flow initiation using field experiments we then used the fast areal simulator with topography for runoff model hereafter referred to as fastr appels et al 2011 to investigate the development of c as a function of a sw for soils of contrasting microtopographic conditions the aim of the modelling was to provide a measure of c and explore how c may be affected by a sw we further investigated the hydrological connectivity as a function of a sw in a range of agricultural soils with contrasting micro topographic conditions specifically we address the following questions i is a sw sufficiently linked to the overland flow generation process that it can be used to predict the initiation of overland flow ii how variable are the microtopographies of a range of agricultural land cover types in terms of dsc and hydrological connectivity and iii how are the characteristics of microtopography and a sw related to the initiation of overland flow in a range of agricultural land use types in order to address the above research questions this study focuses on relatively flat 2 agricultural field of varying surface conditions while naturally hilly areas are more sensitive to erosion and runoff risk is higher flat lands are relatively easy to farm and often have deep and nutrient rich soil brubaker et al 1993 ziadat 2005 and therefore many agricultural fields around the world are selected for being flat fao 1976 to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to make a quantitative link between overland flow connectivity and the proportion of soil covered in water 2 materials and methods a series of overland flow experiments were carried out to investigate the relationship between surface water coverage a sw and overland flow connectivity c the overland flow experiments are described in section 2 1 to further examine the effects of soil microtopography on c soil microtopography was assessed for six additional land cover types across twenty one locations section 2 2 deals with the assessment of soil micro topography for the six land cover types fastr was used to model c the model was first tested using the data from the overland flow experiments and then was extrapolated to investigate the overland flow connectivity for the six land cover types section 2 3 describes the overland flow modelling 2 1 overland flow experiments a series of overland flow experiments were conducted in a permanent pasture grazed by sheep to examine the effects of surface microrelief on irrigation induced overland flow iof in conjunction with other factors of importance to iof two 1 5 m2 field plots henceforth referred to as plot a and plot b 5 m apart were established in the agresearch research farm 43 628 s 172 471 e near christchurch new zealand as shown in fig 1 and table 2 the two plot surfaces differed in spatial organization of their microtopography and random roughness values both plot surfaces had an overall slope of 2 towards their outlets where overland flow was collected and recorded as described below irrigation was applied using a portable variable intensity rainfall simulator fig 2 the same rainfall simulator was used on both plots the rainfall simulator used three teejet 1 4hh ss30wsq nozzles spraying systems co wheaton il usa at a height of 2 5 m above the soil surface to gain terminal velocity mcdowell and sharpley 2003 we assessed the uniformity of water application using christiansen s coefficient david 1978 taking data from eight 0 2 l containers within plot a the uniformity coefficient was 95 and therefore spatial variation of irrigation within the runoff plots was assumed negligible overland flow experiments were carried out using a series of irrigation intensities ranging from 50 to 80 mm h 1 table 3 rates common under centre pivot irrigators of 400 800 m length in the central part of the canterbury region new zealand powers 2012 a tipping bucket rain gauge rain collector ii davis instruments usa 0 2 mm per tip was installed under the rainfall simulator close to each plot to collect the irrigation amount and intensity topsoil 0 6 cm volumetric soil water content was measured at the centre of the plots before and after each experiment using a portable time domain reflectometry ml3 thetaprobe delta t devices overland flow was collected in a buried 20 l bucket at the outlet of each plot the height of water accumulated in the bucket was measured continuously using a pressure transducer true trac new zealand and converted to volume using a calibrated relationship between water level and volume overland flow volume was divided by the projected plot area to give a time series of overland flow in mm for each experimental run each experiment continued until a steady state flow rate was achieved 15 30 min soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of the topsoil 0 10 cm was measured at seven locations near the plots using a single ring infiltrometer following the method outlined in verbist et al 2010 a downward facing 3d structured light camera intel realsense tm depth camera d415 hence forth referred to as the 3d camera was used to assess the soil microtopography at 1 minute intervals during irrigation the microtopography included small changes resulting from depressions filling with water so that changes could be calculated during each experiment the 3d camera produced a 3d point cloud describing the soil surface for further processing the depth data were loaded into the meshlab software http www meshlab net to clean the 3d images for any stray data clip the image to the limits of the runoff plot and then convert the data into a format suitable for loading into the gis software as a text delimited layer after the point clouds had been suitably cleaned they were loaded into the qgis software http qgis osgeo org to produce high resolution digital elevation models grundy et al 2020 an image of the soil surface taken before the simulation experiments was used to provide a dry soil image as the small pockets of water accumulated they resulted in a change in the height of a given pixel so a sw was calculated using the height difference between any given image and the baseline image on pixel by pixel basis 2 2 survey of additional agricultural fields of varying microtopography to further investigate the effect of soil surface roughness on dsc and c 3d images were acquired on agricultural fields of varying surface conditions but all of low slope 2 using the 3d camera the data were obtained in the central part of the canterbury region new zealand the site locations were representative of the local farming area with mainly flat terrain predominantly shallow and stony soils kear et al 1967 and an annual rainfall of 620 mm macaea 2016 fields were classified based on grazing type and intensity cultivation status and observed damage to the soil surface 3d images were acquired from twenty one agricultural paddocks of the following classes i contoured soil ii fine cultivation iii heavy cattle pugging iv light cattle pugging v rough cultivation and vi sheep grazing the sites were selected to give a wide range of surface roughness characteristics as described in table 4 prior to measurement vegetation and surface litter were removed from the surface with as little surface disturbance as possible the 3d camera was set at 1 0 m above the soil surface so the measurement area was 1 2 m 0 8 m in order to capture the spatial variability in soil microtopography 2 3 images from different locations within each site were captured data detrending was implemented using python python 2 7 14 script to remove the tilt trend of the measured surface height before computing the surface roughness for each plot the data were detrended by subtracting a linear fitting equation from the measured surface cf xingming et al 2014 vertical soil surface roughness was calculated as the standard deviation of the detrended elevation data this metric is also referred to as random roughness rr kuipers 1957 because of its simplicity the random roughness index is one of the most widely used soil surface parameters that has been related to dsc cerdan et al 2002 moldenhauer 1970 dsc for each plot was calculated using fastr by finding and filling depressions until they overflow see section 2 3 moreover it has been shown that the soil surface roughness in horizontal direction also affects dsc peñuela et al 2015 to further investigate the effect of horizontal soil surface roughness we calculated the average depression area for each site and converted that to equivalent average depression diameter herein after referred to as average depression size 2 3 modelling overland flow and connectivity the fastr model see appels et al 2011 for details was used to model overland flow rates and connectivity fastr uses a routing algorithm to detect depressions in the surface topography and determines a micro catchment for each depression the model then constructs an internal database of the storage capacity of each micro catchment as well as the location and elevation of the spill points from each micro catchment to its neighbours a water balance is constructed for each micro catchment in every timestep of a simulation when a micro catchment is full water is transferred instantaneously to a neighbouring catchment via their lowest shared spill point if both catchments are full water is transferred to a subsequent catchment or the two merge to form a new larger catchment eventually through these spilling and merging processes a pathway or connection to the outlet of the modelled area is generated and water exits the domain as runoff fastr is in the class of instantaneous flow models that are computationally faster than full two dimensional soil hydraulic models antoine et al 2009 this makes fastr suitable for the analysis of a large numbers of elevation points e g 40 000 per m 2 in the current study the assumption of instantaneous water flow is a reasonable simplification in the case of surfaces with numerous depressions where the transfer of water is controlled primarily by the duration needed to fill the depressions and the time required by water to move from one depression to the other can be neglected fastr outputs allow the calculation of d s as the cumulative volume in the micro depressions divided by the total plot area as well as the calculation of a sw m2 m 2 as the cumulative area subjected to ponding divided by the total plot area the model uses two parameter philip s infiltration equation eq 1 philip 1957 to calculate infiltration rate in every cell of the model domain 1 i s 2 t k p where i is the infiltration rate l t 1 s is the sorptivity l t 1 2 t is time since the start of irrigation t and k p l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity in this study we treated k p as the k sat of the upper soil layer since eq 1 is valid under ponded conditions a time correction was applied when the equation was used for infiltration under rainfall conditions see appels et al 2011 for details the overland flow connectivity was quantified using the rscf antoine et al 2009 peñuela et al 2013 the rscf function expresses the fraction of the field area that has a direct flow connection to an exit point of the field as a function of the volume of water stored in the topography of field depression storage d s in the rscf the vertical axis represents the instantaneous overland flow rate at the boundaries normalised by the instantaneous rainfall in units of volume yielding the ratio of area connected to the bottom outlet c the horizontal axis represents the d s normalised by the dsc yielding the relative depression storage rds antoine et al 2009 in this study we used a sw as the independent variable instead of rds further we defined critical value of a sw as the point in rscf curve when the rate of increase of c is equal to the rate of increase of a sw in other words a sw at c ct represents a critical value of a sw the critical value of a sw was determined by calculating the first derivative or slope of the rscf when border effects are negligible critical value of a sw represents the minimum soil surface area covered in water needed to initiate overland flow the border effect essentially represents the plot area already connected to the outlet before any water is added cf peñuela et al 2015 2 3 1 model testing with the overland flow experiments fastr was first tested using the data collected in the overland flow experiment section 2 1 to examine its ability to simulate depression filling spilling and merging processes and quantifying hydrologic connectivity fastr was supplied with a 5 mm resolution dem for each of the two plots the data collected from the experiments included outlet discharge volumetric soil moisture content k sat and a sw as the soil moisture values at the start of the overland experiments were fairly high table 3 the effect of sorptivity on the infiltration was assumed to be negligible and therefore a value close to zero was used largely to prevent the numerical instability in the model simulation fastr was run with 30 second time steps and simulation results were compared with the observed data for outlet discharge and changes in a sw 2 3 2 overland flow connectivity for various microtopographic conditions fastr was further used to quantify the hydrological connectivity and therefore the risk of overland flow using the rscf for the various types of agricultural soils described above in order to simplify the process we focused on the filling spilling merging processes in doing so soil surfaces were considered to be saturated so that temporal and spatial variation in infiltration capacity could be assumed to be negligible in reality spatial variation in infiltration can play a key role in connectivity disruption as runoff water can infiltrate when it reaches downhill locations with higher infiltration capacity gomi et al 2008 for the infiltration model parametrization we used k sat value of 27 mm h 1 from the overland flow experiment sorptivity for saturated soil surface was assumed to be close to zero for this scale of this study we considered the overland flow that is fed by a uniform and net supply of water at a rate of 18 mm h 1 each plot had a size of 1 2 m 0 8 m and was discretized into 5 5 mm cells 3 results and discussion we present the results from the overland flow experiments in section 3 1 section 3 2 deals with the effects of surface roughness on depression storage capacity for the various agriculture soil cover types finally the effects of surface micro topography on overland flow connectivity for the various agriculture soils and their implications for irrigation management are presented in section 3 3 3 1 filling spilling merging dynamics in the two detailed runoff plots fig 3 upper row shows the development of irrigation induced overland flow iof and surface water coverage a sw with time for event 1 with several snapshots of water coverage assessed by the 3d camera fig 3 middle and lower rows showing the filling spilling and merging dynamics as the irrigation event progressed a sw increased in both plots the initial stage was characterized by the gradual filling of individual isolated depressions the second stage featured merging of small depressions that shared a common spill point to form larger ponds fig 3c g overland flow at the outlet for the experiment depicted in fig 3 was observed at 5 min in plot a and at 7 min in plot b at this time a sw values were 0 15 m2 m 2 plot a and 0 18 m2 m 2 plot b in the third stage fig 3d h the filling spilling merging process continued and hydraulic connection was established across most of the depressions in the soil surface all depressions eventually contributed runoff water to the outlet iof reached steady state at a sw values 0 29 and 0 27 m2 m 2 in the plots a and b this result demonstrates the significant link between overland flow generation and a sw on a rough soil surface fig 4 shows the comparison between observed and simulated iof for plots a and b the hydrograph for plot a rose to a maximum iof in several steps as new depressions became connected to the downstream boundary this process took 13 min from the start of irrigation to maximum iof fig 4a in contrast the hydrograph for plot b rose sharply after flow initiation to reach a maximum flow rate at about 11 min after the start of irrigation fig 4b the differences in hydrograph response fig 4 reflects connectivity differences between the two plots induced by their individual microtopography the results presented above are in accordance with other laboratory and field experimental studies showing that surfaces with similar static topographic properties table 2 may be subject to varying hydrological dynamics as a result of the spatial organization of these properties appels et al 2016 chu et al 2015 darboux et al 2002a the simulated hydrographs fig 4 did not feature a gradually declining recession limb because fastr does not take the live storage into account as a result iof began earlier than measured and ended immediately when irrigation ceased while fastr inevitably underestimates the total duration of iof this feature does not affect the utility of the model for our purposes which is to predict the point of initiation of iof the simulated and observed times to initiation of iof for various initial soil moisture levels and irrigation intensity scenarios are presented in fig 5 fastr predicted the time to iof initiation well but a consistent feature was that it predicted an earlier start to iof for all cases this earlier predicted initiation was a result of the absence of live storage in the model the underestimation of time to overland flow initiation was stable for various initial soil moisture levels and irrigation rates this suggests that the model has captured the effects of spatial organisation of soil microtopography on flow dynamics well and that the method may be suitable for predicting the point of initiation of iof fig 6 shows the observed and simulated runoff ratio outflow irrigation as a function of rds and a sw for near saturated soil conditions under the saturated soil conditions i e negligible sorptivity the temporal variation in infiltration rate can be assumed negligible moreover due to the size of the plot 1 5 m2 used in this experiment it can be assumed that the spatial variation in soil infiltration rate would be negligible for spatially homogeneous and temporally constant infiltration capacity the runoff ratio can be assumed to be equivalent to overland flow connectivity c peñuela et al 2015 simulated a sw compared favourably with that observed for both plots fig 6 both rds and asw showed a threshold relationship with c when the rds exceeded a threshold value a sharp increase in c was observed in both plots fig 6a b similarly as a sw increased over time c also increased and showed a clear threshold response to a sw the connectivity functions of plot a and b as a function of a sw retained differences in hydrologic dynamics as shown in their hydrographs fig 4 plot a showed a slower approach to full hydrologic connectivity than plot b fig 6 a b this type of curve is normally drawn as a function of depression storage fig 6 a b antoine et al 2009 appels et al 2011 peñuela et al 2015 but fig 6 shows that this variability in hydrologic behaviour may also be captured using a sw this is important because in the field a sw is significantly easier to determine than ds fastr consistently showed a leftward shift in a sw this is again because the fastr model ignores live storage and its spatial variability which has been shown to affect the development of overland flow conditions in rough soils mueller et al 2007 smith et al 2007 the critical value of a sw needed to initiate the overland flows as derived from rscf was 0 19 m2 m 2 for both plots which was 0 04 m2 m 2 plot a to 0 01 m2 m 2 plot b higher than the observed values of a sw at the onset of overland flow fig 3 the higher discrepancy between modelled and observed values of a sw at the onset of overland flow in the case of plot a could probably be explained by the combination of border effects fig 6 peñuela et al 2015 and the position of the overland flow point cf appels et al 2011 some support for this contention comes from the fact that there was a sudden sharp increase in overland flow from plot a at observed a sw value of 0 205 m2 m 2 which occurred shortly after the initiation of overland flow fig 3d 4a however the number of overland flow plots n 2 in this study is not sufficient to draw any conclusion regarding the effects of depressions geometry and their spatial organisations on the critical value of a sw further overland flow experiments on various types of soil microtopographies are recommended to examine the effect of spatial organisation of the soil micro topography on the critical values of a sw 3 2 surface roughness and depression storage capacity three dimensional images from the twenty one additional paddocks section 2 2 provided data across six contrasting soil surface conditions this data was used to assess the relationship between soil surface roughness and depression storage capacity dsc each image was approximately 1 2 m 0 8 m with 200 000 elevation points per m2 fig 7 shows typical soil surface representations for each land surface type table 5 summarises random roughness rr dsc and average depression size for each land cover type for most land use types a positive correlation between vertical rr and horizontal depression size soil roughness was observed as a result dsc generally increased with rr and depression size with highly modified contoured soil being an exception in this regard fig 8 table 5 there was pronounced variation in rr table 5 ranging from 5 0 2 8 mm in the sheep grazing sites to 55 8 13 8 mm for the contoured soil the pattern for average depression size closely mirrored that for rr depression size varied from 19 6 8 5 mm in the contoured soil to 45 6 11 0 mm in the heavy cattle pugging site our study provides clear evidence that increasing grazing intensity causes increases in soil roughness table 5 the type of grazing cattle vs sheep table 5 had a large effect on soil surface conditions with heavy cattle grazing rr 6 times depression size 2 times higher than for sheep grazing the soil with only an initial rough cultivation pass had twice the rr and slightly larger average depression size as finely cultivated soil ready for sowing the lower surface roughness in the finely cultivated site could be attributed to the breakdown of the larger soil clods from repeated passes of the cultivator thereby reducing the variation in the level of soil surface moreover rainfall and runoff after cultivation are likely to have reduced soil roughness at a rate that depends on aggregate stability aggregate stability is influenced by soil type soil water content and biological activity related to how crop residue is managed bissonnais 1990 le bisoonnais 1996 zobeck and onstad 1987 freezing and thawing can also reduce roughness pardini et al 1995 plant growth may increase roughness martinez turanzas et al 1997 many of the processes affecting surface roughness mean that soil roughness can change for any location over time this means that if soil roughness features are to be used in precision irrigation applications for example to quantify the dsc during an irrigation event a simple and automated method is needed to assess the state at any point in time to the best of our knowledge currently there exists no method that can provide direct real time estimates of soil surface roughness during an irrigation event in the presence of vegetative cover see section 3 3 the initiation of runoff can be delayed by the soil surface roughness through temporary water storage in the soil micro depressions this can attenuate or decrease the runoff rate and volume and increases sediment retention and therefore soil loss by surface erosion bertol et al 2006 darboux and huang 2005 the occurrence of overland flow and consequently material transport by surface erosion depends on the rainfall volume and intensity soil water infiltration dsc arnaez et al 2007 boulal et al 2011 and terrain slope among other factors previous work has shown dsc to be almost exclusively dependent on rr álvarez mozos et al 2011 kamphorst et al 2000 however recent study has demonstrated the important effect of other soil surface features such as depression size on dsc peñuela et al 2015 in our study dsc generally increased with both rr and average depression size table 5 fig 8 our measurements showed that dsc ranged from 1 3 mm in the contoured soil to 11 8 mm in the soil grazed with heavy cattle table 5 soils with low dsc can have a much earlier initiation of overland flow during rainfall or irrigation events unless their infiltration rates are sufficiently high that water will not accumulate our results also highlight the importance of cross slope cultivation particularly when mounding where practical as this will increase the dsc and minimise runoff and erosion cross slope cultivation creates a barrier to surface runoff thereby reducing flow velocity and providing more time for water to infiltrate quinton and catt 2004 surface depressions can have strong but contrary effects on overland flow initiation surface depressions whether they be produced by grazing or cultivation increases dsc in the first instance the depressions slow the movement of water across the soil surface and this give more time for infiltration which reduces runoff and increases moisture storage in the soil lampurlanés and cantero martínez 2006 zhao et al 2018 the effects of surface depressions and dsc are even more important on sloping land where surface redistribution of water is more likely to occur therefore management practices aimed at manipulating the soil surface characterises can encourage soil moisture storage within the root zone moreno et al 2008 a contrary effect is that the soil in the depressions can disperse with the breakdown of soil aggregates resulting in the clogging of soil pores and reduce the infiltration of water dikinya et al 2006 cultivation or grazing events on soils weakened by high water content and or dispersion are more vulnerable to further damage bilotta et al 2007 laurenson and houlbrooke 2016 this can result in a soil surface with a high dsc but with such a low infiltration rate that ponding and or runoff are increased and plant growth processes are adversely affected cournane et al 2011 drewry et al 2008 mcdowell et al 2003 3 3 overland flow connectivity as a function of surface water coverage simulated dynamics of hydrological connectivity for the six land types are presented in fig 9 for all the sites an increase in overland flow connectivity c was associated with the increase in surface water coverage a sw although the nature of response fast vs slow varied widely among and within the different land surface types in general the differences in soil rr table 5 were accompanied by differences in overland flow connectivity as reflected by the rscf and more specifically by differences in depression storage capacity and in the shape of rscf fig 9 the contoured soil site had mounds parallel to the slope here ponding and runoff started immediately i e highly flashy runoff generation and therefore had a sharp increase in overland flow connectivity for a small increment in a sw fig 9a this can largely be attributed to the development of straighter flow paths more parallel to the downslope direction the rscf of heavily pugged soil and the rough cultivation sites are representative for fields that are poorly connected and dominated by a relatively small number of deep depressions fig 9c e in contrast the rscf of the light cattle pugging fine cultivation and sheep grazing sites are typically associated with the well connected relatively smooth soil surfaces fig 9b d f with lower roughness table 5 and a large collection of shallow puddles antoine et al 2009 appels et al 2011 peñuela et al 2015 it is acknowledged that that the size of the plot in this study was relatively small and that size can limit the extrapolation of rscf to larger scales as shown by peñuela et al 2013 however the average depression sizes in the studied sites were much smaller than the plot size table 5 which indicates that the effect of the plot size on the rscf may be negligible further research is recommended to test the applicability of extrapolating the currently derived rscf to other scales the critical value of a sw needed to initiate the overland flow generally increased with relative depression storage rds at connectivity threshold fig 10 and varied from 0 013 m2 m 2 in the contoured soil to 0 41 m2 m 2 in the fine cultivation indicating a significant link between a sw and overland flow connectivity moreover a much higher rr and lower critical value of a sw and rds value at the connectivity threshold in the case of contoured soil suggests that depressions geometry and their spatial organization can results in intrinsically different hydrological connectivity antoine et al 2009 based on the results of this study a sw as opposed to depression storage d s could potentially be used for the real time prediction of the risk of agricultural field runoff and delivery to watercourses during an irrigation event the use of real time methods to detect emerging flow conditions early enough to prevent substantial flow from the field during irrigation is a potential management option to prevent overland flow however these methods require a prediction of the initiation of overland flow conditions i e risk of overland flow in order to make the connection with real time observations an option is the use of the a sw based runoff response as a means to quantify the progressive non linear nature of overland flow generation process in combination with the proximal remote sensing a recent study has shown that the areal fraction of soil under water i e a sw can be reliably estimated in real time using proximal acoustic sensor bradley et al 2020 the sensor makes use of smart sound patterns which have high discrimination against ambient e g farm machinery noises and can be mounted onto the boom of a centre pivot or linear move irrigation system field testing under a range of conditions has shown that pasture cover upto a biomass of 3500 kg dm ha 1 does not limit the acoustic sensing of soil surface conditions during an irrigation event bradley et al 2020 in addition to the effect of pasture cover the effect of wetting of pasture and irrigation water droplets have been shown to have no effect on the sensor performance this new technology in combination with critical value of a sw has substantial potential to be used for predicting the agricultural overland flow risk during irrigation 4 conclusions this study investigated the overland flow connectivity as a function of surface water coverage and how this connectivity is linked to overland flow generation and dynamics in low slope agricultural fields in doing so the fastr overland flow model was tested using the field data to examine its capacity to simulate soil depression filling spilling and merging processes and to quantify the hydrologic connectivity our results showed the significant effects of surface microtopography on the initiation of overland flow and characteristics of the associated hydrographs the results also demonstrated a threshold response of overland flow to surface water coverage a sw and that a significant proportion of the complexity in overland flow initiation processes may be simplified by linking an easily measurable variable a sw in this case to connectivity that defines the gross behaviour of the system we further investigated the soil microtopography and overland flow connectivity for various agricultural soils for all the sites an increase in overland flow connectivity was associated with the increase in a sw although the nature of response fast vs slow varied largely among and within the treatment types moreover the critical value of a sw needed to initiate the overland flow generally increased with relative depression storage rds at connectivity threshold indicating a significant link between a sw and overland flow initiation our results showed that a sw based runoff response has a substantial potential to be used for predicting the agricultural runoff risk as well as for developing applications to mitigate this risk credit authorship contribution statement chandra prasad

4728,on rough agricultural soils initiation of overland flow is primarily related to the gradual filling of small depressions as the volume of water ponding in local depressions increases the connectivity of those depressions increases and that connectivity permits flow across the field boundaries previous studies have aimed at predicting overland flow connectivity by means of depression storage but this is exceedingly difficult to quantify during an irrigation or rainfall event there has been little work linking overland flow connectivity through variables that are more readily measured than depression storage such as the proportion of the soil surface covered in water a sw we propose using a sw as a proxy for hydrological connectivity which can be measured using proximal remote sensing a series of overland flow experiments were conducted in two contrasting plots of 1 5 m2 outlet discharge and changes in soil surface covered in water were continuously recorded during the experiments the experiments demonstrated that the rougher soil surface experienced a delayed initiation of overland flow the results also showed overland flow initiation was characterised by a distinct connectivity threshold and showed a clear response of overland flow to a sw we further investigated the hydrological connectivity in twenty one additional agricultural soils with contrasting micro topographic conditions our results suggest that a predictor based on a sw has substantial potential to predict initiation of overland flow the prediction is sufficiently early that it could be used in modern variable rate irrigation systems in combination with a sensor to measure a sw in real time to prevent substantial flow from fields during irrigation keywords soil roughness micro topography depression storage variable rate irrigation runoff 1 introduction sprinkler irrigation a modern and commonly used system of irrigating is a method of applying water in a controlled manner in that is similar to rainfall hedley et al 2014 however excessive application rates or amounts of irrigation can lead to an accumulation of surface water in small depressions on the soil surface appels et al 2011 chu et al 2015 in turn the accumulation of surface water results in overland flow and a high risk of contaminant loss blaustein et al 2015 deasy et al 2009 mcdowell et al 2003 mcdowell and houlbrooke 2009 moreover the infiltration of ponded water in microtopographic depressions can result in increased macropore flow causing greater water losses and leaching close et al 2007 while irrigation systems should be designed to apply water at rates below the infiltration rate of the soil o shaughnessy et al 2015 to minimise ponding and overland flow soil surface conditions can change rapidly in space and time drewry et al 2008 2019 as a result even under well designed irrigation systems the application rate can exceed the soil s infiltration rate and result in irrigation induced overland flow iof see table 1 for definitions of the terms used here once iof is generated there is the potential for the rapid mobilisation of nutrients and contaminants from the soil although the frequency and size of iof events can be small compared to those of rainfall induced overland flow laurenson et al 2018 iof is similar to rainfall induced overland flow in having a severe impact on surface water quality because of the relatively large quantity of nutrients and contaminants that can be transported rapidly heathwaite et al 2005 louchart et al 2001 monaghan et al 2016 van der salm et al 2012 minimising iof is therefore key in reducing contamination and eutrophication of water bodies and improving the environmental performance of irrigation systems soil surface depressions delay the initiation of overland flow chu et al 2015 darboux and huang 2005 zhao et al 2018 and enhance the retention of water that would otherwise run off a field the soil surface is generally characterised by numerous depressions across scales increasing soil roughness tends to decrease overland flow volume chu et al 2015 as well as reducing its velocity cogo et al 1983 as a result soil erosion and transport of nutrients and contaminants to water bodies are reduced govers et al 2000 helming et al 1998 the development of ponding in surface depressions and the way in which depressions merge and form flow pathways depends on the spatial organisation of the microtopography of the field as depressions fill hydraulic connections are established with neighbouring depressions the hydrologic connectivity c of the field increases leading to the initiation of overland flow antoine et al 2009 consequently overland flow may exhibit a threshold based runoff response which can be attributed to the filling spilling and merging processes and related threshold based overland flow generation chu et al 2015 2013 peñuela et al 2013 a sharp increase in overland flow usually occurs when certain area of the field is connected to the outlet or field boundary defined as connectivity threshold c ct peñuela et al 2015 several studies have investigated the filling spilling and merging of water in soil surface depressions antoine et al 2009 appels et al 2011 chu et al 2015 2013 darboux et al 2002b peñuela et al 2015 shaw et al 2013 most of these studies have investigated the development of ponding and overland flow generation often at plot scales from the perspective of functional hydrological connectivity the relative surface connection function rscf antoine et al 2009 peñuela et al 2015 rscf is a simplification of the runoff hydrograph where the vertical axis represents the instantaneous overland flow rate at the field boundaries normalised by the instantaneous rainfall rate and the horizontal axis represents the depression storage depth d s normalised by the maximum depression storage depression storage capacity dsc value yielding the relative depression storage rds 0 rds 1 due to the assumption of instantaneous flow in the construction of the rscf the normalised flow rate is equivalent to the percentage of the surface connected to the lower outlet of the field one of the main advantages of rscf is that it provides a functional integrated metric because it explicitly integrates the flow network at the soil surface peñuela et al 2016 the instantaneous flow model is also computationally much faster than a full two dimensional hydraulic model e g wu et al 2020 and is therefore more suitable for analysing large numbers of elevation points or in circumstances where fast processing times are needed peñuela et al 2013 further showed that when border effects were negligible overland flow was initiated at a c ct in practice c ct can be defined as the point where the slope of the rscf equals 1 peñuela et al 2015 the rds at c ct represents the minimum depth of stored water needed to initiate overland flow from the perspective of overland flow prevention and management c ct could be a decision trigger as it occurs early enough to minimise or prevent substantial iof for it to be successful c needs to be known for the irrigated area sensors need to be in place to monitor c and the irrigation equipment needs to be equipped with controls to stop or reduce irrigation in response to sensor observations current developments in irrigation technology e g variable rate irrigation o shaughnessy et al 2015 can enable such on the fly decision making although c can be estimated through the measurement of d s using rscf quantifying the changes in d s during an irrigation event is exceedingly difficult therefore it would be beneficial to investigate whether d s can be replaced by a more easily quantifiable variable that could for example be obtained with proximal remote sensing a recent study has demonstrated that the proportion of soil surface covered in water a sw m2 m 2 can be quantified in real time using proximal remote sensing during an irrigation event bradley et al 2020 it is therefore of interest to investigate whether a sw can be linked to the overland flow generation process that replaces measurement of d s as the a sw increases we hypothesize that overland flow connectivity will also increase and therefore increase the risk of overland flow while previous work has suggested that such a link could be possible peñuela et al 2015 our aim is to make this explicit the overall objective of this study was to examine whether overland flow initiation can be predicted using a sw during an irrigation event on relatively flat areas in doing so we first examined the effect of a sw on the overland flow initiation using field experiments we then used the fast areal simulator with topography for runoff model hereafter referred to as fastr appels et al 2011 to investigate the development of c as a function of a sw for soils of contrasting microtopographic conditions the aim of the modelling was to provide a measure of c and explore how c may be affected by a sw we further investigated the hydrological connectivity as a function of a sw in a range of agricultural soils with contrasting micro topographic conditions specifically we address the following questions i is a sw sufficiently linked to the overland flow generation process that it can be used to predict the initiation of overland flow ii how variable are the microtopographies of a range of agricultural land cover types in terms of dsc and hydrological connectivity and iii how are the characteristics of microtopography and a sw related to the initiation of overland flow in a range of agricultural land use types in order to address the above research questions this study focuses on relatively flat 2 agricultural field of varying surface conditions while naturally hilly areas are more sensitive to erosion and runoff risk is higher flat lands are relatively easy to farm and often have deep and nutrient rich soil brubaker et al 1993 ziadat 2005 and therefore many agricultural fields around the world are selected for being flat fao 1976 to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to make a quantitative link between overland flow connectivity and the proportion of soil covered in water 2 materials and methods a series of overland flow experiments were carried out to investigate the relationship between surface water coverage a sw and overland flow connectivity c the overland flow experiments are described in section 2 1 to further examine the effects of soil microtopography on c soil microtopography was assessed for six additional land cover types across twenty one locations section 2 2 deals with the assessment of soil micro topography for the six land cover types fastr was used to model c the model was first tested using the data from the overland flow experiments and then was extrapolated to investigate the overland flow connectivity for the six land cover types section 2 3 describes the overland flow modelling 2 1 overland flow experiments a series of overland flow experiments were conducted in a permanent pasture grazed by sheep to examine the effects of surface microrelief on irrigation induced overland flow iof in conjunction with other factors of importance to iof two 1 5 m2 field plots henceforth referred to as plot a and plot b 5 m apart were established in the agresearch research farm 43 628 s 172 471 e near christchurch new zealand as shown in fig 1 and table 2 the two plot surfaces differed in spatial organization of their microtopography and random roughness values both plot surfaces had an overall slope of 2 towards their outlets where overland flow was collected and recorded as described below irrigation was applied using a portable variable intensity rainfall simulator fig 2 the same rainfall simulator was used on both plots the rainfall simulator used three teejet 1 4hh ss30wsq nozzles spraying systems co wheaton il usa at a height of 2 5 m above the soil surface to gain terminal velocity mcdowell and sharpley 2003 we assessed the uniformity of water application using christiansen s coefficient david 1978 taking data from eight 0 2 l containers within plot a the uniformity coefficient was 95 and therefore spatial variation of irrigation within the runoff plots was assumed negligible overland flow experiments were carried out using a series of irrigation intensities ranging from 50 to 80 mm h 1 table 3 rates common under centre pivot irrigators of 400 800 m length in the central part of the canterbury region new zealand powers 2012 a tipping bucket rain gauge rain collector ii davis instruments usa 0 2 mm per tip was installed under the rainfall simulator close to each plot to collect the irrigation amount and intensity topsoil 0 6 cm volumetric soil water content was measured at the centre of the plots before and after each experiment using a portable time domain reflectometry ml3 thetaprobe delta t devices overland flow was collected in a buried 20 l bucket at the outlet of each plot the height of water accumulated in the bucket was measured continuously using a pressure transducer true trac new zealand and converted to volume using a calibrated relationship between water level and volume overland flow volume was divided by the projected plot area to give a time series of overland flow in mm for each experimental run each experiment continued until a steady state flow rate was achieved 15 30 min soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of the topsoil 0 10 cm was measured at seven locations near the plots using a single ring infiltrometer following the method outlined in verbist et al 2010 a downward facing 3d structured light camera intel realsense tm depth camera d415 hence forth referred to as the 3d camera was used to assess the soil microtopography at 1 minute intervals during irrigation the microtopography included small changes resulting from depressions filling with water so that changes could be calculated during each experiment the 3d camera produced a 3d point cloud describing the soil surface for further processing the depth data were loaded into the meshlab software http www meshlab net to clean the 3d images for any stray data clip the image to the limits of the runoff plot and then convert the data into a format suitable for loading into the gis software as a text delimited layer after the point clouds had been suitably cleaned they were loaded into the qgis software http qgis osgeo org to produce high resolution digital elevation models grundy et al 2020 an image of the soil surface taken before the simulation experiments was used to provide a dry soil image as the small pockets of water accumulated they resulted in a change in the height of a given pixel so a sw was calculated using the height difference between any given image and the baseline image on pixel by pixel basis 2 2 survey of additional agricultural fields of varying microtopography to further investigate the effect of soil surface roughness on dsc and c 3d images were acquired on agricultural fields of varying surface conditions but all of low slope 2 using the 3d camera the data were obtained in the central part of the canterbury region new zealand the site locations were representative of the local farming area with mainly flat terrain predominantly shallow and stony soils kear et al 1967 and an annual rainfall of 620 mm macaea 2016 fields were classified based on grazing type and intensity cultivation status and observed damage to the soil surface 3d images were acquired from twenty one agricultural paddocks of the following classes i contoured soil ii fine cultivation iii heavy cattle pugging iv light cattle pugging v rough cultivation and vi sheep grazing the sites were selected to give a wide range of surface roughness characteristics as described in table 4 prior to measurement vegetation and surface litter were removed from the surface with as little surface disturbance as possible the 3d camera was set at 1 0 m above the soil surface so the measurement area was 1 2 m 0 8 m in order to capture the spatial variability in soil microtopography 2 3 images from different locations within each site were captured data detrending was implemented using python python 2 7 14 script to remove the tilt trend of the measured surface height before computing the surface roughness for each plot the data were detrended by subtracting a linear fitting equation from the measured surface cf xingming et al 2014 vertical soil surface roughness was calculated as the standard deviation of the detrended elevation data this metric is also referred to as random roughness rr kuipers 1957 because of its simplicity the random roughness index is one of the most widely used soil surface parameters that has been related to dsc cerdan et al 2002 moldenhauer 1970 dsc for each plot was calculated using fastr by finding and filling depressions until they overflow see section 2 3 moreover it has been shown that the soil surface roughness in horizontal direction also affects dsc peñuela et al 2015 to further investigate the effect of horizontal soil surface roughness we calculated the average depression area for each site and converted that to equivalent average depression diameter herein after referred to as average depression size 2 3 modelling overland flow and connectivity the fastr model see appels et al 2011 for details was used to model overland flow rates and connectivity fastr uses a routing algorithm to detect depressions in the surface topography and determines a micro catchment for each depression the model then constructs an internal database of the storage capacity of each micro catchment as well as the location and elevation of the spill points from each micro catchment to its neighbours a water balance is constructed for each micro catchment in every timestep of a simulation when a micro catchment is full water is transferred instantaneously to a neighbouring catchment via their lowest shared spill point if both catchments are full water is transferred to a subsequent catchment or the two merge to form a new larger catchment eventually through these spilling and merging processes a pathway or connection to the outlet of the modelled area is generated and water exits the domain as runoff fastr is in the class of instantaneous flow models that are computationally faster than full two dimensional soil hydraulic models antoine et al 2009 this makes fastr suitable for the analysis of a large numbers of elevation points e g 40 000 per m 2 in the current study the assumption of instantaneous water flow is a reasonable simplification in the case of surfaces with numerous depressions where the transfer of water is controlled primarily by the duration needed to fill the depressions and the time required by water to move from one depression to the other can be neglected fastr outputs allow the calculation of d s as the cumulative volume in the micro depressions divided by the total plot area as well as the calculation of a sw m2 m 2 as the cumulative area subjected to ponding divided by the total plot area the model uses two parameter philip s infiltration equation eq 1 philip 1957 to calculate infiltration rate in every cell of the model domain 1 i s 2 t k p where i is the infiltration rate l t 1 s is the sorptivity l t 1 2 t is time since the start of irrigation t and k p l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity in this study we treated k p as the k sat of the upper soil layer since eq 1 is valid under ponded conditions a time correction was applied when the equation was used for infiltration under rainfall conditions see appels et al 2011 for details the overland flow connectivity was quantified using the rscf antoine et al 2009 peñuela et al 2013 the rscf function expresses the fraction of the field area that has a direct flow connection to an exit point of the field as a function of the volume of water stored in the topography of field depression storage d s in the rscf the vertical axis represents the instantaneous overland flow rate at the boundaries normalised by the instantaneous rainfall in units of volume yielding the ratio of area connected to the bottom outlet c the horizontal axis represents the d s normalised by the dsc yielding the relative depression storage rds antoine et al 2009 in this study we used a sw as the independent variable instead of rds further we defined critical value of a sw as the point in rscf curve when the rate of increase of c is equal to the rate of increase of a sw in other words a sw at c ct represents a critical value of a sw the critical value of a sw was determined by calculating the first derivative or slope of the rscf when border effects are negligible critical value of a sw represents the minimum soil surface area covered in water needed to initiate overland flow the border effect essentially represents the plot area already connected to the outlet before any water is added cf peñuela et al 2015 2 3 1 model testing with the overland flow experiments fastr was first tested using the data collected in the overland flow experiment section 2 1 to examine its ability to simulate depression filling spilling and merging processes and quantifying hydrologic connectivity fastr was supplied with a 5 mm resolution dem for each of the two plots the data collected from the experiments included outlet discharge volumetric soil moisture content k sat and a sw as the soil moisture values at the start of the overland experiments were fairly high table 3 the effect of sorptivity on the infiltration was assumed to be negligible and therefore a value close to zero was used largely to prevent the numerical instability in the model simulation fastr was run with 30 second time steps and simulation results were compared with the observed data for outlet discharge and changes in a sw 2 3 2 overland flow connectivity for various microtopographic conditions fastr was further used to quantify the hydrological connectivity and therefore the risk of overland flow using the rscf for the various types of agricultural soils described above in order to simplify the process we focused on the filling spilling merging processes in doing so soil surfaces were considered to be saturated so that temporal and spatial variation in infiltration capacity could be assumed to be negligible in reality spatial variation in infiltration can play a key role in connectivity disruption as runoff water can infiltrate when it reaches downhill locations with higher infiltration capacity gomi et al 2008 for the infiltration model parametrization we used k sat value of 27 mm h 1 from the overland flow experiment sorptivity for saturated soil surface was assumed to be close to zero for this scale of this study we considered the overland flow that is fed by a uniform and net supply of water at a rate of 18 mm h 1 each plot had a size of 1 2 m 0 8 m and was discretized into 5 5 mm cells 3 results and discussion we present the results from the overland flow experiments in section 3 1 section 3 2 deals with the effects of surface roughness on depression storage capacity for the various agriculture soil cover types finally the effects of surface micro topography on overland flow connectivity for the various agriculture soils and their implications for irrigation management are presented in section 3 3 3 1 filling spilling merging dynamics in the two detailed runoff plots fig 3 upper row shows the development of irrigation induced overland flow iof and surface water coverage a sw with time for event 1 with several snapshots of water coverage assessed by the 3d camera fig 3 middle and lower rows showing the filling spilling and merging dynamics as the irrigation event progressed a sw increased in both plots the initial stage was characterized by the gradual filling of individual isolated depressions the second stage featured merging of small depressions that shared a common spill point to form larger ponds fig 3c g overland flow at the outlet for the experiment depicted in fig 3 was observed at 5 min in plot a and at 7 min in plot b at this time a sw values were 0 15 m2 m 2 plot a and 0 18 m2 m 2 plot b in the third stage fig 3d h the filling spilling merging process continued and hydraulic connection was established across most of the depressions in the soil surface all depressions eventually contributed runoff water to the outlet iof reached steady state at a sw values 0 29 and 0 27 m2 m 2 in the plots a and b this result demonstrates the significant link between overland flow generation and a sw on a rough soil surface fig 4 shows the comparison between observed and simulated iof for plots a and b the hydrograph for plot a rose to a maximum iof in several steps as new depressions became connected to the downstream boundary this process took 13 min from the start of irrigation to maximum iof fig 4a in contrast the hydrograph for plot b rose sharply after flow initiation to reach a maximum flow rate at about 11 min after the start of irrigation fig 4b the differences in hydrograph response fig 4 reflects connectivity differences between the two plots induced by their individual microtopography the results presented above are in accordance with other laboratory and field experimental studies showing that surfaces with similar static topographic properties table 2 may be subject to varying hydrological dynamics as a result of the spatial organization of these properties appels et al 2016 chu et al 2015 darboux et al 2002a the simulated hydrographs fig 4 did not feature a gradually declining recession limb because fastr does not take the live storage into account as a result iof began earlier than measured and ended immediately when irrigation ceased while fastr inevitably underestimates the total duration of iof this feature does not affect the utility of the model for our purposes which is to predict the point of initiation of iof the simulated and observed times to initiation of iof for various initial soil moisture levels and irrigation intensity scenarios are presented in fig 5 fastr predicted the time to iof initiation well but a consistent feature was that it predicted an earlier start to iof for all cases this earlier predicted initiation was a result of the absence of live storage in the model the underestimation of time to overland flow initiation was stable for various initial soil moisture levels and irrigation rates this suggests that the model has captured the effects of spatial organisation of soil microtopography on flow dynamics well and that the method may be suitable for predicting the point of initiation of iof fig 6 shows the observed and simulated runoff ratio outflow irrigation as a function of rds and a sw for near saturated soil conditions under the saturated soil conditions i e negligible sorptivity the temporal variation in infiltration rate can be assumed negligible moreover due to the size of the plot 1 5 m2 used in this experiment it can be assumed that the spatial variation in soil infiltration rate would be negligible for spatially homogeneous and temporally constant infiltration capacity the runoff ratio can be assumed to be equivalent to overland flow connectivity c peñuela et al 2015 simulated a sw compared favourably with that observed for both plots fig 6 both rds and asw showed a threshold relationship with c when the rds exceeded a threshold value a sharp increase in c was observed in both plots fig 6a b similarly as a sw increased over time c also increased and showed a clear threshold response to a sw the connectivity functions of plot a and b as a function of a sw retained differences in hydrologic dynamics as shown in their hydrographs fig 4 plot a showed a slower approach to full hydrologic connectivity than plot b fig 6 a b this type of curve is normally drawn as a function of depression storage fig 6 a b antoine et al 2009 appels et al 2011 peñuela et al 2015 but fig 6 shows that this variability in hydrologic behaviour may also be captured using a sw this is important because in the field a sw is significantly easier to determine than ds fastr consistently showed a leftward shift in a sw this is again because the fastr model ignores live storage and its spatial variability which has been shown to affect the development of overland flow conditions in rough soils mueller et al 2007 smith et al 2007 the critical value of a sw needed to initiate the overland flows as derived from rscf was 0 19 m2 m 2 for both plots which was 0 04 m2 m 2 plot a to 0 01 m2 m 2 plot b higher than the observed values of a sw at the onset of overland flow fig 3 the higher discrepancy between modelled and observed values of a sw at the onset of overland flow in the case of plot a could probably be explained by the combination of border effects fig 6 peñuela et al 2015 and the position of the overland flow point cf appels et al 2011 some support for this contention comes from the fact that there was a sudden sharp increase in overland flow from plot a at observed a sw value of 0 205 m2 m 2 which occurred shortly after the initiation of overland flow fig 3d 4a however the number of overland flow plots n 2 in this study is not sufficient to draw any conclusion regarding the effects of depressions geometry and their spatial organisations on the critical value of a sw further overland flow experiments on various types of soil microtopographies are recommended to examine the effect of spatial organisation of the soil micro topography on the critical values of a sw 3 2 surface roughness and depression storage capacity three dimensional images from the twenty one additional paddocks section 2 2 provided data across six contrasting soil surface conditions this data was used to assess the relationship between soil surface roughness and depression storage capacity dsc each image was approximately 1 2 m 0 8 m with 200 000 elevation points per m2 fig 7 shows typical soil surface representations for each land surface type table 5 summarises random roughness rr dsc and average depression size for each land cover type for most land use types a positive correlation between vertical rr and horizontal depression size soil roughness was observed as a result dsc generally increased with rr and depression size with highly modified contoured soil being an exception in this regard fig 8 table 5 there was pronounced variation in rr table 5 ranging from 5 0 2 8 mm in the sheep grazing sites to 55 8 13 8 mm for the contoured soil the pattern for average depression size closely mirrored that for rr depression size varied from 19 6 8 5 mm in the contoured soil to 45 6 11 0 mm in the heavy cattle pugging site our study provides clear evidence that increasing grazing intensity causes increases in soil roughness table 5 the type of grazing cattle vs sheep table 5 had a large effect on soil surface conditions with heavy cattle grazing rr 6 times depression size 2 times higher than for sheep grazing the soil with only an initial rough cultivation pass had twice the rr and slightly larger average depression size as finely cultivated soil ready for sowing the lower surface roughness in the finely cultivated site could be attributed to the breakdown of the larger soil clods from repeated passes of the cultivator thereby reducing the variation in the level of soil surface moreover rainfall and runoff after cultivation are likely to have reduced soil roughness at a rate that depends on aggregate stability aggregate stability is influenced by soil type soil water content and biological activity related to how crop residue is managed bissonnais 1990 le bisoonnais 1996 zobeck and onstad 1987 freezing and thawing can also reduce roughness pardini et al 1995 plant growth may increase roughness martinez turanzas et al 1997 many of the processes affecting surface roughness mean that soil roughness can change for any location over time this means that if soil roughness features are to be used in precision irrigation applications for example to quantify the dsc during an irrigation event a simple and automated method is needed to assess the state at any point in time to the best of our knowledge currently there exists no method that can provide direct real time estimates of soil surface roughness during an irrigation event in the presence of vegetative cover see section 3 3 the initiation of runoff can be delayed by the soil surface roughness through temporary water storage in the soil micro depressions this can attenuate or decrease the runoff rate and volume and increases sediment retention and therefore soil loss by surface erosion bertol et al 2006 darboux and huang 2005 the occurrence of overland flow and consequently material transport by surface erosion depends on the rainfall volume and intensity soil water infiltration dsc arnaez et al 2007 boulal et al 2011 and terrain slope among other factors previous work has shown dsc to be almost exclusively dependent on rr álvarez mozos et al 2011 kamphorst et al 2000 however recent study has demonstrated the important effect of other soil surface features such as depression size on dsc peñuela et al 2015 in our study dsc generally increased with both rr and average depression size table 5 fig 8 our measurements showed that dsc ranged from 1 3 mm in the contoured soil to 11 8 mm in the soil grazed with heavy cattle table 5 soils with low dsc can have a much earlier initiation of overland flow during rainfall or irrigation events unless their infiltration rates are sufficiently high that water will not accumulate our results also highlight the importance of cross slope cultivation particularly when mounding where practical as this will increase the dsc and minimise runoff and erosion cross slope cultivation creates a barrier to surface runoff thereby reducing flow velocity and providing more time for water to infiltrate quinton and catt 2004 surface depressions can have strong but contrary effects on overland flow initiation surface depressions whether they be produced by grazing or cultivation increases dsc in the first instance the depressions slow the movement of water across the soil surface and this give more time for infiltration which reduces runoff and increases moisture storage in the soil lampurlanés and cantero martínez 2006 zhao et al 2018 the effects of surface depressions and dsc are even more important on sloping land where surface redistribution of water is more likely to occur therefore management practices aimed at manipulating the soil surface characterises can encourage soil moisture storage within the root zone moreno et al 2008 a contrary effect is that the soil in the depressions can disperse with the breakdown of soil aggregates resulting in the clogging of soil pores and reduce the infiltration of water dikinya et al 2006 cultivation or grazing events on soils weakened by high water content and or dispersion are more vulnerable to further damage bilotta et al 2007 laurenson and houlbrooke 2016 this can result in a soil surface with a high dsc but with such a low infiltration rate that ponding and or runoff are increased and plant growth processes are adversely affected cournane et al 2011 drewry et al 2008 mcdowell et al 2003 3 3 overland flow connectivity as a function of surface water coverage simulated dynamics of hydrological connectivity for the six land types are presented in fig 9 for all the sites an increase in overland flow connectivity c was associated with the increase in surface water coverage a sw although the nature of response fast vs slow varied widely among and within the different land surface types in general the differences in soil rr table 5 were accompanied by differences in overland flow connectivity as reflected by the rscf and more specifically by differences in depression storage capacity and in the shape of rscf fig 9 the contoured soil site had mounds parallel to the slope here ponding and runoff started immediately i e highly flashy runoff generation and therefore had a sharp increase in overland flow connectivity for a small increment in a sw fig 9a this can largely be attributed to the development of straighter flow paths more parallel to the downslope direction the rscf of heavily pugged soil and the rough cultivation sites are representative for fields that are poorly connected and dominated by a relatively small number of deep depressions fig 9c e in contrast the rscf of the light cattle pugging fine cultivation and sheep grazing sites are typically associated with the well connected relatively smooth soil surfaces fig 9b d f with lower roughness table 5 and a large collection of shallow puddles antoine et al 2009 appels et al 2011 peñuela et al 2015 it is acknowledged that that the size of the plot in this study was relatively small and that size can limit the extrapolation of rscf to larger scales as shown by peñuela et al 2013 however the average depression sizes in the studied sites were much smaller than the plot size table 5 which indicates that the effect of the plot size on the rscf may be negligible further research is recommended to test the applicability of extrapolating the currently derived rscf to other scales the critical value of a sw needed to initiate the overland flow generally increased with relative depression storage rds at connectivity threshold fig 10 and varied from 0 013 m2 m 2 in the contoured soil to 0 41 m2 m 2 in the fine cultivation indicating a significant link between a sw and overland flow connectivity moreover a much higher rr and lower critical value of a sw and rds value at the connectivity threshold in the case of contoured soil suggests that depressions geometry and their spatial organization can results in intrinsically different hydrological connectivity antoine et al 2009 based on the results of this study a sw as opposed to depression storage d s could potentially be used for the real time prediction of the risk of agricultural field runoff and delivery to watercourses during an irrigation event the use of real time methods to detect emerging flow conditions early enough to prevent substantial flow from the field during irrigation is a potential management option to prevent overland flow however these methods require a prediction of the initiation of overland flow conditions i e risk of overland flow in order to make the connection with real time observations an option is the use of the a sw based runoff response as a means to quantify the progressive non linear nature of overland flow generation process in combination with the proximal remote sensing a recent study has shown that the areal fraction of soil under water i e a sw can be reliably estimated in real time using proximal acoustic sensor bradley et al 2020 the sensor makes use of smart sound patterns which have high discrimination against ambient e g farm machinery noises and can be mounted onto the boom of a centre pivot or linear move irrigation system field testing under a range of conditions has shown that pasture cover upto a biomass of 3500 kg dm ha 1 does not limit the acoustic sensing of soil surface conditions during an irrigation event bradley et al 2020 in addition to the effect of pasture cover the effect of wetting of pasture and irrigation water droplets have been shown to have no effect on the sensor performance this new technology in combination with critical value of a sw has substantial potential to be used for predicting the agricultural overland flow risk during irrigation 4 conclusions this study investigated the overland flow connectivity as a function of surface water coverage and how this connectivity is linked to overland flow generation and dynamics in low slope agricultural fields in doing so the fastr overland flow model was tested using the field data to examine its capacity to simulate soil depression filling spilling and merging processes and to quantify the hydrologic connectivity our results showed the significant effects of surface microtopography on the initiation of overland flow and characteristics of the associated hydrographs the results also demonstrated a threshold response of overland flow to surface water coverage a sw and that a significant proportion of the complexity in overland flow initiation processes may be simplified by linking an easily measurable variable a sw in this case to connectivity that defines the gross behaviour of the system we further investigated the soil microtopography and overland flow connectivity for various agricultural soils for all the sites an increase in overland flow connectivity was associated with the increase in a sw although the nature of response fast vs slow varied largely among and within the treatment types moreover the critical value of a sw needed to initiate the overland flow generally increased with relative depression storage rds at connectivity threshold indicating a significant link between a sw and overland flow initiation our results showed that a sw based runoff response has a substantial potential to be used for predicting the agricultural runoff risk as well as for developing applications to mitigate this risk credit authorship contribution statement chandra prasad

4729,modeling soil moisture sm spatial distribution is important for hydrological forecasting runoff estimation and catchment management and other applications the objective of this study was to quantify the effect of surface heterogeneity including vegetation soil topography etc on sm at the regional and surface characteristics classes scc scales landsat 8 images aster digital elevation model land cover map climatic data and sm measured at 148 locations in the balikhli chay catchment of iran were used greenness brightness wetness and land surface temperature are the surface biophysical characteristics and the topographical characteristics including elevation slope aspect topographic wetness index twi and solar local incident angle calculated using tasseled cap transformation single channel algorithm used in this study the triangular method and the bootstrapping model were used to model sm and mitigate prediction uncertainty correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse between the modeled and measured sm values were used to evaluate the modeled sm the mean r and rmse between the modeled and measured sm for different months were 0 83 and 1 84 volumetric percentage respectively the degree of heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of sm in different classes of surface biophysical and topographical characteristics was different the impact of surface heterogeneity on sm varied across regional and scc scales the mean r values between sm and surface biophysical and topographical characteristics in the regional and scc strategies for different months were 0 41 and 0 54 respectively using the scc scale instead of the regional scale heterogeneity information can increase the accuracy of sm modeling keywords hydrology remote sensing soil moisture surface biophysical characteristics topographical characteristics triangular model 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key factor in hydrological processes it controls the distribution of water as infiltration evapotranspiration and runoff jones 2014 sm is a determining factor in many hydrological models crow and ryu 2009 li et al 2018 accurate sm information can play an important role in improving hydrological modeling such as runoff landslide and flood forecasting in the watershed and better rainfall estimates from the water budget which can be used in both small and large watersheds brocca et al 2013 koster et al 2018 el hajj et al 2018 estimated soil moisture using different remote sensing rs methods they employed soil moisture products of soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture and ocean salinity smos advanced scatterometer ascat and sentinel 1 and evaluated the modeled sm by in situ soil moisture data at 5 cm depths they stated that smap products 36 km and 9 km accuracy in sm retrieval were higher than smap level 2 and sentinel 1 alexakis et al 2017 estimated sm as an input to hydrological model using sentinel 1 and landsat 8 satellite imagery and an artificial neural network method the results showed that the performance of the method and images used were acceptable in estimating sm and played an important supportive role in hydrological studies despite its critical importance challenges remain in acquiring sm information over large areas due to its high variability in space and time this is the result of a variety of different factors working at different intensities such factors as surface heterogeneity land use environmental and climatic conditions contribute to the spatial and temporal variability of sm bai et al 2020 temimi et al 2010 vereecken et al 2008 2007 western et al 2004 changes in surface biophysical characteristics including lst greenness and brightness variably influence evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff contributing to high spatiotemporal variability in sm qiu et al 2001 rao et al 1987 vivoni et al 2010 similarly surface topographic characteristics such as slope aspect the compass direction that a slope faces and elevation are important factors affecting the spatial distribution of sm by influencing soil hydraulic properties mohanty and mousli 2000 qiu et al 2001 the importance of identifying and recognizing the parameters affecting the spatial distribution of sm can be categorized in three aspects 1 understanding and quantifying the impact of various controlling factors that will increase sm modeling accuracy 2 accurate identification of these factors will result in reliable identification modeling and prediction of the spatial and temporal pattern of sm in a region 3 accurate identification and quantification of the sm affecting factors can be useful to improve the spatial resolution of obtained sm from satellite imagery and to produce sm daily maps for each region only a limited number of studies have investigated the influence of a variety of factors on the spatial and temporal distribution of sm qiu et al 2001 noted that surface characteristics such as land cover and topography played an important role in the spatial distribution of sm in their study they found that the relative impact of surface heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of sm was different at various depths following a precipitation event the correlation between sm and aspect significantly increased except for heavy storms and then decreased they also concluded that sm was inversely correlated with relative elevation and hillslope in addition the effect of land cover corresponded with changes in vegetation cover conditions thus the greatest effect of these factors on sm variation occurred in june and august furthermore the maximum effect of aspect on spatial and temporal variations of sm was found in spring and autumn niu et al 2015 stated that land use has a major influence in controlling spatial and temporal variations of sm by affecting evapotranspiration infiltration rate and runoff they investigated the effects of five types of land use on spatial and temporal variation of sm during a two year growing season study in sandy soil in semi arid region the highest mean of sm was observed in the rangelands fields with poplar trees and lands between hills and shrubs respectively zucco et al 2014 examined the impact of land use on sm dynamics and remarked that despite significant discrepancies in land use the temporal pattern of sm at different sites was similar while the spatial diversity of sm in similar land use was high when compared with previous sampling of the same area in some studies the impact of different soil properties was investigated to estimate hydraulic properties and sm their results showed a high impact of these properties on sm moyano et al 2012 silva et al 2014 yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 saxton and rawls 2006 predicted soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity based on estimating several soil properties including texture organic matter and soil structure they showed that statistical correlations between texture and other soil properties soil matric potential and hydraulic conductivity provides sufficient information to be used for numerous analyses and for decision making sm was estimated mostly at the global and regional scale in most of the previous studies carlson 1986 chen et al 2018 cho and choi 2014 kim et al 2018 oldak et al 2003 palsocia et al 2000 segoni et al 2018 wagner et al 2009 however due to the spatial heterogeneity of surface characteristics in mountainous areas sm spatial variations in these areas are large on a local scale this indicate that it is important to study the effect of surface biophysical and topographic characteristics on sm and soil modeling at the local scale in most studies the impact of land use cover and surface topographical characteristics on sm were investigated based on this basic knowledge surface biophysical and environmental factors also influence the spatial and temporal variations of sm but are rarely studied the purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of surface heterogeneity on sm at the regional and surface characteristics classes scc scale this study was the first to investigate and quantify the impact of surface heterogeneity on sm spatial distribution using scc scale information the results were then compared with the regional scale 2 study area the balilkli chay catchment in ardabil province iran has high surface heterogeneity and it was selected for this study for that reason this catchment 47 47ʹ to 48 05ʹ e longitude and 37 50ʹ to 38 15ʹ n latitude with an area of about 567 km2 and an average slope of 17 2 is one of the important catchments in north west iran because of its mountainous landscape and sudden slope changes this study area has special hydrological and geomorphological characteristics which make it vulnerable to erosion and flooding the highest and average elevation of the study area are 4363 and 2109 m respectively above the mean sea level the highest elevation is found in the sabalan mountain in the northern part of the catchment and the lowest elevation of the study area is 1550 m above mean sea level leading to the dam at the outlet of the catchment the climate of the study area is cold semi arid the long term average air temperature is 8 c and the average annual rainfall from 1986 to 2005 was 360 mm this river is one of the most important permanent rivers in ardebil province and it is considered the sole source for drinking water as well as the source for agricultural water according to digital elevation model dem of the study area the high elevation locations are in the northern part with an elevation as high as 4365 m the elevation declines from the north to the center of the study area and reaches 1550 m at the outlet of the catchment in the east fig 1 b the southwest end of the study area is also elevated variations in the elevation has led to variations in slope in the study area the steep slopes as high as 71 7 are scattered in the northern and southern parts of the study area the solar local incident angle slia variation ranged between 5 6 and 64 1 at the regional scale dominant land cover is mostly rainfed agriculture in the central parts of the region with flat land and fertile soil for agriculture the prevailing land cover in the marginal and elevated parts of the study area is rangeland often with no easy access the topographic wetness index twi ranges between 10 61 and 4 12 the highest twi value is related to the relatively flat areas which are in the east and the lowest value is found the northern part of the study area fig 1h 3 data and methods 3 1 data landsat 8 images of the study area wrs path 167 and wrs row 34 with cloud cover less than 10 were used to estimate sm and calculate surface biophysical characteristics on june 15 july 1 august 18 and september 3 2018 the spatial resolution of the reflective and thermal bands of the landsat 8 images was 30 and 100 m respectively advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster digital elevation model dem was used to drive topographical factors including slope aspect elevation twi and slia elkhrachy 2017 the spatial resolution of aster dem was 30 m meteorological and climatic data including relative humidity air temperature and pressure at landsat 8 overpass time were obtained from the ardabil meteorological organization 3 2 soil moisture measurement ground sm data were utilized to model and assess the accuracy of modeled sm at landsat 8 overpass time the geographical locations of the ground sm measurement points were selected to represent spatial variability as well as the surface heterogeneity coverage over the study area sm was measured at 148 points 0 5 cm at 4 landsat 8 overpass times june 15 july 1 august 18 and september 3 2018 fig 1b however due to the topographical conditions in the northern and southwestern parts of the study area and the lack of transportation routes and as a result of the lack of quick access to these areas it was not possible to quickly sample them during the satellite overpass so no sampling point was selected in the mentioned parts to overcome the scale disparities between point measurements of sm and the resolution of imagery used for the explanatory variables we tried to select the sampling points inside the homogeneous pixels this was done so that these pixels were homogeneous in terms of coverage land use elevation and slope on the other hand in addition to all the above we sampled three points from each pixel with different geographical locations and considered the average of these three points as the moisture of that pixel to better represent the sm content of a pixel sm in these areas was measured once every 16 days and in the fastest possible time the geographical location of each sampling point was determined by the global positioning system gps with an error of less than 6 m several field operation teams performed the sampling and measure sm in the shortest possible time matching with the satellite overpass time the measuring points were divided among the sampling teams and each team was assigned to take samples from specific locations at a designated time in this study we also had two sm meter devices which were calibrated using different soil textures with different amounts of moisture before starting fig 2 the area was divided into 20 sections and each team was responsible for measuring in one of the twenty sections this was done to ensure that all sampling points were close to each other however two of the twenty teams were equipped with the sm meter device model δt sm150 made by england to speed the measurement process while the remaining eighteen teams collected soil samples for sm measurement by gravimetric method petropoulos et al 2013 which is accepted as an accurate method but requires more manpower and costs a lot while sm meter devices are portable and measured sm quickly with an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m 3 the samples were collected and placed in zipper storage bags taken to the one location where one person was responsible for collecting the samples and transferred them to the laboratory generally in this research sm refers to the sm content measured on a volumetric basis 3 3 method the following steps fig 3 were carried out to quantify the regional and scc effects of surface heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of sm after preprocessing the landsat 8 images surface heterogeneity including land surface temperature lst and normalized vegetation difference index ndvi were extracted from the landsat 8 thermal and reflective bands surface topography characteristics were also obtained from aster dem in the second step sm was estimated using a triangular method tr and landsat derived indices dem and in situ sm data the bootstrap method was applied to reduce the uncertainty of the sm prediction subsequent to this spatial distribution of sm and the impact of surface heterogeneity were investigated regionally finally the influence of surface heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of sm was quantified at the scc scale in different classes of surface heterogeneity 3 3 1 pre processing of satellite images radiometric atmospheric and geometric corrections were performed to preprocess landsat 8 images for radiometric correction atmospheric effects sensor geometry and topography were considered for the reflective and thermal bands flaash fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of hypercubes algorithm was utilized for the atmospheric correction of landsat 8 reflective bands using the moderate resolution atmospheric transmission modtran 6 radiation transfer database model pyo et al 2018 in addition due to different data sources geometric harmonization was performed to match the data geometrically using image to image harmonization 3 3 2 soil moisture modeling sm modeling was performed using a tr method carlson 2007 kasim and usman 2015 this method was based on the robust relationship between rs derived lst and ndvi and sm carlson 2007 jung et al 2017 the position of each pixel in the feature space between the lst and ndvi was used to determine moisture content srivastava 2017 this method can be defined based on a linear regression relation xu et al 2018 1 sm i 0 i n j 0 j n a ij ndvi i l s t j 2 ndvi n d v i ndvi 0 ndvi s ndvi 0 3 lst l s t lst 0 lst s lst 0 where sm aij lst and ndvi were soil moisture regression coefficients land surface temperature and vegetation cover obtained from landsat 8 respectively the subscripts i and j were the order of the polynomial relationship for ndvi and lst respectively and the o and s subscripts relate to bare soil and dense vegetation appropriate thresholds on ndvi have been used to determine areas with bare soil and dense vegetation yang et al 2008 also for pixels located on the dry and wet edges they were extracted from the pixels with the highest and lowest values of lst in different ndvi classes the n was the order of polynomial which was 3 in this study the minimum value of rmse is used for the objective function to determine the optimal coefficients ai j based on ordinary least squares ols regression the optimal coefficients ai j were determined so that the value of rmse was minimized between the amount of the modeled and measured sm details of the tr model for sm modeling can be found in rahmati et al 2015 xu et al 2018 to optimally determine the unknown coefficients in eq 1 and to evaluate the accuracy of the modeled sm 70 of the measured sm data were used to train the model and determine the unknown coefficients the remaining 30 of the data were utilized for the sm modeling verifications the modeled and measured sm data were analyzed using correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse an uncertainty analysis was carried out to ensure that the predicted sm had a known accuracy since the modeled sm uncertainty can be a function of the accuracy in selecting the training and the test dataset the bootstrap with 100 iteration method was utilized to reduce the uncertainty of the predicted sm arrouays et al 2014 fathololoumi et al 2020 liao et al 2016 a combination of a bootstrap and a spectral base tr method was used to reduce the uncertainty of sm modeling with one iteration in the selection of the training and test data there is a probability of increasing errors in the model results due to the inefficiency of selecting the training and test data sm data were randomly split into training 70 and test 30 data in each iteration finally the mean value of 100 iterations was considered as the modeled sm value the standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv of the 100 iterations indicated the uncertainty of the modeled sm at a pixel scale malone et al 2017 3 3 3 evaluating the influence of surface heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of sm both the regional and scc scales were considered when evaluating the effects of biophysical characteristics topography and land cover on sm firstly the r between sm and surface heterogeneity at the regional scale was investigated secondly the r between sm and surface heterogeneity was studied at the scc also the mean and standard deviation sd of sm at different classes of surface characteristics were determined 3 3 4 surface heterogeneity lst brightness greenness wetness and land cover factors such as surface biophysical characteristics and elevation slope aspect the compass direction that a slope faces twi and slia in satellite overpass time as topographic characteristic were used to model sm spatial distribution using regional and scc strategies the factors of geographic location time position angle of inclination and surface topographic conditions were employed in the slia calculation details of the slia and twi calculations can be found in firozjaei et al 2019 and mattivi et al 2019 the single channel sc algorithm was applied for calculating the lst jiménez muñoz and sobrino 2003 yu et al 2014 4 l s t γ 1 l s e ψ 1 l s e n ψ 2 ψ 3 δ where lsen was the amount of thermal band energy recorded by the sensor lse was the coefficient of emission for the applied thermal wavelength in addition γ and δ were defined based on the planck s function jiménez muñoz et al 2014 yu et al 2014 5 γ t sen 2 b λ l sen 6 î γ l sen t sen where tsen was the luminance temperature recorded by the sensor lsen was the value of thermal band energy numbered 10 bλ was a constant coefficient assumed to be 1324 k for the band 10 of the landsat 8 furthermore ψ1 ψ2 and ψ3 in eq 7 were atmospheric functions respectively presented as jiménez muñoz et al 2014 yu et al 2014 7 ψ 1 0 04019 w 2 0 02916 w 1 01523 ψ 2 0 38333 w 2 1 50294 w 0 20324 ψ 3 0 00918 w 2 1 36072 w 0 27514 where w was the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis water vapor product mod07 the spatial resolution of mod07 is 5000 m with daily temporal resolution the mod07 is the total ozone burden with atmospheric stability and it also provides the temperature and moisture profiles the water vapor amount in the atmosphere was employed as one of the input parameters for lst estimation from satellite images weng et al 2019 in this study the ndvi threshold based method was used to calculate the lse jiménez muñoz and sobrino 2003 yu et al 2014 the mod11a1 daily product and lst ground data recorded by the calibrated automatic thermal sensors were used to evaluate the obtained lst from landsat 8 imagery for the study area tasseled cap transformation tct was used to extract useful and valuable information of surface heterogeneity from satellite images using linear combinations based on the reflective bands of images as well as a specific coefficient matrix liu et al 2015 mishra et al 2015 brightness greenness and wetness were the main components extracted from the tct indices brightness represented the percentage of impermeable surfaces including barren and constructed soils greenness indicated vegetation information and wetness indicated water properties sm plant and complications associated with built up land characteristics the coefficients matrix for the various sensors were different and were calculated by statistical and empirical analyses separately for different sensors in this study tct coefficients were used to extract brightness greenness and wetness characteristics from the landsat 8 images table 1 baig et al 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 soil moisture modeling the modeled sm showed good agreement with the ground measured sm the mean r and rmse values were 0 87 2 06 for the training dataset and 0 85 2 24 for the test dataset respectively fig 4 the value of r for the training data was greater than its value for the test dataset while the value of rmse for the training dataset was less than its value for the test dataset similar results were also reported in the literature carlson 2007 kasim and usman 2015 rahmati et al 2015 the mean r and rmse values between measured and modeled sm based on bootstrap results were increased by 0 09 0 07 and decreased by 15 12 over one iteration with the tr method for the training test dataset the mean values of mean and sd of sampling points for the measured sm were 8 80 and 4 47 while they were 8 96 and 4 66 for modeled sm high values of sd indicated the diversity of the measured and modeled sm table 2 the sm values ranges in the study area were 0 07 72 51 0 35 95 0 25 88 and 0 45 70 for june july august and september respectively within the study area the north and southwest parts exhibited the highest moisture content 72 51 fig 5 a these parts of the area are more elevated than other parts and are covered by snow even in summer the dominant land use in these areas is rangeland with steep slopes fathololoumi et al 2020 the air temperature in this part of the study area is generally colder than the other sites with higher rainfall the existence of snow cover lower evaporation from the soil surface and consequently higher sm the mean values of the mean and sd of sm in the study area were 8 96 and 4 66 respectively indicating the spatial heterogeneity of sm at the study area on four study dates sm heterogeneity can also be attributed to the heterogeneity of precipitation and temperature in the area which is due to the topographic variations in the study area hajdu et al 2018 leng et al 2016 xu 2019 the mean values of cv were 8 19 5 03 6 05 and 5 23 for june july august and september respectively the maximum cv was mostly seen in the north of the study area hence the maximum uncertainty was observed in these areas fig 5 sd cv where the steepest slopes are located and the dominant land cover is lands without cover and rangelands the sm content in these areas was higher than other parts which are associated with higher elevation and more precipitation as snow in the area for this reason the deviation of modeled sm values in these areas is greater than other areas with changing training data 4 1 1 surface heterogeneity of the area surface biophysical characteristics of the study area were heterogeneous fig 6 according to the lst map the surface temperature of the study area varied between 5 8 c in the northern highlands and 56 3 c in the central regions the brightness map of the area also exhibited variability of surface illumination in the region brightness varied from 0 08 in areas close to the catchment outlet in the east with relatively high vegetation to 2 07 in the northern and southwest parts of the catchment with snow cover and bare soils the value of the greenness index in the study area varied between 0 18 and 0 53 the highest values of greenness were observed in the north and south west part of the area and the lowest values were observed in the north and southeast part the highest value of the wetness index was observed in the highlands and along the river the value varied between 1 67 and 0 79 in the study area fig 6 in areas with higher sm twi is lower and in areas with lower sm twi is higher in this study area fig 5 mean and fig 1h kopecký and čížková 2010 also showed the effect of twi on the spatial distribution of sm in their study the mean and sd values of the surface heterogeneity indicated spatial variability of surface characteristics in the study area table 3 for example the mean sd of lst was 4 90 c indicating variations in climatic and biophysical characteristics according to the sd values of the factors table 3 most variations in the study area were related to elevation aspect slope slia and lst in fact changes in the topographic characteristics in the area were more influential than biophysical characteristics 4 2 influence of surface heterogeneity on sm surface heterogeneity section 3 3 4 can lead to the spatial variability of sm in the catchment moyano et al 2012 niu et al 2015 qiu et al 2001 seneviratne et al 2010 we quantified the variations at two scales regional and scc 4 2 1 regional scale the r between the surface heterogeneity and sm are presented in table 4 the statistical significance of these correlations was confirmed at the 95 confidence level the lst and aspect with a mean r value of 0 69 and 0 08 had the highest and lowest effects on the spatial distribution of sm at the regional scale lst by affecting the rate of evaporation from the soil surface might have decreased sm dai et al 2004 and zhang et al 2019 showed that sm was lower in the areas with high lst the higher lst and lower sm values were also observed in the central parts while this trend was reversed in the north and southwest parts of the catchment figs 5 and 6 zhao et al 2019 indicating a direct relationship between vegetation and sm such a relationship was higher in areas with dense vegetation cover figs 5 and 6 the relationship between sm and greenness was also direct this indicated the amount of vegetation on the land surface a high value indicated higher vegetation cover and greater moisture absorption by the root system vegetation can increase surface moisture by affecting the evapotranspiration rate by acting as a barrier between land surface and sunlight holtgrave et al 2018 accordingly this property is one of the most important factors affecting the spatial distribution of sm kurc and benton 2010 according to the r values between sm and surface characteristics table 4 elevation was also one of the most significant factors controlling sm variations in all four months and the r values were 0 74 0 71 0 67 and 0 64 for june july august and september respectively the visual survey of sm maps demonstrated this claim the sm content increased with increasing elevation especially in the north of the area fig 5 based on the lapse rate effect the temperature decreases when height increases also precipitation increases at low temperature and evaporation decreases consequently sm increased in high elevations in the north of the study area firozjaei et al 2020 these results are consistent with the results of martínez murillo et al 2017 who indicated that sm was strongly influenced by topographic characteristics in a catchment with different mediterranean climatic conditions land use and parent material were similar in their study catchments wetness was also one of the factors affecting sm due to its relationship with surface water stress sheng et al 2019 wetness index is considered an indicator for increasing decreasing sm singh et al 2005 eswar et al 2016 also stated that the wetness effect was lower than lst but statistically significant twi was one of the effective indices on sm variation in this study the mean r between twi and sm was 0 42shows an inverse relation between sm and twi this result is confirmed in figs 1 and 5 mean the northern part of the study area has the maximum sm while twi is minimal there this index is based on the area and slope of the region and is inversely related to the slope mattivi et al 2019 therefore on steep slopes the value of this index is lower on the other hand in this area steeper slopes are in higher elevations with lower temperatures and higher precipitation and as a result higher sm therefore with increasing elevation the slope increases and with increasing slope twi decreases 4 2 2 scc scale different classes of biophysical and topographic characteristics for a more detailed examination of the sm spatial variation the mean sm values at the scc scale were investigated and are presented in fig 7 the mean sm varied in different classes of surface heterogeneity in the study area fig 7 the relationship between sm and lst was reversed with increasing lst sm decreased the highest mean sm was observed in the lowest brightness class 0 45 0 55 the high brightness value was associated with high levels of albedo low vegetation density high lst and consequently low sm the areas with high brightness represented bare soils with usually low sm xu et al 2018 however high levels of brightness in the study area were related to snow surfaces which have high values of sm for this reason the mean sm content for the different brightness classes showed a downward trend at first and then an upward trend for greenness wetness and elevation indices the highest mean sm content was observed in the 0 45 0 5 0 1 to 0 0 and 4000 classes respectively because they had a direct relationship with sm increase of these indices increased sm the steepest slopes in the north of the study area catchment upstream with the highest elevation had the highest amount of moisture in the region more precipitation and lower temperature at high elevated locations might have contributed to high sm there was no clear trend for aspect classes but in the case of slia the final class 65 to 75 had the highest mean sm content as the slia increased the amount of short wavelength radiation reaching the land surface decreased and the surface temperature decreased firozjaei et al 2019 consequently sm increased the mean sm content decreased by 22 when lst increased from 25 class to 50 class with increasing wetness from 1 00 to 0 00 increasing greenness from 0 05 to 0 50 increasing elevation from 1500 m to 4000 m and slia from 3 to 5 c class mean sm content was increased by 11 14 20 and 9 respectively the highest and lowest mean sm values were seen in the lowest 4 1 5 5 and highest 9 0 10 7 twi classes respectively this result is aligned with previous studies on the relationship between twi and sm table 4 buchanan et al 2014 raduła et al 2018 the greenness and wetness indices indicate vegetation and moisture but cannot determine land cover type panah et al 2017 therefore analysis based on different land cover types is very important the mean sm values for urban lands and lands without cover were lower than other land cover types zucco et al 2014 showed that land use variability caused an increase in sm spatial variability finally the mean r between surface heterogeneity and sm at scc scale for different months was investigated and are presented in fig 8 the statistical significance of these correlations was confirmed at 95 confidence level the relationship between surface heterogeneity and sm showed that with increasing slope the r between elevation slope aspect and sm increased and greenness decreased fig 8f for example the highest correlation of greenness with sm at irrigated agriculture and gardens class of land cover was 0 66 in general the r values between sm and surface heterogeneity in most classes at the scc scale were higher than that at the regional scale table 4 and 5 this indicated higher accuracy at the scc scale to capture sm variability in the study area over the regional scale for example the mean r value between lst elevation and sm increased from 0 69 and 0 62 at the regional scale table 4 to 0 77 and 0 67 at the scc scale respectively table 5 maximum correlation between elevation and sm in different classes of surface heterogeneity were 0 90 1 05 1 15 brightness class 0 58 40 45 lst class 0 68 0 20 0 25 greenness class 0 85 40 slope class 0 62 3500 4000 m elevation class 0 78 65 to 75 slia class 0 82 sw aspect class and 0 70 land without cover class elevation was one of the most important factors on sm at both regional and scc scales additionally for brevity s sake we only indicated r values of sm with elevation as an example these results confirmed the efficiency of the scc scale in increasing the accuracy of moisture modeling as well as investigating its spatial distribution based on mean r values in different classes of surface heterogeneity table 5 lst was the most important factor on sm at the scc scale with mean r 0 77 table 5 as well as at the regional scale with mean r 0 69 table 4 aspect factor had the minimum effect on sm among other factors mean r 0 11 at both the regional and scc scale 5 conclusion soil moisture is a key factor in hydrological modeling and in catchment hydrological management however its spatial distribution is influenced by soil characteristics and the interactions between them environmental factors and biophysical characteristics have different effects on sm compared to previous studies this study provides important insight into the spatial variability of sm in a mountainous area from the perspective of rs observations the results clearly show that the influence of surface heterogeneity on sm was very important but it was complex this study also showed the advantage of using rs data and satellite images in estimating sm at the catchment level and in areas lacking sufficient in situ sm data the spatial resolution of landsat 8 data accurately depicted the biophysical and topographic effects of the surface the results show that the rs based tr method is an acceptable method for modeling and estimating sm the study of the relationship between moisture content and different factors at the regional and scc scales showed that the scc scale was more accurate than the regional scale the r between sm and biophysical characteristics topography and slia increased at the scc scale indicating the feasibility of sm spatial distribution modelling in the region with greater accuracy using the scc scale information also the scc scale can be used instead of regional scale information to identify the effects of different factors using the scc strategy can significantly increase the accuracy of sm modeling in different regions based on the results of this study the accuracy of hydrological forecasts which rely on sm predictions can be greatly enhanced by applying the scc strategy in future studies it is suggested that different approaches including triangular trapezoidal and machine learning for sm modeling be implemented in scc scale additionally with regards to the lack of in situ data available for a portion of the study region for future researches it is better to select the points to be more geographically representative in addition to any other factors that need to be considered to achieve that soil sampling should be more expand with suitable dispersion in inaccessible north and southwest areas of the region it is recommended that future studies examine the impact of surface biophysical characteristics and surface topography on the spatial distribution of sm in other seasons for this watershed if there are cloud free landsat images in the coming years it is also recommended that this study be conducted in other areas in the future to determine if the results can be generalized declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4729,modeling soil moisture sm spatial distribution is important for hydrological forecasting runoff estimation and catchment management and other applications the objective of this study was to quantify the effect of surface heterogeneity including vegetation soil topography etc on sm at the regional and surface characteristics classes scc scales landsat 8 images aster digital elevation model land cover map climatic data and sm measured at 148 locations in the balikhli chay catchment of iran were used greenness brightness wetness and land surface temperature are the surface biophysical characteristics and the topographical characteristics including elevation slope aspect topographic wetness index twi and solar local incident angle calculated using tasseled cap transformation single channel algorithm used in this study the triangular method and the bootstrapping model were used to model sm and mitigate prediction uncertainty correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse between the modeled and measured sm values were used to evaluate the modeled sm the mean r and rmse between the modeled and measured sm for different months were 0 83 and 1 84 volumetric percentage respectively the degree of heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of sm in different classes of surface biophysical and topographical characteristics was different the impact of surface heterogeneity on sm varied across regional and scc scales the mean r values between sm and surface biophysical and topographical characteristics in the regional and scc strategies for different months were 0 41 and 0 54 respectively using the scc scale instead of the regional scale heterogeneity information can increase the accuracy of sm modeling keywords hydrology remote sensing soil moisture surface biophysical characteristics topographical characteristics triangular model 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key factor in hydrological processes it controls the distribution of water as infiltration evapotranspiration and runoff jones 2014 sm is a determining factor in many hydrological models crow and ryu 2009 li et al 2018 accurate sm information can play an important role in improving hydrological modeling such as runoff landslide and flood forecasting in the watershed and better rainfall estimates from the water budget which can be used in both small and large watersheds brocca et al 2013 koster et al 2018 el hajj et al 2018 estimated soil moisture using different remote sensing rs methods they employed soil moisture products of soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture and ocean salinity smos advanced scatterometer ascat and sentinel 1 and evaluated the modeled sm by in situ soil moisture data at 5 cm depths they stated that smap products 36 km and 9 km accuracy in sm retrieval were higher than smap level 2 and sentinel 1 alexakis et al 2017 estimated sm as an input to hydrological model using sentinel 1 and landsat 8 satellite imagery and an artificial neural network method the results showed that the performance of the method and images used were acceptable in estimating sm and played an important supportive role in hydrological studies despite its critical importance challenges remain in acquiring sm information over large areas due to its high variability in space and time this is the result of a variety of different factors working at different intensities such factors as surface heterogeneity land use environmental and climatic conditions contribute to the spatial and temporal variability of sm bai et al 2020 temimi et al 2010 vereecken et al 2008 2007 western et al 2004 changes in surface biophysical characteristics including lst greenness and brightness variably influence evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff contributing to high spatiotemporal variability in sm qiu et al 2001 rao et al 1987 vivoni et al 2010 similarly surface topographic characteristics such as slope aspect the compass direction that a slope faces and elevation are important factors affecting the spatial distribution of sm by influencing soil hydraulic properties mohanty and mousli 2000 qiu et al 2001 the importance of identifying and recognizing the parameters affecting the spatial distribution of sm can be categorized in three aspects 1 understanding and quantifying the impact of various controlling factors that will increase sm modeling accuracy 2 accurate identification of these factors will result in reliable identification modeling and prediction of the spatial and temporal pattern of sm in a region 3 accurate identification and quantification of the sm affecting factors can be useful to improve the spatial resolution of obtained sm from satellite imagery and to produce sm daily maps for each region only a limited number of studies have investigated the influence of a variety of factors on the spatial and temporal distribution of sm qiu et al 2001 noted that surface characteristics such as land cover and topography played an important role in the spatial distribution of sm in their study they found that the relative impact of surface heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of sm was different at various depths following a precipitation event the correlation between sm and aspect significantly increased except for heavy storms and then decreased they also concluded that sm was inversely correlated with relative elevation and hillslope in addition the effect of land cover corresponded with changes in vegetation cover conditions thus the greatest effect of these factors on sm variation occurred in june and august furthermore the maximum effect of aspect on spatial and temporal variations of sm was found in spring and autumn niu et al 2015 stated that land use has a major influence in controlling spatial and temporal variations of sm by affecting evapotranspiration infiltration rate and runoff they investigated the effects of five types of land use on spatial and temporal variation of sm during a two year growing season study in sandy soil in semi arid region the highest mean of sm was observed in the rangelands fields with poplar trees and lands between hills and shrubs respectively zucco et al 2014 examined the impact of land use on sm dynamics and remarked that despite significant discrepancies in land use the temporal pattern of sm at different sites was similar while the spatial diversity of sm in similar land use was high when compared with previous sampling of the same area in some studies the impact of different soil properties was investigated to estimate hydraulic properties and sm their results showed a high impact of these properties on sm moyano et al 2012 silva et al 2014 yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 saxton and rawls 2006 predicted soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity based on estimating several soil properties including texture organic matter and soil structure they showed that statistical correlations between texture and other soil properties soil matric potential and hydraulic conductivity provides sufficient information to be used for numerous analyses and for decision making sm was estimated mostly at the global and regional scale in most of the previous studies carlson 1986 chen et al 2018 cho and choi 2014 kim et al 2018 oldak et al 2003 palsocia et al 2000 segoni et al 2018 wagner et al 2009 however due to the spatial heterogeneity of surface characteristics in mountainous areas sm spatial variations in these areas are large on a local scale this indicate that it is important to study the effect of surface biophysical and topographic characteristics on sm and soil modeling at the local scale in most studies the impact of land use cover and surface topographical characteristics on sm were investigated based on this basic knowledge surface biophysical and environmental factors also influence the spatial and temporal variations of sm but are rarely studied the purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of surface heterogeneity on sm at the regional and surface characteristics classes scc scale this study was the first to investigate and quantify the impact of surface heterogeneity on sm spatial distribution using scc scale information the results were then compared with the regional scale 2 study area the balilkli chay catchment in ardabil province iran has high surface heterogeneity and it was selected for this study for that reason this catchment 47 47ʹ to 48 05ʹ e longitude and 37 50ʹ to 38 15ʹ n latitude with an area of about 567 km2 and an average slope of 17 2 is one of the important catchments in north west iran because of its mountainous landscape and sudden slope changes this study area has special hydrological and geomorphological characteristics which make it vulnerable to erosion and flooding the highest and average elevation of the study area are 4363 and 2109 m respectively above the mean sea level the highest elevation is found in the sabalan mountain in the northern part of the catchment and the lowest elevation of the study area is 1550 m above mean sea level leading to the dam at the outlet of the catchment the climate of the study area is cold semi arid the long term average air temperature is 8 c and the average annual rainfall from 1986 to 2005 was 360 mm this river is one of the most important permanent rivers in ardebil province and it is considered the sole source for drinking water as well as the source for agricultural water according to digital elevation model dem of the study area the high elevation locations are in the northern part with an elevation as high as 4365 m the elevation declines from the north to the center of the study area and reaches 1550 m at the outlet of the catchment in the east fig 1 b the southwest end of the study area is also elevated variations in the elevation has led to variations in slope in the study area the steep slopes as high as 71 7 are scattered in the northern and southern parts of the study area the solar local incident angle slia variation ranged between 5 6 and 64 1 at the regional scale dominant land cover is mostly rainfed agriculture in the central parts of the region with flat land and fertile soil for agriculture the prevailing land cover in the marginal and elevated parts of the study area is rangeland often with no easy access the topographic wetness index twi ranges between 10 61 and 4 12 the highest twi value is related to the relatively flat areas which are in the east and the lowest value is found the northern part of the study area fig 1h 3 data and methods 3 1 data landsat 8 images of the study area wrs path 167 and wrs row 34 with cloud cover less than 10 were used to estimate sm and calculate surface biophysical characteristics on june 15 july 1 august 18 and september 3 2018 the spatial resolution of the reflective and thermal bands of the landsat 8 images was 30 and 100 m respectively advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster digital elevation model dem was used to drive topographical factors including slope aspect elevation twi and slia elkhrachy 2017 the spatial resolution of aster dem was 30 m meteorological and climatic data including relative humidity air temperature and pressure at landsat 8 overpass time were obtained from the ardabil meteorological organization 3 2 soil moisture measurement ground sm data were utilized to model and assess the accuracy of modeled sm at landsat 8 overpass time the geographical locations of the ground sm measurement points were selected to represent spatial variability as well as the surface heterogeneity coverage over the study area sm was measured at 148 points 0 5 cm at 4 landsat 8 overpass times june 15 july 1 august 18 and september 3 2018 fig 1b however due to the topographical conditions in the northern and southwestern parts of the study area and the lack of transportation routes and as a result of the lack of quick access to these areas it was not possible to quickly sample them during the satellite overpass so no sampling point was selected in the mentioned parts to overcome the scale disparities between point measurements of sm and the resolution of imagery used for the explanatory variables we tried to select the sampling points inside the homogeneous pixels this was done so that these pixels were homogeneous in terms of coverage land use elevation and slope on the other hand in addition to all the above we sampled three points from each pixel with different geographical locations and considered the average of these three points as the moisture of that pixel to better represent the sm content of a pixel sm in these areas was measured once every 16 days and in the fastest possible time the geographical location of each sampling point was determined by the global positioning system gps with an error of less than 6 m several field operation teams performed the sampling and measure sm in the shortest possible time matching with the satellite overpass time the measuring points were divided among the sampling teams and each team was assigned to take samples from specific locations at a designated time in this study we also had two sm meter devices which were calibrated using different soil textures with different amounts of moisture before starting fig 2 the area was divided into 20 sections and each team was responsible for measuring in one of the twenty sections this was done to ensure that all sampling points were close to each other however two of the twenty teams were equipped with the sm meter device model δt sm150 made by england to speed the measurement process while the remaining eighteen teams collected soil samples for sm measurement by gravimetric method petropoulos et al 2013 which is accepted as an accurate method but requires more manpower and costs a lot while sm meter devices are portable and measured sm quickly with an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m 3 the samples were collected and placed in zipper storage bags taken to the one location where one person was responsible for collecting the samples and transferred them to the laboratory generally in this research sm refers to the sm content measured on a volumetric basis 3 3 method the following steps fig 3 were carried out to quantify the regional and scc effects of surface heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of sm after preprocessing the landsat 8 images surface heterogeneity including land surface temperature lst and normalized vegetation difference index ndvi were extracted from the landsat 8 thermal and reflective bands surface topography characteristics were also obtained from aster dem in the second step sm was estimated using a triangular method tr and landsat derived indices dem and in situ sm data the bootstrap method was applied to reduce the uncertainty of the sm prediction subsequent to this spatial distribution of sm and the impact of surface heterogeneity were investigated regionally finally the influence of surface heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of sm was quantified at the scc scale in different classes of surface heterogeneity 3 3 1 pre processing of satellite images radiometric atmospheric and geometric corrections were performed to preprocess landsat 8 images for radiometric correction atmospheric effects sensor geometry and topography were considered for the reflective and thermal bands flaash fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of hypercubes algorithm was utilized for the atmospheric correction of landsat 8 reflective bands using the moderate resolution atmospheric transmission modtran 6 radiation transfer database model pyo et al 2018 in addition due to different data sources geometric harmonization was performed to match the data geometrically using image to image harmonization 3 3 2 soil moisture modeling sm modeling was performed using a tr method carlson 2007 kasim and usman 2015 this method was based on the robust relationship between rs derived lst and ndvi and sm carlson 2007 jung et al 2017 the position of each pixel in the feature space between the lst and ndvi was used to determine moisture content srivastava 2017 this method can be defined based on a linear regression relation xu et al 2018 1 sm i 0 i n j 0 j n a ij ndvi i l s t j 2 ndvi n d v i ndvi 0 ndvi s ndvi 0 3 lst l s t lst 0 lst s lst 0 where sm aij lst and ndvi were soil moisture regression coefficients land surface temperature and vegetation cover obtained from landsat 8 respectively the subscripts i and j were the order of the polynomial relationship for ndvi and lst respectively and the o and s subscripts relate to bare soil and dense vegetation appropriate thresholds on ndvi have been used to determine areas with bare soil and dense vegetation yang et al 2008 also for pixels located on the dry and wet edges they were extracted from the pixels with the highest and lowest values of lst in different ndvi classes the n was the order of polynomial which was 3 in this study the minimum value of rmse is used for the objective function to determine the optimal coefficients ai j based on ordinary least squares ols regression the optimal coefficients ai j were determined so that the value of rmse was minimized between the amount of the modeled and measured sm details of the tr model for sm modeling can be found in rahmati et al 2015 xu et al 2018 to optimally determine the unknown coefficients in eq 1 and to evaluate the accuracy of the modeled sm 70 of the measured sm data were used to train the model and determine the unknown coefficients the remaining 30 of the data were utilized for the sm modeling verifications the modeled and measured sm data were analyzed using correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse an uncertainty analysis was carried out to ensure that the predicted sm had a known accuracy since the modeled sm uncertainty can be a function of the accuracy in selecting the training and the test dataset the bootstrap with 100 iteration method was utilized to reduce the uncertainty of the predicted sm arrouays et al 2014 fathololoumi et al 2020 liao et al 2016 a combination of a bootstrap and a spectral base tr method was used to reduce the uncertainty of sm modeling with one iteration in the selection of the training and test data there is a probability of increasing errors in the model results due to the inefficiency of selecting the training and test data sm data were randomly split into training 70 and test 30 data in each iteration finally the mean value of 100 iterations was considered as the modeled sm value the standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv of the 100 iterations indicated the uncertainty of the modeled sm at a pixel scale malone et al 2017 3 3 3 evaluating the influence of surface heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of sm both the regional and scc scales were considered when evaluating the effects of biophysical characteristics topography and land cover on sm firstly the r between sm and surface heterogeneity at the regional scale was investigated secondly the r between sm and surface heterogeneity was studied at the scc also the mean and standard deviation sd of sm at different classes of surface characteristics were determined 3 3 4 surface heterogeneity lst brightness greenness wetness and land cover factors such as surface biophysical characteristics and elevation slope aspect the compass direction that a slope faces twi and slia in satellite overpass time as topographic characteristic were used to model sm spatial distribution using regional and scc strategies the factors of geographic location time position angle of inclination and surface topographic conditions were employed in the slia calculation details of the slia and twi calculations can be found in firozjaei et al 2019 and mattivi et al 2019 the single channel sc algorithm was applied for calculating the lst jiménez muñoz and sobrino 2003 yu et al 2014 4 l s t γ 1 l s e ψ 1 l s e n ψ 2 ψ 3 δ where lsen was the amount of thermal band energy recorded by the sensor lse was the coefficient of emission for the applied thermal wavelength in addition γ and δ were defined based on the planck s function jiménez muñoz et al 2014 yu et al 2014 5 γ t sen 2 b λ l sen 6 î γ l sen t sen where tsen was the luminance temperature recorded by the sensor lsen was the value of thermal band energy numbered 10 bλ was a constant coefficient assumed to be 1324 k for the band 10 of the landsat 8 furthermore ψ1 ψ2 and ψ3 in eq 7 were atmospheric functions respectively presented as jiménez muñoz et al 2014 yu et al 2014 7 ψ 1 0 04019 w 2 0 02916 w 1 01523 ψ 2 0

product mod07 the spatial resolution of mod07 is 5000 m with daily temporal resolution the mod07 is the total ozone burden with atmospheric stability and it also provides the temperature and moisture profiles the water vapor amount in the atmosphere was employed as one of the input parameters for lst estimation from satellite images weng et al 2019 in this study the ndvi threshold based method was used to calculate the lse jiménez muñoz and sobrino 2003 yu et al 2014 the mod11a1 daily product and lst ground data recorded by the calibrated automatic thermal sensors were used to evaluate the obtained lst from landsat 8 imagery for the study area tasseled cap transformation tct was used to extract useful and valuable information of surface heterogeneity from satellite images using linear combinations based on the reflective bands of images as well as a specific coefficient matrix liu et al 2015 mishra et al 2015 brightness greenness and wetness were the main components extracted from the tct indices brightness represented the percentage of impermeable surfaces including barren and constructed soils greenness indicated vegetation information and wetness indicated water properties sm plant and complications associated with built up land characteristics the coefficients matrix for the various sensors were different and were calculated by statistical and empirical analyses separately for different sensors in this study tct coefficients were used to extract brightness greenness and wetness characteristics from the landsat 8 images table 1 baig et al 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 soil moisture modeling the modeled sm showed good agreement with the ground measured sm the mean r and rmse values were 0 87 2 06 for the training dataset and 0 85 2 24 for the test dataset respectively fig 4 the value of r for the training data was greater than its value for the test dataset while the value of rmse for the training dataset was less than its value for the test dataset similar results were also reported in the literature carlson 2007 kasim and usman 2015 rahmati et al 2015 the mean r and rmse values between measured and modeled sm based on bootstrap results were increased by 0 09 0 07 and decreased by 15 12 over one iteration with the tr method for the training test dataset the mean values of mean and sd of sampling points for the measured sm were 8 80 and 4 47 while they were 8 96 and 4 66 for modeled sm high values of sd indicated the diversity of the measured and modeled sm table 2 the sm values ranges in the study area were 0 07 72 51 0 35 95 0 25 88 and 0 45 70 for june july august and september respectively within the study area the north and southwest parts exhibited the highest moisture content 72 51 fig 5 a these parts of the area are more elevated than other parts and are covered by snow even in summer the dominant land use in these areas is rangeland with steep slopes fathololoumi et al 2020 the air temperature in this part of the study area is generally colder than the other sites with higher rainfall the existence of snow cover lower evaporation from the soil surface and consequently higher sm the mean values of the mean and sd of sm in the study area were 8 96 and 4 66 respectively indicating the spatial heterogeneity of sm at the study area on four study dates sm heterogeneity can also be attributed to the heterogeneity of precipitation and temperature in the area which is due to the topographic variations in the study area hajdu et al 2018 leng et al 2016 xu 2019 the mean values of cv were 8 19 5 03 6 05 and 5 23 for june july august and september respectively the maximum cv was mostly seen in the north of the study area hence the maximum uncertainty was observed in these areas fig 5 sd cv where the steepest slopes are located and the dominant land cover is lands without cover and rangelands the sm content in these areas was higher than other parts which are associated with higher elevation and more precipitation as snow in the area for this reason the deviation of modeled sm values in these areas is greater than other areas with changing training data 4 1 1 surface heterogeneity of the area surface biophysical characteristics of the study area were heterogeneous fig 6 according to the lst map the surface temperature of the study area varied between 5 8 c in the northern highlands and 56 3 c in the central regions the brightness map of the area also exhibited variability of surface illumination in the region brightness varied from 0 08 in areas close to the catchment outlet in the east with relatively high vegetation to 2 07 in the northern and southwest parts of the catchment with snow cover and bare soils the value of the greenness index in the study area varied between 0 18 and 0 53 the highest values of greenness were observed in the north and south west part of the area and the lowest values were observed in the north and southeast part the highest value of the wetness index was observed in the highlands and along the river the value varied between 1 67 and 0 79 in the study area fig 6 in areas with higher sm twi is lower and in areas with lower sm twi is higher in this study area fig 5 mean and fig 1h kopecký and čížková 2010 also showed the effect of twi on the spatial distribution of sm in their study the mean and sd values of the surface heterogeneity indicated spatial variability of surface characteristics in the study area table 3 for example the mean sd of lst was 4 90 c indicating variations in climatic and biophysical characteristics according to the sd values of the factors table 3 most variations in the study area were related to elevation aspect slope slia and lst in fact changes in the topographic characteristics in the area were more influential than biophysical characteristics 4 2 influence of surface heterogeneity on sm surface heterogeneity section 3 3 4 can lead to the spatial variability of sm in the catchment moyano et al 2012 niu et al 2015 qiu et al 2001 seneviratne et al 2010 we quantified the variations at two scales regional and scc 4 2 1 regional scale the r between the surface heterogeneity and sm are presented in table 4 the statistical significance of these correlations was confirmed at the 95 confidence level the lst and aspect with a mean r value of 0 69 and 0 08 had the highest and lowest effects on the spatial distribution of sm at the regional scale lst by affecting the rate of evaporation from the soil surface might have decreased sm dai et al 2004 and zhang et al 2019 showed that sm was lower in the areas with high lst the higher lst and lower sm values were also observed in the central parts while this trend was reversed in the north and southwest parts of the catchment figs 5 and 6 zhao et al 2019 indicating a direct relationship between vegetation and sm such a relationship was higher in areas with dense vegetation cover figs 5 and 6 the relationship between sm and greenness was also direct this indicated the amount of vegetation on the land surface a high value indicated higher vegetation cover and greater moisture absorption by the root system vegetation can increase surface moisture by affecting the evapotranspiration rate by acting as a barrier between land surface and sunlight holtgrave et al 2018 accordingly this property is one of the most important factors affecting the spatial distribution of sm kurc and benton 2010 according to the r values between sm and surface characteristics table 4 elevation was also one of the most significant factors controlling sm variations in all four months and the r values were 0 74 0 71 0 67 and 0 64 for june july august and september respectively the visual survey of sm maps demonstrated this claim the sm content increased with increasing elevation especially in the north of the area fig 5 based on the lapse rate effect the temperature decreases when height increases also precipitation increases at low temperature and evaporation decreases consequently sm increased in high elevations in the north of the study area firozjaei et al 2020 these results are consistent with the results of martínez murillo et al 2017 who indicated that sm was strongly influenced by topographic characteristics in a catchment with different mediterranean climatic conditions land use and parent material were similar in their study catchments wetness was also one of the factors affecting sm due to its relationship with surface water stress sheng et al 2019 wetness index is considered an indicator for increasing decreasing sm singh et al 2005 eswar et al 2016 also stated that the wetness effect was lower than lst but statistically significant twi was one of the effective indices on sm variation in this study the mean r between twi and sm was 0 42shows an inverse relation between sm and twi this result is confirmed in figs 1 and 5 mean the northern part of the study area has the maximum sm while twi is minimal there this index is based on the area and slope of the region and is inversely related to the slope mattivi et al 2019 therefore on steep slopes the value of this index is lower on the other hand in this area steeper slopes are in higher elevations with lower temperatures and higher precipitation and as a result higher sm therefore with increasing elevation the slope increases and with increasing slope twi decreases 4 2 2 scc scale different classes of biophysical and topographic characteristics for a more detailed examination of the sm spatial variation the mean sm values at the scc scale were investigated and are presented in fig 7 the mean sm varied in different classes of surface heterogeneity in the study area fig 7 the relationship between sm and lst was reversed with increasing lst sm decreased the highest mean sm was observed in the lowest brightness class 0 45 0 55 the high brightness value was associated with high levels of albedo low vegetation density high lst and consequently low sm the areas with high brightness represented bare soils with usually low sm xu et al 2018 however high levels of brightness in the study area were related to snow surfaces which have high values of sm for this reason the mean sm content for the different brightness classes showed a downward trend at first and then an upward trend for greenness wetness and elevation indices the highest mean sm content was observed in the 0 45 0 5 0 1 to 0 0 and 4000 classes respectively because they had a direct relationship with sm increase of these indices increased sm the steepest slopes in the north of the study area catchment upstream with the highest elevation had the highest amount of moisture in the region more precipitation and lower temperature at high elevated locations might have contributed to high sm there was no clear trend for aspect classes but in the case of slia the final class 65 to 75 had the highest mean sm content as the slia increased the amount of short wavelength radiation reaching the land surface decreased and the surface temperature decreased firozjaei et al 2019 consequently sm increased the mean sm content decreased by 22 when lst increased from 25 class to 50 class with increasing wetness from 1 00 to 0 00 increasing greenness from 0 05 to 0 50 increasing elevation from 1500 m to 4000 m and slia from 3 to 5 c class mean sm content was increased by 11 14 20 and 9 respectively the highest and lowest mean sm values were seen in the lowest 4 1 5 5 and highest 9 0 10 7 twi classes respectively this result is aligned with previous studies on the relationship between twi and sm table 4 buchanan et al 2014 raduła et al 2018 the greenness and wetness indices indicate vegetation and moisture but cannot determine land cover type panah et al 2017 therefore analysis based on different land cover types is very important the mean sm values for urban lands and lands without cover were lower than other land cover types zucco et al 2014 showed that land use variability caused an increase in sm spatial variability finally the mean r between surface heterogeneity and sm at scc scale for different months was investigated and are presented in fig 8 the statistical significance of these correlations was confirmed at 95 confidence level the relationship between surface heterogeneity and sm showed that with increasing slope the r between elevation slope aspect and sm increased and greenness decreased fig 8f for example the highest correlation of greenness with sm at irrigated agriculture and gardens class of land cover was 0 66 in general the r values between sm and surface heterogeneity in most classes at the scc scale were higher than that at the regional scale table 4 and 5 this indicated higher accuracy at the scc scale to capture sm variability in the study area over the regional scale for example the mean r value between lst elevation and sm increased from 0 69 and 0 62 at the regional scale table 4 to 0 77 and 0 67 at the scc scale respectively table 5 maximum correlation between elevation and sm in different classes of surface heterogeneity were 0 90 1 05 1 15 brightness class 0 58 40 45 lst class 0 68 0 20 0 25 greenness class 0 85 40 slope class 0 62 3500 4000 m elevation class 0 78 65 to 75 slia class 0 82 sw aspect class and 0 70 land without cover class elevation was one of the most important factors on sm at both regional and scc scales additionally for brevity s sake we only indicated r values of sm with elevation as an example these results confirmed the efficiency of the scc scale in increasing the accuracy of moisture modeling as well as investigating its spatial distribution based on mean r values in different classes of surface heterogeneity table 5 lst was the most important factor on sm at the scc scale with mean r 0 77 table 5 as well as at the regional scale with mean r 0 69 table 4 aspect factor had the minimum effect on sm among other factors mean r 0 11 at both the regional and scc scale 5 conclusion soil moisture is a key factor in hydrological modeling and in catchment hydrological management however its spatial distribution is influenced by soil characteristics and the interactions between them environmental factors and biophysical characteristics have different effects on sm compared to previous studies this study provides important insight into the spatial variability of sm in a mountainous area from the perspective of rs observations the results clearly show that the influence of surface heterogeneity on sm was very important but it was complex this study also showed the advantage of using rs data and satellite images in estimating sm at the catchment level and in areas lacking sufficient in situ sm data the spatial resolution of landsat 8 data accurately depicted the biophysical and topographic effects of the surface the results show that the rs based tr method is an acceptable method for modeling and estimating sm the study of the relationship between moisture content and different factors at the regional and scc scales showed that the scc scale was more accurate than the regional scale the r between sm and biophysical characteristics topography and slia increased at the scc scale indicating the feasibility of sm spatial distribution modelling in the region with greater accuracy using the scc scale information also the scc scale can be used instead of regional scale information to identify the effects of different factors using the scc strategy can significantly increase the accuracy of sm modeling in different regions based on the results of this study the accuracy of hydrological forecasts which rely on sm predictions can be greatly enhanced by applying the scc strategy in future studies it is suggested that different approaches including triangular trapezoidal and machine learning for sm modeling be implemented in scc scale additionally with regards to the lack of in situ data available for a portion of the study region for future researches it is better to select the points to be more geographically representative in addition to any other factors that need to be considered to achieve that soil sampling should be more expand with suitable dispersion in inaccessible north and southwest areas of the region it is recommended that future studies examine the impact of surface biophysical characteristics and surface topography on the spatial distribution of sm in other seasons for this watershed if there are cloud free landsat images in the coming years it is also recommended that this study be conducted in other areas in the future to determine if the results can be generalized declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
